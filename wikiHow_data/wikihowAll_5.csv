Learn about your breasts first.,
Eat a diet with the right nutrients.,
Try eating foods that contain phytoestrogens.,
Watch your weight.",How to Make Boobs Bigger Naturally1," Breasts are made up of specialized milk-producing tissue separated into lobes, as well as fatty tissue that surrounds them. Blood vessels provide circulation to the breast. Connective tissue, made from a protein called collagen, helps hold them up. , This may not result in dramatic change, as vitamins are linked to overall breast health and not growth specifically. However, consuming the right vitamins may help maintain and support your breasts at their current size.Vitamin C helps collagen restore itself. Collagen helps hold your boobs up and give them shape, so restoring and strengthening it can help give your boobs more lift.
Vitamin B6 helps your body make more red blood cells. Increasing the number of red blood cells will improve circulation to your whole body, including your breasts.
Vitamin E is an important part of cholesterol control, and can help regulate the fat deposits everywhere in your body, including in your boobs.

, Studies show that women with low levels of estrogen (the female hormone) in proportion to testosterone (the male hormone) tend to have smaller boobs. While scientists are divided on whether foods containing phytoestrogens, or dietary estrogens, have much effect, many women claim to have experienced breast growth by supplementing their diet with these foods. Some foods containing phytoestrogens include:


Nuts and seeds with oils, like fennel, walnuts, cashews and sesame seeds
Soy products like tofu, soy milk and soy nuts
Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats and barley
Legumes, also known as beans
Certain vegetables like beets, collards, carrots and cucumbers
Certain fruits like plums, raspberries, apples and pomegranates
Some beverages like coffee, red or white wine, and black or green tea

, Gaining or losing a few pounds can make a big difference, depending your body type. Gaining weight will cause your body to store more fat in your breasts, while losing some may narrow your waist, making your boobs appear larger.


Gain weight if you have a thin build. Since boobs are made up of a great deal of fatty tissue, increasing your fat stores by eating more can help enhance the size of your breasts. However, note that if you gain weight, you'll gain it all over your body.
Lose some weight if you have a stockier build. Losing a few pounds will most likely make your breasts smaller, but a slimmer waist will accentuate your breasts and make them appear larger in contrast.

Do exercises to target your pectoral muscles.,
Do simple workouts three times a week at home with just your body weight.,
Consider hiring a personal trainer.,
Practice good posture.",How to Make Boobs Bigger Naturally2," Since your pectoral muscles are directly beneath your boobs, any increase in their size will make your breasts appear larger.,


Push-ups are a classic chest exercise, and target your pectorals while strengthening the rest of your body.
Do planks. Lay on your stomach, then prop yourself up on your forearms. Hold this pose for as long as you can, aiming for longer times each time you exercise. This exercise will improve your chest strength while working your whole body.
Do dips using two chairs. Place them on carpet so they don't slide, facing each other. Then kneel between them with your palms on the seats, holding your weight with just your arms. Tuck in your legs and lower yourself, then raise back up to the starting position. Repeat, adding more repetitions as you get stronger.

, Flexible plans will allow you to learn a moves over a couple of sessions and then continue to practice them on your own.

, The better your posture, the more your chest will be pushed up and out. Work to strengthen your back muscles so that good posture is comfortable, and then consciously correct yourself when you feel yourself begin to slouch.

Wear the right size bra!,
Invest in good quality bras.,
Wear a push-up bra.,
Wear form fitting clothing.,
Try bra-cup inserts or “stuff” your bra.,
Use bronzer, or a makeup a shade darker than your skin tone to contour your breasts if your bra and clothes aren’t doing enough.Using a large brush, apply the makeup to the inner edges of your breasts, creating a contour and the illusion of shadow.",How to Make Boobs Bigger Naturally3," Wearing bras that are too small or large can make your boobs appear smaller. Go shopping and ask for a bra size fitting at a lingerie store to learn your real size. , Not only will they last longer, but better quality bras will fit better and help to enhance your boobs more.

, These bras will push your breasts up and out, making them appear to be larger. Try on different varieties to test their effect, as well as comfort. , Tighter clothes will enhance the shape of your chest, while looser or flowing tops or dresses will make your chest seem shapeless.Be careful not wear clothes that are too tight though! Extra tight shirts may squash your boobs, leaving you worse off.

, Invest in silicon “chicken cutlets” that can help pad your bust, or if you’re on a budget, use foam or other padding from around the house.,
Blend to make it appear more natural.
Step back three feet and look in the mirror to make sure that your boobs look real, and not as if you’ve painted them on!
Brush translucent powder over the contouring to help set the makeup and reduce shine.

Use a minimizing or sports bra.,
Try a shaper or chest binder.,
Try chest binding.,
Be careful deciding what kind of binder to use.,
Wear a bra and clothes that fit.,
Avoid clothes that add bulk in the chest.,
Wear dark tops and brightly colored pants or skirts.,
Accentuate your hips.",How to Make Your Breasts Smaller1," Minimizing bras are specialty bras which specifically add no bulk. They help a little and may be enough for your purposes, especially if you're just wanting to fit into particular clothes. Sports bras, however, not only provide support but also flatten your chest. These originally served the purpose of stopping breasts from moving during exercise, causing pain. If large, painful movements are a concern (for both physical and superficial reasons), sports bras may be the solution for you.;
, You probably have heard of Spanx or other shapers. These are items you wear under your clothes that suck everything in. You can buy ones which cover all sorts of different areas of your body but for you, one which covers the chest will be the most helpful. You might find these sold online under the word shaper or chest binder, but they will usually both be roughly the same thing.

, If you're desperate and none of the other options have worked for you, you can use chest binding as a temporary solution and last ditch effort. It only is really helpful for those with breasts in the US C-DD cup range, but you can use it outside of the range as well. Keep in mind that this may not be comfortable but it will get the job done if you just want to have some nice pictures taken or fit into a special dress.

, You can buy good, safe binders from many different sources online. Make sure any binder you wear is safe and will not cause any physical problems. Only bind with a specialized binder, do not use Ace bandages or any similar product. Ace bandages are meant to compress, and can cause breathing problems, bruises, rib fractures, or otherwise damage breasts if when worn for frequent and extended periods of time.

, Wearing baggy clothes will only make you look larger all over and increase the problem. Wear clothes that aren’t tight, but fitted, and cover the breasts entirely to look good without attracting excessive attention. You'll want to do the same with your bra. Just wearing a bra that fits makes a huge difference in how your breasts feel.

, Avoid cowl-neck sweaters and shirts, turtle neck shirts and sweaters, tops with puckers or gathers around the chest, ruffle-front shirts, and any other items which add volume to your chest. These will only make your chest look bigger. Instead, wear tops which are very minimal around the breasts.

, This naturally attracts the line of vision downward, leading eyes away from your breasts. For example, wear a black fitted tee shirt and a teal jersey skirt. Or wear a navy blue blouse and bright white pants.

, If you want to naturally make your body look more balanced and draw attention away from your breasts, draw attention to your hips instead. Use pants with horizontal lines and full circle shirts to create the illusion of more volume in your hips, while also wearing tops that are plain and do not add bulk. This will make your breasts look smaller.

Learn about how to breastfeed from a healthcare professional.,
Maintain a breastfeeding schedule.,
Allow your baby to nurse for as long as necessary to empty your breasts of milk.,
Begin each nursing session with the opposite breast.,
Make sure your baby is latching on correctly to your breast.,
Switch positions for each feeding session.,
Avoid giving bottles to your baby in-between feedings.,
Get at least eight hours of sleep.,
Avoid wearing tight-fitting tops or bras throughout the day.,
Take care of cracked nipples.,
Note if you develop flu-like symptoms or feel ill and run down.,
Check your breasts for inflammation, redness, or swelling.,
See a doctor if your symptoms do not improve.,
Keep breastfeeding.",How to Prevent Mastitis," Mastitis can develop at any point during the nursing process, but many women who experience it in the first four weeks of nursing, when their breasts are still very engorged. It occurs more often in first-time mothers who are new to breastfeeding. Speak to your physician or midwife about how to breastfeed properly so you can prevent mastitis.At the beginning of your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife will likely provide you with handouts and information booklets preparing you for pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, and the first few weeks with your new baby. If she doesn’t offer these materials to you, ask for them.
After the baby is born, don't hesitate to talk to a medical professional if you need help learning to breastfeed. It’s important that you start your time as a mother by learning how to breastfeed properly to ensure your baby gets the nutrients she needs and to prevent mastitis.;
, Having consistent feeding times will prevent your breasts from becoming too full of milk. A full breast can lead to engorgement, which can lead to an episode of mastitis. You should breastfeed every one to three hours, or whenever your baby is hungry.If you know you're going to have to miss a feeding, pump your milk to empty your breasts at the scheduled time for the feeding. If your breasts feel full before the regularly scheduled feeding time, it's important to empty them. If milk sits in your breasts, it will thicken, impeding flow and possibly lead to mastitis.You don’t have to wait for your baby to tell you it is feeding time. Your baby will more likely than not nurse a little when offered the breast. Don’t be afraid to wake your baby if you have to. It is better to interrupt baby’s sleep and drain the breast than to put yourself at risk of developing mastitis.

, All babies have different nursing needs and all mothers have different milk supplies. Some babies will drain a breast entirely in 10 minutes while others can suckle for up to 30 minutes on each breast. Get to know your baby’s nursing needs and allow him the time he needs to empty your breasts completely.Do not put a time limit on how long you allow your baby to nurse. It's important to spend the amount of time it takes to completely drain your breasts of milk during each feeding. Most babies will release the breast when they are finished feeding, so do not remove your breast before your baby finishes., If you offered the left breast first during the previous feeding, offer the right breast first for the next feeding. Rotating between the two breasts reduces your chances of getting mastitis.Sometimes it can be confusing to remember which breast you left off with. Some mothers find it helpful to wear a “nursing bracelet” on the wrist of the breast they offered first. You can buy nursing bracelets at maternity stores, or use a bracelet you already own as your “nursing bracelet.”

, Improper latching can affect the nipple and interfere with the proper flow of milk.Check through your resources for information on proper latching techniques. If your baby is having difficulty latching on, consult your doctor or a lactation consultant.


In order to latch correctly, your baby should be positioned upright, with her chest to your chest. You can raise your breast with your hand while you feed to help encourage the milk to flow to your baby. You can also massage your breast gently before allowing baby to latch on to help the milk flow downward.
If your areolas are flat, massage your nipples to help them stand out so your baby can latch onto them correctly., Experiment with different feeding positions and incorporate pillows into the feeding session for comfort and ease of nursing. This also helps to ensure your breasts are fully drained at the end of each feeding.


Choose positions that allow the milk to flow downward to your baby. For example, you can try feeding while lying on your left side to help prevent blockage on the right side of either breast. You can also try feeding on all fours by kneeling over your baby.

, You want to empty the breasts as much as possible to prevent mastitis, so do not give your baby bottles between feedings as this will lessen his appetite at feeding time.As well, offering a bottle may cause nipple confusion as your baby tries to transition back and forth between the two types of nipples. If you give your baby a bottle between feedings, he may come to prefer sucking from a bottle, because the milk flows much faster. He may also reject your breast or have difficulty sucking from your breast.

, As a new mother, you will likely be overwhelmed with the care required for your new baby. In addition to taking care of your baby’s needs, it’s important that you also meet your own needs and get lots of rest. If you are feeling overly tired, ask your partner to watch the baby and take a quick 10-minute break so you can take a rest and relax. Stress and lack of sleep can contribute to a low immunity to infections and lead to the development of mastitis.When sleeping at night, try to sleep on your back to avoid putting pressure on your breasts and do not wear a bra to bed. This can place pressure on sensitive milk ducts, which can cause them to become inflamed. If inflammation occurs, the milk ducts can become clogged, which can then lead to mastitis.
If you like to sleep on your side, use a body pillow to help you get into a comfortable position that doesn't put pressure on your breasts.

, Go braless as often as possible to avoid added pressure on the milk ducts. Wear loose, comfortable clothing so you don't put pressure on your breasts.If you do wear a nursing bra, it should be properly fitted to your body. You should be able to lean forward when putting on the bra so your entire breast falls in the bra cup. There should be no breast tissue punched at the edges of the cup or bra.You should avoid wearing other constricting clothing like tight bathing suits, breast pads, and placing heavy shoulder purses or diaper bags across your chest.

, It's very common for your nipples to crack while you're nursing, and cracked nipples provide an entryway for bacteria to get in and cause mastitis. Prevent cracked nipples by doing the following:Let your nipples air dry after feedings. This is better for them than toweling them dry or washing them off each time, which can be drying.
Rub your nipples with a lanolin cream. Look for a natural, alcohol-free cream that you can use to treat dry, sore nipples.

, Many mothers with mastitis start to feel like they have the flu, with symptoms like a high fever, body aches, chills, and exhaustion. This is the is the most common presentation for mastitis.Take your temperature if you are feeling ill and think you may have mastitis. A temperature above 101 °Fahrenheit (38.3 °C) can be an indication that you have mastitis.

, These symptoms often occur when a milk duct is clogged prior to the development of mastitis. Detecting these symptoms early can help you take steps to treat the problem before full blown mastitis develops.The skin of your breasts may also appear shiny and have red streaks or red wedge shaped marks. Your breasts may also feel tender and warm to the touch and it may feel painful when you try to breastfeed.
Mastitis usually occurs in the first few weeks of breastfeeding, though it can occur any time during breast feeding. Keep in mind mastitis tends to affect only one breast.

, If your breasts are not improving, you continue to have a high temperature or you are feeling more ill as time passes, chances are you are dealing with a mastitis infection and should seek immediate medical care.If the doctor determines that the mastitis is the result of an infection, she may prescribe a round of antibiotics.
Mastitis can turn into an abscess which is very difficult to treat and may involve disfiguring surgery, so it is important to see the doctor as soon as you feel like mastitis is developing.

, You will need to continue breastfeeding, even if you have an infection. You will not pass the infection to the baby. Not breastfeeding when you have mastitis can make the infection worse. Talk with your doctor about ways to minimize the pain.

Practice good posture.,
Wear tops with embellishments over the chest.,
Wear the correct bra size.,
Use a padded or push-up bra.,
Avoid thin or tight bras.,
Don't stuff your bra.",How to Naturally Increase Breast Size1," Some women find that their breasts appear smaller than they actually are when they have a slumped or slouched posture. For an instant boost to your bust line, simply straighten up! Stand up straight, hold your head high, and draw your shoulders back. Keep your neck straight up-and-down; don't let it slide forward. Push your chest out gently as you stand and walk. Now, take a look in the mirror. You may be surprised what a difference this simple trick has made!;
, One often-ignored way to make your breasts appear bigger is simply by wearing clothing that accentuates your natural curves. For instance, any sort of shirt with puffy, frilly, or ruffled material in the chest area can give the illusion that your breasts are larger than they actually are. The same effect can be achieved with well-worn scarves.


Another good bet is to wear shirts with horizontal-striped patterns on the chest. For the same reason that people worried about their weight like to avoid wearing these types of clothing, people looking to enhance the size of their chest may want to use these volume-adding patterns.

, Wearing a bra that is either too small or too large can leave your breasts appearing smaller than they actually are. Make sure you don't wear a big bra just to make your breast bigger, but wear a bra that allows your breast to lift. On top of this, poorly-sized bras can be just plain uncomfortable! Ideally, bras should support and lift the breasts, not flatten them or allow them to hang loosely. If you think that you may be wearing the wrong bra size, ask for a fitting the next time you go lingerie shopping. Some women who spend years using one size of bra find that after a re-fitting they look (and feel) measurably better.

, A good padded bra can add noticeable volume to your bust while also making your breasts look perkier. Push-up bras, on the other hand, can add lots of ""lift"" to your breasts, giving the appearance of a larger, fuller bust. Using these types of bras is a great quick-fix for outfits that go from looking good to great with a slightly larger chest.


Though some sources may recommend it, in general, it's a bad idea to wear multiple bras, regardless of the type of bras being used. Though this can make your breasts look a little bigger if it's applied to correctly, it can be awfully uncomfortable and will probably have you spending lots of time adjusting yourself throughout the day.

, If you are concerned with your breast size, you may want to avoid wearing thin, lacy bras. These bras may look tremendous on lingerie store mannequins, but on real people, they can prove unflattering. Because they can provide little in the way of padding or lift, these types of bras can leave your bust size lacking. Instead, opt for a padded bra or a push-up bra to make the most of your natural size.


You'll also want to avoid extra-tight bras like sports bras (unless of course, you're exercising), as they tend to flatten your chest rather than accentuating it. This is great if you're looking to have a hassle-free work out, but not so good if you're trying to maximize your curves.

, This middle-school trick can make your breasts look bigger, but it should be seen as an absolute last resort. Using tissue or cloth to artificially add size to your breasts can be quite uncomfortable, especially if this extra material causes you to sweat or irritates your skin. If your extra padding shifts, it can even give your breasts an uneven or lumpy appearance. Also, there's always the chance that, despite your best preparations, your padding falls out or slides up your chest and becomes visible. Because of this, you'll want to avoid stuffing your bra unless you feel that you positively have to.

Eat healthy fats.,
Eat estrogen-rich foods.,
Avoid food rich in testosterone.,
Eat protein.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Drink a mixture of papaya juice and milk every day.",How to Make Boobs Grow Faster1," Breasts are made of fatty, adipose tissue, so they will not appear until you have gained body fat. Monounsaturated fats are the best choices for increasing breast size. Healthy fats include olive oil, nuts, cheese, avocados, yogurt, and granola.Women who have less than 17 percent body fat may stop ovulating and menstruation. If you have already gone through puberty, but you are not having regular periods, then raising your body fat in a healthy way will help you to grow breasts and return to normal menstruation and ovulation.
Avoid other fats that are unhealthy, like trans fats and saturated fats from fast food and processed food sources. These fats usually end up collecting on areas of the body that women want to avoid being fuller, such as thighs, hips, and the stomach. They can also cause other health problems, including high cholesterol.Refrain from consuming processed foods, sugars, and sodas which may help you put on weight but will certainly lead to other unhealthy conditions.;
, Estrogen is a potent female sex hormone, which at its proper levels can aid breast growth. Good sources of natural estrogen include pumpkin, garlic, red beans, lima beans, chick peas, eggplant, flax seeds, and squash.Increase your consumption of soy products. Soy products are high in isoflavones, which can help the body increase its own estrogen levels and promote breast growth. Soy is also rich in protein and can help build and repair damaged tissues in the body. Try soy milk, soy nut butter, etc., to see results., Testosterone is the male equivalent of estrogen which decreases breast growth. Avoid carb-rich foods such as chips, crackers, white rice and baked goods to minimize the production of testosterone in your body.Anabolic steroid use will have a similar effect to testosterone on breast growth as well.

, Protein is one of the best ways to make your breasts grow. Try drinking more milk, and eating more eggs, peanut butter, lean fish, chicken and nuts. In any case, you should be trying to eat a well-balanced diet irrespective of whether or not you are trying to make your breast grow faster.


If you eat more protein, your curves will be softer and round out nicely., Fruits and vegetables help regulate testosterone levels in the body, while the anthocyanins and antioxidants in them further help build healthy tissue and protect against damage from free radicals. Make sure you're getting a minimum of four servings a day.Berries, like blueberries, are a good choice because they're high in antioxidants.
Dates, cherries, apples and plums should be included in your meals because they have more estrogen than other foods., Although it is not extensive or well done, some research has shown that one of the best to improve breast growth is to drink a mixture of papaya juice and milk. Nutrients and vitamins found in these two ingredients help plump your breasts as long as you drink the mixture routinely.Alternatively you can also eat fresh papaya in lieu of the juice.

Stop doing anything that makes your breasts larger.,
Create a calorie deficit.,
Eat a healthier diet.,
Eat better portions.,
Get active in your everyday life.,
Exercise efficiently.,
Stay motivated.",How to Make Your Breasts Smaller2," You should always start by stopping certain things that make your breasts bigger naturally. The most common culprit will be birth control pills, which can add up to two cup sizes to your breasts! You'll have to talk to your doctor about non-hormone based alternatives.


A good alternative option to birth control pills is the copper IUD.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also natural causes of bigger breasts but you should not act against these states as they are natural and temporary.

, Calories are the fuel that our body uses and in order to burn fat (which is the main contributor to your bust line), you'll need to give it less fuel than it needs. This doesn't mean starving yourself, it just means balancing your activity level with the amount of fuel it needs. Lowering the amount of food you eat by a small amount while increasing your activity by a small amount can be enough to help you lose weight.


Use an online calorie calculator to find out how to adjust your diet.
This calorie deficit should only be temporary though. Once you've reached a healthy target weight, balance your calorie intake with your activity level.

, You'll want to eat a healthier diet that puts your calorie intake to work for you! By eating few unhealthy items and increasing the nutritional value of the food that you do eat, you can make yourself feel more full with less food and easily decrease the number of calories you consume in a day.


Add healthy items to your diet. Eat healthy foods like kale, spinach, broccoli, quinoa, whole grain oatmeal, potatoes, lentils, edamame, white beans, fish, eggs, cottage cheese, and many other foods. Skip on fruits, which add a lot of sugar to a diet and instead double down on vegetables and beans, as those listed above contain all of the same vital nutrients as fruit (often in greater quantities).
Cut unhealthy items from your diet. Cut unhealthy items from your diet like trans and saturated fats, excessive salt, and sugar. All of these contribute to weight gain and fat build-up. You can find these things in items like soda, Starbucks-style coffee, bacon, pork rinds, chips, butter, ice cream, and other similar foods.

, Most people eat way too much food at one time. If it seems like it's the size of a restaurant meal, then it's too much food. A good practice is to eat your meals on a side plate instead of a dinner plate, and go back for seconds only if you are still hungry 15 minutes after you finish eating your first portion. Take a half serving for your ""seconds"".


Eating very small meals more often is also a good way to practice portion control. This will also keep you feeling full all day.

, There are lots of ways that you can get active in your every day life. None of these require taking too much extra time out of your normal schedule.


The easiest way to get more active in your everyday life and start burning calories is to walk more. Take the stairs instead of the elevator and park further away from wherever you need to go in order to make sure you're walking a greater distance.
Beyond that, try things like standing or treadmill desks or using an exercise ball instead of a chair. All of these use your normal activities and turn them into exercises!

, It's easy to get bogged down with the clichéd push-ups and pull-ups, but there are more efficient exercises that can fit into your day much easier. Good examples include squats, planks, and burpees, all of which you can learn how to do in the wikiHow on exercising. Try to choose one or more of these exercises and do them for at least 15 minutes at a time for at least 30 minutes day.


Squats and planks are both core exercises. If you only do these, it's a good idea to also take our advice about walking more. Try to spend another 30 minutes total every day walking, and the more stairs and hills involved, the better.

, Exercise needs to be consistent and prolonged in order to have any real effect. You'll have to make a real lifestyle change if you want the weight to stay off. This is why it's important to stay motivated. Having an exercise partner, a trainer, or someone else you're responsible to can really help.


Listening to music while you exercise can also make it much more fun. You can also listen to audio books or podcasts too!

Talk to your doctor.,
Do your research.,
Get a consultation.,
Recognize the risks.,
Accept the permanence.,
Make sure you can afford it.,
Get the surgery.,
Go through the aftercare.",How to Make Your Breasts Smaller3," Please, talk to your doctor before putting too much consideration into breast reduction surgery and certainly before talking to a plastic surgeon (who may have too much of a vested interest in getting your money). There may be other factors that may contribute to your breast size, health factors that may make surgery dangerous, and potentially much easier and less dangerous solutions.


Surgery is a particularly bad idea if you are young. Give yourself time: you may find you feel very different about your body in a few years.
Surgery should also not be used just for cosmetic reasons or to help you fit into the clothes you like. Surgery is dangerous and the dress you wear should not be more important than your life.

, Research the best plastic surgery facilities in your area. If there aren’t any highly acclaimed or reviewed locations nearby, it may be worth your while to go out of your way to find one. Again, plastic surgery is risky, and you want the best treatment you can find.

, Get a consultation with a couple of different plastic surgeons. They will be able to advise you on the different methods of breast reduction and the results that can be achieved. They will also be able to advise on costs and other considerations. You should not choose any surgeon that seems untrustworthy or offers extremely cheap procedures. A poor surgeon can easily give you very bad looking breasts.

, There are a number of risks associated with breast reduction surgery, many of which are also carried with any other surgery: the basic risk of using anesthesia is present, since anyone at any time may develop a bad reaction to those drugs and die on the table. You may also develop an infection or blood clots. There are other risks as well:


You run the risk of scarring, which may even go so far as to form keloids.
You may end up with uneven or unusually shaped nipples.
You may lose the ability to breast feed, complicating the situation if you ever plan to have children.

, Breast surgery cannot be undone. This is obviously a problem if the procedure is done poorly, but it is also important to remember that what's in fashion now or what you like now might not always be so desirable. You may come to love your body just the way it is and if you have surgery, you won't be able to get it back.

, Oftentimes, breast reduction surgery is considered an elective surgery across the board and so it will not be covered by health insurance. This can make it prohibitively expensive. Weigh your priorities to make sure that this is right for you, since spending the money on something like school might be more beneficial for you in the long run.

, Once you've weighed all your options and have made a decision, you'll need to go and get the surgery. It is usually done at a hospital or surgical center, requires general anesthesia, and is completed in a few hours. Generally, you will be sent home the same day, so you'll need to have someone available to pick you up.

, You'll have to be extremely vigilant as you go through the aftercare process. You may have a tube to drain fluids and blood placed in your chest and you'll certainly have stitches and bandages. All have to be kept clean and you'll have to stay fairly inactive, in order to let your body heal and prevent infection. You will likely be in pain and experience severe swelling and bruising. The stitches are usually removed after 1-2 weeks."

Consider breast-enlarging herbs.,
Look into unverified natural oils or creams.,
Try breast massage.",How to Naturally Increase Breast Size2," A wide selection of herbs and plant supplements purported to cause breast growth are available for sale both online and at natural healing stores. Though some women swear by these natural medicines, none have been scientifically proven to be as effective as traditional ""Western"" cures and should be regarded with a healthy degree of skepticism. Additionally, certain naturopathic herbs can cause potentially serious complications in people who are taking certain medications (especially blood thinners),so you'll always want to talk to a doctor before beginning a course of herbal supplements. Some herbs that allegedly encourage breast growth are:Saw palmetto
Fennel
Kava
Wild yam
Chaste tree berry
Black cohosh
Fenugreek
Pueraria Mirifica

, In addition to the herbal supplements that claim to enlarge breasts, many topical lotions, oils, and creams claim a similar effect. As with herbs, there is little scientific evidence (if any) that these solutions have a significant effect on breast growth, though some women claim to have used these topical cures successfully. Before attempting to use any of these methods, contact a doctor to discuss more effective, verifiable ways to achieve your breast enlargement goals.


Note that some actual hormonal medications, like estrogen, come in a topical form. At sufficient dosages, these medications are actually known to cause breast growth. Be careful not to confuse these hormonal creams, which can have other side effects, with naturopathic medicines.

, Some sources claim that, by massaging the breasts with proper technique, it's possible to cause slight breast growth. Sometimes, these sources recommend the use of special oils, creams, or gadgets to encourage growth. Though this may feel good and lead to relaxation, which can cause an improvement in mood and posture, there is no scientific evidence that breasts can be stimulated to grow via massage.


However, because this method is relatively safe and inexpensive (unless you buy a massage aid available for sale from naturopathic healing stores), feel free to attempt it at will. As noted above, massage can be a handy tool for achieving a relaxed, content mood.

Build your pectoral muscles.,
Focus on your back and shoulder muscles.,
Don't worry about becoming bulky.,
Consider gaining weight if you are thin.,
Don't believe the ""spot-reducing"" myth.",How to Naturally Increase Breast Size3," Pumping iron isn't just a great way to improve your strength, mood,and overall health — it's also a killer way to improve your breasts! Specifically, building the pectoral (chest) muscles underneath your breasts with regular strength training exercise can help improve the size, firmness, and perkiness of the overlying breast. Below are two sample exercises you may want to try out:



Chest presses: Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Hold one dumbbell in each hand with your elbows bent at a 90 degree angle. Use your chest muscles to lift the weights up toward the ceiling and touch them together. Lower the weights to their starting position slowly and smoothly. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps 3-5 times per week.

Push-ups: Get on your hands and knees. Stretch your legs behind you and balance on the tips of your feet. Bend your arms to lower your body toward the ground. Use your arms and chest to return back to the original position. Keep your back straight and your hips elevated so that your body stays in a straight line. You can lower your knees to the ground if standard push-ups are too hard. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps 3-5 times per week.

, Your chest muscles aren't the only ones you should work. In general, when strength training, you'll want to ensure that you exercise all of your major muscle groups each week to ensure maximum total-body strength and prevent injury. In addition, toning muscle groups besides those in your chest can also have positive effects on your bust size. For instance, strengthening your shoulder and back muscles can give your upper body a toned, firm appearance and make it easier to maintain pert, erect posture. Both of these can make your breasts appear bigger and more shapely. Get started working your back and shoulders with the sample exercises below:


Y Raise: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold one dumbbell with each hand in front of each thigh. In a smooth, controlled movement, raise the dumbbells out in front of you and over your head into a ""Y"" shape. Keep your core firm and maintain an erect posture as you do this. Complete the exercise by lowering the weights back into their starting position slowly. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps 3-5 times per week.
Renegade Row: Grab two dumbbells and get into push-up position with straight arms. Keeping your hips stationary, pull one dumbbell from the floor up to your chest, keeping your elbow tucked against your body. Lower the dumbbell back to the ground and repeat with the opposite arm. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps 3-5 times per week.

, It's a common myth that women can become bulky, muscle-bound, and unattractive from strength-training exercise. In fact, it's almost impossible for women to get big, burly muscles without becoming professional body builders or using steroids. Women don't produce as much of the hormone testosterone as men, making it much more difficult for them to naturally put on big muscles. While women are perfectly capable of becoming stronger and more toned, they generally have to have the schedules of professional athletes (or use steroids) to even begin to appear muscly in a masculine way.

, Breasts are comprised primarily of fatty connective tissue.Like the rest of the fatty tissue on the body, this is eventually lost as a woman loses weight. If you are thin and have small breasts, putting on just a few extra pounds of fat can help fill out your breasts. However, you'll want to avoid an all-out weight-gaining binge, as the negative effects of rapid weight gain and obesity are numerous.Your best bet is to increase your calorie intake moderately for a week or two, then judge your results. If you don't like any changes you see, return to your previous diet.


However, it's important to note that all women carry their weight differently. Some women gain weight in their thighs, belly, or elsewhere before gaining weight in their chest.
It is important to follow a healthy diet even if you are trying to gain weight. Increase your intake of lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, rather than foods rich in unhealthy fats and sugars. In addition, always remember to stay active — the Centers for Disease Control recommend about 2 hours and 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per week along with at least two sessions of strength-training., It's an unfortunately common belief that it is possible to burn fat in certain areas of the body by selectively exercising those areas. In fact, there is no such thing as spot-reduction — you can fat or lose fat from your body as a whole, but you can't gain or lose it just from certain areas.This concept has been repeatedly debunked by scientific research. So, if you're trying to get bigger breasts, don't waste time trying to spot-reduce in other areas of your body. It just won't work!


While you can't selectively gain or lose fat by targeting certain areas of the body, you can selectively build muscle by targeting certain areas with strength training exercises. However, keep in mind that most people look their best (and are less at risk for injury) when they have a balanced, varied workout routine.

Consider taking birth control.,
Look into estrogen therapy.,
Get bigger breasts from your progesterone therapy.,
Increase breast size with your SSRIs.",How to Naturally Increase Breast Size4," For women who want to prevent an unplanned pregnancy and, coincidentally, also desire larger breasts, birth control pills can be an effective solution for both problems, as breast growth is a common side-effect of many hormone-based birth control pills. Most birth control pills contain the female sex hormone estrogen, which, as discussed below, can cause slight breast growth. However, you should never take birth control just to get bigger breasts, as it's a powerful medication that can have serious side effects (though these are rare). Because not all birth control pills contain estrogen and because birth controls that do contain this hormone can have a variety of other effects on the body, it's important to talk with your doctor before beginning to take birth control. The side effects of birth control can include:Mood swings
Nausea
Headaches
Decreased libido
Weight gain
Unexpected bleeding (or spotting).
Note that not all women get bigger breasts while taking birth control and that any growth that does occur may be minor.

, Estrogen, a naturally-occurring female sex hormone, can be prescribed to women for a variety of reasons. For instance, it is frequently prescribed to middle-aged women to relieve the troublesome symptoms of menopause. One of the side effects of taking estrogen can be mild breast enlargement. Again, however, you should never try to take estrogen just to make your breasts bigger. Because replacing your body's natural supply of estrogen with artificial supplements has a variety of other side effects and can increase your chances for certain health problems in the long term, you should only consider taking estrogen if your doctor has already suggested it for some other health concern. Side effects of estrogen include:Headaches
Nausea
Weight gain
Vaginal discharge
Breast tenderness
A slight increase in the likelihood of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.
A slight increase in the likelihood of strokes or blood clots.

, Progesterone is another naturally-occurring female sex hormone that can be prescribed for a number of reasons. For example, progesterone is frequently prescribed to prevent the overgrowth of the uterine lining in women who are taking estrogen. Like estrogen, progesterone can cause mild growth in the breasts. However, also like estrogen, progesterone is a serious medication and should not be taken merely to enlarge the breasts. Only consider taking this hormone if a doctor has already recommended for other reasons. Side effects of progesterone can include:Acne or hair growth
Cough
Weight change
Joint pain
Vaginal irritation
Symptoms similar to those of estrogen therapy (including an increase in the likelihood of certain cancers and serious health conditions)
Rarely, depression

, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, are a common type of antidepressant which can cause moderate breast enlargement as a side-effect.Although SSRIs are relatively safe and complication-free compared to other forms of antidepressant, it can still be unsafe to take them without cause, so, once again, you should only consider this option if your physician has already recommended that you should start taking antidepressants. Never take SSRIs just to get bigger breasts. Besides breast enlargement, side effects of SSRIs include:Nausea
Reduced libido
Headache
Difficulty sleeping
Dry mouth
Weight gain
Drowsiness

Do yoga or pilates.,
Do chest presses.,
Do chest contractions.,
Do chest flys.,
Do chair lifts.,
Do pushups.,
Do palm pushing.",How to Make Boobs Grow Faster2," These exercise programs strengthen your core and in turn require significant strength in your chest. Often you are working with your pectoral muscles, the chest muscles under the breast. As those muscles are strengthened, through poses like chaturanga in classical yoga, the breasts will have enhanced size and shape.

, Grab 5 lb (2.2kg) weights in each hand. Set them aside on your exercise mat as you lower yourself onto your back. You can also use a weight bench for this exercise.


Bend your knees and contract your abdominal muscle deeply.
Grab a weight in each hand. Raise your hands directly over your shoulders. Your palms should face each other when they are in the air.
Lower your arms down slowly until your elbows touch the floor beside your waist.
Pause and lift them slowly. Repeat 12 times. Do 3 sets of 12 with 30 second resting periods in between.
Switch the position of your hands so that the palms face your feet and repeat the exercise. You can also use a 10 lb. (4.5) weight bar for this version.

, Stand with your feet hip width apart. Grasp the ends of a hand towel with a hand on each end. Hold your arms out straight in front of you. Contract your abdominal muscles and try to pull the towel in opposite directions with each hand. Pretend you are playing tug of war. Hold the contraction for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat 3 times.


Increase the amount of time you contract your muscles every other day.

, Find a weight bench that you can set at an incline. You can also use a chair that inclines, as long as it gives firm support. Grab 2 5 lb. (2.2kg) weights. Lay back on the incline.


With a weight in each hand, extend your upper arms parallel from your shoulders. Your palms should face toward your lower body, rather than toward each other.
Lift the weights until they almost touch in front of your chest. Pause and slowly lower them to the original position.
Do 3 sets of 12 repetitions.

, This will tone and strengthen the arms, chest and shoulders while also enhancing the size and appearance of the breasts.


Back up to a stable chair. Squat down with your feet slightly out in front of your knees and reach back with your arms to grab the arm rest or seat of the chair.
Lower your torso down slowly without going past 90 degrees of elbow bend. Then push yourself back up.
Repeat 10 times, then break, and do two more sets of 10.

, Pushups will help strengthen your pectoral muscles, those muscles under your breasts, which in turn will give the breasts an enhanced firmness. Pushups are also just excellent exercise for overall physical fitness and strength.Lay down on your stomach on an exercise mat. Place your arms right below your shoulders.
Press yourself up into a plank position. Your weight should rest on your hands and feet, with a straight line extending between your shoulders and your ankles.
If you don’t have considerable upper body strength, modify the pushup position so that you are on your knees, in a plank.
Lower your body as far as you can by bending your elbows. Stop before you reach the floor.
Raise yourself back up. Go slowly, spending 2 to 3 seconds for each movement.
Do 2 sets of 10 and increase the number of repetitions you do each week.

, This a simple exercise that can be done anywhere and anytime. Place both palms of your hands together and press into each other for a count of 5 and then release. Do 10 reps.

Massage your breasts.,
Stop wearing a bra.,
Try breast enhancement herbs.,
Talk to your doctor about birth control pills.,
Try breast enhancers that don't change the size of your breasts.,
Just be patient.",How to Make Boobs Grow Faster3," It has been rumored, though remains scientifically unconfirmed, that massaging your breasts daily helps stimulate blood flow to the breasts and allows natural hormones taken in your diet to reach breast tissue more effectively. In turn, your breasts grow., A 15-year French study recently reported results that bras cause women’s breasts to sag over time. Researchers found that going braless increased the elasticity of the breasts making them perkier. This study goes against previous reports that bras support women’s breasts and fight sagging.However, keep in mind that this study only applies to women ages 18 to 35 who have never worn a bra before.


The study found that women who never wore bras had nipples on average seven millimeters higher (relative to their shoulders) than women who wore bras regularly., Consult a local health food nearby or a naturopath about taking natural female health supplements and herbs. These should help your breasts appear fuller and more-filled out. Try to stick to natural products, though.Marshmallow root, for example, is one natural herb that can help, apparently, breast growth. Be sure to consult your physician, though, as this particular herb can interfere with other medications you may be on.
Keep in mind that there is no evidence to support herbs helping with breast growth.

, Birth control pills contain hormones - most importantly estrogen - that will affect breast size. Hormones should, however, be considered a last resort.There are several reasons to start taking birth control pills in addition to decreasing the risk of pregnancy. The hormones in birth control pills can regulate your period, make periods less painful, and reduce the symptoms of PMS.
If you are a teenager who has not yet used birth control pills, then talk to your parents and doctor about monitoring your hormone levels.Note, however, that weight gain should not be the only reason you opt to start taking the birth control pill. It is a form of medication and will have other side-effects on your body, so think carefully about taking it.

, If you want your breasts to look bigger but don't really want to try any of the other suggestions, try wearing a padded bra or other stuffing inside your bra. Your breasts will appear larger but won't actually be any larger.Even standing up straight and keeping good posture will make your breasts look bigger.

, If you are currently going through puberty, there are several clues to help you predict whether your breasts will grow naturally.


Look at your mother and grandmothers’ breast sizes. If most women in your family have larger breasts, they are likely to get bigger as you go through puberty.Examine at your breasts in the mirror. Notice whether the areolas, the area around the nipples, ""stick out"" a little, meaning they look like little mounds on top of your breasts. If they do, then your breasts are still in their growth phase.Keep in mind that you may not reach your full breast size until you are in your late teens or even in your early 20s."

Place your forearm on a table or the arm of a chair so that your arm and elbow are supported.You can also lie down on your back.If you’re doing the exam on someone else, support their arm with your free hand.;
, Use your three middle fingers to feel for lymph nodes. Do not use your thumb, which is less sensitive. Feel with the pads of your fingers – where your fingerprints are.If you’re palpating someone else’s axillary nodes, use your right hand to check their left armpit, and your left hand to check their right armpit., Your axillary nodes are rather deep into your armpit, so press in with firm, slow pressure. Move the pads of your fingers around in a circular motion.When you move your fingers to a different area, do it slowly and while exerting gentle pressure against the body., Start feeling for lymph nodes with your hand straight up, deep in your underarm, at the bottom middle of your armpit. Then feel three other points, making the shape of a diamond:Move your hand up and towards your chest, feeling underneath where your chest muscles (pectorals) reach your armpit.
Move across your armpit horizontally towards your back, and feel under where your scapula (shoulder blade) reaches your armpit.
Move up and to the middle of your armpit to where your arm joins your armpit, and feel for nodes with the palm of your hand facing the bottom of your arm.

, When you feel a swollen lymph node, write down what you feel. Take this to your doctor so they can make comparisons over time, then keep it handy so you can keep track of any changes. Write down the following information:The size: estimate to the closest centimeter, or use a ruler to measure from one side to the other.
The shape: is it round, oval, or irregularly shaped?
The firmness: is it soft when you gently press it, or firm and rubbery?Roll your fingers over the node with slight pressure.The mobility: if you try to wiggle it gently, does it move around a bit or is it firmly fixed in place?
Tenderness: is the lymph node sore or tender at all?

, If you feel a lymph node in your armpit that is less than 3cm, soft, and moveable, don’t worry about calling your doctor. These rarely indicate a problem. On the other hand, swollen nodes might mean you have inflammation, an infection, or another problem. Call your doctor for a check-up if the enlarged lymph nodes you feel are any of the following:Fixed (not moveable)
Firm
Persistent (it’s normal for nodes to get big for under a week then go back to normal)

, See your doctor if you have an alarming enlarged node that lasts longer than a week.They will talk to you about your medical history and do a physical exam.

Find an accomplishment or an attribute about him and lift him up to the people around him or you. “Hey, did you know Harry just got a job at Carter’s corporate office?” or “I’m really proud of him for pursuing his songwriting. It’s been amazing to see him grow.”, Men crave compliments just like women do, just not as often or not quite in the same way.

Perform monthly self-breast exams to identify a lump in a breast.,
Talk with your doctor if you feel new lumps (most are pea-sized) or firm and hard breast tissue.,
Pay close attention to breast lumps that suddenly grow or change in shape.,
Be aware of other concerning symptoms.",How to Identify a Lump in a Breast1," Most lumps are found by women, often by accident (in fact, 40% of breast cancers are found by women self-reporting a lump in their breast to their doctor). Start by standing in front of a mirror to look at your breasts, with your hands on your hips (as this optimizes the positioning of your breasts so that you can look at them and compare them). Things to look for include: breasts that are similar to their normal in terms of size, shape, and color; no swelling; no skin changes; no nipple discharge or nipple changes; and no redness or soreness.
The next step in your breast self-exam is to raise your arms above your head, and to examine your breasts for the same features listed above. This change in position of your arms alters how your breasts sit, and is another way to identify any changes.
The next part of the breast self-exam is done lying down. Lift your right arm over your head. With your left hand, apply firm pressure to your right breast. Move your fingers in a circular motion around the nipple, the surrounding tissue and the armpit. Be sure to cover the full surface area of the breast, from the collarbone to the bottom of the rib cage, and from the armpit to the breastbone. Raise your left arm and repeat the process examining your left breast, surrounding tissue and the armpit with your right hand.
Doing a breast exam in the shower also works. You may actually be better at reading your breast when your fingers are wet and soapy as your fingers will glide over your breast tissue more easily.;
, If you do find one, don't fret; odds are it's not cancerous — eight out of 10 aren't. The benign ones are usually caused by cysts, a fibroadenoma, or just generalized breast lumpiness.


It's not unusual to develop breast lumps for a short duration of time; most often, these are related to the menstrual cycle (they are called ""physiological breast lumps"" and come and go each month in sync with your menstrual cycle).
In order to distinguish ""physiological breast lumps"" (related to your period) from worrisome ones, watch to see whether the lump grows and then shrinks again within the month, and whether this pattern repeats monthly with your cycle. If this is not the case, or if the lump continues to grow, it is always best to seek the advice of your physician.
The best time to do breast self-examination is one week before your period starts (as this is the time when it is least likely, hormonally, to have lumps related to your period). If you are post-menopausal or have irregular periods, you can examine your breasts on the same day of each month to keep your self-examination process as consistent as possible.

, Most women have inconsistencies in breast tissue (it is the nature of how our breasts are), but if this changes over time (or grows) it is more likely to be worrisome. Also, you can assess one breast in comparison to the other — if both breasts feel the same, it is not a worry, but if one breast has a lump that is definitely not present in the other, this is more of a cause for concern. , These symptoms may or may not occur in conjunction with a breast lump; if they do, the lump is more likely to be worrisome and it is best to see a physician sooner rather than later. Look for a bloody or pus-like nipple discharge.
Watch for a red or pink rash near or around the nipple.
Notice any changes in your nipple, especially if it becomes inverted.
Observe breast skin. If it becomes thick, scaly, dry, dimpled, red or pink, talk to your doctor.

Call your family doctor if you are unsure whether your breast lump is of concern.,
Set up a mammography appointment.,
Proceed with a breast ultrasound for further investigation of your lump if your physician recommends this.,
Have your physician prescribe a breast lump biopsy if the other test results are unable to rule out breast cancer.,
Follow-up as per your doctor's advice.",How to Identify a Lump in a Breast2," It is always best to have reassurance that things are fine, or the proper series of investigations and tests as soon as possible if your doctor agrees that there is cause for concern.


Medical professionals are well-trained in how to evaluate and assess breast lumps, and in particular in how to rule out breast cancer. If in doubt, do not hesitate to ask for doctors advice.
Breast cancer is a realistic concern for many women (being the number one most frequent cancer diagnosis in women). One in nine women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their life, so if in doubt get your breast lump checked out by a doctor sooner rather than later. Most breast lumps are benign (not worrisome), and many cancer diagnoses are completely treatable if caught sooner rather than later.
Keep in mind, however, that breast cancer under the age of 20 is very rare, and it is very uncommon under the age of 30.

, Do this on an annual basis or as prescribed by your doctor. This is a low-dose X-ray examination used for locating breast tissue abnormalities.


Mammograms are the number one way in which breast cancers are caught and diagnosed. It can be used as a screening test (routine test for any woman over the age of 40 to rule out breast cancer even without symptoms or lumps), and also as a diagnostic test (for women with a breast lump to gather further information to determine whether or not the lump is of concern).
For a young patient with dense breast tissue, however, an MRI may be a better test than mammogram.
People who receive a mammogram for diagnostic reasons (to determine whether or not their breast lump is worrisome) will likely also receive additional tests to add to the information your doctor has to work with, to determine whether or not she is concerned about your breast lump.

, Ultrasound provides a different viewpoint of the breast than mammography, and can help to differentiate between solid and cystic masses (cystic masses are generally fluid-filled and not of concern; in other words, not cancerous).


An ultrasound can also provide further information to see whether a biopsy (sample of the breast tissue taken with a needle and examined by doctors under the microscope) is needed. , A sample of your breast tissue will be examined under a microscope, which can give a definite answer as to whether the lump is benign (non-worrisome) or malignant (cancerous).


If the lump is in fact diagnosed as breast cancer, you will be referred to an oncologist (cancer specialist) and perhaps a surgeon for surgical, hormonal, or chemotherapy treatments, depending upon the severity.
Again, it is important to be aware that the great majority of breast lumps are not cancer; however, it is always best to see your physician and to have the recommended tests done in order to rule out any possibility, and to get treatment as soon as possible (which results in the most successful outcomes) if you are in fact diagnosed with breast cancer.
At times, a breast MRI or ductogram will be used as ""diagnostic tests"" by your doctor, but these are significantly less common than mammograms, ultrasounds, and breast biopsies. , Oftentimes, if a breast lump is determined to be not particularly concerning, your doctor will ask that you continue to monitor it over time and to report back if there are any significant changes or growth. Most often there will not be, but it is always better to be safe rather than sorry and to continue paying attention to any lumps or different textures to your breast to see if these change or worsen with time (at which point a follow-up visit to your family doctor is recommended).

Rest in the recovery room immediately after surgery.,
Ask for homecare instructions from your doctor.,
Arrange a ride home.",How to Heal Breast Implants1," Immediately following your surgery, your doctor will take you to recovery room where you are placed in a semi-upright reclining position to help keep the swelling down.In the recovery room, your breasts are wrapped in gauze dressings to keep the surgical site sterile.
You may also be asked to wear a supportive bra to aid in the recovery and the bandages may be changed just before you go home.You will also be given a pain medication, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, to manage pain and discomfort.;
, It is helpful to bring someone with you to go over any discharge instructions with the nurse. The anesthetic and pain medications that are used during and after the surgery can make it hard to remember any instructions that are discussed. Before you leave the surgical center, be sure to ask for written aftercare directions so that you know exactly what you and any caretakers should be doing during your recovery period.


For example, you should know how long you need to wear the gauze dressings after the surgery, if you need to change them and whether you need to remove the dressing before a shower or keep them covered while showering.Sometimes, your doctor may advise you not to remove the surgical dressing at all, as this is done during your postoperative appointment.Your doctor will also go over the activities you should avoid that can put your recovery and the implants at risk., Breast augmentation is a major surgical procedure and you should not drive yourself home afterwards. If you have not arranged a ride to home, take a taxi to the surgical center and back home.


You will most be given pain medications that can impact your ability to drive.
Also, make sure you and your driver have plenty of time to get back home. The last thing you need is a bumpy ride and a seatbelt digging into your sore chest area.

Bulgarian beer has no effect on the size of your breasts, either. (See link below.)
Chicken or other foods have no effect on your breast size.
Drinking lots of water is good for you, but will not change the size of your breasts.
Your sleeping position has no effect.
Whether you wear a bra or not has no effect.
Rubbing or squeezing your breasts will not change their size.
Breasts do not get bigger with sex, or lack of sex.
Pumps and machines will not increase the size of your breasts.
Breast size is partially controlled by estrogen, so when taking the birth control pill some women will get larger breasts, while others will not. Such a change cannot be counted on and is considered a side-effect.

Pregnancy increases bust size for the duration of the pregnancy and nursing period, afterwards they go back to their normal size and sometimes get smaller than they were before.
Breasts contain fat cells, so gaining weight will increase their size, unfortunately it will also increase your overall size. There is no known way to use weight gain to only increase the size of your breasts.

Engaging in strenuous activity too soon can lead to injury and compromise the integrity of the surgical incisions.


Make sure that you do not schedule any important appointments or strenuous activity within two weeks of your breast augmentation surgery.
Do not engage in any activity or exercise that requires you to use or engage your upper chest muscles. This includes activities such as jumping, running, swimming, tennis and horseback riding.'
In particular, you should not swim or soak in water for three to four weeks after surgery. This can interfere with the healing process of your scars. If you do swim after this waiting period, be sure to change out of your suit (or bikini top) quickly, or put on a dry one, so that you are not soaking your still healing incisions.Do not push, pull, or carry anything heavy for at least one week after your surgery. Ask your doctor what is a weight you can safely pick up and carry., After a breast augmentation surgery, a supportive bra (such as a sports bra) becomes your best friend that helps you adjust to the new size of your breasts and aids in the recovery.


Use an unlined sports bra during the first few weeks of your recovery period, as underwire can irritate your incision site.Visit a department store or lingerie shop to get specially fitted for a sports bra to support your new breasts.Although you may need to replace all your old bras, you should wait at least one month before shopping for new traditional bras and stick with the sports bra., Over-the-counter pain medications (such as acetaminophen) will help you manage your pain and discomfort after the surgery, but check with your doctor first to make sure it's okay to take them. In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe prescription pain medication for the first few days/weeks.


Whether you opt for over-the-counter or prescription medications, make sure that you take all medications responsibly and according to directions.
It is generally recommended to avoid aspirin-containing pain medication for 10 – 14 days after surgery, as it can thin the blood and increase bleeding.
Anti-inflammatory medications can also help with inflammation and swelling.
You may also want to ask your doctor about an injectable, time-released medication called Exparel, which can help manage your pain over a longer period., Recovery from breast augmentation surgery takes time and lots of rest. Besides avoiding strenuous activities, you should also allow yourself to take it easy for the first few weeks.While you can return to work within a few days of your surgery, it is advisable to wait one to two weeks to return to work and regular activities., Postoperative appointments are an important part of a successful recovery from breast augmentation surgery. Make sure you go to all your scheduled appointments.


Postoperative appointments typically take place during one day one to two weeks after the surgery.During the appointment, your doctor checks for signs of hematoma and irritation of the flesh as well as for any other complications., After the initial recovery period and your post-surgery checkup, ask your doctor whether you should start applying moisturizer over the breasts and the incisions.


The implants can cause your skin to stretch. By applying shea butter, you may promote proper healing and prevent stretch marks.

, Besides your breasts being sore after the surgery, the incisions are also vulnerable and you should not put any added strain on them. Thus, it is recommended you sleep on your back for a few weeks after the surgery.


During your post-surgery checkup, ask your doctor if it is safe to sleep on your stomach again; however, you may still opt to sleep on your back or side if your breast tissue continues to be sore or it is uncomfortable to sleep on your stomach.

, After the stitches have been removed, a light manual massage helps break up any scar tissue that might form after the surgery. Massage may also help your implants to reach their proper position and may help your body to adjust to your new implants faster.Before you start any massage regimen, consult your doctor and ask if it is safe.
Gently use your hands to massage your breasts for 20 minutes at a time twice, using the opposite hand to massage the opposite breast.Only do the massage regimen if there is no pain or discomfort. If you experience pain during the massage, stop immediately.

, Make sure you know the warning signs following your surgery. Contact your doctor immediately if you suffer from any of the following symptoms:


Fever (greater than 100.4°F or 38°C), pain, skin discoloration, inflamed tissue, and smelly wounds are indications of infection and require immediate treatment.Shooting pain, uneven lumps, and deflated breast tissues are possible signs of failure from the implants and should be inspected by your doctor as soon as possible., Breast implants typically last for several years, even lifetime, but you should be aware of certain factors that can impact the integrity of the implants. Keep the following factors in mind:


Menopause, pregnancy, and hormonal changes can cause your breast tissue to change, leading to changes in the appearance of your breast implants.Weight loss can also cause the composition of your breast tissue to change, meaning you need to have some sort of surgery for correction."

Do arm and shoulder exercises.,
Try shoulder rolls.,
Try shoulder wings.,
Do arm circles.,
Try the ""W"" exercise.,
Try the hands behind your neck exercise.,
Try wall crawls.",How to Heal Breast Implants3," Once your initial recovery period, you should start doing exercises that target your arms and shoulders. These allow you to regain arm/shoulder movements and prevent scar tissue formation. Start by doing exercises five times a day until you have regained a full range of motion.Talk to your doctor before engaging in any exercises.
You should feel gentle stretch during the exercises described.
If you experience pain, stop or reduce the range of motion to a level that you can perform without feeling pain.

, The shoulder rolls are gentle exercises that stretch the chest and shoulder muscles.Sit with your back straight and arms straight on your side with fingers pointing to the floor.
Roll your shoulders in a circular motion moving them up, forward, down, back, and up again.
The movement should come from the shoulder, while the arms and elbows stay straight.
Do 10 rolls to one direction, then switch directions and do another 10 rolls on both shoulders.
Start with small circles and then increase the diameter as you can.

, This exercise helps you regain outward movement of your shoulder and you can perform it either sitting or standing.Fold your hands to your chest so that your elbows point downward.
Holding your hands against the chest, raise your elbows to the side like a “chicken wing.”
Hold for a moment, then lower the elbows and repeat 10 times.
As your range of motion improves, try lifting the elbows higher and higher.

, This exercise helps increase the range of motion in your shoulders. Do this exercise one arm at a time either sitting or standing.With your back straight, raise one arm to the side as high as you can, keeping your elbow straight.
Start making small circles in the air with your straight arm. The movement should come from the shoulder and not from the elbow.
Perform 10 circles to forward and 10 circles backwards. Then switch to the other arm.
Start with small circles and increase their size when you feel comfortable and experience no sharp pain.

, The W exercise involves making the W shape with your arms. Raise your arms out to the side, fingers pointing up and elbows pointing down, with the palms of your hands facing forward.Pushing your elbows down toward your back, pitch your shoulder blades together.
Hold the position for a moment, then release and repeat at least 10 times.
If you feel pain or discomfort, stop or reduce the movement.

, This resembles the chicken wing exercise but instead of lifting your elbows up, you bring them forward and back.Place your hands behind your neck with your elbows pointing to the side.
Slowly bring your elbows forward, nearly touching them together.
Hold for a few seconds, then move your elbows backward as far as you can to feel the stretch in your chest, arms and shoulders.

, During this exercise, you stand next to a wall and “walk” your hands up and down against the wall. This exercise can be done forward facing and side facing the wall.During the forward facing crawl, place both hands against the wall and begin to walk your fingers up as high as you can to feel a stretch but no pain.
Walk back down and repeat.
For the side crawl, turn one side toward the wall and perform a wall crawl with one had at a time.

Put on your regular training bra, and put on a shirt over it.,
Move around with your training bra.,
Ask your mother, older sister, older relative, or any trusted female friend what she thinks about it.,
Get a fitting.,

Try on a bunch of different bras.",How to Know when It's Time to Go from a Training Bra to a Cup Bra," Look in a mirror. If you feel that your breasts are not supported enough, or look pointy and ungainly, it may be time for a cup bra.
, If it feels like your breasts are moving all over the place in an uncomfortable or painful in any way, it may be time for a cup bra., If she thinks you should buy a new cup bra, ask her to take you shopping. You probably don't need a fancy bra like from Victoria's Secret for your first bra; perhaps try Aerie, or even Macy's or discount stores like TJMaxx and Kohl's., If you go to a Macy's or Aerie, find a salesperson and ask her to measure you. She'll tell you your bra size--it will be a number followed by a letter, such as 28A, 32B, 34D, 32C, etc. Pick out some different brands and styles of this size., If your breasts do not fill out the bra, and there's a gap between the cup of the bra and the top of your chest, it's too big. If all the bras are too big, find a smaller cup size. The smallest is AAA. If that size is too big for you, you can stick with a training bra for now!, Move around in them. Wiggle--do your breasts feel supported? Try on a shirt on top of the bra--does it look smooth and natural? Once you find some bras you like--congratulations! Finding a good bra is not always so easy!"

Do push-ups.,
Do dumbbell chest presses.,
Do isometric chest contractions.,
Ingest more estrogen.,
Gain weight in general.",How to Increase Breast Size1," You may think of push ups as an arm exercise, but they also home in on your pectorals, the muscles in your chest. Working out the pectoral area strengthens and enlarges the chest and can make breasts appear fuller and larger. As a bonus, your arms will get trim and muscular, too. Do 3 sets of 15 push ups at least every other day to start. As your arms and pecs get stronger, increase the number of push ups per set.


Lie stomach-down on the floor with your arms bent at your sides and your palms flat against the floor.
Push up with your arms to raise your torso, keeping your knees straight and your toes on the floor. Continue pushing up until your arms are straight. If you want, keep your knees on the floor to make the push ups less difficult at first.
Lower yourself slowly back to the floor, then repeat. Focus on flexing your pecs as you go.;
, This is another great chest workout that creates, bigger, stronger pec muscles and pushes out your breast tissue.Pick out dumbbells you can comfortably lift for 3 sets of 8 - 12 reps. Using 8, 10 or 12 pound weights is a good place to start. Two or three times a week, do 3 sets of 10 dumbbell chest presses. As you get stronger, increase the number of reps per set.


Lie back on an incline bench. Hold the weights at your sides.
Lift the weights toward each other over your chest, straightening your arms, so that the two ends of the weights touch each other.
Slowly lower the weights down and repeat.

, This type of exercise requires contracting your muscles without extending them, and it's particular good for boosting the size of chest muscles.For this exercise, all you need is a hand towel. Do it at least three times a week for best results.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Hold the hand towel in front of your chest with both arms outstretched.
Pull on both sides of the towel at the same time, contracting your chest muscles in short bursts.
Keeping the towel taut, continue pulling it in a pulsing motion for three minutes.

, The hormone that produces female breasts during puberty stops being produced around the age of 18 or 19. After that, you can supplement your estrogen supply by eating a lot of soy products such as soy milk, tofu, soy beans, and soy cheese.Breast enhancement pills are made with estrogens derived from herbs to achieve the same effect., If you're dieting and exercising to keep yourself thin, your regimen is affecting your breasts, too. Eating more calories will lead to bigger breasts, if you're willing to get a little bigger in other places, too. Becoming pregnant is another way to get a big breast boost naturally.

Understand that breast augmentation will have no effect on your looks or attractiveness, nor will it make other people see you differently.,
Know that even with implants your breasts will still change size and shape in response to health, age and other factors.,
Perhaps the most surprising and important thing to understand about augmentation is that it is not a ""one shot deal"".,
In order to qualify for this procedure you must be 18 years of age for saline implants and 22 years old for silicone implants.

,
There are different breast implant materials that should be discussed and evaluated with a plastic surgeon to understand which type could best suits your body (not only your breast).

,
Do not take in consideration to look exactly as a model, actress or someone else you chosen in advance and get fix on that image.",How to Make an Informed Decision About Breast Enlargement2," It is important to understand and articulate your own expectations before going ahead with surgery.;
, For example, breasts will still sag after pregnancy, weight gain, or from the natural effects of gravity.

, You don't go to the clinic, have the implants put in, heal up and get on with your life. Implants need constant testing, replacement, and checkups. Implants may add complications to pregnancy, and demand modifications to many other medical procedures like mammograms. Your new breasts will need constant attention while you have them.

,,, Mammoplasty it's about physical proportions and any surgical procedure should be suited for your natural body shape to avoid any plastic or fake effect. Better to discuss with a surgeon on what he suggest and be realistic than choose an impossible shape to be like someone else.

Be aware that the cost of breast surgery can be astronomical.,
Understand that few, if any, insurance companies cover the cost of breast surgery unless it is re-constructive surgery after cancer.

",How to Make an Informed Decision About Breast Enlargement3," The national average (American Association of Plastic Surgeons) is $3,437 but this does not include:


Fees for the surgical facility.
Anesthesia
Pre-surgery medical tests.
The actual implants.
Prescriptions and other miscellaneous costs related to surgery.
The costs of follow-up visits and ongoing breast implant care.

Like all surgical procedures breast augmentation carries risks.",How to Make an Informed Decision About Breast Enlargement4," Some are severe, while some less so, but it is important to know what you risk for bigger boobs:

Nerve damage in the breast may cause numbness in the nipples or breast tissue; an inability to feel anything. These effects can be permanent in some cases.
Complications with future mammography. Breast implants make breast-cancer screening more difficult and demand an x-ray technician experienced in working with implants. Your doctor may also require additional tests with each checkup including an ultrasound and an MRI.
Your scars will be firm and pink for at least six weeks. Then they may remain the same size for several months, or even appear to widen. After several months, your scars will begin to fade, although they will never disappear completely.
Capsular contracture refers to a painful complication when scar tissue hardens around the implant and squeezes, which can result in shape changes in the breasts, breasts that are hard to the touch, and pain. Additional surgery is required to deal with capsular contracture.
Uneven results. Your new breasts may be slightly different from one another in size and shape.
Routine activity or injury can cause damage and make implants leak or break. Additional surgery will be necessary to remove the implant or replace it.
One to two weeks after surgery some women suffer severe infections. In rare cases, the implant will have to be surgically removed.
You may experience excessive bleeding following the surgery along with swelling and pain. Again, additional operations will be needed if this happens.
While there is no evidence that implants change your ability to nurse an infant, or change anything about pregnancy, however pregnancy will probably alter your body enough that the implants will have to be replaced for aesthetic reasons.
Implants that break or leak. Beyond factory defects many things can cause the implants to break and leak inside your body including exercise, injury and even normal day-to-day movement. Ruptured implants are a controversial topic and more can be written about the subject. In general, what happens when an implant breaks depends on the kind of implant:

If a saline-filled implant breaks, the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body.
If a silicone-gel filled implant leak or break, the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell, or may escape into the breast. A leaking silicone gel implant may not be noticeable except through expensive tests like an MRI. Thus woman with silicone breast implants are advised to visit with her plastic surgeon every year to make sure they are still functioning properly.

Inform yourself in advance, if possible.,
Change the bandages according to your doctor's or nurse's instructions.,
Comply with the instructions concerning bathing.,
Try to prevent infection by foregoing physical activity.,
Do visual bandage checks from the outside and take the patient's temperature regularly (at least twice a day).",How to Know when to Call the Doctor After Breast Implant Surgery," Ask questions when meeting with the surgeon and the anesthesiologist prior to surgery. Once you (or your loved one) is in the hospital, ask the staff about specific care-giving tasks before you leave. This may involve how much and what type of physical activity the patient should participate in, how to bandage scars, warning signs to check for, etc.;
,


If you don't know how often to change them, call and ask. Do not open any professionally applied bandages ""just to take a look"". Ask your doctor or nurse whether you need to apply topical disinfectant and which kind is safe to use.
Buy rubber gloves, and sterile gauze or adhesive gauze bandages in the appropriate size in the drugstore. When changing the bandages, do not breathe in the direction of the scar. As long as the stitches are still in, the site is prone to infection because the skin is still broken.

, Usually, bathing is not permitted as long as drainage tubes are still in place. Whether you can bathe with stitches still in is a question of your overall health status and should be decided by your doctor.


Whenever your/their scars come in contact with water, pat them dry gently with clean (preferably sterile and disposable) material and apply disinfectant (if advised by the doctor) before applying clean bandages and putting on the post-surgery support bra and chest belt. If you do use regular towels, do not share towels with other people and launder them often, using the hottest available setting on your washing machine.

, If the patient sweats, this will aid bacterial growth. Movement will place tension on the scars and increase the risk of opening them.


Put a care network in place and avoid any kind of strenuous activity. Order in the patient's meals, if nobody else can provide care. Don't let them lift anything heavy. Physically place your hands over your scars and apply pressure while laughing, sneezing, coughing, or doing anything that causes your chest muscles to contract.

, Take pictures regularly from the outside to monitor leakage of fluids. Draw around visible leaks/stains with a pen on the outside of the bandage to monitor whether it is expanding or has already stopped. Don't press on the bandage too hard.

If there is leakage of fluids that are slightly yellow and very watery, that is normal. If the bandage is soaking through very quickly or the site is bleeding, or the site around the stitches is puffy and red, the patient runs a fever or is feeling intense pain, always call the doctor. If any of the stitches should open up, call ahead and then immediately take the patient in to medical care.
If the patient is released from the hospital with drainage tubes still in, and one of them should slip out or loosen, DO NOT touch the site or pull, push or tug on the tube. They are very long and you will cause internal injury. Seek medical assistance immediately.

Discover breast contouring.,
Buy a push-up bra.,
Get chicken fillets.",How to Increase Breast Size2," You probably use makeup to add flattering contours to your cheekbones and chin, but you may not know that you can also use makeup to contour your cleavage. This inexpensive, albeit temporary, method for achieving a larger look is quite easy to do with a little practice.Get fully dressed with the bra and top you want to wear. Since this solution involves a trick of the eye, your cleavage and chest area should be visible - wear something low cut.
If you're concerned about getting makeup on your shirt, you can protect it with some toilet paper or tape. That said, you probably don't want to use this method while wearing white.
Create a cleavage shadow with dark bronzer by applying it between your breasts. Load the brush and sweep it upward from the center of your chest and up and out, creating a v-shape between your breasts.
Apply a lighter colored face powder to the top half of your breasts. Use a makeup sponge to blend the edges with the bronzer for an even finish.

, Bra technology has evolved to the point where you can have beautiful, genuine-looking breasts without having to go under the knife or expend effort toward exercising. Shop around for a push-up bra that feels comfortable and makes your chest look the way you want it to. A great push-up bra won't weigh you down, shift when you move, or make your boobs look pointy or oddly shaped.


Push-up bras with extra padding can increase your breast size by several cups. Size up one cup or go for two or three sizes bigger.
Try on push-up bras under a shirt before buying them. You might be surprised at how much heft they add to your chest, and you want to make sure you look natural and comfortable.
Push-ups are made with foam, gel, and even water inserts for a natural look.

, These silicone bra inserts are worn inside your unpadded bra to provide a highly realistic simulation of a real breast. Their weight, texture and appearance is quite close to that of the real thing. You can buy them in a skin tone color or transparent.

Look into using a breast enhancement cream.,
Consider the Brava.,
Research breast fillers.,
Consider fat injections.,
Look into electric acupuncture.",How to Increase Breast Size3," The market is full of topical creams containing estrogen and collagens, and purporting to both increase the size and tone the shape of breasts. The creams are said to pump up the cells in your breasts and make them appear to be bigger, and some run several hundred dollars a bottle. No enhancement cream has been proven to actually enlarge breasts, and some sources say the creams may actually be unsafe to use.If you want to give this option a try, look for a cream with only natural ingredients like shea butter and aloe. Worst case, your breasts will be soft and moisturized.

, This is a breast-enhancement vacuum device that will run you at least $900, but there is research to show that it causes the breast cells to enlarge and replicate, leading to an increase of one or more cup sizes.The device is fitted over your breasts like a bra, then vacuums inside the cups work on your tissue and increase your size over time. It takes at least 10 weeks to see a difference.

, Fillers are injections of hyaluronic acid into the breast. They increase breasts by a cup size or two over a serious of multiple injections. Each injection takes about 30 to 90 minutes, and the procedure totals a few thousand dollars.


Fillers may have extremely dangerous side effects, so do careful research before deciding to use one.In some cases you may need a ""tune-up"" to keep the fillers looking natural.

, In this procedure, fat is taken from the abdomen or buttocks and injected into the breasts to make them fuller. Since some of the fat is absorbed into the body each time, multiple injections are required before results are seen. Pursue this method with extreme caution, since there's a chance the fat will calcify and lead to major health complications., In this procedure, needles are inserted into the breasts, transferring an electrical current that plumps up the cells. It's a popular treatment among celebrities. In some cases it doesn't last forever, so you may need more than one treatment. There isn't much scientific information on long-term effects of this, so proceed with caution.

Know the types of breast implants.,
Meet with a plastic surgeon.,
Undergo surgery and recovery.",How to Increase Breast Size4," You can choose between silicone or saline implants. Women report that silicone implants feel more ""real,"" but they're also more dangerous if they begin to leak inside the breasts.Both types of implants cost between $5,000 to $10,000.


In the past, silicone breast implants were taken off the market by the FDA because they were contributing to major health problems. In some women they ""slipped"" over time, causing lopsided breasts and other cosmetic issues. After scientific advancements they were recently placed back on the market.
Breast augmentation surgery is not usually covered by insurance companies.

, If you decide to get breast implants, you'll meet with a plastic surgeon to discuss which implants are right for you. You should have a firm idea about what size and shape you want your breasts to be. The doctor will show you examples of how the implants will change your figure and walk you through the surgery process.


Look for a surgeon with plenty of experience and great reviews. You don't want to be the guinea pig for an inexperienced surgeon.
Talk to the doctor about medications you are taking to make sure nothing will interfere with the medicines you'll need to take during and after the surgery.

, You will be placed under general anesthesia while the surgeon makes a cut either under your breasts, under your armpits, or around your nipples, depending on the plan you've agreed upon. The surgery typically takes 1-2 hours. Your breasts will be covered with surgical tape, and you may have breast drains during the healing process.


Complications are possible with any type of surgery. Bleeding, scarring, and more severe issues may occur.Most people need breast implant replacements after several years, since breasts change shape naturally over time.
Breast implants may make it more likely for cancer cells to grow, and they may also interfere with breastfeeding."

You may just pick someone who wears glasses and braces, but inside they may be a total Nerd Hater. So spend some time watching everyone like a hawk (don't be creepy though!), and try to discover who the nerds are. It may be someone obsessed with one particular topic - like computers, a fandom, or literature; or it might be someone who loves schoolwork and seems to always be doing homework and extra credit. Make sure you're careful when trying to find the Nerds - don't make a mistake and pick someone totally different.;
, This is essential. You need a good conversational base to construct a dialogue with the nerd, because they will probably be talking a lot about (especially in the beginning) their chosen field of expertise, or what they may regard as their obsession. Mastery is not necessary - unless of course, you want to, if it fascinates you or you enjoy it- which is even better!

, This shouldn't be too difficult. Talk to them about their obsession,and how you're interested in them. You may want to ask them some questions, for example: if the Nerd is into math(s), you may ask them, ""So what do you prefer - Algebra or Geometry?"" Or if you have a literature fan on your hands, you may ask them what their favorite authors are, and what their opinions are on a book.

, Talk more and more about the Nerd's obsession with them. Be nice to them, don't tease or pick on them. Try to ask them intelligent questions, and be interested in their opinion. Add your own opinions too - don't be afraid to speak your mind. Spend more time with the Nerd - try to sit next to or near them, spend a break time with them, or even go to their hang-out place or to their home(s).

, Don't do anything too ""normal""; this might put them off. Nerds are simple folk, and that is all that needs to be done to continue the friendship indefinitely.

Ask around.,
Learn to sign the alphabet.,
Learn more sign language.",How to Befriend a Deaf Kid at a Hearing School1," When you first notice that there is a deaf kid in your school, ask other students about him or her. See if anybody knows the kid's name, whether he can read lips or communicate with hearing people. Also see if he has an interpreter. Find out what grade he is in and if he has any friends.;
, Learning sign language will take a long time, so start with the alphabet. This will allow you to fingerspell any words you don't know. This way, you can communicate with the deaf kid, even if it's slow. Also, learning a little bit of signing will not only make it easier for him, but make him feel better that somebody cares about him enough to learn a whole new language, just to say hello at the least.

, If you want to learn actual signs, try reading a sign language book, looking signs up online, or watching YouTube videos on sign language. You will be amazed at how many sign language tutorials are out there in the world. Be sure that you are learning ASL (American Sign Language), or whatever particular language the kid you want to befriend uses.

Hopefully, he will smile back and greet you. Start a conversation, but make sure he knows exactly how much sign language you can understand, or if you can only fingerspell.

, Ask permission to sit down with him or her at lunch. Ask about how his day is so far, what he is eating, and what class he is in. Show interest in and concern for him, and try to have a good conversation. He will be so happy that somebody is nice enough to care about him.


Consider bringing paper and a pencil so that you can write out your messages. Until you learn to sign better, this may be faster than trying to fingerspell everything you want to say.

, Try not to bring a boat-load of hearing friends over to his table, because he will feel uncomfortable, and have to read all those lips; if he even can. If you are going to bring your friends, at least have them know their alphabet and to be respectful. If he can speak, he will most likely have a ""Deaf Accent"". If he does, try not to laugh. It is very disrespectful.

, In school, and out. if you are in the same grade, or have any classes together, then you should have study hang outs. Maybe you can invite him to a party with your friends that will be respectful to him, and talk to him. But patience is the key! Always be patient. It might take him a couple seconds for him to figure out what you are saying. especially if you are a beginner.

, Enjoy spending time together and hanging out! He will be grateful to have a friend like you.

However, this option might seem a little too suspect or overly intellectual for your liking, so skip it if it doesn't feel right, and cut straight to the chase of confronting your enemy directly.

, Everyone appreciates a friendly grin; even a nemesis! This might be hard for you especially if your enemy is unpleasant but try not to scream at them.

, If they call you a name, retort back with something like, ""Yeah, at least I have the nerve to be strong about it."" That may shock them a little bit and might change their judgment of you.


If your enemy teases you, just hang in there and give them the same response you would give to your friends if they were to tease you.

, Always having your head down when you walk past them is not going to help. You need to be brave. If their friends told you some things that they are really into, you can try having a conversation with them! Talk to your enemy about things that he or she likes, you never know, you may have something in common, and that could start a neutral friendship.


Approach your enemy and tell them that you want to resolve the issues that you two have together.
Apologize, if it's warranted, and suggest that the two of you start over.
Tell them that you aren't here to argue or quarrel. None of you have time for this and it wastes precious time. Explain to that person why you don't want to hate.
If you can, try to talk out the problems you had in the past.
If they tell you bad things, act like you don't care at all, even if you do.
Don't be insistent. If they don't want to talk to you, you'd better leave talking for another time. Do it slowly and you will see (s)he will want to talk to you.

, The more you fight or do mean things, the worse it gets! Figure out what you have in common. Figure out what's good in this person. However begrudging you feel about that, at least you can focus on the good in their actions and thoughts.

, If you weren't enemies for too long or neither of you ever did anything too bad to each other, chatting with them on the phone once or twice a month won't hurt. If you don't know their phone number, you can ask some of their friends that, too.

, By doing this, you're letting them know that you no longer want to fight. Do not offer your phone number if you feel they may misuse it. Also, if they give you their number its important that you don't misuse it either as that will surely make them lose their trust in you.

, This can't be done completely through talking—actions speak louder than words. Smile when you see the person when you see them, and go out of your way to be nice. Tell them nice things they want hear but they should respect you too.


If you don't feel as though a talk with your enemy is necessary, or you want to be on friendly terms but not necessarily friends, you can start by just smiling and being nice to them when you see them in the halls. This will show your enemy that you no longer hold a grudge, and hopefully they will follow your lead.

, Invite your enemy to your home to play video games, go shoot pool, go to an arcade, go shopping, or see a movie. Invite your nemesis to dinner. Most people won't refuse dinner, no matter how much they dislike you! This gives you a time to bond and have fun together even though you just want them to stop annoying you. You don't have to follow on with the friendship but this could create one as well- unexpectedly!

, Test the waters before allowing yourself to get too close. However, being cautious doesn't mean acting cold. Rather than telling him or her your deepest darkest secret, tell them something that you don't care if it gets spread around. See if they tell others. If so, maintain a friendly distance until you know you can trust them.


Take things slowly. Your differences will eventually subside—considering the effort made—and you two will become friends in time.

, This may help you to build trust and worthiness. Adjust to your slowly transforming relationship slowly—remember that this is a new friendship, and thus that you should not treat your ex enemy like your best friend.


If all else fails, just try and ignore the enemy. Sometimes, people are best left alone.

After some small talk, your new guy friend should understand that you are friends.,
Get that guy with a couple of your other friends.,
Sometimes, girls can be too much in a guy's face, which is annoying.,
Build up your confidence.,
Take care of basic hygiene.,
Be yourself.,
Once you see a guy, try to talk to him.,
Show interest.,
Once you have your (boy) friend, invite him over for stuff and have a great time hanging out.",How to Become Friends With a Guy," Look for a guy that you either know is interested in being mates with you, has the same interests as you, or that would make a good friend. It's quite good if the guy has at least one interest similar to you, otherwise you would have nothing to do or talk about.;
, Watch out for any flirting from either of you - you don't want them getting the wrong impression! Find out what they like, and encourage that in small talk. Let the guy know that you want to talk about his favorite topics too!

, Give that guy some room, let him go to other people and see new faces other than just yours. If you see that guy during the day, say ""hi"" or wave, let him know you're there without getting in his face. He will hopefully realize that you're being friendly. Again ,be watchful for flirting. The last thing you want is that awkward wrong impression.

, It's always better to be with a group and get to know each other than in a tight area with just you two. Being in a crowd simply lets him know that you want his attention for talking and hanging, not anything more. Once he's comfortable with your friends and you, ask him if he wants to hang out. If he says he can't, don't be worried.

, If he is annoyed by you, you can easily tell. Don't be put down if he says no to your suggestion of hanging out. If you are becoming friends, then there will be plenty of other opportunities!

, Find things you're great at, and praise yourself. It may seem silly, but repeating, ""I'm great at _______, and I'm proud of it,"" in the mirror for ten times a day will help. Guys want to hang around confident people. Who would want to hang around someone who hates themselves?

, Shower frequently and use deodorant. Trim your nails and get your hair cut. Wear clothes you would wear normally. Don’t overdo the makeup and perfume. Some guys hate makeup used in excess, and others are allergic to perfume. But don't look or smell like a slob!

, See if your school has a club that deals with your favorite activity. If you’re home-schooled, there are many businesses like art programs that would love to have you join them. There are guys who go to art programs.

, If he’s in your club, there you go! Instant conversation! If you want to talk about something else, talk about something like:


How gross the lunch was today – “Was there something crawling in the meatloaf surprise?”
How the weather is today. An old standby, but still a great conversation starter.
How the football game went. Many guys like sports, and if you went to or heard about the big game, he would love to talk to you about it.

, If you liked your conversation, tell him you have to go but would love to talk to him again. When you see him again, talk to him! The more you talk, the better bond you’ll grow. It may be embarrassing being seen with a boy if you’re younger, but it pays off. Many friendships grow and bloom, and sometimes even become “something more.”

, Tease him and have fun with him. Just don't go to far or do it too much because he will start to think you're fake. Your friendship will become as strong as ever! Good luck!

, Though we're all a little self conscious, this can be hidden. Show the bold and exciting you and do crazy stuff, just avoid getting into too much trouble.

, When you are picking your clothes out, take some time and effort and choose what you're going to wear. Wear something that is comfortable for you.

, Wave and smile, it's a very polite way to say ""hi"" to someone. The more you do it, the more friends you will have.

, You need to be liked by everyone and well known. Don't turn your nose up at others. Talk to everyone. It makes you seem more interesting than others.

, If you want people to talk to you, don't come across as rude or snobby. Talk to them and show an interest in their hobbies and life.

To understand how to break the subculture rules, you need to know which subculture you belong to in the first place.,
Stoners.,
Now that you know what you are, eliminate all prejudice you have against people from other subcultures.,
Now that you are over your prejudice, strike up a conversation with someone from a different clique, whether they are someone you specifically wanted to be friends with, or you are just looking to broaden your horizons.,
Think over that first conversation, to see if you have anything in common, however small.,
If you think you and this person/people have friend potential, continue to hang out, maybe invite them over.,
OK, so it worked out between you two as friends; but, like The Fox and the Hound, people may be trying to keep you apart, or critical of your friendship.",How to Be Friends with Someone from a Different Subculture," Here are a few descriptions; see which sounds most like you.



Punk. Most people consider a punk to be someone who dresses in spiky, tough-looking, attention-getting clothing, in accordance to the fashion of the punk subculture, associated with punk rock, and listens to intense music, usually the aforementioned punk rock or one of its many offshoots. Perhaps their hair is dyed an unnatural color, perhaps it is several different colors. Whatever the case, the style differs depending on what specific punk sub-genre they belong to the scene of, and it's never hard to spot them in a crowd. They may be teased for looking different, but it varies school to school and punk to punk.

Prep Definition 1. Now, there are two definitions of prep out there at the moment. This is the more traditional, polo shirt wearing type. Preps tend to wear conservative but stylish clothing, from places such as Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, J.Crew, Tommy Hilfiger, Martha LeWren, and Brooks Brothers. They are very polite, upbeat, and classy, though, because of their wealth, they can be mistaken for stuck-up. Preps also tend to be slightly athletic.

Prep Definition 2. This is becoming the standard for 'preppy' in most modern-day public schools. These preps shop at Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, American Eagle, and Aeropostale. They may also have designer bags, and are generally looked upon as being ditsy and perhaps a little stuck-up. They are not true preps like Prep definition 1, they are ""stereotypical"" of how they think a true prep would act. They are like a knockoff""Our Version of Polo"" instead of Polo Assn. Company.They are not wealthy but middle class.

Emo. Emo has recently become one of the most mentioned subcultures ever. An off-shoot on punk, emos tend to wear dark colors, perhaps dye their hair dark, as well. They usually listen to sad, slightly punk music, are very sensitive, and, yes, sometimes cut themselves.

Goth. Goths wear mostly black clothing and tend to dye their hair black if this is not their natural color. Both male and female adherents of this subculture wear dark eyeliner and nail polish. The style of this subculture borrows much from punk, as well as fashion of the Victorian and Elizabethan eras. The most common ""mall goth"", would be wearing Tripp pants, or homemade pants with added metal, and listen to nu-metal.

Mundanes. Normal people who don't really belong to a subculture. They wear basic clothing that is not especially expensive or cheap, not especially trashy or modest. They get decent grades, but not fantastic ones, and perhaps play a sport or two without being too-too obsessed with it. The definition of 'normal' really varies from person to person, but they are generally average looking, and of average talent and intelligence.

Popular. Generally very attractive, wealthy, and hopefully also smart. It really varies school to school what makes a person popular.

Jock. Jocks are people who love sports. They can be either boys or girls, but either way, sports are their life. Their grades and appearances are OK, but it's the sports fields where they really shine.

Nerds. Like the definitions of popular, preppy, and normal, the definition of nerd may vary school to school. Generally, they are smart(or otherwise very talented in one particular subject) and polite, but a little socially awkward and clueless.

Hip-hop. These kids wear clothing from such brands as A Bathing Ape, Rocawear, South Pole, and various sports brands. Some also wear Aeropostale, American Eagle, and occasionally Hollister: these ones generally also fit the second definition of a prep or jock, although the hip-hop subculture has been known to overlap with many others. Their shoes tend to be Nike Dunks, Nike Air Force 1's, or Air Jordan's, although trendier hip hop kids also wear Converse, Vans, and Timberland boots, and those who skateboard may may seen wearing skate shoes. Jeans can range from skinny to baggy on both genders and be from many different styles and brands, depending on what kind of hip-hop kid wears them. They enjoy hip hop and R&B music like Flo Rida to the Gym Class Heroes.They can range from VERY loud to quiet.

Wiggers. They are wannabe ghetto kids. Like definition of Prep two.;
, They love plaid, skinny jeans and usually have longer hair. They enjoy doing drugs and act very laid back and ""chill"". They listen to everything from 60s music to 80s music.


There are many other subcultures out there!

, Maybe you're 'normal', and punks frighten you. Tell yourself that they really are just kids like you with zits to conceal and homework to finish and families to bring glory to. Maybe you're a jock and popular people drive you crazy. Use the same strategy. No matter what you are and what you are up against, remember what everyone has in common:


We're all human. We all have problems, we all have our good points, and, yes, we all need to remember to put on deodorant (though striking up a conversation about that isn't the best idea!). The mere fact that we all have minds, bodies, and feelings, gives us all at least a little common ground.
If you go to school together, chances are you're the same age, have the same teachers, and know a few of the same people. Even the cruddy cafeteria food is a decent start for a conversation.
Besides that, you may have something more specific in common. There are preps out there, both true and twisted, with punky taste in music. Likewise, there are emos who secretly love the way they look in polo shirts (even if those polo shirts are over-sized and black). You never know.

, Talk about something basic and school-related that anyone your age would have something to say about, but don't be boring! Laughter is a good way to break the ice, so if you can add in a funny story or witty comment, great! However, with some of the more sullen, moody subcultures, this could be difficult, so don't feel too rejected if they don't respond much or are otherwise rude. Perhaps they don't have the friend potential you thought they would.

, For example, on My So-Called Life Angela, Rayanne, and Rickie seem very different, but are good friends, because they all feel different somehow, and that helps them relate to each other. Perhaps, even though you and your friend-from-a-different-subculture have different outlooks on fashion, music, etc, you have similar outlooks on life, or a similar sense of humor.

, Don't ignore the differences; trying to picture a prep in skater clothes never ends well; but don't get too hung up on them. Just hang out and have fun.

, Ignore them. To be totally blunt, they're small-minded idiots and not worth a second of your time, energy, or brain space!

Break the ice by inviting her to a sleepover.,
Act like a friend to her.,
Attend parties, sleepovers, and other social gatherings she invites you to.,
If she happens to be friends with people that dislike you, or you dislike them, who cares?,
Keep your cool.,
Avoid being clingy.",How to Become Friends with the Popular Girl (for Girls)," This way, when you start being friendly to her, she will have seen you before and she will be more comfortable with you. Also, those girls could invite you over to a sleepover, along with the popular girl you want to be friends with, and that is a great way to bond with her. Try hanging out with one of her shy friends.


Identify the nicest and friendliest of the popular girls, but make sure she's not the leader - the leader usually isn't very approachable unless you're friends with someone else in her clique. You should make friends with the nice popular girl, but make sure not to use her to get a better social status.;
, Stop thinking of this girl as a popular girl. If you're going to be friends, you can't just use her. Try to think of her as a person who you have heard of and want to be friends with!

, If one day you're totally indifferent and the next day you're clinging on to the popular girls, she'll get creeped out. It's important to be approachable but not clingy and to stay true to yourself.


Don't hang onto the new popular girls desperately. Start out with hanging out with them once a day, then during a break, then during both breaks, then at lockers. Slow and steady wins the race.

, Are purple shirts in? Or is everyone wearing dangling earrings? Try to identify with their style, without changing your entire style. If you're good with fashion, try not to follow the trends, but be a trendsetter based off the style you have noticed the populars preferring.

, This means positive attitude, even when things seem quite the opposite. Everyone wants to be around someone who brightens up their day.

, It shows that you have a great personality.

, It is important that you have a sense of humor.

, Nobody likes a person who listens to all their secrets, then blabs them to the rest of the school.

, If you're in another place for a vacation, bring back keychains or bracelets for the populars. Everybody loves getting souvenirs and gifts.

, Notice what she wears and what her group wears. Imitate the style but try to also own it, by adding your individual elements to it. If she wears clothes that are too expensive for you, find substitutes that are just as good, such as by shopping selectively for one or two good items, visiting thrift and vintage stores and generally dressing with care. The clothing you wear can help get her to begin to notice you more.

, Start off by complimenting her outfit, and doing small things like lending her pencils. Then, start doing bigger things. Offer to be her lab partner when she has no friends in that class, or include her in games with your friends. Then you can start walking next to her in the halls, talking more, and maybe even texting. As long as your friendly and fun, and she likes you, you will find yourself becoming her friend.

,, But don't lie - don't say something that you don't mean. If you like her hair, say ""I love your hair!"" or ""you have beautiful hair!"", be creative. Come up with your own ways to compliment. Everyone appreciates compliments. Don't overdo it, or it will lose its effects. Compliment every now and then; she'll get the idea.

, If you are shy, you have to come out of your shell a bit and strike up a conversation. Greet her when you see her in the hallway. Be extra nice to her, like offer to help her with her assignment, buy her a drink, invite her shopping, etc. She will appreciate it. The more you talk, the better friends you will become with her!

, Make sure the sleepover is fun, not boring. Do things like nails, watch funny movies, baking cookies, and makeovers. You want her to see that you can be a very good friend.

, Sit with her at lunch, talk to her, and be nice. She will see that you are a friend, and start treating you like one.

, Try hosting your own social gatherings. Always be there to support her.

, Don't be discouraged, you can be her friend without having to be friends with all her other friends. Just go for being her friend, and you can be friends with some of her friends that are nice. Besides, if you eventually become like, best friends with her, you will end up ""stealing"" her from the meaner friends and soon she'll like you better than them!

, Don't freak out if you feel nervous, it will take some time to get more confident around her. Also, studies show that looking at a person and then smiling instantly charms them.

, Don't follow her around everywhere, that's creepy. Give her space. If she wants to hang out with her friends and not you, leave it be and come back later. Avoid creating the impression that you're needy and likely to be in her way all the time.

Introduce yourself.,
Become their friend.,
Be an awesome friend for the newbie.,
Stop bullies from bullying them.,
Do not gossip about them when you are away from them.,
Introduce them to your friends and have the newbie become their friend.

,
Help them if they are feeling uncomfortable.,
Do not laugh if they do something wrong.",How to Be Nice to New Kids," Tell them about yourself and your interests. Ask their name, and their interests, etc.;
, Act around nicely, help everyone, do not show any bad behavior or attitude and never leave the new kid out because most of the people do this as they don't know the newbies. Include them with your group when you are hanging out, going for lunch, trips or whatever.

, Show them around, explain the rules and show them all class rooms and give them a map of school so they don't get lost. Show them how to open the lockers and invite them to hang out with you. You could even ask them to come to your house for a party.

, There will always be someone who targets the new kid. If so, ask them to stop right away and do not be afraid to fight back, but do not get mad or you may get in trouble. Clearly explain them it is bad and tell them they are wrong and everyone is not perfect (mostly people bully newbies as they are weak in style or studies or sports, if so, highlight their weakness in front of everyone). If the bullying gets serious, inform your teacher, parent or someone who can handle better than you or your friend.

, If they approach you while you are talking, do not shut up right away.

,, Act like a good friend and to know how to be a really good friend read this.

, Heading to the wrong class or getting scolded because they did not follow rules is normal for them because they are not familiar with the new environment. Comfort them if this happens, and tell them how they can prevent it.

Start with the people around your locker.,
Chat them up!,
Walk together!,
Get to your bus!When you guys are leaving school at the end of the day, walk together to the exit of the building to your buses, or if you walk home, walk home together!

",How to Be Friends with the People Around You1," These are the people who will be right next to you throughout the whole year, so even if you don't have any classes together, you'll still be able to talk. Start off with a simple 'Hi'. If you say this every time between classes/every time you're at your locker, the other person will become accustomed to you and it may lead to further conversation. After a few days, skip saying 'Hi' and see if they greet you first. If they do, it means they want to be your friend!;
, Don't be afraid to start a conversation. While you're getting your books for your next class, ask them what class they have next, and what teacher. Who knows, their third hour may be the same as your first hour! Now you already have something to talk about. If that is the case, ask about the homework at the end of the day or tell them about the lesson plan before they go to that class.

, If you have the same class, or are heading in the same direction, walk together while talking about something. Good topics are teachers, sports, celebrity gossip, homework, food, fashion, boys/girls, pets, etc! You can even plan hanging out together sometime soon.

Say Hi.,
Talk to the person you sit next to.,
Ask about vacation.,
Ask to borrow something.",How to Be Friends with the People Around You2," Simple and easy. Just like that.

, This is the most obvious thing to do. Start a conversation before the bell rings. Ask them what kind of music they're into and what movies they've seen.

, If school just started, or if there was just a vacation break, ask the people who sit by you what they did over break. You can share stories and it's an easy way to make friends!

, Even if you don't need one, it's an easy way to talk to the person sitting next to you. Ask for a piece of paper if you're taking notes, a pen, marker, or highlighter if you're checking homework or highlighting. Or ask for a pencil or eraser.

With a wide variety of interests, you'll likely have something in common with everyone and it'll be easier to hold a conversation and let your relationship bloom. So join the choir. Volunteer at your local hospital. Start painting in your free time. Learn guitar. Join the soccer team. If you've ever wanted to do something, this is a good reason to do it.


Understand the personality of a group you are trying to befriend. Figure out what unites them – is it a shared activity (e.g., debate team, journalism publication, love of performing music) or a harmonious balance of personality traits (talkative, sociable, quiet, etc.)? If you share this unifying quality with the group, then let your interest/personality/whatever it may be shining.;
, When it comes to making new friends, most people are pretty shy. They tend to automatically assume you're not interested in friendship unless you say otherwise. Take a risk, put yourself out there, and ask for their phone number, Twitter or Instagram handle, or friend them on Facebook. Being online friends is the first step to being friends in real life.And then when you have their contact information, you both can invite each other to hang out, or even just make random small talk online. The more you talk to each other, the more comfortable you'll be with each other at school or wherever you naturally meet up.

, Be outgoing and proactive in inviting people to hang out and paying attention to when and where people are gathering. If you want to be friends with everyone, you have to initiate reaching out to groups and be sensitive to their habits. Again, people get nervous and shy around new people. They may want to hang out, but be too timid to ask.


Go out a lot in order to hang out with different groups. However, do know that being friends with everyone can be very time and energy-intensive because you must be friendly, outgoing, and willing to spend time hanging out, leaving yourself very little time to yourself.
Remember, you don't have to be outgoing in order to be a good person; it's perfectly fine to be shy and reserved, and you will make your own friends. However, if your goal is to befriend a wide range of people, you will have to put that effort out there.

, There's a saying that goes something like, ""If you stop going, they'll stop inviting you."" And it makes complete sense – would you keep inviting a friend that turned you down time and time again? So as you're making these friends (especially in the beginning stages), accept the invitations that you get. How else do you expect the friendships to grow?


Remember that each group will be different. They will use different words, find different things funny or respectable, or will have very different ways of ""hanging out."" Observe what is appropriate for each group, and act accordingly, but don't change yourself just to fit in. You are who you are., When you're friends with everyone, you're going to have a lot of information floating around in your head. Is it Haley that likes rock music? Paul and Vinh are the lacrosse players? When you're with your new friends (or soon-to-be friends) use their name, ask them about something you know about them, and just smile. They'll feel special seeing that you remembered so much about them.


One of the easiest things you can do to make good friends is to smile and just be happy. Make jokes, laugh, and help the group have a good time. Once they realize that you're a fun person to be around, you all will become friends.

, Making small talk with people don't know very well is one of the hardest parts of new friendships. To get to talking, simply make a comment on what's around the both of you or the occasion. Talk about your teacher's droning voice, or how you can't believe that cute person in homeroom is wearing that outfit. It doesn't have to be much – the conversation will get better and better from there.


Even ""Man, I love this song!"" can get the ice breaking. When the two of you start singing at the top of your lungs, it's an immediate bonding moment.

, To get the ball rolling even further, start asking the person or people you're talking to the open-ended question that they can't just answer with a ""yes"" or ""no,"" as one-word answers will stop any conversation in its tracks. What do they think of the big event coming up? Who do they know that's coming?


Ask people what their plans are for the weekend. If something seems appropriate for you to join, you can express interest in the activity and see if they extend an invitation. If not, you must take a call about whether you should put yourself on the line and explicitly ask to come. Be careful about always tagging along -- it can annoy some people., When's the last time someone looked you in the eye, smiled, and asked, 'How are you?' and actually meant it? A genuine listener is pretty hard to come by, especially these days when everyone's eyes are attached to their phones. When they're talking, give them your attention. They'll feel it and appreciate it.


Being interested in another person is one of the best ways to show someone you like them and make them feel like they matter. Even if they're just complaining about their mom, support them. Help them laugh about it. Everyone needs a shoulder from time to time, and you could be that shoulder.

, In addition to getting people feeling good about themselves, compliments are a great ice breaker, too. ""Hey, I love those shoes! Where did you get them?"" is an easy way to start a conversation. It could be one of the highlights of their day. Who knows?


Think about your friends. Which ones do you associate with positivity and which with negativity? It probably doesn't take you too long to come up with your answer. Here's a heads up: you want to be associated with positivity, and giving compliments is a way to do just that.

, You have a lot of friends now. Once you have them on your side, the main battle is going to be making time for them. If you have a set schedule, great. Monday is for your choir friends, Tuesday is for soccer, and so forth. Just make sure if you haven't seen a friend in a while to give them a call!


This is the main downside to being friends with everyone – they all want a piece of your time. If it starts to burn you out, don't ignore it. Take some time to yourself and refuel. Your real friends will be patient and there when you're ready.

, Being friends with everyone isn't about being in the popular clique or demanding respect by being snooty, it's about being likeable and being a good friend. If you want everyone to like you, act like someone you would like. What kind of friend do you picture everyone liking?


A good place to start is by being considerate and helpful. If someone missed a day in class, offer your notes. Do they need a ride somewhere? That's an opportunity, too. Who knows? When you need a favour, they may pay it back.

, Most of us battle with self-image issues and we all have days where we don't feel great about ourselves. But when we meet someone who comes along and who wants to be our friend and who makes life a little more fun, it's easy to perk up. Make your new friends feel good by actively saying you want to hang out, complimenting them, and going out of your way to be friends. Text them randomly, send notes, and just let them know you're on their side.


Even just being there for them can change their life. Recent studies have shown that having one good friend can not only make you incredibly happier, but it can also lengthen your life. What's more, one good friend is the equivalent in happiness of $100,000 a year.You just being there for them is quite the gift.

, Realize that in the process of being friends with (nearly) everyone, you will encounter people with all sorts of personalities, attitudes, opinions and interests. You need to make yourself open-minded and pleasant enough such that you can get along with all of these varying people, even if you may not 100% agree with them on everything. Concentrate on their good qualities and what you like about them – not what you disagree about.


Be a respectful person so you can respectfully agree to disagree when differences come along. You don't necessarily have to suppress your views or opinions, but make sure that you're not expressing them in an offensive or harmful way towards others.

, Since you have so many friends, sometimes it's naturally going to be difficult to keep up the friendship. What's more, friends naturally come and go – most research says half of any social circle dissipates in 7 years. If you found some friends you want to keep close by, put the work in. Invite them to things for no reason, call them, and stay connected. It's a two-way street, after all.


And if your friends are far away from you, you'll need to put in more work. Studies show, though it's completely logical, that far-away friendships fall apart more quickly and tend to get replaced by local friendships. So keep up the texting, the Facebooking, and the phone calls. You two can still be there for each other if you need it.

, While it may make for an interesting two-minute conversation, you never know whom you might be offended and what bridges you're burning. Also, if you're always badmouthing others, people pick up on that and will be more hesitant about you – how do they know that you're not bad-mouthing them when they're not around?


Be a pleasant person, follow the golden rule (treat others the way you would like to be treated), and the friends will come flocking.

, If you notice that you are routinely left out of plans, or don't hear about things until the event is over, realize that people may be subtle but intentionally trying to exclude you. While you may see this as a hurtful act, others do not have the obligation to be your friend, and if they feel that your personality doesn't jive with the rest of theirs, it's their prerogative to decide whether to include you. Forget about trying too hard to join that group and move on to find other friends.


If you find yourself having to ask every weekend what someone is up to in order to be a part of a group, switch it up and contact someone else in the group whom you know. Alternatively, invite the person to hang out and see what they say. If your invitation conflicts with existing plans, they may invite you to join them. If your invitation to hang out falls before an existing plan, you too may end up going to the group activity together.

Sit next to him in class.,
Figure out what to say.,
Start a conversation.,
Find common interests.",How to Make a Boy Like You in School1," Even if your teacher doesn’t allow much chatter, your odds of talking to him are increased if you’re in his vicinity. You will be able to interact with him more often than if you were on opposite sides of the room (you may need to borrow a pencil, or pass handouts to each other). If you don’t have class with him, make an effort to say “hi” when you see him in the hallway. The more he is around you, the more likely he is to eventually develop feelings.If your teacher doesn’t allow you to choose your own seats, just try to sit near him in the cafeteria or hang out with him during breaks.
By sitting near him, you will also be able to use body language to attract him, which will be explained later.;
, It can be intimidating to just start chatting up someone you have a crush on, but it will definitely get his attention. To minimize your nerves and help ensure a smooth interaction, it’s helpful to plan a few things you want to say to him. Whether it’s a question about the homework assignment, a comment about an upcoming project, or something completely unrelated to school, it is helpful to have a game plan.


Make sure you don’t sound too rehearsed. The more natural and casual you seem, the better.
Rather than saying, “Hello. I remember you enjoy . Did you watch the episode last night ?”, try to keep it casual and say something like, “Oh hey, you watch right ? Did you catch last night’s episode?”

, By initiating an interaction, it will show him that you’re both friendly and interested in getting to know him better. Remind yourself that, no matter how great he seems, you are just as great! Let your personality shine, and show him the great traits that your friends and family see.


Try to shake off your nerves, or at least not let him see them. The more comfortable you seem, the smoother the conversation will go. Don’t build it up to be a stressful or scary event in your head– it’s simply a conversation.
Start the conversation with something like, “Are you excited about this project coming up?” When he answers, you can start to tell him about your project ideas.
If you want to talk about something outside of school, you can mention a show you know he watches or a team he roots for. Saying something like, “Did you watch the last night? That was so !” is a great way to start a conversation and show him you have common interests.

, If you know you cheer for the same sports team or watch the same weekly television shows, bring that up in conversation. If you saw he ate your favorite flavor of chips for lunch, say something. It doesn’t matter what it is — common interests or hobbies are great ways to start conversations that can lead to other things. If he sees similarities in you, he will be more likely to like you!If you don’t know of any common interests, make some. If he wore a band t-shirt to school, listen to their music and mention it in conversation. If you see him reading a book, borrow a copy and put it on your desk. Get resourceful and find a way to connect.
At the same time, don't fake it. If you don't like the book you noticed he was reading, don't pretend you did. Instead, try a different one by the same author. Then you can say something like, ""Oh you're reading ? That one wasn't my favorite, but I just read her new one. It was really good — you can borrow it when you're done reading that one, if you want."" Or, just look for something else you have in common. You may not like the same music, for instance, but you may both love horror movies.

Face him.,
Smile.,
Make physical contact, when appropriate.,
Mirror him.",How to Make a Boy Like You in School2," Turning your body towards his is a welcoming and friendly gesture, and can warm a person up to us without them even realizing you’re doing anything. When you speak to him, make sure your legs are pointing towards him. If you’re in a chair, swivel your body so you’re facing him. If you’re standing in a circle and he approaches, turn your body so that it’s angled toward him. Try to keep your body angled toward wherever he is.Don’t make a spectacle of yourself trying to maneuver your body toward him. Keep it subtle and only do it when it can appear natural.

, Happiness is an incredibly attractive feature, and a big smile is sure to catch his eye. You don’t have to plaster a giant grin on your face, but try to smile as much as you possibly can in his presence. When your teacher makes a small joke, when your friend asks to borrow a pencil, whenever. Just show him that you’re a happy, upbeat person.Fake smiles are pretty easy to spot. Try to make your smile look genuine and real by thinking of something funny or happy. You don't need to be smiling 24/7, but just make sure to flash authentic smiles whenever you can, and whenever it seems natural.

, No, you don’t need to give him a giant kiss on the cheek when you say hello or rub his back while he’s doing homework. Instead, find ways to casually touch him. When he makes a joke, brush his arm while you laugh.


If you need his attention, tap your hand on his back. If you’re sitting side my side, you can lightly touch your knee to his. If he’s passing a paper to you, graze his hand when you take it.
Don’t be overly aggressive. The smallest physical contact can get a guy’s attention., This is a subtle little trick to make you seem interested and likable to your crush. Again, it’s a simple way to make him feel connected and welcomed by you. Watch his body language, and mimic it. If he leans towards you, lean into him. If he leans up against a locker, lean up against a locker. If he runs a hand through his hair, wait a few seconds, then do the same. It’s really simple, and it’s really effective.Be sure to allow a three to four second delay before mirroring his action. You don't want to literally mime him — that will look more strange than endearing.

"
"
Invite him to things.,
Create opportunities to be with him.,
Make mutual friends.,
Be honest.,
Let him speak and respect his feelings.",How to Make a Boy Like You in School3," It doesn’t have to be any sort of romantic invitation. You can ask him to see a movie with a whole group of people, or work on some homework together. You can even ask if he just wants to meet up at a school sporting event or another local event in town. It doesn’t matter what the invitation is — what matters is that you’re showing interest and getting to spend time with him outside of school.If he rejects your invitation once, don’t worry. Sometimes guys are shy, and sometimes they have other obligations. If he rejects two more invitations, then consider moving on. There are plenty of other guys to pursue.

, Sometimes, there simply might not be anything fun to invite him to. Create a way to spend extra time with him. If you walk home from school every day, maybe you can change your route a bit so that you can walk with him. Ask him to study with you or work on a project together if you're in the same class. Join him in whatever activity he does during breaks. You might have to get a bit creative, but you should certainly be able to find ways to get extra face time with your crush.

, This is key. If your crush spends all of his time with a certain group of people, it can be really helpful to befriend them. By joining his social circle, you’ll increase your odds of seeing him at social events outside of school. Of course, this doesn’t mean to ditch your current friends or use his friends to get to this boy. It simply means to get to know his friends and, if you enjoy their company, make a little extra effort to become friends.


Sit next to his friends in class and start a conversation. If he has girl friends, compliment them on something, like their outfit or backpack. If you're having a party, make sure you invite his friends and not just him. Go out of your way to make his friends see you as a friendly, warm person.

, Tell him that you like him. It’s best to do this if you think he’s returned your flirty vibes, and you’ve developed a level of comfort around each other. Let your friendship grow a little bit before revealing your crush, just so he doesn’t feel overwhelmed or totally caught off guard. Not only will he be impressed that you had the confidence to tell him your feelings outright, he will also be flattered. Who wouldn’t?Some signs that he might be into you include initiating physical closeness, laughing at jokes or having inside jokes with you, gently teasing you, blushing around you, making an effort to be around you, and asking you questions about yourself.
You don’t need to make this a serious, sit-down chat in which you pour out your heart. All you need to do is tell him what you think about him, or what makes you like being around him. Keep it casual.
Do this when you’re able to talk to him alone. It’s OK if you’re with a group of people, just try to find a time to break apart and talk to him one-on-one.
Say something like, “I have so much fun hanging out with you. I think you’re really funny and smart, and I like you as more than a friend.”

, You’ve put your cards on the table, and now you can give him the opportunity to do the same. Simply ask something like, “So, do you think you may have a bit of a crush on me?” It sounds terrifying, but it could make the difference.He may be shy, so respect that he might not be comfortable answering you. Don't pressure him or demand a certain answer.


While a “no” answer might be upsetting at first, it will save you time and more hurt feelings in the future. You can move on, and you can stop giving energy and time to a boy who doesn’t reciprocate feelings.

By using good communication and problem solving skills, you can keep your friendship healthy.



Actively listen to your friend.

Make compromises so that you’re both happy.;
, When you have a disagreement with your friend, you can experience strong intense emotions. This often leads to hurt feelings, disappointment, and discomfort. When you are unable to work through your issues, you may be left feeling hurt. Instead, work with your friend to resolve your issues so that you can build trust and a deeper, stronger bond between the both of you., After you have had an argument with a friend, you should consider giving it some time before you try to talk to them again. People tend to say hurtful things when emotions are high. Allow each party some time to relax before reaching out to your friend again.Allow two to three days for you and your friend to calm down before trying to reach out to your friend.

, It is normal and healthy to confide in someone when something is really bothering you. While you give your friend some time to cool down, take some time to vent your feelings and frustrations to a trusted friend or family member. You will feel much better once you have received some advice and validation.For example, if you friend said something hurtful to you about your weight, you might confide in another friend by saying, “It really made me angry when Anna pointed out that I had gained weight.”

, Once you have taken a few days to calm down, writing a letter to your friend is a good first step when reaching out after an argument. You can write to them by email, social media, or snail mail. Though reaching out can be difficult, you should avoid waiting too long to reach out to your friend. The longer you go without talking to your friend the harder it will be to repair the relationship., Reconnect with your friend with a phone call or text message. Have a conversation about your parting ways. Suggest that you get together for lunch or coffee to continue the conversation in person. If distance has put a strain on your friendship, consider scheduling regular phone calls to keep in touch.Discuss why you parted ways and why you are interested in rekindling the friendship.
Address any hurt feelings or concerns that you may have.

Ask yourself why you want a boyfriend.,
Define what dating means to you.,
Look at your schedule to see if you have enough time for a relationship.,
Determine what your personal goals and dreams are.,
Watch out for red flags from potential suitors.,
Be honest with yourself about your feelings.",How to Know When It's the Right Age to Have a Boyfriend1," Whatever your age, knowing why you want something, like a boyfriend, is a good place to start. You don’t want to jump into a relationship or say yes to dating a guy without thinking or just because you think it might be fun. Relationships take maturity and work so it’s best to first think about what you’re getting into.


There are good reasons and bad reasons for wanting a boyfriend.Companionship and a partner to share life with are good reasons for wanting to seriously date one specific person.
If you feel unhappy or incomplete, keep in mind that a person can’t fulfill that for you.
Boyfriends can be a temporary cure for boredom or loneliness, but expecting them to be perfect and always there for you is not realistic since they are imperfect, just like you.;
, If you want to one day settle down and marry someone special, then having a boyfriend is a good way to learn about being in a serious, committed relationship. But if you just want to have fun getting to know a bunch of guys, then being exclusive with a boy may not be the best idea.


Your ideas about dating will affect how you treat a boyfriend.
If you want to get married, you will expect more loyalty and long term plans out of a boyfriend than if you just wanted to date a lot of guys and weren’t worried about being too serious., Having a boyfriend is going to take up a lot of your time. In all honesty, you might be too busy with school, friends, sports, clubs and hobbies, or even trying to get a good night’s sleep to add another thing into your life.


Committing a few hours or days a week to spending time with a boyfriend is about the average time you'll need to set aside.Don’t neglect your friendships or family. Dating can take up a lot of your time and you don’t want to be the person who disappears while they’re in a relationship and then resurfaces only when a break-up happens.However, technology makes it easy to have a boyfriend and still have a life outside of the relationship. You can text, call, or video call if you don’t have time to spend together face to face.

, As an individual, you likely have plans for your life. For example, you may want a career, or you might want to be married and have kids. A boyfriend can either help you reach these goals or hinder you, you just need to decide how dating will affect your plans.Remember that you have time to figure things out. You’re never too old to start dating and you’re never too old to figure out what you want to do with your life.Don’t worry about not having enough time. There will be plenty of boys to date so you don’t need to feel desperate about being alone or the only one in your friend group without a boyfriend.

, Being pressured to date by a guy or even by your friends is not a good reason to have a boyfriend. You don’t want to compromise your own boundaries and comfort just because everyone else has a boyfriend. Your safety and emotional health is more important that having an unhealthy relationship.


Don’t let anyone guilt you into thinking you have to have a boyfriend.
A simple ""No, thank you"" or ""I'm not interested in dating right now"" can help deter anyone who wants to ask you out if you don't feel ready.
If you’re ever feeling pressured by a guy friend or a boyfriend, especially about sex, you have the right to step away from that relationship and say no.

, If there’s a boy who wants to date you, truthfully consider if you like him back or if you’re just flattered that he’s showing you attention. However, warm, fuzzy feelings can be the start to a relationship if you feel a connection. If that's the case, dating is an opportunity to learn more about another person one on one.You always have the option to group date to help take the pressure off the both of you. One on one time can be daunting and can also invite physical temptations, so you may want to start going on dates with a boy in a group with friends.
Be careful not to accept dates out of pity or start a relationship that way. It will end up hurting both you and the boy in the end.

Apologize for your wrongdoing.,
Avoid unhealthy responses.,
Accept apologies.,
Let go of the past.,
Discuss a way forward.",How to Be Friends Again2," It is easy to see where the other person is wrong. It is difficult to admit to your own wrongdoing after a disagreement. Determine what it is that you did wrong and how you can fix it. Then, reach out to your friend with an apology.For example, you may feel like you weren’t listening to your friend’s complaints. You may say to them, “I’m sorry for being a poor listener when you were trying to talk to me.”
Don’t expect to receive an apology in return. Your friend may not believe that they owe you an apology.

, As you work through a disagreement, it’s easy to fall on unhealthy responses, but they won’t help you fix your friendship. Unhealthy responses include refusing to acknowledge your friend’s point-of-view, reacting with anger, withdrawing from your friend, and fearing that the worst will happen. If you catch yourself doing these behaviors, choose a healthy response instead.

Listen to your friend’s concerns, then repeat back what you heard to see if that’s what they meant. Don’t argue with their feelings; instead, tell them that you understand how they feel before you share your side.
Stay calm when talking to your friend, and don’t put all of the blame on them, even if you feel like it’s their fault. Try taking a deep breath or counting to 10 before you speak.
Reach out to your friend to talk through your issues.
Remember why you’re friends in the first place. Trust that your friend wants to work things out, too.

, If your friend is ready to apologize, allow them the space to do it. Listen to everything they have to say and truly accept their apology. Don’t grant your friend forgiveness until you are really ready to forgive them., Letting go of the past is a long, ongoing process. In order to let go of the past you must be willing to change your attitude. Be ready to truly forgive your friend and move past the disagreement. Don’t hold those wrongdoings over your friend’s head forever. Avoid getting hung up on who was at fault., Talk to your friend about what you need from them in order to mend the friendship. Then, ask for them to tell you what they need out of the friendship. When they talk to you, be sure to actively listen.

Spend time together.,
Be dependable.,
Set boundaries.",How to Be Friends Again3," Find time to commit to your friend again. In order to rebuild your trust and friendship, you will need to spend time together again. If you are unsure about how much time you should spend together, consider taking it slowly. You will begin to feel a sense of loyalty to your friend again., Part of being a good friend is being a dependable friend. Listen to your friend when they are confiding in you. Be available to them when they need you. Stick to your commitments and do what you say that you are going to do. Being dependable is very important in repairing broken trust in a friendship.For example, if you have agreed to take a weekly yoga class with your friend, be sure to make every effort to keep that commitment.

, Know what your core beliefs and values are. Use these to help you set boundaries within a friendship. Be sure to articulate these boundaries with your friend. Ask your friend to do the same. This will help to prevent harmful words or actions in the future.For example, you might set a boundary regarding comments about how you raise your children. If your friend knows up front that criticizing your parenting could result in an argument, they may choose not to discuss it.

Talk to your parents for their opinion or rules.,
Ask your friends for advice but don’t give into peer pressure.,
Listen to older couples about their dating experiences.",How to Know When It's the Right Age to Have a Boyfriend2," Before you decide completely about having a boyfriend, ask your parents about their rules for you about dating. They might suggest you wait until you’re in high school, even even after graduating high school. You might not be able to decide if you can have a boyfriend right now if they want you to focus on school or other things.When you talk to your parents, be sure to ask about curfew, if you can drive with your boyfriend, if you should group date first, or if they have any other specific rules for you.Some good questions to ask your parents could include: ""When did you start dating?"" and ""Do you wish you had waited to start dating?""
Your parents have your best interest at heart, so you should try and respect their wishes even if you don’t agree with them.
To help convince them, if there’s a certain boy you want to date, bringing him around to meet your parents might help your case.
Your parents may have a better idea of your maturity level. And listening to them is a great way to prove to them that you are mature enough to make grown-up decisions., It can be easy to get caught up in the thrill of dating and hearing about your friends' boyfriends and want one yourself. Just keep in mind that just because everyone is doing something, doesn't mean it's the best idea.


If your friends aren’t dating yet because of their parent’s rules or everyone still hangs out in groups together, maybe you don’t need to break away yet and have one on one time with a boy.
Ask your friends if you can hang out with them and their significant other to get an idea of what it's like to date at your age.
But, if your friends are happily established with significant others, you may be on the same maturity level as them and can handle having a boyfriend.Just make sure that whatever you decide, you make the decision for yourself and not for your friends.
Be careful. Just because your friends might all have boyfriends, doesn’t mean you have to have one. You might be old enough, but don’t feel pressured to just accept any boy’s offer for a date just because you want a boyfriend.

, Find an older married couple or a dating couple who have been together a long time. Ask about their love story and about how they met. Hearing about other couples’ experiences may help you decide if you want to wait to have a boyfriend or if you’re ready to jump right in.You may find that you want to wait for someone special to ask you out, or you may have even found that person already.
Older couples will have more experience in a relationship. They’ll be a better source of advice, not your friend who has a different boyfriend every week.
Ask questions such as: ""When did you meet your spouse?"" or ""Do you think courting is a better idea than dating?"" or ""What kind of dates did you do on?""

Consider the culture you grew up in.,
Observe the area that you currently live in.,
Talk with a mentor about having a boyfriend.",How to Know When It's the Right Age to Have a Boyfriend3," You might have a family background where all of the girls married their high school sweethearts. Or, you might come from a culture where you don’t have multiple boyfriends but court with the intention of marrying someone. Take note of your own personal background when deciding if it’s time for a serious relationship with a boy.


Your religion or culture might have specific opinions on things like sex or birth control. While it may sound fun to rock the boat and do something rebellious, keep in mind that the rules you know might be in place to keep you safe.
Remember, you are your own person and can have your own ideas and opinions.
However, it may be in your best interest to respect the rules and culture around you.
Whether you choose to go along with what everyone around you is doing or go off on your own about having a boyfriend, keep in mind that your choices will still impact others.

, Your own town or school might have different ideas about dating or when it’s best for a girl to have a serious boyfriend. You can go along with those practices if you want, but keep in mind that just because everyone is doing something, doesn’t mean that it’s the best idea for you.


For example, if all the boys in church group don’t date until they want to get married, it’s best to wait for them to ask you out instead of trying to force a relationship.

, Someone like a pastor, priest, or guidance counselor can be a good resource and person to talk to if you’re ever in a difficult situation. Sometimes it's best to wait to have a boyfriend if marriage is the main focus of your family's culture or religion.


Some organizations or even schools sometimes have rules about dating. It’s best to respect those guidelines about relationships so you don’t get yourself into trouble.It may seem fun to be rebellious or edgy, but having a boyfriend for the sake of breaking rules or making a point is unhealthy.

If he points his shoulders and pelvis towards you while sitting, he is definitely feeling something for you.;
, If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him.

, If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.

See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else.

, Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction, and helps them know if you really do like them or not. You can tell that they are trying to make you jealous if they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend to look out for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you.

, For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you introduce him to a TV show that he didn't really know about and that becomes his new favorite thing, that's a sign that he likes you.

, Signs of nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, or possibly even looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he likes.

, smiles at you a lot in the hallway, work, etc., at least go out for a walk.)

, If he mimics you, he probably likes you, such as if you move to another table, he'll go with you.

, If a guy teases you a lot, it might mean he likes you, but if he doesn't tease any other girl, he probably does like you.

, If you do your hair or makeup differently one day, and the guy notices, that's a very good sign that he likes you. Most guys won't notice, and if they do, they won't say anything unless they're into you. Anything like, ""You look nice today,"" ""I like that shirt,"" or even ""Did you do your hair differently today? It looks nice,"" are all indicators that he could be interested in you. NOTE: If he's a good friend of yours, these won't necessarily be indicators of romantic interest. It could just be him being a good friend. Not all guys are this straightforward about compliments, so don't be worried if he doesn't compliment you.

, For example, some of your dad's aftershave rubbed off on you when you hugged him. Your crush may say 'is that aftershave on you?' This indicates he thinks it is from another guy (and not your dad!)

, If he chats with you often he may like you. He could also just be talkative and friendly so don't assume he's into you for chatting. He may put 'x' on the end of everything he says to you. That might not necessarily mean he likes you. It could just mean that you are good friends. If he says, ""I know something you don't know,"" then this could mean that he likes you and wants you to be guessing. He might also want you to know and wants to see if you feel the same way. Or it could just mean he knows something you don't know, e.g. a new colour, the fact that he has a new friend, etc.

, For example, if you're on table 1, talking to your friends, watch to see if he is close nearby. So when the conversation end, and you go to say, table 7, see if he follows you, but of course does not follow you to table 7 unless he is good friends with the people at table 7 and wants to talk to them coincidentally. Check to see if he stands at a different place when you are at table 1 and 7 to make sure he is following you.

If she avoids looking at you entirely, this can be just as strong a sign she's interested. Another sign could be she is looking straight at the clock, whiteboard, or talking to her friends to distract herself but she will look in all directions in the room except avoid looking your way.;

Balance the areas of your life.,
Work on your confidence.",How to Impress a School Girl1," It's hard to be impressive to anyone if you don't take care of your hygiene first. Make sure you keep your hair and facial hair well groomed. Shower regularly, with body wash, shampoo,and conditioner. Never forget to brush your teeth because girls hate bad breath. Trim your nails and keep them dirt free. It's those kind of details that girls especially will notice., The way you dress can make you stand out, in either a good way or a bad way, so pay close attention to your fashion choices. There's no right or wrong style, but have one. Your clothes are an expression of yourself, so think carefully about what you're expressing with your choice in dress. However if at your school you have to wear a school uniform most schools hold school discos where you can dress however you want!Even though there's no such thing as a right or wrong style, there are guidelines you can follow. For example, dirty clothes give off a certain impression, and it's not a good one, so keep your clothes washed and clean.
Also, try to avoid dressing inappropriately for the occasion. What you wear to school should be different from what you wear to a fancy dinner or a music recital.
Unless you're going for a specific look and you know what you're doing, stick to clothes that fit well. Baggy jeans and oversized shirts aren't typically very flattering.

, Having interests makes you a more interesting person. Think about what you like to do, what interests you, and find ways to pursue those things more. If you're into sports you should look into joining a team. If you're into chess you should see if your school has a chess club. It doesn't matter what your passions are, just as long as you have them and find ways to cultivate them., Contrary to common sense, it's the people who are well-rounded, rather than the people who focus all their energy in one part of their life, who stand out the most. Don't let your social life get too much in the way of your academic life, and vice versa. Balance your time outside of school between quality family time, studying time, extracurricular time, and social time.

If you've got problems with your confidence, work on it by getting better at things you like to do, and When you do things you're good at, it makes you feel good about yourself, and that will give you confidence. Confidence in one area of life will spill over into others. Find your talents, interests, and passions, and improve yourself in those areas to build confidence.
The other way to build confidence is simply to fake it until you make it. Pretend to be more confident in social settings than you are, and eventually you won't have to fake it.

Observe small compliments.,
Pay attention to how she talks.,
Give the girl you like compliments.,
Listen for laughter.,
Take note of volume and pitch.,
Ask through a mutual friend.",How to Know if a Shy Girl Likes You at School2," It might not seem like a big deal to you when she compliments your new sneakers, but her noticing changes in your outfit or appearance and complimenting you could be her way of showing you she's interested enough in you to pay attention., Many shy people are worried about saying the wrong thing, which sometimes leads to quietness around a crush. Oppositely, nervousness at being close to a crush might cause a shy girl to be a little more chatty. In either case, research has shown that if she responds to you smoothly and quickly, she likely is interested in some kind of relationship with you., Small praise has a profound effect on people, but this effect is more pronounced with potential romantic partners.Does your girl light up when you pay her simple praise? She may be crushing on you.

, When she peppers your conversation with pleasant laughter at your wit and charm, it could mean she wants you to like her.Listen for frequency. Laughing more with you than others could be a love letter from her subconscious.

, Notes in lower registers are subconscious attempts at showing off, which makes a dreamy or husky quality in her voice a good sign for you!She may be loud around others, but quiet around you. These are often hints she is interested.

, Shy people frequently fear direct confrontation, so asking her if she has feelings for you through a note passed on through a friend or in a message that friend relates to her could save you from unnecessary detective work.Remember, she will find out that you asked, and sometimes people use this information to pick on other. There is nothing wrong with asking someone if they like you.


Remember that some shy girls are very reserved and may keep their crush a secret, even from their best friends. It's important that you take time to read your situation to see if this kind of inquiry is a good decision.

Ease her into conversation.,
Share regular conversation with her.,
Use soft communication styles when asking direct questions.,
Try asking her out.",How to Know if a Shy Girl Likes You at School3," Since she's a shy girl, it is important during this stage that you don't force her to talk with you. She might need time to adjust to being around you or to speaking with you, and rushing her into conversation could cause her stress.When checking to see if she likes you, first talk about low-stakes topics, like the weather, teachers, classmates, or daily life. Be patient and it is likely she will become more comfortable with you.


It might take time before she's ready to break out of her shell, so be persistent if she is even slightly responsive.

, Studies have found that people naturally speak more around those that they like and have romantic interest in.When you share conversations with her that go on and on, or if you find her more conversant around you, take this as a sign of interest. Also, speaking with her more should put her more at ease around you, which will make asking her out less difficult. Some topics you can use to get her started include:


Future plans
Hobbies and sports
Family
Favorite class
Dream job

, After weeks of wondering, ""Does she like me?"" you might be ready to ask, but with a shy girl, this might not be the best decision. Try to approach whatever question is on your mind in a way that gives an escape if the question is too uncomfortable.Whatever you do, do not comment on how shy she is, as this could make her even more self-conscious and less willing to talk.Instead of asking, ""Want to go to a movie with me?"" you might instead mention, ""That movie looks really great. I was hoping to see it next week when it comes out, but I don't have anyone to go with.""

, If you see a lot of the signs and signals of romance in your relationship with her, and you believe that she likes you, trust your instincts. And remember, though rejection is rarely enjoyable, if you never try, you'll never have a chance of finding that special someone.

Start establishing a friendship.,
Ask her about herself.,
Use humor.,
Be real and honest in front of her.,
Flirt to impress.",How to Impress a School Girl2," If this girl isn't someone you're already on friendly terms with, start with ""hi"" and take it from there. Don't overthink this, just start a conversation. Then as you see her around school, talk to her and start to get to know her. Ask her if she'd like to join you during lunchtime. Tell her you're going to see a movie with some friends and ask if she'd like to go. Something like this will also give you an excuse to get her number., When you talk to the girl you're trying to impress, be interested in getting to know her more deeply. Ask her questions that show this interest. It's hard not to take notice of someone who seems genuinely interested in your life and what you have to say. Ask her about her family, her interests, what she wants in the future, anything like that, and then let her steer the conversation.Just be careful not to turn the conversation into an interview. You shouldn't be asking questions constantly, like this is some kind of interrogation. Let the questions be open-ended, and insert comments about how you can relate to what she's saying as the conversation continues.

, Girls want guys who can make them laugh. If you want to stand out to a particular girl, making her laugh should be one of your main tools. In group settings this means taking risks by making funny comments when they come to you, and teasing your friends and the girl you like in a playful way. When alone with her, you can flex your funny bone by making funny observations about something around you, and telling humorous stories about your life., Don't try to impress her by pretending to be someone else. She can sense it. Openness and sincerity can be very impressive. When you're alone with the girl you like, try to steer the conversation in a more personal direction sometimes. Talk about things dear and important to you. Just make sure you don't do too much of the talking., There's no better way to get someone's romantic attention than to flirt. Good flirting skills are impressive because so few people, especially school aged, have them. Look her in the eyes when talking to her. Send deep gazes her way every once and a while. Compliment her when you have the opportunity.Other examples of flirting include: finding reasons to innocently touch her, like hugging goodbye, and teasing her in a friendly way.

Be chivalrous.,
Get to know her friends and family.,
Take the initiative.,
Be romantic.",How to Impress a School Girl3," Chivalry might be slowly becoming outdated, but as it stands today, plenty of girls still find acts of chivalry impressive. There are plenty of ways to do small chivalrous things that make your girl feel special, for example:Pull her chair out for her when sitting down at a restaurant.
Open doors for her.
Help her take off her coat.

, Don't give all of your attention to your girlfriend when you're hanging out with her friends or at her house when her family is around. Socialize with her friends. Try to establish a friendly rapport with them. If you're at her place for dinner with her folks, offer to help clean up, or set up the table. Impress her friends and family, and you'll impress her., It may be a stereotype that girls want guys who take most of the initiative, but it's a stereotype for a reason. While the last thing you should do is try to control her life, most girls appreciate it when their boyfriend puts effort into things like planning dates, finding things to do on the weekend, and just generally being decisive.Sometimes this can be as simple as deciding quickly where the two of you should sit at lunch, or where you should go to eat.

, Celebrate moments of joy, achievements and birthdays with her. Look for ways to go out of your way to show that you care. This can be as simple as surprising her with flowers, or as grand as planning a romantic home-cooked dinner.Don't forget to celebrate your anniversaries together. It never hurts to surprise your girl with a small present for your one month or six month anniversary.

Stay hydrated.,
Don’t drink soda.,
Balance calcium and oxalate-rich foods.,
Avoid consuming too much sodium.,
Cut back on animal protein.,
Maintain a healthy weight.",How to Control the Risk of Kidney Stone in Women1," Drinking lots of water (roughly 8-10 glasses per day) will help you eliminate the different kinds of wastes that can build up and develop into kidney stones. Proper hydration will also help you keep your urine’s PH level balanced, which will reduce the risk of forming phosphate-based kidney stones.


If you have an especially active lifestyle or live in a hot climate, drinking more water will be necessary to stay properly hydrated.;
, Diets high in soda are associated with an increased risk of kidney stones due to their high sugar and phosphate content.

, One of the most common kinds of kidney stone forms when too much calcium or oxalate builds up in the renal system. These are known as calcium-oxalate stones. Calcium is typically found in dark green vegetables, dairy products, and animal protein. Oxalate (or oxalic acid) is a compound that generally comes from plants. Both are healthy in moderation. Keeping your intake of dietary calcium and oxalate balanced will cause the calcium and oxalate to bind to each other in the intestines, reducing the amount of either that the kidneys will absorb.


The most commonly-consumed oxalate-rich foods are chocolate, rhubarb, tea, spinach, strawberries, wheat bran, nuts, and beets.
Don’t restrict your calcium intake too much. Low levels of calcium can also lead to kidney stones.

, Too much sodium in the diet may increase your calcium level to a point where you will run a higher risk of developing kidney stones.


Talk to your doctor to determine an appropriate level of sodium for your diet.
Processed foods such as hot dogs, canned soups, lunchmeats, and fast foods frequently contain high levels of sodium.

, Eating too much animal protein may increase the amount of calcium in your body, as well as uric acid, which can collect in the kidneys and turn into stones. Although overconsumption of animal protein is a greater risk factor for kidney stones in men than in women, it is probably safest to avoid it no matter what.Red meats, organ meats, and shellfish are particularly high-risk forms of animal protein. They contain high levels of purines, which are substances that can increase uric acid content in urine. These foods, along with poultry, also reduce your production of citrate, which can stop stones from forming.

, Obesity is another serious risk factor for developing kidney stones, particularly in women.Calculating your Body Mass Index (or BMI) is a good starting point to determining if you are at a healthy weight for your height.A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.

Visit your primary care physician.,
Review your insurance policy to find a list of OB/GYNs.,
Find a low-cost health care provider near you if you do not have health insurance.,
Ask for recommendations from your primary care physician, family, and friends.,
Look at the locations of your options.,
Choose if you would like a male or female OB/GYN.,
Look at the services each option provides.,
Ask if each office is accepting new patients.,
Do more in-depth online research about potential doctors.,
Schedule meetings with a few different doctors.,
Schedule an appointment with your new OB/GYN.",How to Choose an OB/GYN," Make an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss getting a referral for an obstetrician and/or gynecologist. Talk about why you want to see an OB/GYN. Explain to your doctor which services you think you need. Your doctor may be able to provide some of those services, or your doctor may give you a referral.Your doctor may give you a specific OB/GYN that they recommend or let you choose yourself, based on your insurance options.;
, Go on your insurance company's website and find a list of OB/GYN providers in your area that are covered by your insurance. Write down their names, locations, and phone numbers. This will be your working list of potential OB/GYNs that you can visit.


Many insurance providers have a list of “in-network” and “out-of-network” physician options. Unless you have a compelling reason for selecting an out-of-network OB/GYN, many insurance companies will cover little or none of the cost of out-of-network visits and care.

, Search for free clinics or women’s health clinics. Many of these clinics can provide low-cost options, with a sliding scale based on income.They can provide a huge range of reproductive services, from pap smears to STD/STI screenings to pregnancy tests.


Select the service you need. If you’ve never been to see an OB/GYN before or haven’t been in a year or more, choose a “well-woman” exam, or a general check-up for reproductive health. You can also seek treatment for STD/STIs, pregnancy, and other general issues. If you’re not sure what kind of service you want or need, call the office or clinic to talk with a professional.
Schedule an appointment. Even if you are uninsured, some health care providers, like Planned Parenthood, cannot turn you away from their services because of inability to pay.Keep in mind that clinics are typically open during normal business hours, so you may need to make arrangements for work or child care.

, You may have a lot of options from your insurance company. Ask your general practitioner, family, and friends who their OB/GYNs are. Ask them what they like and dislike about their experiences there.Many people love their doctors and will be able to make recommendations. Others may dislike their doctors and give you important information about what you could expect at the office they visit, such as long lines, insurance hassles, or rude providers. Here are some potential things to ask about:


How easy it is to make an appointment
Wait times in the office
Kindness and professionalism of the people at the office
Professionalism and personality of OB/GYN
Birth control services
Pregnancy services
Overall experience

, See how long it would take you to travel to various doctors from your home and your work. Cross off any options that are inconveniently located or too far away. Keep in mind that you will most likely be traveling to your OB/GYN during business hours.

, This depends purely on your preferences. If you have a preference for a female doctor, do not see a male doctor. You are entitled to be comfortable. Remember that you will have to be completely undressed during your visits to your OB/GYN.Also remember that sometimes a doctor’s name is not necessarily indicative of their gender; for example, the first name Dylan can be used for all genders.

, If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you will need an OB/GYN that can provide both obstetrical (OB) and gynecological (GYN) services. If you are planning to have a baby, make sure that the hospital that your OB/GYN delivers at is also covered by your insurance. If you’re only looking for an annual checkup, however, you may only need a gynecologist, rather than an obstetrician and gynecologist. Figure out what you need from your physician and call the offices on your list to ask them if they provide all the services you need. If they do not, cross those options off of your list.


An obstetrician, or an OB/GYN, is a medical doctor trained in women’s reproductive health, pregnancy, and birth.A gynecologist is a medical doctor who primarily focuses on health care and diseases related to breasts and women’s reproductive health.All gynecologists are trained in both obstetrics and gynecology, but this particular doctor has chosen to practice gynecology only.

, Contact your potential offices and ask them if they are accepting new patients. If they are not, cross those off of your list of potential doctors. Being able to make an appointment quickly and easily is important for choosing an OB/GYN, especially if you are planning to have a baby.

, Use these sources to narrow down your list from many providers to only a few. Search a variety of sources and take all online reviews with a grain of salt. Not every doctor is perfect for every patient.


Many state medical boards provide information on every registered OB/GYN, listing any documented complaints or reprimands currently in effect against the physician. If a physician has a complaint filed by a patient, check to see if it is for inadequate or negligent care, and if so, continue down your list in search of a new provider. If the complaint instead deals with insurance reimbursement or other non-care based issues, you should keep it in mind should you decide to engage their services.
Look on doctor review websites such as Vitals and Healthgrades.Take online reviews with a grain of salt, as always, but cross off any doctors on your list who have overwhelmingly negative reviews. Pay attention to what you’re looking for in a doctor and cross off any doctors with poor grades in those categories. For example, if you care a lot about bedside manner, you may cross off doctors with negative reviews regarding bedside manner but keep doctors with negative reviews regarding office wait times.

, Call in advance and ask to meet with an OB/GYN before you schedule an official appointment. Be aware that many offices may not agree to meet and greets — there is no reimbursement for this and they can be time-consuming. If they do, some offices will request some form of payment, which the insurance company won’t pay. If the doctor does agree to a meeting, look at the cleanliness of the office and the friendliness of the staff. Ask the doctors about their credentials, their certifications, their education, and their views on certain issues (such as birth control).If the doctor is unable to accommodate a meet and greet, consider making an appointment for a minor issue so you can still ask questions, get a feel for the office, and potentially have the visit covered by insurance.
Ask how long the physician has been practicing. Even a new OB/GYN has received extensive training, but if you have considerable health problems or if you are experiencing a high-risk pregnancy, you may wish to opt for a more experienced provider.
If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, find out if the physician or nurse is available after hours for urgent questions and whether the OB/GYN will be available or on-call for your delivery.
If you have special needs or considerations, such as a recent hysterectomy or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, ask whether the physician has experience handling cases such as yours.

, Make sure that you can make this appointment time and will not have to cancel. Ensure that you are getting a comprehensive check-up the first time you go. If you have any medical records from past doctors, bring those to your appointment.


Remember, you are not required to return to an office simply because you have begun seeing them as a patient. In most cases, your new provider can call or fax a form to the old OB/GYN office to get a copy of your medical records.

Learn about absorbency options.,
Choose the lowest level of absorbency needed to avoid TSS.,
Use different absorbencies on different days.,
Change your tampon every 4-6 hours.",How to Choose a Tampon Size1," Tampon sizes correspond the amount of liquid they can absorb. You can select the right absorbency level for you based on the level of your flow.The most common tampon absorbency levels (moving from smallest to largest) include:

Regular
Super
Super Plus
Some brands may also offer Junior/Slim (smaller than Regular) and/or Ultra (larger than Super Plus).;
, Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a rare but serious condition that can result from using higher absorbency tampons. To prevent TSS, you should always use the lowest absorbency level to meet your needs. Start with Regular (or Junior/Slim) tampons, and move up to a higher absorbency level if needed.Symptoms of TSS include: high fever, low blood pressure, vomiting or diarrhea, and a rash that resembles a sunburn.You will know an absorbency level is meeting your needs if it is not saturated in 4-6 hours. If you need to change your tampon more frequently than every 4 hours, or if you are experiencing leaks, you may want to try a higher absorbency.

, For most women, flow is the heaviest on days 1-3 of their cycle. After this, the flow usually begins tapering off (for days 3-7 or longer). You can use higher absorbency tampons on your heavy flow days, and switch to lower absorbency as your period begins to taper off.Look for tampons sold in variety packs, with multiple absorbency levels in one package.
You may want to use a panty liner or pad as a back-up on heavy flow days.

, In order to prevent infections (such as TSS), it is important to remove your tampon every 4-6 hours, even if it is not completely full.If you have just started using tampons, it can be helpful to set a timer for yourself.
Remember to use the lowest absorbency level to meet your needs.

Avoid taking too many calcium supplements.,
Get the recommended 2mg of vitamin B6 daily.,
Stick with the recommended 60mg of vitamin C daily.,
Consider taking vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are commonly thought to increase your risk of developing kidney stones, but recent studies do not show a clear link between vitamin D supplement use and kidney stone development.As with calcium supplements, you should talk with your doctor before beginning any vitamin supplement regimen.

,
Talk with your doctor about what medications you take might put you at risk for developing kidney stones.",How to Control the Risk of Kidney Stone in Women2," Moderate levels of dietary calcium can help you avoid kidney stones. But your body might not absorb supplemental calcium as easily, and too much of it can build up in your kidneys and lead to stones.Calcium supplements can be useful for helping with osteoporosis, which women commonly encounter later in life. Unfortunately, your risk of developing kidney stones as a result of taking too many calcium supplements goes up as you age.Therefore talk to your doctor to determine if calcium supplements are necessary for you, and if so, at what level. Remember that your body will typically absorb nutrients more easily if they are consumed as food rather than supplements.

, The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin B6 is 2mg, and doses higher than that have not been shown to decrease your risk of kidney stones.Get the recommended daily amount to reduce your risk, but avoid taking megadoses of B6.

, Taking too much vitamin C can reduce your risk of kidney stones, but vitamin C is an essential vitamin for good health. Therefore, just aim for the recommended daily amount of vitamin C. Do not take large doses of it.


Try drinking a glass of lemonade or water with a tablespoon of lemon juice added to it. You will get some vitamin C and potassium citrate, which can help to prevent kidney stones.,, For instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin have been linked to a higher risk of developing kidney stones."
"
Be aware that some medical disorders can lead to kidney stones.,
Understand if your age will contribute to your risk of developing kidney stones.,
Be especially careful if kidney stones run in your family.",How to Control the Risk of Kidney Stone in Women3," Not all kidney stones form as a result of lifestyle or medicine usage.


Chronic kidney infections can lead to struvite stones. Long-term antibiotic use may be required to prevent these stones from forming regularly.
Some stones form due to a genetic disorder called cystinuria which causes an overproduction of the chemical cystine in the urinary tract. If left untreated, excess cystine can also develop into stones.Other disorders like hyperthyroidism, gout, and urinary tract infections can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones., Although anyone can get kidney stones (even children) the chances that you will develop them go up between the ages of 20 and 40.Common risk factors like over-consumption of oxalate are much worse for older women than younger women.Postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels are more likely to develop stones.

, If one of your immediate relatives has had a kidney stone, you are 60% more likely to develop a stone. Once you develop one kidney stone, your odds of developing another also rise by about 60%.
People with only one kidney are also at an increased risk.

Track your menstrual cycle alongside other methods.,
Make a chart of the cycle durations.,
Use your chart to predict the fertile period in your current cycle.",How to Calculate Your Ovulation1," This is not the most accurate method, but it's an easy, useful step to take while tracking other data.Purchase or create a calendar to begin keeping track of your monthly menstrual cycles. Circle the first day of your cycle, which is the day you start your period. Keep track of the duration of the cycle, which typically averages 28 days.


Record the number of days in each cycle, including the day you start your period. The last day of each cycle is the day before your next period starts.
Keep tracking your cycle this way for eight to twelve cycles. The more cycles you have to reference, the more accurate the calendar method will be.;
, Once you have at least eight cycles recorded, you can turn the data into a chart. List the day of the month your period began in one column, and the number of days in that cycle in a second column.


Alternatively, you can use an online ovulation calculator such as the WebMD Ovulation Calculator. Make sure all of the information described below is included in the calculation, or it may be a less effective prediction.

, It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact day you’ll ovulate using only a calendar. Instead, a calendar is useful for predicting the range of days during which you will be fertile, which can be a different length for each woman, as described below:Predict the first fertile day in your current cycle by finding the shortest cycle in your chart. Subtract eighteen from the total number of days in that cycle to find your first fertile day, meaning the first day in your cycle when pregnancy could occur. For example, if your shortest cycle lasted 26 days, your first fertile day would be the 8th day in each cycle (26 - 18 = 8), counting the day you began your period as day one.
Predict the last fertile day in your current cycle by finding the longest cycle in your chart. Subtract eleven days from the total number of days to find the last fertile day in your cycle. For example, if your longest cycle lasted 31 days, your last potentially fertile day in each cycle would be the 20th day in the cycle (31 - 11 = 20).
Note that the more regular your cycle duration is, the more effective this method will be."

Start with slender tampons.,
Choose an applicator.,
Use “active” tampons for physical activity.,
Try different brands.,
Avoid scented tampons.",How to Choose a Tampon Size2," If you are new to using tampons, or if you find regular tampons too bulky, look for tampons that labeled Junior, Slim, or Slim fit. These tampons can be easier to insert, and can be more comfortable for some women.Junior/slim tampons may not be available in stores that have limited selections, such as grocery stores or gas stations.
You can easily find these products at pharmacies, drug stores, or anywhere with a wide selection of feminine hygiene products.

, An important factor when selecting the right tampon for you is choosing the right applicator. If you are new to using tampons, plastic applicator tampons can be the easiest to insert. But all applicator types have their benefits.Plastic applicator - These tend to be the easiest to insert (for most women).
Extendable applicator - These are usually made of plastic and are designed to be more discreet. To use, you first pull down on the applicator to extend it.
Cardboard applicator - These are the least expensive type of tampons, and are commonly found in vending machines.
Digital tampon (applicator-free) - These tampons are inserted using your finger. Some women find these easier. They are also discreet and produce less waste.

, If you workout, play sports, or live a very active lifestyle, you might try using “active” or “sport” tampons. These tampons are designed to be flexible and move with you. This is meant to avoid leaks.Any kind of tampon can be used while swimming or playing sports. Just find the size and style of tampon that works best for you.

, Each brand of tampon is a little different, and even within each brand there are a wide range of different tampons. The specific shapes and fit will vary from brand to brand, and product to product. You may want to try several different kinds of tampons in order to find the product that works best for you.Some brands include:

Tampax
Playtex
Kotex
O.B. (applicator-free)
Seventh Generation (organic cotton)

, Tampons are available in both scented and unscented varieties. Avoid using scented (or deodorant) tampons! The chemical additives used can cause irritation. As long as you change your tampon every 4-6 hours, you should not experience any unpleasant odors.If you’d like to go a step further and avoid all chemical additives, you may want to choose organic cotton tampons.

Understand the role of cervical mucus.,
Chart your mucus pattern.,
Interpret your mucus pattern to determine the day of ovulation.",How to Calculate Your Ovulation2," Cervical mucus, a protective substance on the cervix, changes at different points in your cycle. Your body produces more mucus right around the time of ovulation to help facilitate the fertilization of the egg. Once you get to know your pattern well, it’s possible to use it to predict the day you will ovulate.

, To learn how to check your mucus, see How to Check Cervical Mucus. Check your mucus every day after your period ends, and note the distinct changes that take place over the course of your cycle. Keep track of the changes on a calendar.


Chart the days when you have your period, dry days, and days when your mucus is tacky, sticky, slippery, and wet.
Note changes in color and smell in addition to texture. Note whether the mucus is cloudy or clear.
Keep as thorough a record as possible, especially in the first few months when you’re still getting used to this method.
Breastfeeding, infections, certain drugs, and other circumstances can affect the cervical mucus, so be sure to note these factors as well.

, The day of ovulation is usually the day when cervical mucus is most wet and slippery. In the days that follow that peak, especially when the cervix is dry again, fertility is at its lowest.

Buy a basal temperature thermometer.,
Take your temperature daily.,
Chart your temperature.,
Interpret your temperature pattern.",How to Calculate Your Ovulation3," Right before ovulation is the woman’s most fertile time. The body temperature rises slightly right after the woman has ovulated, then remains elevated for the remainder of the cycle, until your next period. You are most fertile during the days in your cycle directly before the temperature rise. Because the incremental temperature change from day to day is so small, regular thermometers will not provide accurate results. Basal temperature thermometers are digital thermometers available at drugstores.


The most accurate readings are taken in the vagina or rectum, but there are also basal temperature thermometers designed to take readings in the mouth. Stick with the same method during the entire process, and try to measure at the same depth and angle each time.

, It’s important to take your temperature at the same time every day, since it fluctuates throughout the day. Ideally, take it first thing in the morning, after at least five hours of sleep and before getting out of bed. Record your temperature within 1/10 of a degree. Use a dot or other symbol on your chart to mark days when other factors may alter the reading, including illness, restless sleep, and fever reduction medicines such as aspirin, Tylenol, and Motrin.The average woman’s body temperature is 96–98ºF (35.6–36.7ºC) before ovulation, and 97–99ºF (36.1–37.2ºC) after ovulation. If you get results significantly outside this range, consult the thermometer instructions to make sure you are using it correctly.

, Record your daily result on a temperature chart that allows you to create a graph, tracking your temperature changes over time. See Baby Center Sample Chart for a sample Basal Temperature chart.

, Over the course of several months, notice the day when your temperature goes up. Most likely, ovulation has already occurred at this point, so your most fertile time is right before that. With enough data, you’ll know which days of your cycle you are most likely to ovulate.

Purchase an ovulation test.,
Moderate your water intake in the hours before the test.,
Interpret the test.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Calculate Your Ovulation4," Sold in drugstores, ovulation testing kits detect the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine, which increases one to two days before ovulation. Similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests, these are digital devices with a testing stick to be held under your urine stream.


There is another type of testing kit, using which you can test your dried saliva under a microscope for ""fern"" patterns that sometimes indicate a rise in estrogen levels in the few days leading up to ovulation. This is less reliable than the LH test, especially if you have poor eyesight., Very concentrated or very dilute urine throws off the results of this test. For best results, avoid caffeine and alcohol on the day of the test, avoid dehydration or excessive water consumption, and wait until your bladder is full.

, Urinate on the stick and wait for a new line to appear in the viewing window. A line that is about as dark as the existing control line means you are probably ovulating. A faint line is not a reliable indicator.


Ovulation tests accurately predict the level of LH in urine, but the surge in LH only lasts about 24–48 hours, giving you a short window to detect it. Using multiple methods to track ovulation is recommended.
Some tests may work slightly differently, so check the instructions. For example, you may need to urinate into a cup and dip the test into it, or the fertility symbol may show up as as smiley face instead of a line., Test yourself daily during the most likely parts of your cycle, as described in the calendar section. If you have missed your ovulation in previous cycles and can afford additional tests, consider taking an ovulation test twice daily.

Visit a doctor.,
Have your sexual partner tested as well.,
Ask about treatment.",How to Calculate Your Ovulation5," An OB/GYN or a reproductive endocrinologist can perform tests that are more accurate than home methods.These may include a blood test to measure levels of progesterone and other hormones, or tests to detect abnormalities in thyroid function or prolactin levels, if your doctor thinks these are likely. An ultrasound test can be used to detect structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract that could be affecting ovulation., Men can also be tested for infertility. This typically begins by testing a sperm cycle, and may continue to an ultrasound exam to detect possible issues in the male reproductive system., If a doctor does suspect you are infertile due to anovulation (lack of ovulation), she may recommend one of a variety of drugs, depending on your exact condition. Do not assume that lack of conception is due to lack of ovulation without an official diagnosis, as there are many other possible causes. Your doctor should also examine the possibilities of blocked fallopian tubes, sperm-related problems, uterine or egg implantation problems, and age-related decline in egg quality.

Protect the health of your circulatory system with vitamin K. Vitamin K is needed for blood to be able to clot.",How to Choose a Multivitamin for Women," Many people think they do not have vitamin deficiencies, when in reality, they may have one or several. Traditional, routine blood work does not test for all vitamins. It may not even test for vitamin D. You need to ask for these tests to ensure that they're being done. If this is the case, your doctor can help you come up with a nutrition plan and possibly recommend vitamins suited to your needs. Your doctor is likely to recommend vitamins if:You usually eat less than 1,600 calories per day.
You eat a diet that does not contain enough fruits and vegetables. You should eat one and a half to two cups of fruit per day. In addition you also need two to three cups of vegetables per day.You don’t eat two to three portions of fish per week. In this case, your doctor might recommend fish oil supplements.
You have heavy menstrual bleeding. This would make you vulnerable to an iron deficiency.
You have digestive problems which make you unable to absorb enough nutrients from a healthy diet.;
, These diets tend to be excellent for keeping your fat intake and cholesterol levels low. They are often associated with a lower risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to be sure that you are getting all of the proteins, vitamins, and minerals that you need. You may be less likely to get sufficient:Iron. Many vegetarians have lower iron stores than non-vegetarians. Ask your doctor if your iron levels are low.
Vitamin B12. Vegetarians can obtain B12 from dairy products and eggs, but vegans must obtain it from supplements or foods that have been fortified with B12. Check the packaging on soy and rice milk, breakfast cereals, and meat substitutes.
Calcium: Because meat and dairy products are rich in calcium, many vegans are particularly vulnerable to being low in calcium. Calcium is crucial for maintaining healthy bones and avoiding fractures. If you are vegan, try to consume foods that are fortified with calcium, such as some fruit juices, breakfast cereals, soy and rice milk. It will say on the packaging if it has been fortified. You may also want to ask your doctor about calcium supplements.
Vitamin D: Your body produces vitamin D when it is exposed to the sun. However, how much you produce depends on your sunscreen use, the time of day, time of year, latitude, and your skin pigmentation. Vitamin D is important for bone health. If you are concerned about your vitamin D intake, consult your doctor about supplements and eat vitamin D fortified foods. Foods that are sometimes fortified include cow's milk, rice milk, soy milk, orange juice, breakfast cereals, and margarine.
Zinc: Soy, legumes, grains, cheese, and nuts are good vegetarian sources of zinc. If your diet is low in these foods, talk to your doctor about possible solutions.
Long chain n-3 fatty acids: These are necessary for maintaining healthy eyes and good brain function. Many people get them from eating fish and eggs. If you do not eat these foods you can also get them from flaxseed, canola oil, walnuts, soy, fortified breakfast bars or microalgae supplements. Ask your doctor if it is necessary for you to also take supplements.

, Postmenopausal women need to be careful to get enough calcium and vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis. This is particularly important for older women who live alone and for whom falling and breaking bones is a serious risk. Women over 50 should get:800 international units of vitamin D. Spending time in the sun will also help your body produce vitamin D. Try to go for a walk each day to make sure you get some sunshine.
1200 mg per day of calcium. This is important for your bones to stay strong and repair the normal wear and tear that occurs during use.

, If you are trying to conceive, pregnant, or breastfeeding, chances are your doctor will recommend you take a prenatal vitamin supplement. This is not a substitute for eating a healthy diet, but it can help ensure that your baby gets what it needs from you. These vitamins are specifically designed for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are not pregnant, trying to conceive, or breastfeeding, you should not take prenatal vitamins. Prenatal vitamins generally have:Folic acid. Women who are trying to conceive or are pregnant require 600-800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid each day. This supports healthy brain development in the early stages of fetal development. Overdosing on folic acid can make it harder to detect if you are deficient in B12.Iron. Pregnant women need about 27 milligrams (mg) of iron each day. If you take too much iron, it can make you sick. It can cause constipation, vomiting, diarrhea or even be fatal.
Calcium. Calcium is important for pregnant women because it supports the development of healthy bones. Pregnant women should get 1000 mg per day of calcium. However, most prenatal vitamins only give you 200–300 mg. This means that it is still important to eat plenty of calcium. You can get the rest of your daily calcium needs by eating vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, turnips, collard greens. Other foods like soy milk and fruit juices often have calcium added to them. Getting too much calcium can increase your risk of kidney stones.Vitamin D. Pregnant women should also obtain sufficient vitamin D for their baby’s bones. The Mayo Clinic recommends 600 international units (IU) per day. You can get this by spending time in the sun and eating fish, particularly fatty fish like salmon, juice with added vitamin D, milk, and eggs., Some vitamins may interact with how you metabolize your medicines. If you are on medications, discuss vitamin supplements with your doctor or a registered dietitian before starting to make sure that they are safe for you. Some interactions include:


Vitamin D can influence your blood sugar and blood pressure. It can also interact with birth control and medications for treating HIV, asthma, cancer, heart problems, cholesterol problems, pain, and others.Vitamin B6 can increase your risk of bleeding if it interacts with aspirin or other blood thinners. If you are diabetic, discuss vitamin B6 with your doctor before taking it because it may affect your blood sugar. It may also interact with medications for asthma, cancer, depression, Parkinson's, or other conditions.Vitamin E can also increase the risk of bleeding when combined with blood thinners. It may also affect medications for Alzheimer’s, tuberculosis, cancer, asthma, heart problems, seizures, and other conditions. Vitamin C can interfere with blood thinners and affect blood sugar and blood pressure levels. It can also interact with oral birth control, HIV medications, acetaminophen, Parkinson’s medications, antibiotics, anticancer medications, aspirin, barbiturates, nicotine, and others., The benefit of multivitamins is that most are designed to give you the Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) of many different vitamins and minerals. The RDA is an amount that should be sufficient, but not too much, for most healthy adults.Examine the label on the product. There should be a table that tells you what percent of the RDA the product has for each vitamin or mineral it contains. The best ones provide you with approximately 100% of the daily value for lots of different vitamins and minerals.
If your doctor feels it would be beneficial, you can purchase multivitamins over-the-counter at drug stores and grocery stores.

, If the label on the bottle says that it provides much more than 100% of the recommended daily amount, then it is a megadose. For example, 500% of the RDA is a megadose. Over dosing on some vitamins can actually be harmful:Both too little and too much vitamin B6 can cause nervous system problems.
Fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are easier to overdose on because excess amounts are not excreted through the urine, as with water soluble vitamins. Too much vitamin A can raise the risks of hip fractures. Too much vitamin D can cause the blood to have too much calcium. This can cause vomiting and constipation.
Overdosing on iron can cause vomiting and liver damage.
Vitamins and minerals are frequently added to processed foods and beverages. If you are taking vitamins that provide a high amount of some vitamins, be aware that you may need to reduce your supplement intake if your diet already provides you with the right amount.

, Vitamins can degrade over time. This is particularly likely if they are stored in hot, humid places. If your vitamins have expired, it is safer and healthier to simply purchase new ones.


If the type you are considering does not have an expiration date on it, don’t take it.

, The contents of vitamins and supplements are not strictly quality controlled the way food is. This means that it is difficult to be sure exactly what is in the pills that you are purchasing.Check with the Food and Drug Administration’s website to see if your supplements are under review. The website can also tell you if people have complained of negative reactions.

, Women who are not pregnant need 400 mcg per day. Folic acid, or folate, is a B vitamin which is important for the nervous system. Excellent sources of folic acid include:Whole grain cereals or cereals that are fortified with folic acid
Spinach
Beans
Asparagus
Oranges
Peanuts

, Your body absorbs iron best from meat, particularly red meat. However, if you are vegetarian, you can still meet your iron needs by increasing your intake of non-meat foods that are rich in iron. Before menopause women should get 18 mg per day. After menopause, they need 8. Excellent sources of iron include:Red meat. Lean meats are healthiest because they have less fat.
Pork
Poultry
Seafood
Beans
Peas
Spinach
Raisins and dried apricots
Foods that have iron added, such as some cereals, breads, and pastas. The packaging will tell you if iron has been added.

, After menopause, women’s daily calcium needs increase from 1000 mg per day to 1200. Getting enough calcium is important to prevent osteoporosis. Women can avoid a calcium deficiency by eating:Milk
Yogurt
Cheese
Broccoli
Spinach
Kale
Turnips
Collard greens
Soy milk and fruit juices which have been fortified with calcium
Salmon

, Vitamin B6 is important for your nerves to function properly. Deficiencies are uncommon, however you can guard against it by eating:Cereals
Carrots
Peas
Spinach
Milk
Cheese
Eggs
Fish
Flour

, The recommended amount for adults is 600 international units per day. For people over 70 an extra 200 per day is recommended. This is important to sustain strong bones in the later in life when people are vulnerable to breaking bones if they fall. You can also get vitamin D by eating:Milk
Yogurt
Salmon
Trout
Tuna
Halibut

, Getting enough vitamin A may even help prevent cancer. You can get vitamin A by eating:Yellow vegetables
Liver
Kidney
Eggs and other dairy

,, Most people get sufficient vitamin K through eating a diet containing:Green leafy vegetables
Meat
Dairy

Pay attention to headaches and mood changes.",How to Treat Menopause Symptoms," By understanding the stages of menopause, you can better understand the symptoms, determine where you are in the process, and prepare for what is coming next. The four stages of menopause include pre-menopause, peri-menopause, menopause, and post-menopause.Pre-menopause begins with your very first period, continues through your reproductive years, and ends with your last menstrual cycle.Peri-menopause includes the years immediately before you begin menopause. For most women, peri-menopause usually begins in your 40s, and lasts for about four years, although many women experience peri-menopausal symptoms for as many as 10 years. During this time you may experience irregular periods, as well as some of the symptoms routinely associated with menopause.Menopause is actually determined after your final period. Once you have gone for one year without a menstrual period, you have technically been through menopause. The average age for menopause is 51, but it can occur earlier or later, and still be considered normal.Post-menopause begins after your last period, and lasts for the remaining years of your life. Menopausal symptoms can linger for one to two years in most women, but they eventually taper off.The post-menopausal years are associated with increased risk for health problems related to lower levels of estrogen and progesterone. Two primary areas of focus include osteoporosis and heart disease. Your doctor will help monitor for changes related to these conditions.;
, The common symptoms that occur during menopause include hot flashes and night sweats, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, problems sleeping, headache, weight gain and slowed metabolism, mood changes, problems with memory, thinning hair, dry skin, decreased sex drive, urinary changes, and loss of breast fullness., Not everyone has problems during menopause, but some women experience severe symptoms. Hormones, like estrogen and progesterone, play a role in many parts of your body. As your ovaries lose their ability to make enough natural hormones, the receptor sites located all over your body begin to notice., Estrogen and progesterone receptors are found all over the body. The symptoms experienced during menopause are directly related to the lack of the natural hormones binding to those receptors. The receptors are located in your brain, skin, heart, and your bones, to name a few. Realizing where the receptors are, helps to explain why you are having those unwanted symptoms during menopause.The absence of these hormones increases your risk of developing serious health problems once menopause has past. Two of the more serious complications include an increase in your risk of osteoporosis which can result in bone fractures, and heart and blood vessel disease that can lead to cardiovascular conditions including heart attack and stroke.Talk to your doctor about your medical conditions, and any additional steps and lifestyle changes you should take to keep yourself as healthy as possible., Let your doctor know the most troublesome symptoms you are experiencing, and ask about medications that can help you manage those symptoms during this difficult time. Many women do not find the symptoms severe enough to warrant taking medications. Yet sometimes the symptoms can be extreme, interfere with your ability to function at work and at home, and cause both physical and mental distress., Menopausal hormone therapy is a new name for hormone replacement therapy. This type of treatment involves taking both estrogen and progesterone. If you no longer have a uterus (due to hysterectomy), then you would just take estrogen., Menopausal hormone therapy provides estrogen and progesterone, or just estrogen, to supplement those hormones as your body adjusts to the transition. Products that contain these hormones are available in a variety of forms to suit your needs. Some examples of available forms include tablets, capsules, vaginal gels, patches, and topically applied products.Taking menopausal hormone therapy has been proven to help with many of the symptoms associated with menopause. They work by providing a balance of hormones throughout the body to counteract the symptoms that occur during menopause.Transdermal preparations are considered safer and more effective for managing mood symptoms because they avoid the first pass through the liver, decreasing blood clots. They also don't affect libido as much as pills.

, Do not take menopausal hormone therapy if you have vaginal bleeding with an unclear cause, a history of breast cancer, a history of uterine or ovarian cancer, a history of thromboembolic problems including DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke, or heart attack, liver problems, or if you have a genetic condition that increases your risk of blood clots. Your doctor will know if it is safe for you to proceed with menopausal hormone therapy., A major clinical study, called the Women’s Health Initiative, was started in 1991 and lasted for 15 years. The study focused on women that were prescribed hormonal medications, 50 to 79 years of age, and included nearly 162,000 women.The study results have provided a better understanding of the risks and benefits associated with the use of hormonal drugs in this population of women. The focus of the study was on the use of prescribed medications. Most healthcare professionals consider the results of this study to help determine the best course of treatment for their patients.
Review the Women’s Health Initiative study results for yourself. Even though the study results are rather detailed, a summary is provided here for your review.
A slightly higher risk was identified for women taking hormonal medications in the following areas:

Breast cancer: Eight women in 10,000 may develop breast cancer who would not have gotten it if they had not been taking hormones.
Heart attack: Seven women in 10,000 women may have a heart attack who would not have had one if they had not been taking hormones.
Stroke: Eight women in 10,000 women may have a stroke who would have not have had strokes had they not been on the mediation
Blood clots: 18 women in 10,000 may experience blood clots in the lungs or legs who would not have experienced blood clots if they had not been taking hormones.


A slightly higher benefit was identified for women taking hormonal medications in the following areas:

Hip fracture: Five in 10,000 women may be less likely to fracture their hips due to taking the medication.
Colon cancer: Six in 10,000 women may be less likely to develop colon cancer due to taking the medication
General bone fractures: Statistics are not provided, but the study authors concluded that fewer bone fractures are expected in the medication group as compared to the group not taking the medication.



, Other lifestyle factors should be considered in making your decision about menopause hormone treatments. Some things that can add to the risks and warrant your consideration include smoking, a family history of breast cancer and heart disease, your weight, and your level of physical activity., Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are substances that can act like natural estrogen in your body. Natural sources of soy include tofu, tempeh, soymilk, and soy nuts.Some products claim to reduce menopausal symptoms by using natural ingredients, like soy. Since the manufacture of these products is not regulated in any manner, natural products may not always be reliable or even safe., Some herbs contain varying amounts of phytoestrogens. Some examples include black cohosh, wild yam, dong quai, and valerian root. Many of these herbs can be made into different forms of administration, like oral tablets or topical creams.Use caution with natural or herbal sources of phytoestrogens. Many herbs claim to provide benefit with hot flashes. Talk to your doctor if you decide to use herbs to treat your symptoms. The safety and reliability of these products is unknown.
Plus, plant sources and herbs can cause problems by interacting with some prescribed medications., Take charge of making lifestyle changes that can help your body to handle the transition easier.Quit smoking. If you are a smoker, try to quit. Smoking can trigger hot flashes, weaken your bones, and irritate your bladder which may already be more sensitive.Smokers also tend to go through menopause two to three years earlier than non-smokers.
Eat a healthy diet. Limit alcohol and caffeine, and maintain a good balance of foods in your daily food choices. Eating a well-balanced diet can help to provide you with the energy you need and avoid gaining weight during this time as your metabolism begins to slow down.

Another commonly used name for this group of products is “compounded bio-identical hormone replacement therapy,” or “compounded-BHRT.” There is no scientific evidence to support the claims being made about the use of these products.Some of the advertising claims about BHRT drugs include statements like, “A natural and safer alternative to prescription drugs,” “…can slim you down by reducing hormone imbalances,” “Prevents Alzheimer’s disease and senility,” and “…can cure or prevent heart disease.” There is no clinical research or valid scientific evidence to support these advertising claims.An additional advertising claim describes using a saliva sample that provides your exact hormone levels in order to make a compounded BHRT drug that is specific to your needs. Saliva samples are far from reliable measures of your own levels of hormones. Hormone levels that can be measured in your saliva change depending on what time of day the sample is taken, and are naturally different from one day to the next. Other unknown variables can also alter the saliva test results. This is not a useful or scientific method in determining the best treatment options for you., In rare cases, someone may be allergic to the filler ingredients used in a manufactured menopausal hormone therapy product. If you have this type of allergic reaction, then your doctor can write a prescription that identifies the exact ingredients safe for you to use. This prescription can be filled at a specialty compounding pharmacy., Try dressing in layers so you can remove some items of clothing when you experience a hot flash. Wear clothing made of natural fibers like cotton. Keep sandals nearby, so you can remove your socks and shoes.


Consider adding a room-size fan, or even a smaller personal-size fan, to your work area or rooms where you spend most of your time. You may also try slow and controlled breathing when you feel a hot flash beginning., If menopausal hormone therapy is not right for you, other medications have been shown to be helpful with handling the hot flashes associated with menopause.Low-dose antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can help to manage hot flashes, plus this type of agent also helps with mood swings associated with menopause. Two of the more commonly prescribed antidepressants for hot flashes are venlafaxine and Paxil.
Gabapentin is a drug primarily used for seizures, but is also helpful in treating hot flashes, headaches, and some mood symptoms associated with menopause., Using a lubricant can help to reduce vaginal dryness, as well as help with some of the pain associated with intercourse. Vaginal lubricants are available over-the-counter can be water- or silicone-based.Water-based lubricants include products like Replens®, K-Y Jelly® and Astroglide®. Silicone-based lubricants include Eros®, Wet Platinum®, ID Millennium® and Gun Oil®. Vaginal estrogen is also available in several formulations and provides estrogen directly to the vaginal mucosa.


Remaining sexually active during this time can help to maintain the elasticity of the vaginal walls. , A varying degree of bladder incontinence is often experienced as the menopausal years approach. Kegel exercises can help build the pelvic floor muscles and assist with urinary incontinence.


The first step in doing Kegel exercises is to identify the muscles you are supposed to contract and relax. Try stopping the flow of your urine while you are urinating. If you can do this, then you have identified the muscles you need to strengthen. Do not continue to stop your stream of urine since this can cause unwanted problems.Now that you know the basic move in a Kegel exercise, try to hold your muscle contractions for two or three seconds, then relax. Contracting, holding, then relaxing is one complete exercise move. 10 repetitions make up one set. Try to do five sets of 10 repetitions each day. You can do this while driving or even seated at your desk while working. Be sure your bladder is empty when you do the exercise.If incontinence is problematic and you can't figure out the correct muscles to exercise there are physical therapists who specialize in working with women to target these muscles.

, Increasing your physical activity can help to address any sleep problems you may experience, plus this can help to maintain a healthy weight. Avoid exercising immediately before bedtime.Other steps that can help with sleep problems include avoiding large evening meals, caffeine after noon, and alcohol near bedtime.

Avoid watching television or playing video games just before trying to sleep. Avoid napping during the day, and try to go to bed and get up at the same times every day.Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for menopausal sleep issues.Consider asking your doctor for a medication that can help. Short-term use of agents used for insomnia may help you get the sleep you need during this transition. Zolpidem and eszopiclone are controlled prescriptions and come with risks such as abnormal behavior and risk of dependence and abuse. Safer medications for sleep such 1mg of melatonin, 25mg of Trazodone, or 10mg of Doxepin may be suggested.
The treatment for insomnia that has the most evidence for long term effectiveness is CBT-I, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Low dose progesterone is also helpful for sleep in menopausal women.

, Estrogen exerts profound effects on mood, mental state and memory by acting on both ""classical"" monoamine and neuropeptide transmitter mechanisms in brain.Recognize that this is not the time to be taking on more than you can handle. Manage your daily responsibilities with a positive attitude. Try to avoid becoming overwhelmed and negative. Consider finding a support group that includes other women dealing with the same changes.Some mood changes such as depression and anxiety (which are common during menopause) can't be treated with a positive attitude. Women with significant mood symptoms should see a doctor for medications and consider psychotherapy.

, Decreases in estrogen can cause vaginal tissue to change and sex to become painful. If this is the case, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking osphena, a non hormonal treatment for painful intercourse.


A decrease in libido can also occur from mood swings, a natural decrease in testosterone with age, or emotional strain in the relationship.

In some cases, there may be an underlying cause for your problem, such as the beginnings of depression., Some women experience additional problems such as frequent headaches, urinary problems, and dry skin. While menopausal hormone therapy can help to address many symptoms, there may be other options that can help with individual problems., Due to the rapid loss of bone in the first few years after menopause, your doctor may recommend adding calcium supplements to your daily regimen; however, a recent finding by the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against taking large doses of calcium during your menopausal and post-menopausal years. This topic is somewhat controversial.Talk to your doctor to determine how much calcium and vitamin D your body needs. Lab tests can be done to measure your bone density and current calcium stores in your body. This is the best guide to determining your need for calcium and vitamin D supplements.Natural sources of calcium and vitamin D are a part of any healthy diet. Sources include low-fat and nonfat milk and yogurt, hard cheeses, collard greens, tofu, calcium-fortified orange juice and breakfast cereals, sardines, and canned salmon with bones. The best natural source of vitamin D is natural sunlight.If you doctor determines that you are at risk for osteoporosis, treatment options beyond calcium supplements are available that can help., Vaginal bleeding during menopause is not normal. If you experience any episodes of vaginal bleeding, call your doctor as soon as possible., These are not common side effects of the medication or normal symptoms of menopause. If you feel bloated, or have bouts of unexplained nausea, let your doctor know as soon as possible., Breast tenderness or swelling warrants medical attention. Any changes you may notice in your breasts can indicate a more serious condition, and you should notify your doctor as soon as possible., Even though these symptoms are sometimes experienced as you transition through menopause, they may also be warning signs of something more serious.

27 milligrams of iron. You can find iron in meats, beans, and spinach.
80-85 milligrams of vitamin C. Citrus fruits, broccoli, cauliflower, and green peppers are good sources of vitamin C.
0.46 milligrams of folate. Folate, also called folic acid, can be found in dark green leafy vegetables and legumes.

, Medical professionals recommend that you drink at least 10 cups (2.4 liters) of fluids each day during pregnancy. Water should be the primary fluid that you drink. Water helps to relieve some pregnancy symptoms, like constipation or excessive swelling. Too little water can contribute to premature or early labor, so be sure to monitor your water and fluid intake., Gestational diabetes occurs when your body cannot make and use all the insulin that it needs while you are pregnancy. It affects up to 9% of pregnant women and can be dangerous for both fetuses and mothers.You can lower your risk by limiting your fat intake to less than 30% of your daily calories, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly while pregnant.

, Unfortunately, pregnancy can be a major stressor on a relationship and is a common trigger for domestic violence. According to the Center for Disease Control, 4 to 8 percent of pregnant women report abuse during their pregnancy. This number may be much higher because women may be afraid to report their abuse. Domestic abuse is a crime and is never justified. It poses a severe health and safety risk to you and your baby.Call an emergency number like 911, the police, or a domestic violence hotline if you are ever afraid your partner may abuse you."

Tobacco use exposes a fetus to dangerous chemicals and toxins, limits their oxygen supply and hinders the delivery of nutrients. It is also dangerous to your health.By stopping your tobacco product use, you lessen your risk of pregnancy loss, infant death, premature birth, and other complications.

, Doctors have not identified a safe level of alcohol for women to consume while pregnant. While they are unsure whether there may be a safe amount of alcohol to drink, they do know that excess alcohol consumption can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is entirely preventable as long as you do not drink alcohol while you are pregnant.If you have a drinking problem, contact a medical provider immediately to develop a treatment plan to help you quit drinking.

Eat yogurt or take probiotics.,
Use a cold compress to deal with itching and discomfort.,
Ask your gynecologist before trying any probiotic suppositories.",How to Balance Vaginal pH2," The good bacteria in yogurt and probiotic supplements may help to balance your vaginal pH.Try adding a serving of yogurt to your daily diet to get more beneficial bacteria.


Do not insert yogurt directly into your vagina. It may seem that putting the yogurt directly into your vagina may work better than just eating it, but this is not recommended. The sugars contained in yogurt may cause more problems.
If you want to try a probiotic supplement, make sure that you choose a brand that lists the strains (look for Lactobacillus), species, and genus or the probiotics, a best by date that says how many organisms will still be alive, the manufacturer’s contact information, and the dosage information.As with any supplement, make sure that you check with your doctor first.

, If your vaginal area is itchy or burning, then soaking a clean cotton washcloth in cold water, wringing it out, and applying it to your vaginal area may help provide some relief. Do this as often as needed to help soothe your vaginal area., Vaginal probiotic suppositories have been studied to determine how well they treat bacterial vaginosis, but they have not been studied for use on healthy vaginas.These suppositories are thought to work by repopulating the good bacteria in a woman's vagina, but not enough is known to recommend them for casual use. Talk to your gynecologist before you decide to try any probiotic vaginal suppositories.

Check for symptoms of a yeast infection.,
Identify trichomoniasis symptoms.,
See a doctor for a diagnosis.",How to Balance Vaginal pH3," Sometimes when vaginal pH is out of balance, you may develop a bacterial infection such as bacterial vaginosis. The symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include:A foamy, often yellowish vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor, often described as a “fishy” smell
A burning sensation when you urinate
Itchiness and irritation around the vagina

Itching and burning of the vagina and labia
Painful urination
Redness and swelling of the area just outside of the vagina
Painful intercourse

, Infections with the trichomonas organism are common as well. Keep in mind that many people with trichomoniasis have no symptoms.Symptoms of trichomoniasis (sometimes called “trich”) in women may include:A frothy or foamy yellow or a gray-green colored vaginal discharge that has an unpleasant smell

Know if you are at risk of endometriosis.",How to Choose the Correct Menstrual Cup Size," Many brands of menstrual cups are on the market and they offer several options for you to choose from.Read the information provided by different manufacturers so you have a good understanding of the materials used in manufacturing and the features offered by their brand.Variables include the size of the cup, color choices, disposable vs reusable, amount of fluid they will hold, stiffness of the rim, stiffness of the lower part that holds the fluid, overall length of the cup, width measured at the rim, and the materials used in manufacturing.;
, There is no standard way to determine the correct size like you might do in choosing your shoes or your clothing. A “small” cup provided by one manufacturer may not be exactly the same as a “small’ cup provided by another. However, most manufacturers consistently recommend the choice of cup size, either small or large, based on general characteristics and categories of women.


Cups generally come in either a small or large. General guidelines provided are a starting place, then you may need to tweak your choice of brand and size to find the cup that completely meets your needs.
If you are a teenager, have never had sexual intercourse, are under the age of 30, have never delivered a baby vaginally, or exercise often, then you may want to start with a small.The smaller size has more to do with how it fits inside your vagina, and less to do with how much fluid it will contain.A large size is suggested for women that are over age 30, have had a vaginal delivery, or have a heavy menstrual flow., Once you have chosen a brand and a size, take some time to get used to your menstrual cup.Wear a pad or pantyliner while adjusting to the cup to prevent leakage or spilling.


It may take two to three menstrual cycles to decide if your first choice is the perfect fit.The companies that make menstrual cups understand it takes some adjustment. Many companies offer money-back guarantees for new users., The amount of fluid a menstrual cup can hold varies from one brand to another.All menstrual cups are advertised to hold more menstrual flow than that of a normal tampon.The average time recommended for use between emptying is 10 to 12 hours.If you have an exceptionally heavy flow, schedule your wear time for six to eight hours to prevent leakage.Take steps to have backup supplies available until you are comfortable with the length of time you can wear your menstrual cup without leakage.

, Your menstrual cup should be comfortable. A reusable cup is made to last for years.When you have found the right cup you should not feel it all. If it feels uncomfortable, then try a different size or a different brand.Choose a cup that has a smaller rim width, or is more flexible in the part of the cup that collects the fluid., This may be a more comfortable option for you. Two types of disposable cups are made.One is intended to be thrown away after every use, and one is to be discarded at the end of that menstrual cycle.Disposable cups are made of very flexible material. The part that collects the fluid is very light-weight and flimsy., If you have chosen a reusable product and you find it to be uncomfortable, pay attention to the length of the cup.Length is often the biggest problem that causes discomfort with a reusable menstrual cup.If you are uncertain, then start with a product that has a medium length.Most cups have a part that protrudes at the bottom, like a stem, that can be trimmed to help adjust the length to improve the fit.If you have a heavy flow or are having trouble finding a cup that fits you properly, consider comparing cups made by the same company as well as comparisons between some of the major companies. Additional information is available online that may help you in comparing the details of cups made by different manufacturers., For lack of exact medical terms, cups can be either softer or firmer.Cups that have a more solid or firmer structure in the bell shaped part that collects the fluid can be more comfortable for some women. Plus, firmer cups tend to leak less often since their structure is more rigid.The firmness helps the cup to open easier once inserted, maintain its shape against the vaginal wall, and avoid problems with sagging or sinking in of the sides.Firmer cups are often easier to remove since the walls of the cup fold in with pressure at the base, making it easier to break the suction.However, because of the stiffer or firmer structure, you may feel the cup once it is inserted, causing some pressure and possibly some discomfort.Softer or more pliable cups put less pressure on the bladder, are generally more comfortable to wear, and conform to women that may have a unique shape to their uterus.The softer cups may be more difficult to remove since the entire cup does not respond to the pressure from your finger when you are trying to break the suction to remove it. In general, softer cups may leak more since they can cave in or give way to changes in movement caused by the muscles of your vaginal wall., Some companies offer their menstrual cups in a rainbow of colors.


The disposable cups are clear. If you prefer a clear cup, most brands of reusable cups are also available as a clear option.
The colors are helpful in hiding any stains that result from repeated use. The clear cups can also be thoroughly cleaned and soaked in hydrogen peroxide to remove any stains from repeated use.

, The menstrual cup is a good option for women that exercise regularly. Some disposable cups can be worn during sexual intercourse..


The disposable menstrual cup is not a form of birth control and does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.The reusable cups are made of a more solid material and are not to be inserted or in place during sexual intercourse.Menstrual cups can be worn during physical exercise such as swimming, playing sports, or bicycling., The use of typical feminine hygiene products require changing every few hours.But menstrual cups can be in place for as long as 12 hours.In addition, menstrual pads can cause an odor since your flow is exposed to air.The menstrual cup collects the flow inside your vagina and prevents any problems with an odor., Provided you keep your cup clean, this method of managing your menstrual flow has a lower risk of infection.There is no change in the pH of your vaginal area with the use of a menstrual cup and there are no problems with tiny tears in the surrounding vaginal tissue, as can happen with the use of tampons.Changes in the pH and “micro-tears” can lead to bacterial infection. This is avoided with the use of a menstrual cup., The menstrual cups advertised and sold in the United States have been approved by the FDA.The FDA has deemed menstrual cups to be safe for use. Most companies use hypoallergenic and nontoxic materials in the manufacturing process.Some menstrual cups can be used safely by women with latex allergies. Check the product literature to be sure., Toxic Shock Syndrome has been linked to the vaginal use of tampons during menstruation.Toxic shock syndrome is a bacterial infection linked to problems with the use of tampons.There have been no reports of toxic shock syndrome reported due to the use of menstrual cups., Reusable cups save money and are considered to be eco-friendly.The purchase of a menstrual cup is more costly than purchasing a package of tampons or pads, but your menstrual cup purchase will last for years.
The disposable cups are less costly than the reusable cups and are comparable in price to other feminine hygiene products, depending on where you shop.The reusable cups prevent the accumulation of feminine hygiene products that end up in landfills., Once you are comfortable with insertion and removal, using a menstrual cup is an easy way to take care of your monthly period.Every manufacturer offers step-by-step instructions on both insertion and removal contained within their product literature, available online at their product websites, and many offer YouTube videos to help with understanding the procedures.The cup is folded, then gently slid into the vagina aimed toward the back, then given a little push to secure it in place.Remove the cup by pinching the base, then pulling it out. Do not pull directly on the stem, since the cup is secured by suction. By pulling on the stem, you can cause injury to the surrounding tissues., Menstrual cups can be messier.As you remove the cup, you are also removing the fluid that it has collected over the past eight to 12 hours.It takes some practice to develop a system that works for you. Many women remove it while “hovering” over the toilet to avoid any spills on their clothing or the floor.If possible, you may also want to practice removing the cup while in the shower.
The cup can be cleaned with fresh water then reinserted for the next 8 to 12 hours.You may want to wear a pad or panty liner until you have mastered the removal and insertion of your menstrual cup.
When you need to perform this removal and reinsertion in a public restroom, you may need to strategize to come up with the best way to rinse your cup, since sinks are not usually part of the individual stalls., Some women have trouble with insertion.Teenagers and younger women sometimes have trouble with inserting a menstrual cup.Some women that have never had sexual intercourse have trouble with insertion., Problems with removing the cup are more common than insertion difficulties.It is important not to pull down on the stem. Since the cup is being help in place by suction, pulling down on the stem can cause irritations or even tears to the surrounding vaginal tissue.The proper way to remove the menstrual cup is to pinch the base to break the suction, then pull down and out.Empty the collected fluid into the toilet, clean the cup with fresh water, and reinsert., Once you have completed your menstrual cycle, you must clean the cup thoroughly.If you don't think you have time or would be willing to do this, then the menstrual cup may not be for you.


You can sterilize the cup by placing it in a shallow pan of boiling water for five minutes.Other methods used for baby bottles and pacifiers using sterilizing solutions can also work for menstrual cups.Follow the guidelines for cleaning provided in the product literature.

, If you are allergic to latex, some menstrual cups are made of materials that are safe.Read the product literature to be sure. Select a cup made of medical-grade silicone if you have a latex allergy., Most doctors recommend against using a menstrual cup if you have an IUD in place.There have been reports of IUD’s being dislodged during insertion or removal of a menstrual cup.Check with your doctor to be sure it is safe for you to try a menstrual cup before you purchase one., Check with your doctor to be sure it is safe for you if you have any concerns.Do not use a menstrual cup if you have recently delivered a baby or recently had a miscarriage or abortion.Do not use a menstrual cup if you have been told you have a tilted uterus.Avoid using a menstrual cup if you were told to avoid using tampons due to a surgical procedure or other medical condition.Do not use a menstrual cup if you have a condition called pelvic organ prolapse.

, Talk to your doctor about this prior to trying a menstrual cup.This is extremely unlikely, but you may wish to discuss it with your doctor.


One case report of endometriosis was linked to the use of a menstrual cup. The FDA considers the use of menstrual cups to be safe, but discuss this with your doctor if you have any concerns."

Wait to become pregnant again.",How to Recover from an Ectopic Pregnancy1," How your doctor and you choose to treat the ectopic pregnancy will depend on your health, the location of the ectopic pregnancy, and the extent of existing damage to your reproductive organs.


Some ectopic pregnancies are eliminated by the woman’s body. If your ectopic pregnancy is very early and you have no negative symptoms, your doctor may recommend “expectant management” or “active monitoring.” With this process, you wait for approximately a month, with frequent doctor supervision, to see whether your body can resolve the ectopic pregnancy without additional treatment. In general, this approach only makes sense when your hCG (a hormone produced during pregnancy) levels are low and declining, and when you have no symptoms.If the ectopic pregnancy has been diagnosed very early and you do not have internal bleeding, your doctor may suggest an injection of methotrexate. Methotrexate will stop the growth of rapidly dividing cells, including pregnancy tissue (so it's important to rule out a normal pregnancy). It could take a couple of injections for this method to work completely.A laparoscopic salpingostomy is a procedure that removes the pregnancy tissue without removing any portion of the tube. This treatment is generally appropriate for early ectopic pregnancies where the fallopian tube has not ruptured. Most surgical treatments of ectopic pregnancies use laparoscopy, which is done under general anesthesia and involves using a small tube with a camera and light inserted through a small incision.A total salpingectomy may be necessary if the fallopian tube is very damaged, if you have very heavy bleeding, or in the case of a large ectopic pregnancy. In a total salpingectomy, the fallopian tube containing the ectopic pregnancy is removed.
A laparotomy is an abdominal surgery that is usually required in emergency cases of ruptured fallopian tubes or heavy bleeding. Laparotomies involve larger incisions and longer recovery times than laparoscopies.;
, Recovery time depends on the specific type of procedure that was used. In


With laparoscopic surgeries, you will usually be able to go home the same day as surgery. Recovery is fairly quick, with most women being able to resume walking. You can usually resume your regular activities within 7 to 14 days.It can take about a month to fully recover from laparoscopy.Surgeries done by laparotomy usually require several days in the hospital. This is because the incision is more extensive, and it will interfere with the functioning of your intestines. You will get clear liquids the morning after surgery and start solid foods within 24-36 hours. Laparotomy incisions may take up to 6 weeks to heal.
While there may be little physical recovery necessary for early ectopic pregnancies that don't require surgery, your doctor will carefully monitor your health to ensure the ectopic pregnancy resolves on its own.

, You may begin to feel better within a few days after your surgery. Do not push your body by exercising or doing too much physical activity. You also want to avoid any movements that may stretch or put strain on your incisions.Do not lift anything that weighs more than 20 pounds for the first week.
Climb stairs slowly, pausing after every few steps.
Walk around whenever you feel able to. Do not try to jog or run.

, Abdominal surgery can interfere with the functioning of your intestines and cause constipation. Your doctor will provide you with instructions on how to treat constipation. Some things you can do on your own include:Eat high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Drink plenty of water.
Use laxatives or stool softeners (as recommended by your doctor).

, If you had a salpingostomy or were treated by methotrexate injection, you will need to have regular tests to determine if the hCG levels in your blood return to zero. If they do not, you may need additional treatment with methotrexate.

, There are many possible reasons why you would experience pain after an ectopic pregnancy. The incisions can take time to heal, and the resulting scar tissue may cause pain as well. If the pain becomes persistent, severe or unmanageable, contact your doctor.Pain may also be due to your body trying to resume its normal menstrual cycle. Your body may resume its normal cycle between 4-6 weeks after treatment, although it could take longer.Some women report that they are more aware of ovulation following an ectopic pregnancy. They may experience pain when ovulating., Pain is usually your body’s way of telling you to rest. However, if you have any of the following symptoms along with pain, you should contact your doctor:Fever (above 100F or 38C)
Vaginal discharge, especially if it smells “fishy” or ”funky”
Lumps or bumps around the incision or scar that are red or hot to the touch
Discharge from the incision site
Nausea and/or vomiting
Dizziness or fainting

, After an ectopic pregnancy, you may not be able to use some contraception methods. You should discuss your options with your physician to determine what will work best for you.IUDs and progesterone-only contraception are usually not recommended after an ectopic pregnancy.You should also speak with your doctor to determine when it is safe to have sexual intercourse again.The treatment you received will largely determine this., If your ectopic pregnancy was treated with methotrexate, your doctor will advise you on how long you should wait before trying to become pregnant again. This is generally about one to three months, depending on the dosage you received. Methotrexate can cause problems for an early pregnancy by reducing the availability of folic acid to the fetus, so you need to wait until the drug is out of your system."

Watching how much sodium you eat in the two weeks prior to your period can prevent water retention and may help you feel better.Hold the salt when you cook. Read labels for hidden sources of sodium. It is often in foods including soy sauce, canned vegetables, and soups.
Avoid processed foods because they often have a lot of sodium. Processed foods such as deli meats, cheeses, fast food, and even potato chips often have a lot of salt that can cause bloating and discomfort.;
, Whole fruits and vegetables are good sources of complex carbohydrates, and are high in vitamins and nutrients. Eating fruits and vegetables can help you not only curb cravings for junk foods, but also help prevent bloating and weight gain.Make sure you have at least 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 2 ½ cups of vegetables daily.Select whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, mangoes, beets, and peas.

Meditation promotes relaxation and can improve your mood.Remember that yoga is another great relaxation technique.Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tightening and contracting each muscle group in your body. Start at your feet and tense each muscle group for five seconds. Repeat tensing each muscle group until you reach your head. Rest for ten seconds between muscle groups., Getting enough sleep may relieve the physical and emotional symptoms of PMS.Sleep comfortably for seven to nine hours every night. This may help with stress and tension.


Keep your knees slightly bent while lying on your side to reduce cramping and back pain.
Try taking off the flat sheet on your bed. It may restrict your ability to move and cause discomfort., PMS can come with the discomfort and pain of such things as headache, backaches, and cramping. Taking an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever may keep these symptoms at bay.Take pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). You can also try acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin.Do not take aspirin if you are under 20 years old as it may lead to a severe condition called Reye's syndrome.
Talk to your doctor if OTC medications do not work.

, Hormones control your menstrual cycle. Trying a hormonal birth control (available as pills, a patch, a ring, an implant, and the Depo-Provera shot) with specific hormones may reduce your symptoms of PMS including pain or other discomfort.

, Warmth or heat can relax ease physical discomfort and help you relax. Use a heating pad or hot water bottle or take a warm bath to ease the symptoms of PMS.Put a hot water bottle or heating pad on spots that are uncomfortable. This could be your back, abdomen, head or shoulders. You can make your own heating pad by putting beans or lentils in an empty sock or pillowcase. Heat it in the microwave for about three minutes before applying to your skin.The Food and Drug Administration suggests a maximum of 20 minutes per application of any heating device.Massage OTC heat rubs into your skin or apply heat patches to any area causing you discomfort.
Take a warm bath when you have pain or discomfort or are feeling stressed, tense or unhappy. Fill your bath with water between 36 and 40°C (96.8 to 104°F) so that you don’t burn yourself.Check the water with thermometer or feel the water carefully with your hand to make sure it is not too hot. If you have one, a whirlpool can also help relieve the symptoms of PMS., Acupuncture or acupressure can increase blood flow and balance out your hormones, which can relieve PMS.

For example, if you have severe mood swings, anxiety, or depression related to your menstrual cycle they may suggest you take an antidepressant the two weeks before your period begins."
"
Understand your menstrual cycle.,
Know when you ovulate.,
Note your symptoms.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Deal with Painful Ovulation1," Your menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of one menstrual period (this is “day one” of your cycle) to the first day of the next menstrual period. A typical cycle lasts 28 days, but if you chart your menstrual periods on a calendar, you may notice that your own cycle is longer or shorter. During the first half of your menstrual cycle (before ovulation), you menstruate, your uterine lining thickens again, and hormones begin working to trigger ovulation. During the second half of your menstrual cycle (after ovulation), an egg is either fertilized, or the body prepares to shed the uterine lining again.


Your own menstrual cycle may vary by a few days each month, and this is not something to worry about.
However, if your menstrual cycle varies significantly (by a week or more over a period of several months), it is best to see your doctor.
Although there are many non-concerning causes for variable periods, there are some that can be helped with treatment (such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, where periods come infrequently due to hormone imbalance), so a doctor's advice is always best if you are in doubt.;
, Ovulation usually occurs at the midpoint of your menstrual cycle — for women with a typical 28-day cycle, then, ovulation occurs around Day 14. If you think you may be experiencing painful ovulation, charting your cycles for a few months can help you confirm the timing.


The second half of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) tends to be consistent among women at 14 days (14 days before your next period begins). Therefore, if you happen to have notably longer or shorter intervals between periods (as compared to the average of 28 days), know that ovulation can be calculated by charting 14 days prior to the start of each period.
Understand that ovulation is when the egg is released by the ovary. It entails rupturing the membrane of the ovary at the location where the egg exits, which can be accompanied by bleeding and a pressure sensation. For many women, this goes unnoticed; however, for some, the blood in the abdominal cavity and pressure against the ovarian membrane can be a notable source of discomfort.

, If you are experiencing lower-abdominal or pelvic pain or pressure around the midpoint of your menstrual cycle, and if this pain disappears within a day and does not reappear until you ovulate again, you probably have painful ovulation. (It could be pain from other internal organs, but pain with this specific pattern that repeats most cycles is most often from ovulation.)


You may notice that the pain seems to be on only one side of your abdomen at a time. This is because ovulation occurs only on one side or the other, and this varies with each menstrual cycle (it does not alternate, but switches at random).
Pain during ovulation may sometimes be accompanied by minor vaginal bleeding; you may also experience some nausea.
The pain from ovulation tends to last anywhere from a few hours to two to three days.
Approximately 20% of women experience pain mid-cycle with ovulation. In most cases, it is relatively mild, but in some cases it can be severe and unbearable.

, As long as the symptoms are not severe, painful ovulation is probably harmless. Nevertheless, it’s important to see your doctor and rule out other possible causes of your pain (such as ovarian cysts, endometriosis, or if the pain is worse in any particular episode it may be a more severe and urgent condition such as appendicitis).

, Wear light layers of cotton clothing that you can easily remove when you start experiencing a hot flash. For example, you can wear a light tank top with a button-up shirt on top. When you start feeling hot, you can remove the shirt., Keep small electric fans around the house and office. When you're feeling a hot flash, turn them on, and direct the air towards your face and body. If you have air conditioning, you can turn it on and sit in front of a vent for instant relief., Panicking or worrying about the hot flash might make it feel worse. Instead, close your eyes.

WIC assistance is available to following types of individuals:Women. Women can apply for WIC assistance if they pregnant or have been pregnant within the last six months. Women who breastfeed are eligible for WIC aid for up to one year after giving birth.
Infants. Babies are eligible for WIC aid up to their first birthdays.
Children. Children under the age of five may also be eligible.;
, WIC aid is available to individuals who are struggling financially. Although the exact income thresholds vary from state to state, they are generally within the 100 to 185 percent of the federal poverty level.Federal poverty definitions are available on the USDA website.Previous enrollment in some other assistance programs may make you automatically eligible for WIC assistance. These include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), Medicaid, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF, also known as welfare), and sometimes other programs as determined by the state you live in., The USDA considers certain medical conditions and other circumstances to be a ""nutritional risk."" These conditions make applicants more likely to receive aid.Among these conditions are:


Anemia (low blood iron levels)
Being underweight
A history of poor pregnancy outcomes (e.g. miscarriages, premature births)
Dietary based conditions (e.g. having a poor diet)

, Use the USDA's pre-screening tool to see if you are likely to be accepted into your state’s program. This is available at http://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps/pages/start.jsf.


You will need to disable your browser’s pop-up blocker to ensure you can load the tool.

, Once you've decided you're eligible, locate a nearby agency office using the list available on the USDA's website.Select your state from the drop down list or by clicking on the map. Then, click “Apply.”


You can only apply for WIC in the state of your primary residence. You may be required to show proof of residence., Find them using the state’s WIC website or call the toll-free number provided to inquire about state requirements..


Read or ask about your state’s income requirements to verify you meet your state's requirements.. Find out what documents you need to provide to prove eligibility
If you are enrolled in other aid programs, read or ask about which ones might make you eligible and what proof of enrollment you'll need to provide.

, In some states there may only be one location in the entire state. Other states have several WIC locations.


Note that most WIC offices only take new appointments on certain days of the week or month. You will need to plan in advance., Go to the WIC office at the scheduled time. Make sure to bring any necessary documents to prove your eligibility.


You will need to bring some proof of income, such as one month’s worth of check stubs or previous tax records, depending on your state's requirements.You may also want to bring proof of enrollment in other programs, such as Medicaid, TANF or SNAP.

, There will, in most cases, be a medical screening at the appointment to determine any nutritional risks you may have. This appointment should be made and completed at no cost to you in order to assess this eligibility requirement.You can also bring documentation from your own physician that shows you have a nutritional risk condition if you prefer., As part of your appointment, you'll fill out and application form. The specifics of this form vary from one state to the next.


It is at this point that you will provide your proof of income and other program enrollment information such as your address, date of birth, parental status, and so forth. In some states you can start this process online.

Understand that your feelings are natural.,
Ask your doctor about counseling.,
Talk with friends or family.,
Find a support group.,
Treat yourself with kindness.,
Get exercise once it is safe to do so.,
Talk to your doctor before trying to get pregnant again after ectopic pregnancy.",How to Recover from an Ectopic Pregnancy2," An ectopic pregnancy is a physically and emotionally taxing experience. There are several reasons why you might feel angry, worried, or sad. You should know that these feelings are natural, and there is nothing “wrong” with you. There is no “right” or “wrong” way to feel.


Your body’s hormonal balance has been in flux. This can lead to depressive symptoms. It can also cause symptoms such as palpitations, agitation, and dizziness.Even though your body cannot carry an ectopic pregnancy to term, it can be devastating to learn that your pregnancy must be terminated.
You may be worried about your health and your ability to have another pregnancy.
You may blame yourself or feel guilty. You should know that ectopic pregnancies are not your fault.Recovering from a major surgery can put further strain on your emotions., Your hospital or community clinic may be able to refer you to counselors with special training in pregnancy-related issues. Losing a pregnancy and having major surgery are both experiences that you may find helpful to discuss with a mental health professional.You may also wish to involve your partner in counseling. Some people may have difficulty expressing their feelings, and going to counseling together may help both of you work through this difficult time.It is a common myth that men do not grieve the loss of a pregnancy. However, research suggests this is not true. Men may express their grief differently than women, but they may also experience anger or depression after their partners lose a pregnancy., There is nothing that says you have to talk if you don’t want to. However, you may find that it helps to get support from those close to you. Find friends or family members that aren't afraid to acknowledge your loss and provide the support you need to work through this difficult time., One of the most important elements that helps recovery is not feeling alone. You may find that a support group where you can talk with others who have had similar experiences will help you process your feelings.In the United States, RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, has support groups across the country. You can find a listing at their website.SHARE Pregnancy and Infant Loss Support also has local support groups in the US. You can find a support group in your area on their website.In the UK, the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust and the Miscarriage Association both offer resources and counseling for women who have lost pregnancies.You may find that online support forums also provide a space for you to talk about your feelings. The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust maintains online forums overseen by medical professionals where you can discuss your experience and share your feelings., Some women find that doing something special for themselves helps them deal with the difficult days after an ectopic pregnancy. A trip to the spa or similar outing may alleviate the sadness and provide welcome pampering. You may just wish to sit on the couch and watch your favorite movies. Give yourself the love you need.Do not feel guilty about treating yourself with kindness. Ectopic pregnancy can be physically and emotionally exhausting, and you need time to recover.

, Exercise after recovery is complete can be an effective way to minimize sadness and regain lost energy. Physical activity releases feel-good hormones called endorphins into the body, which are a natural mood-booster. Ask your doctor when you can begin an exercise regimen.Do not do anything high-impact or vigorous without consulting with your doctor.

, Your doctor will tell you when your body is physically ready and advise you about potential risk for another ectopic pregnancy. Some risk factors include smoking, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and a previous ectopic pregnancy. Those at risk will be closely monitored during a subsequent pregnancy, in order to catch potential problems and treat them early.Consider seeing a reproductive endocrinologist, who is an ob/gyn with subspecialty training in fertility treatment. You will need evaluation of the fallopian tubes, for example, and this kind of doctor is the best person to provide that. You can find a board certified REI at www.srei.org.

Wait it out.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Use heat.,
Take a bath.,
Consider taking birth control pills.,
Watch for symptoms of a more serious problem.",How to Deal with Painful Ovulation2," If your symptoms are minor, or if they tend to disappear quickly (some women experience pain for only a few minutes), you probably don’t need to do anything at all.

, Basic pain relievers like ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen should help relieve your symptoms. Follow the instructions on the label, and do not exceed the recommended dosage.


Note that different women find different over-the-counter pain medications to be more effective than others, and this varies from woman to woman. If you find that one does not work particularly well, do not hesitate to try another, as you may find greater success in trying another type of medication.
Anti-inflammatory pain medications (such as ibuprofen and/or naproxen) are known to be troublesome for people who have been diagnosed with kidney or stomach problems. If you fall into either of these categories, consult your doctor prior to use. Or, if you notice symptoms of upset stomach after starting the medication, consult your physician for further advice.

, Some women report that a heating pad alleviates their symptoms. Apply the heating pad to the lower abdomen, and repeat as necessary.

The reason heat works so well is that it enhances blood flow to the area of pain, relaxes muscles, and eases cramps. Some women also report that a cold pack or cold compress can help to alleviate pain, so you can try both heat and cold and see what works best for you.

, A warm or hot bath may work like a heating pad does to relax you and relieve your symptoms.

, If your symptoms are very bothersome, you can try hormonal contraceptive pills. Prescription birth control pills prevent pregnancy, in part, by stopping ovulation. If you begin taking hormonal birth control pills, you will no longer ovulate, and your painful ovulation will therefore disappear.


Note that birth control pills are the only effective way to prevent ovulatory pain, as they halt ovulation altogether (by suppressing your natural hormones and therefore preventing ovulation).
Birth control pills are therefore the most effective mode of treatment for painful ovulation, if home remedies (such as heat or cold) and over-the-counter medications are insufficient.
See your doctor to discuss the pros and cons of birth control pills and whether they are the right choice for you. You may also wish to chart your menstrual cycle over a few months time and bring this in to your doctor so that he or she can have a clearer picture of what's going, and perhaps come up with a more specific diagnosis.

, For many women, painful ovulation is a bothersome but normal part of the menstrual cycle. Serious symptoms, though, are not normal. If your pain lasts longer than two or three days, or if you experience any of the following symptoms along with the usual mid-cycle pain, seek medical treatment immediately:


Fever
Painful urination
Redness or inflammation of the skin on your abdomen or pelvis
Severe nausea or vomiting
Heavy vaginal bleeding
Abnormal vaginal discharge
Abdominal swelling

Use gabapentin to reduce the severity of hot flashes.,
Take an anti-depressant.,
Try a clonidine patch to lower the frequency of hot flashes.",How to Alleviate Hot Flashes2," Most medical treatments of hot flashes require a prescription. Visit your doctor to discuss the best treatment plan for you. You can see a primary care doctor or your gynecologist., HRT may be the most effective treatment for most women. Because of its side effects, however, you and your doctor should carefully consider if it is the best treatment for you. To start HRT, you may be given estrogen or progesterone as a pill, patch, cream, gel, or vaginal ring.If your hot flashes are frequent or severe, if you have low bone density, or if you have had early menopause (before the age of 40), HRT may be the best treatment for you.Side effects of HRT can include stroke, blood clots, heart disease, and an increased risk of breast cancer.
Do not go on HRT if you have a history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, blood clots, or stroke.

, Gabapentin is typically used to treat seizures, but it can also reduce hot flashes in women. If you are nervous about the risks of hormone replacement therapy, talk to your doctor to see if gabapentin will help instead.Side effects of gabapentin include dizziness, disorientation, and headaches.

, Even if you do not have depression, a low dosage of an anti-depressant such as paroxetine (such as Brisdelle or Paxil), venlafaxine (Effexor XR or Pristiq), or fluoxetine (Prozac or Sarafem) may improve your hot flashes.Side effects of anti-depressants can include nausea, dizziness, weight gain, dry mouth, or problems with sexual arousal.

, Clonidine may be able to reduce the number of severe hot flashes that you experience. To take it, you will apply a patch to your skin daily. Side effects include dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, and skin irritation."

Try acupuncture to reduce discomfort.",How to Alleviate Hot Flashes3," Hot flashes can be triggered by smoking, caffeine, spicy foods, alcohol, tight clothing, heat, sugar, or stress. Not everyone has the same reactions to these triggers. It is important to identify what causes hot flashes for you so that you can avoid it.For example, if you notice that you get hot flashes after smoking, you may need to quit smoking.

Keeping track of your hot flashes in a journal can help you learn your triggers. Write down when your hot flashes occur, as well as what you ate, drank, and did that day. You may notice a pattern over time.

, Isoflavones are a type of plant estrogen, and they may be able to help decrease hot flashes. Introduce some isoflavone-heavy foods into your diet. These include:Chickpeas
Lentils
Soybeans
Soymilk
Tofu
Crushed flaxseed

, Sleeping in a cool room will make you more comfortable at night. About twenty minutes before you go to bed, turn down the thermostat in your room. If you do not have A/C, you can turn on a fan instead.Using cotton or moisture-wicking bedsheets can also make you feel cool at night.

, Acupuncture involves inserting sharp and thin needles into various parts of the body to relieve pain or discomfort. It may be able to reduce hot flashes in some women. Acupuncture can only be done by a professional, and multiple visits may be needed."

, As a result of the physiological changes associated with the growing baby, many woman suffer from constipation during pregnancy. This constipation can be better controlled by consuming specific food and drink and performing exercises that can help.

Another issue you may find yourself having to deal with is constantly wanting to urinate. This can cause earlier-than-desired sleep interruptions! If you experience this discomfort, you'll find it's usually in effect during the first 13 weeks or so of pregnancy and then again in the third trimester. Don't dehydrate yourself though; instead, drink a lot during the day but less in the evenings to try to alleviate many toilet trips during the night. Then again, it is a form of training for what's to come.

If you experience burning or stinging sensations when urinating, speak to your doctor; you may have a urinary tract infection.



, Learn to maintain a schedule of going to the bathroom to help eliminate hemorrhoids associated with pregnancy., Tiredness is a commonplace issue for many pregnant women. By learning to control your sleep schedule, you can better manage your tiredness during the day.

Learn to love naps. Nap when you're home, over the weekend, during a lunch break. Again, this is more training for what's to come! Also, get others to help more with housework, any lifting/shifting/moving heavy items, grocery shopping, etc. At work, ask for reduced travel or changed tasks if you feel too tired as a result. Avoid going out at nights, as this can increase your tiredness; meet up with friends and family on weekends or for lunch instead.
If you're already a mom, nap when the children do. Ask a neighbor or friend to mind the kids for a bit while you catch up on some lost sleep.

, Pregnant women frequently suffer from back pain because of the physical stress of carrying a baby, but there are steps that help better control the discomfort.

Avoid standing or sitting for long periods of time. If this requires changes in your routine, then ensure that the changes occur.
Wear flat shoes that have excellent support. Visit a shoe clinic if you don't know what good support in a shoe is all about.
If you must lift things, always bend from your knees.
Don't twist or jerk around, especially not suddenly.
Get someone else to put other children into backseat car restraints.
Use warm (not hot) baths to relieve backache.
Use warm heat packs or warm hot water bottles to relieve backache.
Talk to your doctor if nothing is helping you.

, Massage techniques geared toward pregnant women can ease pain, and are easy to teach to a friend., Physical therapy, yoga and rhythmic body movements can all help pregnant women overcome pain associated with the round ligament during pregnancy., If you get a fever while you're pregnant, learn how to reduce your fever safely to prevent putting yourself and your baby at risk.

Ask your doctor for safe medications. Some medications that you'd consider safe when not pregnant can be harmful to the growing fetus, so always check before taking anything.

, Take an empty glass and pour an adequate amount of baking soda (around a teaspoon) into it. Pour room temperature water into the glass, filling it. This will leave the water a whitish color. Drink in small amounts, and drink whenever you have heart burn, and/or before a meal/snack."

Make a choice.,
Remember that you're still a woman.,
Reawaken your purpose.,
Use anti-stress techniques.,
Maintain good physical health.",How to Remain Upbeat About Menopause1," You essentially have two choices: you can face menopause angrily and in denial (but it's still going to happen), or you can accept it and make the most of the transition period to set yourself up for the remainder of your life.When you feel negative emotions creeping up, or you find yourself overwhelmed by symptoms, stop and breath.
Say to yourself, “I accept this change.”;
, In a youth-prone society, it is very easy to fall into the trap of feeling that post-reproductive age, your womanhood is somehow reduced. The reality is that you're no less a woman! In fact, menopause is one of the most unifying experiences for women!Use this change as an opportunity to connect with other women.
By talking with other women about these changes, you can create new and lasting bonds that are forged through woman-ness.

, For many women, menopause is a time of redefinition of roles, interests, and reawakening of purpose. Many women find that this is a time for reflection about where they have been and where they are headed.Is there something that you have always wanted to do?
Is it finally time to end or alter a negative relationship?
Could this be the time for you to put yourself first and get what you’ve always wanted?

, If you feel stressed during menopause, the fluctuating hormones are probably going to simply add to these feelings. Rather than reaching for a pill, consider ways to reduce the stress.Can you handle your workload differently?
Can you take up yoga, meditation, a gym class?
Deep breathing exercises can help with hot flashes. It takes practice but is very effective.

, A healthy body will support a healthy mind and ease you through this transition. Use good food, water, and exercise to fortify you for this change in your life.Use food as a way to improve your mood. Turn to ""menopause super-foods"" such as unprocessed foods, fruit and vegetables, beans and pulses, fish, sugar-free foods, etc.Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. The changing hormone levels affect how the cells in our body retain moisture.
Use exercise as a way of maintaining a good mood and good physical health. Exercise has also been proven to lower the intensity and frequency of hot flashes.

Avoid hazardous materials and dangerous activities.,
Make physical accommodations for yourself.,
Ask your employer for help.,
Wear comfortable clothing and shoes.",How to Cope With Being Pregnant at Work1," Some chemicals are known to negatively impact fetal growth. Furthermore, some activities--like heavy lifting or performing x-rays--are known to be dangerous for pregnant women. If you’re in a job with dangerous conditions, you should ask to be shifted to other duties (not involving chemicals handling, heavy lifting, or x-rays) for the duration of your pregnancy and lactation.If you work in an industry that handles chemicals, find out immediately what is safe for you to be around and what is not.
Look into your legal rights and be sure that your workplace is not violating them.;
, Try to make your work experience as comfortable as possible. If you'll be sitting, choose a comfortable chair. If you'll be standing (in one spot), add an additional mat under your feet. If you'll be at a computer, aim to create an ergonomically correct workstation. If you need to grab or pick up items (for instance, in retail work), consider using a ""grabber arm"" in order to avoid excess bending., Talk to your employer about implementing any reasonable accommodations that will help you to work more comfortably. If you are comfortable, you'll be able to work more effectively and stay at work later into your pregnancy. Review your employee handbook and/or state/province/country guidelines to find out what rights you are entitled to.For example, you might need to run to the restroom more often that the average employee. You might say, ""Can we make a plan to manage times when I need to step away?""
If you need more breaks/snacks, you could say, ""Would it be possible for me to take shorter breaks more often, instead of a long lunch?""
If you need some time off work for doctor's appointments, you could say, ""I need to schedule my doctor's appointments during business hours and these can conflict with my work schedule. I thought maybe we could work together to find the best times before I made official appointments.""

, Even if your ""regular"" clothing still fits, it may press on your body in uncomfortable ways. You can help ease any discomfort and feel cute by wearing specially-made maternity clothes. You may also need to change your footwear. Choose shoes that cushion your feet, while allowing room for swelling.Dressing in layers can also be a good way to cope with hot flashes!

Accept yourself.,
Love the clarity of vision that can arrive with menopause.,
Grieve the past.,
Pick up where you left off.,
Find strength in friends.",How to Remain Upbeat About Menopause2," It will be harder to do some things, such as keeping off weight. But rather than complaining about this, accept the change. Maybe it is time for you take up more space?


If there is a change you struggle to accept, look in the mirror and say, for example, “I accept my new body.” In time, you will believe yourself., Menopause is a crossroads, a time to rebirth yourself, change your focus, and start exploring your own needs more. It becomes a time when you stop stifling your own needs in favor of others and start making changes needed to forge on with a positive future., You are leaving behind parts of your life that were once integral to who you are. Find a ritual to farewell that part of your adulthood and to welcome in the next stage of adulthood.Throw a menopause party!
Take yourself on a trip.
Get that tattoo you’ve always wanted.

, Before the juggling act of your earlier decades swamped you, you probably had some more plans for yourself. Now is the time to return to those dreams. Resurrect a rusty career, start a new one, go on a pilgrimage, or start a business., Look to friends who are experiencing the same as you, or have already gone through menopause.Unburdening yourself in the company of trusted and understanding friends can relieve many concerns and reassure you that you're in good company.


Share stories.
Support one another.

Laugh together.

"
"
Read books about menopause.,
Learn what to expect.,
Seek out a variety of stories.,
Talk to other women.,
Trust what you know.",How to Remain Upbeat About Menopause3," Pay specially attention to those written by women who have experienced it, or who work with it! Reading about other women's experiences will help you to understand the variety of possibilities during menopause, as well as reassuring you that you're not experiencing menopause alone.


A good book to begin with is Dr Christiane Northrup's The Wisdom of Menopause: The Complete Guide to Physical and Emotional Health During the Change., Use books or the internet to research physical and emotional symptoms. Knowing what to expect will help when you're feeling irritable, dissatisfied, or impatient. Tracing these moods back to the reality of menopause will help you to work through them, rather than viewing yourself as suddenly ill-tempered., There are plenty of stories about the dreadful journey women go through when experiencing menopause, often published in women's magazines. The reality is that these stories highlight the less usual experiences; the more sensational and unusual the experience, the more newsworthy but that doesn't mean it's a reflection of the average experience.Look for books and articles that reflect good or neutral experiences, rather than simply bad ones.

, If you don't know what to expect from menopause, you'll be more vulnerable to the horror stories, the pressure to undergo treatments that you might not necessarily want to have, and the worry that your changes are out of your control. One way to combat this is to simply hear first hand accounts from women that you know! This will expose you to a variety of unique experiences., Information is power that leads to wisdom. As you absorb information on menopause, trust your own intuition, your critical thinking skills, and especially your body to tell you what is true for you.You probably know much more than you think!

Snack often.,
Avoid nausea triggers.,
Take nausea medication.,
Try natural alternatives.,
Manage heartburn.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Cope With Being Pregnant at Work2," Although it is called ""morning sickness,"" pregnancy-related nausea can strike at any time. The best way to keep this at bay is to keep a little bit of food in your tummy at all times. Keep healthy snacks with you at work.Fresh fruit, dried fruit, nuts, crackers, cheese, milk/non-dairy drinks, and water are good selections to have at hand.
Try to avoid snacking on high-sugar, low-quality foods. These can contribute to feeling tired.
Talk to your employer about working short snack-breaks into your schedule.

, These can be drastically different for everyone, but it won't take you long to decipher what makes your stomach turn. Avoid eating foods or encountering smells that trigger your nausea. Consider moving your work station (if possible), or asking co-workers to alter their behaviors (if you think it will help).Some common triggers include:

Food smells
Perfume smells
Coffee
Greasy foods
Visual triggers, such as watching people eat

, Some over-the-counter and prescription nausea medications are approved for use during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best options for you, especially if morning sickness is interfering with your happiness, comfort, or ability to work.Supplements such as B6 might help.
Dramamine is approved for use during pregnancy.
Prescription drugs such as doxylamine and pyridoxine are approved for use during pregnancy, but they have been shown to cause drowsiness.

, You also have a number of natural nausea remedies available to you that you can explore. Every person is different, so you will need to experiment to find something that works for you.You might try:

Mint (essential oil, tea, or candies)
Ginger (tea, hard candies, ginger chews, or supplements)
Acupressure therapy (such as motion sickness bracelets)
Acupuncture
Hypnosis
Aromatherapy

, Another common digestive problem during pregnancy is heartburn. When it comes to managing heartburn, you have a couple of options. You can avoid heartburn-producing foods (such as tomato sauce, greasy food, spicy food, citrus, or dairy), and/or you can take approved medication.

Some OTC approved medications for heartburn include: Tums, Mylanta, Malox, or Pepcid.
Your doctor may recommend Zantac or Tagamet if your heartburn is severe.

, Particularly if you are prone to morning sickness (but even if you are not), staying hydrated can help keep you healthy and comfortable during your pregnancy. Drinking water after you eat may also help prevent heartburn..

Plain water is your best option, but sparkling water, coconut water, non-dairy milks, and occasional fruit juice are good choices, too
If you have been vomiting, it is especially important to consume fluids.
For some, sparkling water can help ease nausea.

Consume iron-rich foods.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Maintain a fitness routine.,
Go to bed early.",How to Cope With Being Pregnant at Work3," Fatigue may come as the result of anemia, or low iron, which is quite common during pregnancy. You can counter anemia and boost your energy levels by consuming plenty of iron-rich foods.Some iron-rich foods include: meat, poultry, spinach (and other leafy greens), broccoli, sweet potatoes, beans, and fortified cereals.
Supplementing iron is an option, but it can cause upset stomach, so this may not be a good choice for you.

, Taking short, frequent breaks can help keep your energy up while you're at work. Getting up and walking around or resting your eyes in a dark room for a few minutes can do wonders for your mood and help counter fatigue. Do this as often as you are able during your work day.Speak to your employer about working short breaks into your daily schedule.

, Fitness may be the furthest thing from your mind during pregnancy (especially if you are not feeling well). However, maintaining a modest fitness routine can help boost energy levels and keep you (and your baby) healthy.Try going for a walk after work each night (or on your lunch break).
Look for prenatal fitness classes (such as yoga, Zumba, or water aerobics) in your area.
Be careful not to overexert yourself.

, The best way to cope with pregnancy fatigue is to sleep as much as possible. Avoid staying up late to tackle tasks. Rest is more important to a healthy, comfortable pregnancy than crossing items off of your to-do list."
"
Decide when to tell people.,
Know your rights.,
Plan your maternity leave.",How to Cope With Being Pregnant at Work4," Many people choose to disclose their pregnancy toward the end of the first trimester. However, if you suffer from severe morning sickness, you may need to inform your employer of the pregnancy sooner. Determine when you'd like to inform your employer, and who you are comfortable sharing this information with.

, Find out your legal rights in relation to work and pregnancy. Research the guidelines for your country and province/state, as well as the policies specific to your workplace.Such guidelines should help explain:

Hazardous actions that you should avoid at work, and safe alternatives
How many sick days/family days you can take
What (if any) accommodations will be offered during your pregnancy
The length of your maternity leave
Your ability to pump breast milk after you return

, If you will be taking a maternity leave from work, work with your employer to determine the approximate start date and end date. Determine what you will need to do ahead of time to prepare for this absence, and do it as early as possible. As your due date nears, leave everything you work with (your station, desk, locker, etc.) neat and orderly before going home each day. Your baby may arrive sooner than you think!You may want to compose a written ""maternity leave plan,"" that outlines exactly what you have agreed to, including the length of your leave, what (if any) contact you will have with your workplace while you are gone, and what (if any) duties you will continue to perform while you are gone.

Get regular exercise.,
Avoid sitting in the same position for a long time.,
Elevate your legs.,
Practice deep breathing exercises.,
Wear flats or low-heeled shoes.,
Wear support hosiery for pregnant women.,
Try to sleep on your left side.,
Prevent vulvar varicose veins.",How to Avoid Varicose Veins During Pregnancy1," Varicose veins typically appear in the later stages of pregnancy, when the weight of the baby is pushing down on your pelvis. Try to do low-impact exercises throughout your entire pregnancy to keep your blood flowing and minimize your chance of developing varicose veins. Talk with your doctor about what exercises are best for you, especially during late pregnancy.Walking and swimming are good low-impact exercises.
You can also do foot exercises by bending and rotating your feet at the ankles. Bend, stretch, and rotate your feet throughout the day to keep the blood circulating well.;
, Varicose veins are more likely to develop if your circulation is poor. This can happen if you have to sit in the same position for a long period of time or don't get to move around much. To improve your circulation, try to stand up and change positions occasionally.


Don't cross your legs when you're sitting, since this can slow down your circulation.

, If you have to sit in the same position for a long period of time, try to elevate your legs occasionally. For example, if you have to sit in a chair, rest your feet up on an Ottoman or small stool. This will relieve some of the pressure on the veins in your legs. If you can, stand up and go for a short walk before elevating your legs to improve your circulation.


For a comfortable way to elevate your legs, stack several pillows under your feet and knees.

, Deep breathing is a great way to improve your circulation, relax, and prevent varicose veins. Sit comfortably with your feet elevated above your hips. You might try sitting with your feet raised up on pillows. Breathe in deeply, so your lungs are full. Breathe out slowly as you feel the air release from your diaphragm. Do this for 10 minutes every day.Try to keep your chest in place as you breathe in. Your shoulders shouldn't move up or down as you inhale or exhale.

, If you frequently wear high-heels or shoes with tight straps, switch to flats or shoes with low heels. Wearing high heels can actually increase the pressure on your veins and increase your risk for developing varicose veins. Flats or low-heeled shoes will allow your blood to circulate easier and keep your veins healthier.


You may find that you need to buy new shoes anyway, since many pregnant women's feet swell during the final months of pregnancy.

, There may not be much you can do about the pressure your belly is putting on your body, but maternity support hosiery can help. These are thicker than standard women's hosiery and they're designed to be looser near your thighs while being tighter near the ankles. This will reduce some of the pressure from your belly and improve your blood circulation.You can find maternity hosiery at maternity clothing stores, pharmacies, and medical supply stores.

, A major vein runs down along the right side of your body (the vena cava). To prevent additional pressure on this vein, sleep on your left side if you can. You can also pressure and swelling in your legs by sleeping with your legs elevated. Just lay a few pillows underneath your knees and ankles before you sleep.Don't worry if you roll onto your right side while you're sleeping. The important thing is that you're comfortable enough to get a good night's rest.

, Although most varicose veins develop on the legs, pregnant women can develop varicose veins in the vulva area, especially during the third trimester. If you begin to feel pressure or pain in the vulva area, elevate your hips using pillows. You can also place an ice pack in the area to reduce swelling.Talk with your doctor if you experience sharp pain or are concerned about vulvar varicose veins.

Maintain a healthy weight.,
Prevent hemorrhoids by getting plenty of fiber.,
Switch to a low-sodium diet to reduce swelling.,
Take your prenatal vitamin.",How to Avoid Varicose Veins During Pregnancy2," Since you'll be gaining weight during pregnancy which puts additional pressure on your veins, it's important to be at a healthy weight. If you're overweight, talk with your doctor about healthy lifestyle adjustments you can make to feel more comfortable. For example, your doctor may recommend eating a more nutritious diet and adding low-impact exercises to your routine.It's important to get regular prenatal care, so your doctor can monitor your weight, blood pressure, and overall health.

, You should include 25 to 30 grams of fiber in your diet every day to prevent constipation. Straining from constipation can cause varicose veins known as hemorrhoids. Eating more fiber means you'll need to drink more fluids to keep your digestive system balanced. Good sources of fiber include:Bran and whole grain cereals
Beans and legumes
Berries
Greens

, A diet high in sodium can increase swelling which will put pressure on your veins. Control swelling and prevent varicose veins by eating a diet that's low in sodium. Choose no-salt added products and swap out salt with other seasonings (like fresh herbs).If you can, eat more of your meals at home, since foods in restaurants generally have more sodium than those you prepare in your own kitchen.

, Your doctor will probably recommend that you take a daily prenatal vitamin during your pregnancy. Any prenatal you choose should contain vitamins A and C. These are important for keeping your blood vessels healthy, so they can repair any damage to the veins.You can also get these vitamins from food. For vitamin A, eat foods like sweet potato, carrots, and leafy greens. For vitamin C, good sources include oranges, red peppers, and kale.

Make sure you definitely want to deliver your baby in a birthing center rather than a hospital.,
Shop around your local area to find a birthing center near you.,
Contact the birthing centers in your area and schedule a time to tour the facility.,
Select a birthing center that makes you comfortable.,
Inquire about how long you will be permitted to stay after the baby is born.,
Find out what their visitation policy is.,
Find out if you're appropriate for the birthing center.,
Book early.",How to Choose a Birthing Center," These facilities are not for every pregnancy, and there are a few accommodations that they lack compared to a hospital ward. Consider the following questions before committing to a birthing center:


Do you want the facilities that a hospital offers? Hospitals are already prepared for any eventualities in relation to possible birth complications.
Do you want to use local anesthetics, allowing for less pain in the entire process? Many birthing centers do not use local anesthetics. However, this may depend on the birthing center or where you live; some birthing centers will permit the use of local anesthetics and nitrous oxide, also known as ""laughing gas"".Are you worried that your insurance will not cover the birth? In many cases, insurance companies in the United States will not cover births that are carried out in birthing centers, due to what is considered to be their lack of proper facilities in the event of a complication. Talk to your insurance provider to see if this is a route that they will allow you to take.;
, Remember, you do not want the birthing center you chose to be located too far away from your home. Contractions can come on abruptly, sometimes without warning. If your birthing center is located too far away, then you may not have enough time to reach their facilities.


In some places, such as in Australia, there are birthing centers in the hospital grounds, which are known as ""hospital affiliated"". Should complications arise in this situation, you are within the same grounds and just a few elevator rides or corridors away from medical assistance. Looking for a birthing center attached to hospital facilities may prove to be an excellent method for calming any concerns you have about use of a birthing center. However, do be aware that hospital affiliated birthing centers may have the hospital attitude you may be trying to avoid, such as rupturing your membranes, inductions and vaginal inspections during labor. And if the birth center is crowded when you come in, you may be ""bumped"" into the hospital ward.
If you don't have the possibility of a hospital affiliated birthing center, is the freestanding birthing center located near a hospital? In the event of complications, a hospital must be close by in order to properly handle any emergencies or risks that arise.

, Take a close look at the facility. Ask questions and take note of how well the facility is run and how prepared they are for complications.


Are they licensed by the state, province or relevant national authority? In order to receive a state license in the United States for example, the birthing center must have licensed nurses and midwives. The requirements will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so inquire about your local licensing laws.
If you're in the United States, find out whether they are accredited by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birthing Centers. This accreditation is a major telltale sign that it is a properly run facility. In order to receive accreditation by the CABC, they are required to have charts on birth outcomes, proper sanitation, proper pH in the jacuzzi, etc.
Is the facility clean? Is its informational literature ordered neatly? Is the staff caring and kind?

, Assuming you have selected one that has passed the above checklist, then you might want to ask yourself a few additional questions that tap into your own reactions to the birthing center, such as:


Do I like the atmosphere of this birthing center? In many cases, women choose birthing centers because of their home-like settings. There are often whirlpools in which to relax, showers or baths, kitchens where the family can gather, soft lighting, a double bed made up like a home bed, exercise balls to rock on, plenty of space to move around in, etc.
Do I like the staff? It is always important to feel comfortable with the people who will help deliver your baby. It is an extremely important experience for the both of you, and staffing issues should not stand in the way of you and your peace of mind.
If births are happening at the time you are visiting (often highly likely), what does the atmosphere seem like? Do you feel a sense that this could be the right place for you too?

, The length of time for postpartum care varies according to the birthing center's rules and needs. You do not want to find out that you have to leave after 24 hours if you were expecting to be able to stay for 48 hours. In some birthing centers, you are encouraged to leave within hours of the birth provided you're in a totally healthy condition; in this case, you may want to consider shifting to private hospital or other care if you'd like more rest or to have family and friends (or even hired help) ready to help you at home for the first few days back.


Don't see an early leaving time as a problem. In line with the philosophy of birthing centers to keep everything as natural and seamless as possible, an early return to home is viewed as a key way to get you into the rhythm of caring for your baby innately, rather than feeling as if there is a hospital routine being imposed upon you. Some women love this; others are terrified of the thought of no rest so soon! Plan according to how it works for you but it is wise to have helpers ready to lend a hand for at least your first week back at home.

, Some birthing centers have no restrictions and allow unlimited visitors to come and go as often as you would like. Others have specific guidelines for how many visitors can be present at one time and during what hours visitors are welcome. Some may even limit visitors to immediate family members only. It is best to know their policy ahead of time rather than find out when your guests, who traveled hours to see you and your new addition, are turned away at the door.


It is possible that the idea of having visitors gawk at you when incapacitated is not one that interests you in the slightest anyway. Having people shuffle in and out to see how you are in your hospital bed is not the way of birthing center, which is one reason it appeals to women who use them.
Make sure that it's fine for your partner, spouse or birthing partner to be with you throughout the birth. This is an important aspect of birthing center philosophy. Of course, if you don't want anyone else than midwives present, that is also your prerogative.

, It isn't all your choice––you have to be a low-risk pregnancy and a reputable birthing center will do tests, with a doctor monitoring your progress throughout the pregnancy, to ensure that you are low risk. A reputable center will advise you if you're a pregnancy at risk of complications and will refuse to take you or will ask you to change your plans later on if they have already accepted you but the risks change during the pregnancy. Also, stay in touch with your treating doctor to ensure that you are getting proper monitoring throughout the pregnancy by an independent source.


The arrangements for being allowed to bring your regular doctor or obstetrician into the birthing center during delivery will depend on the birthing center's policies and local rules, so ask in advance what is possible and what is not. Also ask about bringing in your independent midwife, if this is something that you want to do. The answers to these questions may determine your decision.

, If you do want to use a birthing center, realize that most of them are in high demand and can be booked out during your due dates if you leave it too late. Moreover, reputable birthing centers will expect you to be monitored regularly by their staff and will also ask you to undergo training for having a baby, especially if this is your first baby or there has been a long gap since you last had a baby. If you leave it too late, you might miss out and the choice will be made for you to go to a hospital facility instead.

Research the common toxins that can affect an unborn child.,
Take inventory of chemicals within your home.,
Refrain from using chemical insecticides in your yard or home.,
Stay away from paint and paint removers.,
Choose all natural household cleaners.,
Avoid exposure to lead.,
Pay close attention to your sense of smell.,
Speak out against environmental toxins and warn other expectant mothers about the dangers associated with them.",How to Avoid Environmental Toxins During Pregnancy," The best way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins is to understand which toxins in the environment can affect the health of an unborn child. It is impossible to completely avoid all toxins in the environment. Chemicals are everywhere, and even a mother who stays indoors all the time will still be exposed to various chemicals and potential toxins at some point during a pregnancy. By researching some of the worst chemical toxins, you can learn exactly what chemicals and environmental toxins should be avoided most fervently. This simple step can help you to become aware of environmental indicators of toxins so that you can do your best to steer clear of them and improve the health of your child.


Pesticides are poisons designed to kill insects and rodents. These harsh chemicals can also be dangerous to an unborn fetus or cause nausea and vomiting in a pregnant woman.
Fumes from paint, paint thinner, and wood varnishes contain fumes which may be harmful, causing early delivery or even brain damage to an unborn child.
Aerosol products may release airborne chemicals which can cause nausea, accelerated heartbeat, or even brain damage in the unborn child.;
, Many mothers are surprised to learn that the bulk of their exposure to environmental toxins comes from within their own home. There are many different toxins in the average home, and taking inventory of the chemicals that you use in your home every day will help to increase your awareness of these toxins so that you can rid your home of these dangerous substances.


Check garages, laundry rooms and basements for hidden sources of toxins. Search for pest poisons, products with labels that say ""toxic,"" and products which have flame retardants, as these can all be dangerous to an unborn child. If at all possible, rid your home of these chemicals when you start trying to get pregnant. If you are already pregnant, have a friend or partner clear out these areas for you. Leave rooms open so that accumulated chemicals can air out. These areas almost always uncover a variety of chemicals that can be potentially harmful to an unborn child. Watch for dangerous fumes, strong odors and harmful ingredients in products such as laundry detergent, fabric softeners and paint.

, Insecticides are some of the most harmful environmental toxins that pregnant mothers are exposed to on a regular basis. These chemicals may negatively impact the health of an unborn child.


Avoid coming into contact with any chemical pesticides. If you are accidentally exposed to them, be sure to wash the area immediately with soap and water to remove any chemical residue.
Ban the use of pesticides in your yard or home during the length of your pregnancy. When insecticides and pesticides are used in the open environment, some of the chemicals become airborne and can be inhaled by pregnant women.
Avoid areas where pesticides are used. When out in public, watch for signs of pesticide use such as newly fertilized lawns and trees sprayed with insect repellent.

, Paint and paint thinner can release toxic aromas into the environment, which can have a negative effect on the health of an unborn child.


The chemicals used in paint and paint thinner are extremely noxious. Many expectant mothers forget about the noxious properties of paint when they begin decorating a nursery or baby's room. Pregnant women should not take part in painting projects around the house, and they should never be responsible for using paint thinner to remove paint from brushes and rollers.

, Household cleaners sometimes contain powerful toxins and noxious chemicals that can have a negative effect on the health of an unborn child.


Search through your cleaning products and eliminate those that contain harmful toxins. Avoid using powerful cleaning agents such as bleach or ammonia during pregnancy, and steer clear of abrasive cleaners that emit powerful odors, such as scrubbing powders and bathroom cleansers.
Replace toxic cleaning supplies with natural versions. By substituting chemical cleaners with household cleaners that use organic and all natural plant extracts, you can reduce the noxious properties of your home cleaning products. Replacing toxic cleaners with natural cleaning products is a good habit to get into when preparing to raise children in your home.

, Lead is one of the most toxic materials in the environment. There are many different ways in which expectant mothers can be exposed to lead.


Check for harmful lead levels in your tap water by contacting your city's water purification headquarters. Some tap water has a high enough lead content to have a negative effect on a developing human fetus. Many pregnant women choose to avoid lead content completely by drinking only purified water or bottled water during their pregnancy.
Discard all dishes that are lined with lead. An unborn child can be exposed to toxic levels of lead if the mother consumes food which has come into contact with lead-lined dishes or china. Eating food from plates which contain no lead is the only way to safely feed your unborn child.

, An excellent way to reduce the amount of environmental toxins to which your unborn child is exposed is to trust your sense of smell.


During pregnancy, a woman's sense of smell often increases exponentially. This may be a survival instinct for pregnant mothers to avoid dangerous situations for their children. If you smell something that smells caustic or noxious, it probably is dangerous for your unborn child and the environment which houses the smell should be avoided.

, It is impossible for a pregnant mother to avoid all environmental toxins no matter how careful she is. However, many pregnant mothers and mothers with young children are speaking out against the presence of toxins in the environment. Even a single voice can make a difference in helping to reduce the amount of airborne toxins which exist in the world.

Have an intimate conversation.,
Reveal the news with a sweet or funny surprise.,
Be prepared for a range of reactions.,
Tell when you’re ready.,
Tell close loved ones before going public.,
Make your announcement using social media.,
Consider your workplace.,
Hold a gender reveal party.",How to Announce Your Pregnancy," Maybe you and your partner have been trying to get pregnant for a long time, and you know your news will bring tears of joy. Or perhaps your pregnancy is totally unplanned, and it will be as much of a shock to your partner as was to you when that test read “positive.” Either way, you might find that the best way to tell your partner is with an honest, intimate conversation.


In most circumstances, your partner should be the first person you tell. You may be tempted to immediately call your mom or best friend, but if you’re in a relationship with someone else who will also be a parent to your baby, that person deserves to know right away.
That said however, if you're no longer in a relationship with the father (or are unsure who the father even is) then it would be best to tell a close friend or family member.
Try to be honest about your true feelings with your partner. If you have anxiety about what’s to come, share that feeling as well as your joy. You’ll need emotional support while you’re pregnant, and hopefully your partner will be able to provide that for you, even in those moments when you’re feeling overwhelmed.;
, Maybe you’d like to break the news a bit more creatively, so you can relish the look on your partner’s face. Here are a few fun gestures to consider if you want to make your partner laugh:


Make a romantic dinner for the two of you. Serve baby-themed food like baby-back ribs, baby carrots, and apple juice served in little Sippy cups. It won’t take long for your partner to figure out the message you’re trying to send.
Have a movie night and rent baby-related movies: Nine Months, Look Who’s Talking, Babe, etc. Write your news on a piece of paper and place it inside a DVD or VHS case. Hand the case to your partner and watch the news light up his or her face.
Give your a partner a gift. Buy a t-shirt or coffee mug that says “World’s Greatest Daddy” or “I Love My Mommy.” Wait with a smile as he or she absorbs the great news.
Order a cake from a bakery. Request that Congratulations on Your Pregnancy to be written on it. Then ask your partner to pick the cake up for you and bring it home. When he or she asks who it's for, say, ""Us! We're going to be parents!""

, If this is an unexpected—and possibly undesired—pregnancy, be as calm as possible and allow the other person time to digest the news. If the person starts becoming violent and is at risk of hurting someone or something, step away and out of the room until they calm down, it is an extreme reaction but can happen.

If they make threats towards the baby's or your safety, TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. Report them to the authorities as its always better to be safe than sorry)
The first reaction a person has is not always indicative of his or her true feelings, keep this in mind when telling.







, Traditionally, women waited until the end of the first trimester to tell others about their pregnancies. Miscarriages are most common in the first trimester, after which the risk drops significantly. These days, however, many women don’t want to wait three months to receive congratulations and support from friends and family. Choose the timing that makes the most sense for you and your partner.

, It’s thoughtful to tell your family, your partner’s family, and close friends that you’re pregnant before you post the information on Facebook, Twitter, or a public blog.


Consider telling your loved ones in person, or calling them individually. If you tell them through email or some other means, you won’t get to hear their exclamations of surprise and joy!
Alternatively, you may want to formalize the moment by sending a card. It has become increasingly trendy to share the news through pregnancy announcement cards, available at most stores that sell stationary.
If you want to record people’s reactions, wait until you’re at a family get-together and have everyone pose for a picture. Instead of telling everyone to say cheese, tell them to say, “(Your Name's) pregnant!” right before snapping a few photos.

, If you have a Facebook or Twitter account, you might share the news by posting a pregnancy announcement or a photo of yourself that shows the progress of your pregnancy. Some couples choose to share a picture of the first sonogram. There are many creative ways to reveal your news - just be yourself!


Keep in mind that once you post the information publicly, there’s no controlling who finds out. Don’t post your news until you’re definitely ready for everyone to know.

, Your friends at work will be excited to hear that you’re pregnant, but there are a few extra things to think about when it comes to making the announcement to bosses and coworkers.


Tell your boss before you tell the rest of your coworkers. It’s common to wait until after the first trimester, or even until the pregnancy starts to show, before telling your boss that you’re pregnant. If you have friends at work that you want to tell before then, arrange a meeting with your boss on the early side.
Research your company’s maternity leave policies so you can have an informed conversation with your boss. Be prepared to answer questions about how your pregnancy will affect your work performance and how much maternity leave you plan to take.

, Gender reveal parties are now the ""in"" thing. There are so many amazing ways to reveal the gender of your baby and the fact that you're having a baby at the same time. For example:


Buy a few albums (for each family member) and on the first page add the ultrasound photo, along with the announcement ""Baby Salazar arriving October 2014"". Print the ultrasound photo and the announcement (double-sided) and roll it up into a scroll and stuff it into a balloon or a box with tissue for family members to pop it and see the surprise inside. Lastly, record everyone's reaction and make a compilation video to share with friends and family on Facebook. It is a lot of work, but so worth it.
Have your husband paint his hands in either blue or pink. Wear a white t-shirt or top that you don't mind getting printed with the paint. Have a photographer take a photo of your husband cuddling you from behind with his hands around your stomach. Then take another photo as he takes his hands away and reveals either pink or blue! There, the baby's gender is known.
Check ""gender reveals"" on Pinterest; you'll find lots of amazing ways to reveal both the fact that you're pregnant and the baby's gender that allow you to show many loved ones and friends at the same time.

, Do not contact her by text or email if it is avoidable. Telephone is acceptable in certain circumstances, but face to face interaction is best. When you are talking to her, explain how you feel and what you think you two should do about the situation.


Remember to maintain eye contact the whole time if you are talking to your friend face to face.

, Remember people may need time to get over certain events which may have transpired. If this is the case, do not push it. Just exercise patience and respect your friend's space.

, If you are not careful and don't watch what you say, the hurt can be worse than the initial one. At the same time, don't plan too much. What you need to say to your friend can't be a speech; it has to be a sincere collection of your thoughts and feelings.

While it isn't the only way of seeing what happened, it is important to know how you view the matter so that you can better explain yourself when the time comes.
, Hysteria and drama have no place in sorting out friendship problems. If you are unable to remain calm when discussing things with your friend, he or she will imagine that it's all about you and how you feel rather than be considerate of their feelings too.

, If you think about how great of a friend they were, this will give you motivation to do your part in restoring the friendship.

, If you had been on the receiving end of what occurred, if you had been your friend, how would you have seen what happened?

, What is your motivation? Ensure that it is a genuine desire to restore the friendship and not an occasion of proving yourself right and your friend wrong. In friendship, seeking to apportion blame is a certain way of destroying the relationship for good. Thus, be ready to seek friendship again and to take responsibility for your own actions and words., Say you're sorry and ask to hear their side of the story. Realize that if you don't get to the root of the problem, you won't be able to fix it. Not confronting your friend in person might be best for both of you, at first. An email gives both of you the calm space in which to cool off but still present your concerns and seek reconciliation.

, Instead, just try giving them their space and every once in a while, giving them a little sorry and smile, letting them know that you want the fight to be over.

, For example, have a sleepover and just take the time to talk about how each of you feel and what you think you need to work on to make your friendship stronger.

, Make sure that your friend knows how you feel. Understanding each other is the key to a good friendship.

, Even if they are not as well prepared as you are, hear them out. Try to genuinely see things from their view, and how that would make you feel if you were in their shoes.

, There are some things you must not try to do or say when reconciling. These include:

Never tell your friend that they're wrong. Everyone has their own opinion, and by telling them that they're wrong (even if they are) you're making it sound like you don't care about what they have to say.






Avoid blame shifting. When you are trying to sort out something with a friend, avoid starting your sentences with ""you"" because your friend will automatically think you are blaming her/him. Stick to ""I"" statements, for example: ""I feel...."".






Never try to change your best friend to make them more like you. You'll soon realize that they're perfect exactly the way they are.






When they try to talk to you, don't walk away. Make sure that you listen to everything they have to say. Communication is gold.






Never try to make your best friend jealous by pretending to have a new best friend. It'll hurt them -and you- way more than make them jealous.







,, It may feel a bit awkward at first, but the more time you spend together, the more things can go back to normal.

, It's best to do this in person. Avoid talking about such personal issues over the internet or phone.

, Sometimes a gift can help to ease tensions. For example, a bouquet of flowers or box of chocolates delivered to their office or home.

, Sometimes it's the simple actions that make a huge difference.

Think carefully about the argument.,
Decide how major the argument was.,
If it's your fault, apologize - if you apologize nicely and they are a true friend they should accept it.,
If an argument was your fault and they didn't accept your apology, keep trying.,
In the meantime, start hanging around with some other friends - but when (if) you and your friend make friends again, don't just drop the person or people you were hanging out with.

,
When all the apologies are said, hug and make up - there's no point leaving tension between the two of you.,
Make a promise to try not to argue as much - arguments between close friends cannot be avoided at most times, but they can be made not as worse and/or not as bad.,
If you really and truly believe that the argument was their fault and it wasn't yours, but they think it is your fault for making it a big deal then try to sit down and have a conversation about your feelings with that person.,
If they seem like they don't want anything to do with you, make sure you put it out there that you can survive, too.",How to Resolve a Fallout With Your Friend," Think how it started, think how it ended up as a fall-out. Most of all, decide whether it was your fault or not - if it was, then you'll need to apologize; but if you're positive it is your friend's fault, never apologize. You can't let someone walk all over you, especially not a friend.

, If it's a 'minor' fight, you will make up (unless you argue all the time), but if it's a 'major' argument, you should consider whether you should completely leave your friend. A minor fight would be arguing about who gets the last sweet or something silly like that, and a major one would be them spreading one of your big secrets or an argument where violence is used.

, They might not accept it first time though. If you are certain that it's their fault, tell them that if they apologize you will accept it and be their friend again, and that you will apologize for any not nice thing you said.

, Make sure your apology is meaningful and sincere, rather than an angry murmur of 'Sorry'. If it wasn't your fault and they refuse to apologize, wait until they do.

,, If it was their fault and they apologize, mostly you should apologize too; you probably said something mean to them in response to what they said.

, Remember that this is your friend and you must try not to say anything mean or lose your temper with them.

, Make sure you let that person have their turn telling how they feel too.;
, Hang out with your other friends. Show them that you are a strong person and even though you want to resolve the issue and be friends again, you can still live your life as though they weren't in it, because one day they will come back regretting what they did.

Call or text your friend about catching up again.,
Be sincere and humble.,

Try to lay low for a while if your friend is still seething and resentful.,
Be open minded and willing to forgive your friend if they are in the wrong.",How to Make Peace With a Friend After a Fight," It will provide some time for both of you to cool off. Also calm yourself and think about what you want to say to your friend that makes sense and accepts your share of the responsibility for the fight.


Keep an open mind. Despite any strong feelings you may have, it is always best to approach a resolution with an open mind.;
, it varies from person to person. Some people, although they try to avoid it, would prefer direct confrontation in order to get the issue resolved.

, Do this when you're relatively certain that both of you have had ample time to cool off. You must feel ready to talk to your friend again at this stage; if not, give it a bit longer before calling to reconcile. When you call, ask to meet up somewhere if possible, as it is better to apologize and sort things out face to face.


Be ready to apologize when you call or text. Keep it simple and save the big apology for when you meet up and discuss it again. However, also be prepared for the possibility that your friend wants to sort it out by phone, in which case, you'll just have to be ready with your apology.

, Apologize for your role in the fight. Accept that you had equal responsibility for the fight and don't try to blame your friend. Insisting that your friend apologizes for their part in it will only make things worse and isn't going to smooth the way to a harmonious resolution.


If your friend has very little reason to be mad at you and you have a big reason to be mad at them, be more mature than your friend. Feeling like the bigger person may even feel better than winning some petty fight.
If you have done something that has offended your friend, accept it, apologize and don't argue with whatever fair retaliation your friend wants. If they want time, give them time, if they want you to keep apologizing, do it.
Avoid repetitive use of the word ""you"". Doing this comes off as an attack on the other person and risks escalating the conflict.

, Read your friend's body language carefully. Ensure that your body language isn't communicating something you don't intend. Situations may not have been as they appeared and there's always room to learn.

, It is a form of lying to them because there is a point at which you aren't sorry but you are wanting this over and done with. If your friend accuses you of doing something you didn't do, tell them. If they say you did something you didn't, tell them you didn't. Don't get angry with your friend, just stay calm and repeat the facts as you understand them to be.


Don't try to balance things out between the two of you, it isn't a contest. Both of you have probably done things that have annoyed the other.

, Don't keep pushing for a resolution if it is obvious that your friend isn't interested in one. Find a temporary solution that allows both of your to agree to disagree for now, and agree to resolve the issue later.

, Don't start any gossip and do not get involved with any fights or rumors that could damage this friendship any further. Just continue to be nice and to keep trying to resolve the issue. Let your friend know that you're still there for them when they're ready.

, Don't hold any grudge against them after you've made up. Instead, work on strengthening your friendship, by hanging out, talking, or doing fun activities together. Conflict is a healthy element to every strong relationship and if handled well, tightens the bonds rather than weakening them.

Ask yourself if it was a misunderstanding.,
Ask yourself how the other person feels.,
Put it in perspective.",How to Get Over a Friend's Betrayal1," It's easy to get upset when you think that someone close to you has betrayed you, but you need to be sure that a betrayal has actually taken place. Think about if you may have rushed to conclusions. Make sure your friend has really done something wrong.


What was your role in the incident? Could you have made an assumption that led to a misunderstanding or upset?
Find out what really happened. Ask third-parties who may know what happened for more information.
Consider all the information including your own. If your friend really has done something wrong, has he or she admitted wrongdoing?
Of course, a confession is not the only evidence of guilt, but it should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, you have to consider the possibility of a misunderstanding. This is not to say that all guilty people confess. Many don’t. So consider all the evidence, and make a decision about what to do next if a betrayal has occurred. For instance, if you told a secret and suddenly everyone knows your secret, then you'll probably suspect your friend of betraying you. Ask your friend if he or she intentionally told someone. Was it an accident? Did it just slip out?;
, If your friend is just as upset as you are, maybe you should understand your friend’s perspective. Try to put yourself in your friend’s shoes. Could you have said something that was misinterpreted by your friend, or vice versa?


You also have to understand that you don’t know what is going on in a person’s life. So, you have to look at the incident from the other person’s perspective. If your friend is open to it, ask about how he or she is feeling. You never know what could be happening, so you must try to see it from his or her point of view.
Continuing with the example above, understand how your friend felt carrying your secret. Was the secret too much of a burden to carry? Also, consider if your friend feels badly.

, There are two sides to every story, and there are many elements that influence events. Try to look at the situation objectively. If you remove yourself from the situation and think about it as if it happened to someone else, it allows you to view the incident differently. You might see the situation and understand it in an entirely different light.


This is not to say that after you do this, you won’t think that any wrongdoing has occurred. You still may come to the same conclusion:You think you’re friend betrayed you whether you look at it objectively or subjectively. If this is the case, then you’ll have to consider how you want to proceed.
After reviewing the situation objectively, you’ll likely develop some compassion for your friend. This doesn’t mean you’ll excuse your friend’s behavior, but since you have a different lens to view the situation you’ll feel differently. Having compassion for your friend who has betrayed you, believe it or not, will help you move on.You may also begin to realize how you may have contributed to a situation that led to betrayal, or how you may have contributed to the situation -- either by turning a blind eye or overlooking something. It's a powerful realization and a wake-up call to face-up to everything that was being ignored or overlooked.Was it too much to ask to ask a friend of yours to carry a major secret? Is your friend a blabber mouth? Does he or she tell everyone's business? If so, then you made a bad decision in expecting your friend to keep your secret.

Sadness, regret, anger, disappointment: these are all normal, healthy emotions. If you don't allow yourself to feel them for at least a little while every now and again, then you'll find yourself unable to cope with many difficult situations. Our ability to be sad in a healthy way and then move on after a short period of time is like a muscle, and you have to exercise yours in order to keep it in peak condition.


Don't let people make you feel bad for having an emotional response to this situation. Emotions are normal and healthy.;
, Let yourself be sad (or angry, disappointed, whatever) for a few days or a few months, depending on the seriousness of the situation, and then let that feel go. Let it go. The more time you spend being sad, the less time you have available to spend on filling your life with joy and great new experiences.

, Forgiving, coping, and moving on from being hurt doesn't mean not saying anything. You should speak up when someone has wronged you! This is especially important if they've done this more than once. You need to let people know how their poor behavior effects you. This is healthy for you and a good learning experience for them.


If they continue to be a source of pain in your life, consider that maybe they don't deserve to be in your life any more. This may be the healthier choice for both of you.

, Sometimes people really hurt us but sometimes it's also easy to get caught up in small arguments and problems that don't matter as much as we think they do at the time. Try to look at the issue you're having in a big picture way. Maybe you and your bestie are fighting over a boy. But after so many years of close friendship and real emotional support, does this boy really matter to you as much as your relationship with your best friend? These are the kinds of things you need to remember. Yes, your feelings will be hurt and you'll be right to be hurt, but try to keep perspective about how much that hurt means.

, You have to stop seeing yourself as a victim or a survivor and start seeing yourself as someone who took control of the situation they were in and made their lives better. Seeing yourself as a victim will make you continue to feel powerless and hurt. Seeing yourself as a survivor will lead you to continuing to define yourself by this experience. You want to reach a point where it's just something that happened to you and one of the many things that's helped make you the person that you are.


For example, if your boyfriend dumped you, don't just keep thinking of yourself as that girl who got dumped. You're you, not that label.

, Take some time immediately after being hurt in order to cool off. Usually, a couple hours to a day is a good period of time. When you're really hurt, in the moment, you tend not to think and you can easily end up saying things you don't mean or saying things in a way that's not constructive to anyone. You want your words to be thought out and have impact, so give yourself a little while to think.

, Try to understand the person that hurt you. People, unless they're actual sociopaths, always have feelings and a good reason for doing what they do. People are also rarely maliciously mean. Most of the time, they're just doing their best and trying to do what they think is the right thing to do. And a lot of the time, just like the rest of us, they make mistakes.


Try to think about why they might have thought what they were doing was right. This will help you sympathize with them and feel better about what happened.
Just because someone did something with good intentions or simply didn't think about the hurt they'd cause, doesn't excuse them or make them right. If they did something bad, you should still let them know (kindly) so that they can make the right choice in the future.

, Now, imagine you were them, trying to make the same choice. Really try to set aside your bias. You'd probably have made the same choice, right? Or, at least, you probably made a similar choice for similar reasons in the past (maybe when you were young and didn't know better). Thinking about this will also help you understand them and what happened, which will make you feel better.


Remember that people usually have more stresses of sadness and stress in their life than they let on. They might have not been in the best mental condition when they did what they did, which might explain really strange or cruel choices. We can't be at our best 100% of the time, so try to have sympathy for them.

, A good place to start when forgiving someone is to accept their apology. Give them the benefit of the doubt and take them at their word that they really are sorry. People can be truly sorry and still continue to make mistakes (even the same mistake on occasion). Accept their apology, believe it, not just for them but for you too. It can really help you in your own healing process.


Accepting someone's apology doesn't entitle them to anything or mean you have to do anything. You don't have to be nice or happy around them all of a sudden. It's even okay to keep them out of your life still, if that's what's best for you.

, Now, this is really important. If you feel hate for them, you have to stop. Hatred is an emotion that doesn't do anyone any good. It doesn't punish them and it doesn't make you any happier. For your own emotional health, you have to stop hating them. Instead, focus on not thinking about them at all, if you can't follow the earlier steps and come to understand them better.

, Revenge is another thing that doesn't do anyone any good. Thinking of revenge will only consume you and make your life all about the pain that you suffered. Would you rather that your life was about your pain or about all of the happy, amazing things you're going to do now? The best revenge that you can have is to go on to live an amazing, productive, fulfilling life which won't happen while you sit around being angry.

, A good way to truly forgive someone in your heart is to be happy that what happened happened. You do this my turning your experience into something meaningful and positive. Find a lesson to be learned in what happened to you or devote some of your time and experience to helping keep others from making the same mistake.


One example would be if you had a long-term relationship end. Don't see it as the end of all your happiness. Instead, take the experience as something that helped shape who you are and helped make you into the person that your future spouse will love even more.
Another example would be if you were subject to racism, use your experiences to go into schools and give a talk about how racism affects the lives of other people.

, A big part of forgiveness is letting go of the emotions that have a stranglehold on your heart and shifting your perspective. Here's a simple exercise that helps you do just that. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and ask yourself: would I want the other person to forgive me if I did something wrong?


Most people who are honest with themselves answer yes. Because forgiveness means so much when it comes from an unexpected place. It inspires us to give to other people. It helps us become better versions of ourselves. Most importantly, it heals bonds. The truth is that most people would rather live together with other people than live apart.

, Yes, you heard right. Write the most emotionally raw letter you can. Describe exactly how you feel and why you're angry. Spare no details. Then burn it. This sounds really dramatic, but for a lot of people, it works. Because the burning letter is a reminder that everything is temporary — even pain and hatred. Once you realize this, you should be a lot more ready to forgive.


People have a name for this process: catharsis. Catharsis is a release of bad emotions on a path to relief. Catharsis helps you feel better, and it's why doctors and psychological professionals tell you to talk about your feelings and even relive them.

, Being upset, hatred, wanting revenge: all of these take up a lot of energy and time! That's time that you could be spending doing something that makes you feel happy and fulfilled. It might even be keeping you from meeting new and exciting people. Put those negative feelings aside and find a new use for your energy. This could be pursuing a promotion, learning a new skill, or improving your grades!


Giving yourself a busy and set schedule can help, especially during the early period when you haven't quite changed your own heart yet.

, When bad things happen, it's easy to focus only on the bad thing and ignore all of the incredible good deeds that people do in response. Look back on your pain and think about the people that were there for you. It's important to really embrace the love that they showed you and spend some time showing them your gratitude.


For example, your best friend holding back your hair after you stress-vomit from seeing your ex. That's an incredible act of love that you should not put aside or forget.

, Continuing to tell the story of what happened to you over and over again simply makes you relive the experiences and leaves you feeling like a victim. Don't be a victim. Dwelling on these negative experiences can also drive away people who would otherwise really like to make you happy. When we fill our spirits with spite and sadness, we wear those emotions on the outside too. This is often scary and unattractive to people. You don't want to drive away good people...then the person that hurt you has won!


If someone asks you about the topic, you can certainly still tell them about it if you want to, but the important idea here is to stop identifying yourself and your life as being all about that terrible thing that happened.

, When we're focused on bad things, it's easy to forget about all the good things that happened too. A breakup may make you forget what might have been many happy years with that person. A fight with your friend may make you forget about the happier times and fun the two of you had. Thinking about these good times and realizing that you can make new happy memories can help you move on.

, Making new happy memories, really working to enjoy life while you have it, is one of the best ways to move on. When we feel really bad, it's easy to forget that life goes on but it really does. The more happy things you do, the more your soul will begin to come back in and wake up within you. Before you know it, you won't even be thinking about the things that hurt you.


A great route to take is to travel. Travel somewhere really crazy, where you don't speak the language. This will force your brain to focus on all new sets of problems and experiences. You'll be so busy enjoying yourself that you'll end up leaving those past experiences exactly where they belong: in the past.

, In order to move on, you'll probably need to start rebuilding trust at some point. This might mean rebuilding trust with the person that hurt you, but it mostly means rebuilding trust with yourself and with those who might be able to hurt you again. Unfortunately, a big part of rebuilding trust is giving people the chance and letting them surprise you. You'll have to make yourself vulnerable, but the payoff will be worth it.


Your heart might get a little rained on, but that doesn't mean you should lock it inside and away. Just give it an umbrella and let it sing in the rain until happiness comes to call again. Someone will come that will deserve your trust and you will be so glad that you let them into your life.

, Meet new people! You never know who's going to surprise you and take your life in a whole new, amazing direction. Whether you're making new friends, making new romantic connections, or building the family you wish you had, meeting new people is how you move on to new experiences and new happy times.


You can meet new people by joining clubs or taking classes. Try your local community center in order to find something that appeals to you.
Remember, you shouldn't close doors before you get a chance to look inside. Just because someone doesn't seem like your usual type doesn't mean that they won't make your life feel like the dream you never thought you'd realize. Give people the chance to surprise you.

, Like we said, living a great life is the best revenge. When you're pursuing your happiness, embracing life to its fullest, and doing things that make you feel fulfilled, all the stuff that hurt you before is going to feel like a Cliffnote. Don't sweat the past and instead look forward to the future!

Relax and take some time alone.,
Self-soothe.,
Re-frame the situation.,
Let out frustration.",How to Get Over a Friend's Betrayal2," Meditate, shop or dance. Do something that you enjoy to take your mind off of everything. Do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better. You are more likely to find a worthwhile solution while doing something you enjoy or having fun. It sounds counter-intuitive, but creative solutions often come out of doing something fun even if is not related to the task at hand.


Relating back to the example above, you should remove yourself from the situation. You don't want to be around people who know your secret. Retreat. Remove yourself from the situation. Go do something relaxing.

, Avoid self-blame. Don’t assume that everything is all your fault and you always mess things up. Try not over generalize with statements like, “This always happens to me.” Over generalizing leads to depression.Everyone makes mistakes and has accidents. “Bad things” happen to everyone. Blaming yourself for everything that has occurred paralyzes you from moving forward, which makes it harder for you to let go and move on with your healing.If we continue with the previous example, don't beat yourself up for telling your ""big mouth"" friend your secret. Instead of thinking, ""I'm so stupid. Why did I do that?"" Think, ""Well, I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes.""

, If you believe that your friend has betrayed you, and you have not received an apology, re-frame the incident so that the blame is not placed on you. It’s imperative that you manage your own feelings about the situation in a way that is healthy for you so that you can move forward. Re-framing also helps you work toward forgiveness.For instance, instead of thinking that it's all your fault, think about how you now realize that your friend talks a lot and can't keep secrets. Although you know that now, you didn't know it at the time when you shared your secret. You made the best decision that you could at the time. If you could choose again, you would do it differently.

, For many people, the best way to let out frustration is to vent. So, choose a person who you trust that does not mind listening to you talk about the betrayal. You may want to choose a person who is far removed from the situation to avoid bias or any further conflicts among friends. Vetting helps you release your negative emotions about the situation.Try not to be too emotional or too negatively entangled in what happened. For you are stuck in avoidance or self-blame, you won’t be able to express yourself adequately.
Choose a person who is not likely to “have a pity party” with you. You don’t want your confidante to become sad and hopeless after hearing your story especially if you already feel that way. Choose a person who will remain positive and might be able to offer you good suggestions about what to do. If you’re not the kind of person who wants to vent to others, then there are other ways of getting out your frustration especially if you’re active person, or even if you’re not. Go on a walk or a run to release some of those negative emotions. If you play a sport, play with friends or kick a ball around. Boxing, kickboxing and even yoga all can be helpful ways to get your stress out of your body.Talk to another friend about your feelings of betrayal. If you don't have a friend or family member to talk to, then journal about it.

Forgive.,
Decide if you want to maintain a relationship with the person.,
Consider the event a life lesson.",How to Get Over a Friend's Betrayal3," Or, at least be open to forgiving. Even if you don’t receive an apology from the person who has betrayed you, you still have to be willing to forgive the person so that you can move on. Consider forgiving your friend as a gift to yourself, not as a gift to the friend who betrayed you.



If you forgive, you can let the incident go and move on. If you don’t, then it keeps you in the situation -- stuck there. Without forgiving, you’ll likely hold a grudge, and months or years later you might still be mad as if the incident just occurred.[
Ideally the friend who betrayed you should offer an apology, and the apology would be weighed in your decision to forgive. However, many times there is no apology, or there’s an insincere apology,neither of which can be weighed in your decision. So, many times you will have to work through the forgiveness stage irrespective of what the friend who has betrayed you has done because there might not be an apology.Try not to think about it over and over and over again. Once you forgive, pack up the situation , put it in a box and move on. One way to catch yourself and stop yourself from thinking about it is to wear a rubber band on your wrist. Then, snap the band every time that you think about it.Forgive yourself for telling your friend your secret. You didn't know that your friend couldn't keep a secret.

, Many times, a friend who has betrayed you once will do it again, but this depends on the situation and the person. So, you have to decide if you want the person in your life as a friend, an associate or not at all.


If you decide that you still want the person in your life but to a lesser degree, you might consider the person an acquaintance instead of friend. Or, if you feel it is best, you might not want any sort of relationship with this person at all.
If you find that you no longer want to be friends with this person, sever all ties with him or her. You don't have to be mean about it. Assuming you talked to your friend about it, he already knows that you are upset with him, which will make ending your friendship easier.
If your best friend leaves you for other friends the best way to feel better is to make yourself a better person and not stoop to her level .Think what you care about! Is someone who doesn't care about you really important !Or do you come first .For example if you both go to the same school the best was is to beat her academic wise .Try studying extra at home to beat her .One day she will regret leaving you because deep down she is just a user if she left you for others .
If you find that you want to maintain your friendship, make sure the other person understands that you feel like they did something wrong, but you have forgiven them and want to continue being friends.
If your friend is not remorseful or apologetic and you still want to maintain a relationship with person, then really consider it. You might be setting yourself up for a repeat event.
You could continue to maintain a relationship with your friend, but you won't be telling your friend anymore major secrets. However, if you feel like you tell all your friends major secrets, then you will have to re-consider your friendship with this person.

, Think of it as a lesson learned. Now, you know the signs and symptoms of a betrayal, and you can pinpoint them in the future. This, of course, will keep you from making the same mistake again, or from possibly being betrayed again. Of course, you cannot control if someone betrays you. However, you can control if you will be caught off guard, and how you will deal with it if it happens.Now you know that some people can't keep secrets even if that person is your best friend. Next time, you'll think twice about telling someone a major secret especially if this person cannot keep secrets.

Admit your wrongdoing.,
Explain why you betrayed their trust.,
Tell them their feelings are completely valid.,
Apologize for your actions.",How to Earn Your Friend's Trust Back (Girls)1," If you spilled a secret or gossiped about your friend, own up to it. The sooner the truth is out in the open, the sooner you can apologize and start to repair your friendship. By confessing what you did, you will show your friend that you are remorseful, honest, and eager to make things right.For example, you might say something like, “Krista, I have something to tell you. I told Jennifer about that secret that you told me.”
This may seem to make things worse instead of better. And it might– at first! However, your friend will eventually realize that you are an honest and good friend who will be truthful and upfront in uncomfortable situations.;
, This can sometimes be a tricky thing to pinpoint, and an even harder thing to admit. Think long and hard about why you did whatever you did. Did you tell one of their secrets because you were mad at them for something? Were you trying to fit in with a crowd by talking poorly about them? Figure out why you betrayed their trust, and tell them.For example, you might say something like, “I didn’t mean to tell Jennifer what you said. It just came out.”
This doesn’t mean you should make excuses for your behavior. Rather, it just shows your friend that you recognize where you went wrong, and why.

, If they’re angry and refusing to speak with you, tell them that you understand why. If they’re upset, tell them you would be upset too in their shoes.Your friend needs to know that you completely acknowledge how they feel and are at their mercy.


For example, you might say something like, “You have every right to be angry at me and hurt by what I did.”
If you try to downplay their hurt feelings, you will only make them defensive. Even if you think they’re being dramatic or over-the-top, just bite your tongue if you truly want to earn your friend’s trust back.

, After you have explained what you did and why, you will need to make a sincere apology for your actions. Your apology does not need to be anything fancy. It can just be something simple and straightforward, but you may also want to let your friend know that you want to earn back his or her trust.


For example, you might say, “I am sorry for what I did and for how it has affected you. I want to try to regain your trust, and I hope you are willing to let me try."""

Listen to your sister's side of the story.,
Remember what it was like to be your sister's age.,
Consider your sister’s motivations.,
Tell a parent or caretaker what is happening.",How to Stop Your Little Sister from Annoying You1," When you are having any kind of conflict with another person, it’s best to to avoid dealing with the problem while you are feeling angry, frustrated, or upset.You will probably not communicate well, and may just make the situation worse.


If possible, remove yourself physically from your little sister. Talk about what happened when you both feel calmer.
If you can’t get away, try to keep your head. Blowing up at her will only make things worse. Take a breath and count to ten before responding.;
, Instead of saying, “You are such a brat!” or or “Why won’t you leave me alone?” try telling her, “When you do that, I feel sad/hurt/disrespected/upset. It hurts my feelings. Do you like it when people hurt your feelings?” This helps your sister understand the impact of her behavior and teaches her that her actions have consequences.Using ""I"" language rather than blaming, criticizing, or accusing your sister will also show her that you respect her. She will be much more likely to treat you with respect in return., How is she experiencing your conflict? Even if you continue to disagree, understanding where she's coming from will help you both move toward a solution., Were you always totally rational, or did you sometimes do ridiculous or embarrassing things? Do you think you ever annoyed people? Do you remember how it felt when people you loved or looked up to were mean to you? Your sister’s brain is still developing, and she needs patience as she figures out how to interact with others. The more empathy you show her, the more she will learn, and the less annoying she will become., If you want to change her behavior, you have to understand why she acts the way she does.Although it may not always seem like it, your sister looks up to you. She wants to spend time with you, and to know that you love and respect her.If you show her that you do, your relationship with her will become much easier.


Consider the consequences of your own actions. For example, if you give your sister the silent treatment she will become desperate for your attention, which may make her even more annoying. On the other hand, if you make sure that the two of you spend a little bit of quality time together every week she will be much more likely to accept it when you say, “I’m sorry, I can’t play with you right now, I’m doing something else.”Learn to compromise. Your sister's needs may be different from yours, but objectively speaking, they are just as important as your own. You cannot always meet her demands, and sometimes her youth will mean her reactions aren't as mature as you'd prefer. If you strive to meet in the middle when possible, however, you'll eliminate considerable conflict on both sides., If your sister is getting on your last nerve, reach out to an adult for help.


Remember, people will be less inclined to help if you get personal, or if you overreact: “She’s so annoying! Make her stop!” or, “You always take her side!”
Instead, focus on the problem: “She’s come into my room without knocking every day this week, and I feel like I can’t get any privacy. Could you try talking to her about it?” or, “She starts screaming every time I say no to her, and I’m having a lot of trouble handling it. Do you have any ideas?”Ask your parent or guardian for regular ""alone time"" to talk about life in general -- and your relationship with your little sister. Checking in on a regular basis will give your parent or guardian the knowledge they need to monitor your interactions with your little sister before they hit the crisis stage of serious irritation. Your parent or guardian should take similar time to talk with your sibling(s)."

Give your friend time.,
Have a conversation about trust.,
Show them your trustworthiness.,
Confide in your friend.,
Try to be patient.",How to Earn Your Friend's Trust Back (Girls)2," You won’t be able to earn their trust back overnight. This doesn’t mean to ignore your friend or stop spending time with them. Instead, just realize that they may not be spilling their heart out to you right away. Show your friend that you’re not going anywhere and that you truly appreciate and treasure their friendship. Eventually, they’ll open back up.Be consistent. Don’t flake on plans or neglect your friend when they may need you. Show that you’re loyal and show that you’re dependable.

, Talking with your friend about what trust means to both of you may help you to ensure that you do not break your friend’s trust again. Try talking with your friend about what behaviors indicate trust to her and what behaviors would be a betrayal of trust. Ask her what she needs from you to feel safe enough to continue your friendship.


For example, your friend might indicate that she defines trustworthy behavior as keeping her secrets, being open and honest with her, and never saying negative things about her behind her back.
Your friend might also define untrustworthy behavior as keeping secrets from her, lying to her, or speaking ill of her behind her back.
Your friend might request that you tell her the next time that someone is gossiping about her, even if you think the news might hurt her feelings.

, If you tell your friend someone else’s secrets, or spend your time gossiping about others, you aren’t demonstrating that you are a person of integrity or loyalty. If you betray other people, your friend may assume you’ll betray them too. The most important thing you can do is to show your friend that you’ve learned from your mistake.


This can be a hard habit to break, but really focus on speaking only positively when you’re around this friend.

, By allowing yourself to be open and vulnerable around your friend, you’ll show them that you trust them. You’ll create an environment of sharing, and that will help them warm back up to you. Trust is mutual, and if you start revealing things to them, they will be more likely to reveal things to you.Exposing secrets and flaws to other people requires courage. By showing courage and trusting in your friend, you’ll hopefully give them that same courage to trust in you.

, Building trust can be a long, challenging process. This is especially true if someone has experienced a significant betrayal.Try to be patient with your friend as you work to regain your friend’s trust.


Try to be as dependable and consistent as possible when working to rebuild your friend’s trust in you. Keep the promises you make and follow through when you say that you will do something.

Stay true to your word.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Walk in their shoes.",How to Earn Your Friend's Trust Back (Girls)3," Your friend may forgive you and begin trusting you again, but they may not do it a second time or a third time. You need to stick to your promises and keep their secrets private.It doesn’t matter if they make you mad, tell you the juiciest secret of all time, or spill one of your secrets– you will never win by being a gossipy or untrustworthy person.

, If you have a bad habit of talking about others or spilling secrets, own up to it and make a change. Make a goal of not talking about anyone else for one day, then a week, and so on. Challenge yourself to talk about personal experiences, or ask others about theirs, instead of talking about people who aren’t around.Eventually, you’ll break the habit.


If you’ve earned your friend’s trust back and you want to keep it, you must change your behavior so it doesn’t happen again.

, Remember how it felt when someone gossiped about you or told one of your secrets. It probably didn’t feel very good. Remember that feeling, and use it as motivation to not make others feel that bad. You don’t want to be known as a mean or catty person, so aim to be a friend that makes people feel happy, loved, and safe.

Establish family rules.,
Be a good role model.,
Be kind.,
Be clear about your expectations.,
Follow through.,
Reward good behavior.,
Walk away from bad behavior.,
Remember that in the end, you aren't your sister's parent.",How to Stop Your Little Sister from Annoying You2," Sit down with your parents at a time when you're both calm and set ground rules for interacting during conflicts. These rules will help you handle conflicts fairly and set expectations for how certain situations will be addressed.


For example, you might set a rule that distinguishes between ""tattling"" and ""telling"" -- ""tattling"" is done just to get someone in trouble (""Jane tracked mud in the house!""), while ""telling"" is done to keep someone out of bigger trouble (""Ann is standing on the counter and I'm worried she'll fall off!"")., Even though it may not always seem like it, your little sister looks to you as an example of how she should act.If you blow up over small things, pinch her, or raise your voice, she will copy that behavior.


When you interact with your little sister, ask yourself, “How would I feel or react if she treated me this way?”
If you mess up and raise your voice in a moment of anger, apologize to her later, when you’ve calmed down. She will learn from your example, and may start to return the favor when she messes up., When you are angry it can be tempting to lash out physically at your little sister, but it is never okay to hurt her on purpose, even if she hurts you first. Remember, you are bigger and stronger than her, and it is unfair to take advantage of that.Hitting her won’t change much, either; she is more likely to resent you than to regret her actions, and if she’s mad at you she’s more likely to be annoying., Explain what you want, what will happen if she doesn’t do it, and what will happen if she does.


If you don’t want your sister to come into your room, for example, say something like, “This is my space, and you need to respect that. If you come in here without asking, I’m going to tell Mom, and I won’t play with you that night. If you respect my privacy for a whole week, though, you can come sit on my bed this weekend, and we’ll play any board game you want.”

, If you tell your sister a certain behavior will earn her a certain reward, make sure she gets that reward if she behaves. On the other hand, if you tell her a certain behavior will have a negative consequence, make sure that consequence happens if she doesn’t behave. If she expects you to lie to her or trick her, she probably won’t listen to what you say.


This also means that you should avoid saying things like, “If you don’t leave me alone, I’m never talking to you again!” You sister knows that you will have to talk to her again at some point, so your threat will be meaningless, and she will have no reason to listen to you.

, This is especially important when your sister is behaving well without being told to.


If your sister goes a whole evening without pestering you, tell her, “I really appreciated how well you kept yourself entertained while I was doing my homework tonight. That was awesome.” Give her a high-five, or better yet, spend a little time hanging out with her. It will mean the world to her that you noticed that she was being good, and she will want to impress you again in the future.

, Saying, “If you need to be upset for a while, that’s okay, but I can’t talk to you while you’re like this,” and then calmly disengaging yourself, can be far more powerful than yelling and screaming at your little sister to leave you alone.It may lead to a tantrum at first—your sister is desperate for your attention, and being annoying is one of the easiest ways to get it.


Don’t leave your sister alone and unsupervised if she is very small, but don’t try to calm her down or reason with her while she is kicking and screaming. Negative attention is still attention, and if you respond to her tantrums by engaging with her she will learn that throwing tantrums is a good way to get you to interact with her.
Once she's calmed down, be ready to re-engage.

, As an older sibling, you are a valuable role model and even a teacher. Establishing strong expectations and following through on what you've said are important ways to exercise these responsibilities.


Avoid, however, the temptation to ""parent"" your sibling. Ultimately your parent or guardian is responsible for guiding your sibling's behavior. If you're a firstborn sibling, in particular, you may feel that everyone depends upon you.Younger siblings, on the other hand, can feel like they're being given less attention or are treated like babies.Let your parent or guardian be the head of the household.

Breathe.,
Get plenty of sleep and eat well.,
Keep things in perspective.,
Get some space.",How to Stop Your Little Sister from Annoying You3," Concentrating on your breathing is a tool many psychologists use to help teach people to manage anxiety. Inhale slowly through your nose for about 4 seconds, hold your breath for about 2 seconds, and then exhale slowly for another 4 seconds. Pause for a couple seconds, and repeat. This will work best if you are breathing from your diaphragm—this means that your stomach should inflate when you inhale, rather than your chest., You have probably noticed that you tend to be crankier when you are tired or hungry. Taking care of your body will help you stay sane when your little sister starts annoying you., Remember that a big part of what makes your sister annoying is that she is still little. While it may feel like she’s always going to make you angry, it may help to remember that she is growing and learning every day. She won’t always be this aggravating. Remind yourself that you love her, and that this moment won’t feel very important in another week or so.Remember the many positive aspects of having a sibling. You and your sister will always have each other. It's highly likely that the person you find so annoying at this stage in your life will grow into a lifelong friend.
Make a list of kind, helpful, or loving things your little sister has done for you. Keep it for future reference to remind yourself of her good qualities when you're finding her especially annoying., While giving your sister the silent treatment will only make matters worse, you'll cope more effectively if you take some time for yourself. Visit a friend, go for a walk, spend some time doing something you love, or sit in your room with your headphones on for a while."

, If you see your friend while you are out, say ""Good Morning"" ""How are you?"" or whatever that shows you care about your friend.

, If your friend seems down, give them a hug if possible. This will just make their day and make the rest of their day good.

, Tell them you are always there for them, they can talk to you ""anytime"" they want of anything. These will help them.

Ask your parents for your own room.",How to Stop Your Brother from Annoying You," If your brother is being difficult, you may have to try temporarily ignoring him. This isn't a very effective strategy for long-term sibling relationships, but if you want to avoid lashing out in anger, the best response is to just ignore him.Not responding is not a sign of weakness. If anything, it takes more strength and willpower to resist lashing out at your brother or sinking to his antics.
Remember that you have to pick and choose your battles. You can't engage with your brother every single time he annoys you, especially if he's not very communicative.
If you don't give your brother the response he wants (getting upset or irritated), he'll tire himself out eventually and give up on it.;
, If your brother is annoying you, you may be tempted to lash out at him in anger or respond with equally-annoying behavior. However, that type of reaction will only make things worse. Any time you feel an urge to respond with harsh words or annoying behavior, remember that being calm and collected is more likely to break your brother out of his annoying behavior than getting angry.Take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Keep your focus on your breathing pattern to calm down quickly.Try counting to 10 before responding. Take deep breaths in and out during that 10 second count, and try to think about how to express yourself calmly and rationally.
Go for a short walk or leave the room for a few minutes if you need to compose yourself for longer than 10 seconds. Let your brother know you'll be right back, and think about what you want to say and how best to say it.

, Any time you can negotiate a peaceful resolution with your brother, you should try to do so. Sometimes that may require compromising on some aspect of the situation, or even putting your brother's needs before yours for a short period of time. Ultimately, though, this will help de-escalate the situation and may help prevent future conflicts.Ask your brother directly what it is he wants to communicate to you.
Let your brother feel heard and validated, and try to rephrase the things he says. Say something like, ""I think I understand where you're coming from. You're saying you feel ____ when I _____, and that's causing problems.""
Try to arrive at a mutually-beneficial solution. Ask your brother for input, offer your own input, and try to compromise.
Recognize that no one is going to get their way all the time. The goal is to arrive at a solution that both you and your brother feel somewhat satisfied with, even if it's not the solution you'd hoped for.

, A common cause of annoying sibling behavior is simple boredom. Perhaps your brother is bored, or feels like he's not getting enough attention. Instead of giving him negative attention by fighting back or engaging in your own annoying behavior, try doing something fun and productive together.Doing something fun together should take your brother's attention away from being annoying pretty quickly, and it might help the two of you bond over the shared experience.
Try going for a walk or riding bikes together (if you're still young, make sure you get your parents' permission first), or do something indoors like watching a movie, putting together a puzzle, or playing video games together (although this may cause more fights).

, It can be very difficult to not be personally offended or bothered by insulting/annoying behavior. However, at the end of the day, your brother is still your sibling, and he does actually care about you. Let your brother know that he's upsetting you and try to find a resolution, but don't take it personally.Know that your brother probably isn't trying to actually hurt your feelings. Some people (especially at a younger age) just don't know any better.
Your brother probably won't remember the annoying or hurtful things he said/did in an hour, so don't waste your time holding a grudge.
Remember that by letting your brother's behavior upset you, you're giving him all the power. If he sees that he's bothering you, he's more likely to keep up with the annoying/hurtful behavior.

, If your brother is jealous about some aspect of your life, he may be acting out as a way of expressing his frustration. If you think this may be the case, you may want to at least attempt to have a direct and honest conversation with your brother about how his jealousy hurts your feelings and makes things difficult between you.Think about your situation and the times your brother has lashed out at you with annoying behavior. Is it possible he's jealous of your grades, your possessions, or your lifestyle?
Your brother is probably motivated by a simple urge to vent his frustrations.
If your brother is jealous because something you're doing now takes away from the time you used to spend together, the best way to calm his feelings may be to spend more time with him. However, it's important to set your own limits and boundaries, and let him know that he needs to respect them.

, Your brother's jealousy is probably related to not getting enough attention. If you make him feel better about himself by finding things to feel good about, it might help snap him out of his jealous streak.Even if you can't get your brother the same thing he's jealous you have, you can help him find something to be happy about. That might help curb his annoying behavior, at least temporarily.
Give credit to your brother for the things he's good at. If your brother is jealous that you made the soccer team, remind him how good he is at other activities, or talk about how good he's doing in school.

, If your brother's annoying behavior is motivated by jealousy, one way to resolve the situation is to help him get what you have (or something like it). This obviously won't be feasible all of the time, but in certain situations it can help calm down a jealous sibling. Plus, if your brother sees you trying to help him, he might learn to be less resentful of you.If your brother is jealous of your good grades, offer to help him study.
If he's jealous of the fact that you're better at him in sports, spend some time playing catch or practicing with him to help him improve.
If he's jealous that you have a significant other and he doesn't, offer to help him ask someone out (if he's old enough to date).
No matter what it is your brother is jealous of, the point is to show him that he's not limited to what he currently has. If you offer to help him get the thing that he wants, he'll be even more receptive to changing his present situation.

, As you and your brother grew up together, you've probably had your share of fights. However, sometimes squabbles cross a line and become hostile acts or even bully-like behavior. In those instances, it's best to get a parent involved who can mediate the situation and take action as needed.Picking on a sibling is normal. However, if your brother continuous to torment you about the same topic over a period of several days or weeks, it might be bully behavior.
If your brother doesn't apologize or try to make up with you after a fight, or continues to show hostility towards you at all times, it's a sign of bullying.
Having some type of advantage, like being bigger/older/more popular, can quickly turn simple sibling rivalries into a bullying situation.
If you think your brother is legitimately bullying you, talk to a parent right away.

, If you believe that a situation is out of control and you haven't been able to reach any kind of agreement on your own, it may be helpful to have one or both parents moderate a conversation. This can allow both you and your brother to express your thoughts and feelings on the conflict in a safe, supportive environment. Your parents can also help keep the peace if a disagreement arises, and ultimately give some type of command on how to proceed.Have your parents sit down with both of you individually, then together to moderate a family discussion.
Encourage your parents to try and find a solution that makes everyone happy. Ideally, you should be able to arrive at some type of win/win situation.
If you were unsuccessful at reaching a compromise on your own with your brother, your parents' final say in the matter should resolve the conflict.

, If your parents are ignoring your brother's aggressive, annoying, or otherwise problematic behavior, you may need to bring it to their attention. Ask your parents to be fair and apply the same rules to both you and your brother, and to enforce the rules to keep the peace.Your parents may not be aware of the situation, or may not realize its extent.
It's easy for parents to get caught up between work and family distractions. Make a point of bringing problems to your parents' attention when you haven't been able to resolve those issues on your own.

, This may not stop your brother in the moment from being annoying, but it can help you build a stronger sibling relationship. It can also provide a much-needed break from any tension that might have been building between you at home.Sometimes getting out of the house and having a positive, shared experience can help you bond with a sibling.
At the very least, a group outing should distract your brother from his problematic behavior.
You can use the time with your family to find things that make everyone happy, and try to incorporate those elements into your everyday lives.

, Whether you're the older sibling or the younger one, you may find it frustrating to spend a lot of time with your brother when he's exhibiting annoying behavior. If your parents have you watch your brother a lot or make you bring him with you when you go out, talk to them about spending more time alone or with your friends independent of your brother.A growing sense of independence and individuality is one of the biggest reasons siblings end up fighting when they spend time together.
Let your parents know that you value the time you and your family spend together, but that you really need more time by yourself or with your friends.
Remind your parents that you and your brother can still be close while spending more time apart. If anything, it will make the time you do spend together be of greater quality.

, Depending on your age and your family's living situation, your parents may frequently ask you to watch your brother. If this is the case, you may find it difficult to have your own space and time alone. Talk to your parents about finding alternatives or working out a compromise.


Suggest hiring a babysitter. If your parents are resistant to the idea, you could at least ask for some type of extra allowance or compensation for babysitting.
You might try suggesting that you could continue to babysit your brother once or twice each week if you get to have the weekends to yourself without your brother.
It's best to have this conversation without your brother present, as he may have hurt feelings or voice objection. Younger children often have a hard time understanding why someone who is older might have more responsibility or freedom.

, If you have friends or a significant other over, it's important to set boundaries with your brother. Your visitors shouldn't be subjected to your brother's annoying behavior, especially if he tries to direct that behavior at your friends.


Tell your brother to stop. If he won't listen, try getting your parents involved.
Try inviting friends over when you know your brother won't be home or will be busy with his own friends.
If your brother won't stop and your parents won't intervene, putting a lock on your door might be the only way to enforce your right to privacy when friends are visiting.
Ask your parents before you install any locks, or they may get upset or suspicious.

, Sharing a room can be a great bonding experience if you and your brother get along reasonably well. If you don't get along or if you simply need your own space, ask your parents about rearranging your home to accommodate your needs. There may be an extra room being used as a craft room or home office, for example, that could be an extra bedroom.Depending on your living situation, having your room may simply not be an option. You may have limitations on space that would make it impossible for you and your brother to have your own rooms.
If your family is limited by space, you may be able to rearrange a room to allow for you to have your own space. Talk to your parents about converting a home office into a bedroom, or perhaps part of the basement or attic.
When you talk to your parents and make your request, frame the petition as an issue of privacy. It's much easier for a parent to make arrangements if it ensures privacy, rather than simply to solve a short-term dispute.
You might say something like, ""Mom and Dad, I know we don't have a ton of extra space. But I'm getting older, and I'd really like it if we could try to find a way for me to have my own room so I can have more privacy.""
If your parents are planning on moving, let them know that you would really appreciate it if having separate rooms were a factor in choosing your new home.

If matters are worse, ask your parents for advice and see what they can do to help strengthen the relationship between you and your sibling.",How to Stop Fighting With Your Brother or Sister2," Let him/her know that you've noticed that you two have been fighting a lot. However, while explaining that, do not point out that it's his/her fault or he/she has started most of the fights. Otherwise, your sibling may feel defensive, and you'll soon find the two of you bickering over this!

, Wait for him/her to be finished talking, then make a few comments of your own as well. However, do not take too much time in this for there are the negative points you must face as well. Also, your sibling might get bored of this conversation and want to leave, possibly sparking another fight between you two.

, Do not interrupt your sibling while he/she is talking or feel defensive about some comments that he/she makes. It will be your turn to talk soon, and it's best that you know what you've been doing wrong.


Listen to what your sibling has to say. Then, he/she may feel obliged to fully listen to you when it's your turn to speak.

, However, when telling your sibling, do not start off with an accusatory tone or he/she might immediately feel defensive. Instead, use a polite and kind tone while saying words similar to, ""Well, I've noticed that we don't do our fair share of chores a lot. Maybe we should both work on that.""


Keep in mind that saying ""we"" is better than saying ""you"" because ""we"" means the two of you will work together on this. It's not just your sibling that has to work on it.

, Although you two may want to work on all the areas at once, it's easier said than done! It will become harder for you to balance all of those areas at once so it's better to tackle a few at a time.


If you feel that your relationship isn't strong enough to handle two or three areas, stick to one if necessary. However, don't procrastinate in handling the other areas!

If he/she asks, ""Why did you do that for me?"" respond with: ""Because I wanted to.""


This shows your sibling that - despite all the fighting you do with him/her - you still love him/her and you desire a better relationship.
Even if your sibling doesn't take time to do something in return for you, don't feel discouraged, but keep on being nice and kind to him/her. Note that you shouldn't be kind to him/her once in a while, but you should keep being nice ever single day whether he/she deserves it or not!

They might be lonely or just bored. You could say, “I’ll hang out with you in one hour if you let me be alone now.”

Feel good about asserting yourself, and be prepared to do it again.,
Reflect on what went well in your conversation and what could go better next time.,
Change the way you talk to yourself.,
Make an effort to reach out to your sister more.,
Talk to your parents and friends about the situation.",How to Stand up to a Mean Sister," Typically, if you feel like you are being picked on, you are in one of two situations. Either, one, you are having a trouble sticking up for yourself and saying what you need, or, two, you feel like your needs are more important than your sister’s. You can make both of these situations better if you learn how to understand yourself and your sister better. If you are having trouble expressing yourself, you should identify what you need from your sister or why you feel wronged by her, and put it into words. You can use a journal to write about your experiences and feelings to clarify for you what is going on. For example, you might write “I feel hurt when she ignores the things that I say. It makes me feel stupid and then it makes me angry.”;
, Think about what she is doing that makes you feel stressed or uncomfortable. Especially if your sister is making you feel uncomfortable, this might be a sign that you are being walked on in an unfair way. Break down the things that go wrong in your relationship and pinpoint what actions you can ask her to stop doing or things you can ask her to stop saying.


For example, you might feel uncomfortable when she walks into your room and starts looking for something without asking. Perhaps she gives a reason for why she walked in and acts like it is okay that she is in your room. Do not be distracted by her reason or attitude. Think about specifically what she did wrong in this situation, and that is your boundary. In this example, she needs to knock before she walks in.
Make your boundary more specific. If you don’t want her to walk in without knocking, how should she knock? Can she come in if you aren’t in your room? Decide on reasonable and more specific limits for your boundary. For example, you could say, “You aren’t allowed to come in my room without knocking. If I am not here, you have to text me to ask before you go in my room.”

, You can often discover where part or most of your problems with her come from if you pay attention and understand the other things that are going on in her life. When she is arguing with you or talking in general, pay close attention to what she says, and pay attention to her body language, too. Think about whether she seems stressed out about anything else in her life. Think about the bigger picture of her life and why she is stressed about those things. If you are able to pick up on the reasons why your sister is upset, you might be able to avoid your problems with your sister.

Are there any particular situations that trigger fights between you two? If you can pinpoint the places or times that you two seem to clash, you can often find ways to avoid your fights/problems.
For example, if you notice that she gets upset with you when she is getting ready for school, you can avoid her during that time in the morning.

, Consider whether there are other factors that are making the situation with your sister worse on your side. For example, are you having problems at school? Do you have difficulty with your parents? If you notice that you have a lot of problems with your sister after you hang out with your friends, for example, think about what influence your friends are having on you.


With this knowledge of yourself, you can think about ways to avoid having the same problems with your sister after you hang out with your friends. For example, you might tell your sister something nice when you see her after spending time with your friends to start your conversation off on a good note. Or you might avoid particular topics of conversation with her; for example, if she asks you what you did today, you can say something small and change the topic.

, Have a conversation with your sister before you have another problem. She will probably be more likely to hear you out. If you aren’t able to, you can also ask her why you are having problems when you are about to have a fight or problem. Asking her to talk about it is the first step in sticking up for yourself. Have the conversation when you have enough free time to discuss what is going on in your relationship and where you can have a conversation without being interrupted.


If you are having problems, stop the fight and say something like, “Stop. I don’t want to fight. I’ve noticed we have been having problems lately, and I want to talk about it.”
If you are starting the conversation with her, ask her honestly, “I want to know what you think is going on between us.”
Explain that you want to help make things better. You should ask her something like, “What can I do to make things better?”

, Some of the things she says will probably make you angry, and you should anticipate this. Realize that you need to keep quiet, not interrupt, and hear her out before you defend yourself. If you can pay attention to what she says, you will be better able to explain your side and understand her better.


Nod along to the things that she says.
Make and keep eye contact with your sister while she is talking.
Ask her clarifying questions. You can say something like, “So are you saying that you want me to leave you alone when you are hanging out with your friends unless you ask me to hang out?”

, Depending on your sister and your relationship with your sister, you may need to defend yourself in different ways. If your sister does well with people who are straightforward, you should clarify with her what is going on with you using simple assertions.

This means you tell her something or ask for something directly.

Start with the good, for example, “I appreciate it when you let me use your computer.”
Be honest and straightforward about your problems. You can say, “But I think we have some problems that we should work on.”
Tell her something that you need from her. For example, you can say, “I’d like you to knock before you come in my room.”
You can explain to her how you feel, for example, say “Because I feel like I can’t trust you when you come in my room without asking.”

, This is especially good to do if your sister is someone who cares about being heard and/or is an emotional person. When you talk to her, include what you think she might feel when you are explaining what is going on with you. Do this to let her know that you are thinking about her feelings, too.


If you are starting with the positive, you can say, “I know you don’t have to let me use your computer, so I am happy that let me use it when I need to.”
You can also use empathy in talking about what you need, too. For example, you can say “I can understand why you think that you don’t need to knock when you come into my room because we used to share a room, but I need my own space now. Please knock before you come in- every time you come in my room.”

, This way to talk to your sister could be good for a sister who needs you to be nice to her on some days and firm with her on other days. If, however, she doesn’t listen to you and keeps doing the things you asked her not to, you may want to use an escalating assertion in the steps below. This does not mean that you become aggressive with your sister. Being more firm just shows that you are serious about your boundaries.


Start nice, and say something like, “I’m happy to have you come in my room, but I need you to knock first.” Say this is a nice but firm way.
If she doesn’t listen, get more firm, and say something like, “Amanda, do not come into my room unless you knock first.” Keep your voice serious, but do not get mean or shout. Shouting will not help you communicate with her.
If it keeps happening, tell her no in a more serious way, say something like, “Amanda, I’ve asked you twice to knock before you come into my room. Stay out of my room until I tell you that you can come into my room.” Let your tone be serious and firm, but do not get emotional or yell. This will make it seem like you are out of control.
Remember that if she doesn’t agree, there is nothing you can do about it. All you can do is stand your ground.

, For example, if you notice your sister is eating your food even though she said she wouldn’t, you can use these I-Statements to tell her how you feel. There are 4 parts to the I-Statement:


Describe the things your sister is doing and the facts of the situation specifically- “Amanda, you are eating the food I saved for my lunch today.” Don’t use accusations when you talk to her by saying things like, “You stole my food.” or “You don’t care about me.” Because you aren’t a mind reader, and you don’t want to accidently assume something that is incorrect.
Tell your sister how her behavior impacts you. For example, you can say, “I saved that food and was looking forward to eating it today and now I have to find something else to eat and I don’t have a lot of time or good options.”
Then tell her how that makes you feel. Say something like, “And when you eat my food it makes me feel like you don’t care about me.”
Give a solution to the problem and/or explain the situation more. For example, “I want you to ask me if you can eat my food next time. If I am not around, send me a text. And sometimes I do have extra food that I would be happy to share with you.”

, Do not yell or get mean with your sister. If you want your sister to respect you, you need to learn how to communicate with her without getting mean or loud. If you can’t control your emotions, she might see this as a weakness and try to distract you from the conversation by starting an argument with you.


Practicing what you will say in a role play with your friend or in the mirror before you talk to her will help you to stay calm in your conversation. Try to focus on being matter of fact and natural in your tone of voice.

, Ask a friend or family member if he or she can pretend to be your sister to practice what you want to say to her. Find someone who knows your sister, and have him or her act the same way your sister acts with you. You can practice telling her your boundaries or asserting yourself.


Write down the things you want to say to your sister and practice saying them in your role play. Have your friend respond the way he/she thinks your sister would respond so that you can practice defending yourself to your sister.
You can also practice listening to your sister. Have your friend role play your sister explaining what is going on, and you can practice active listening. Once again, write down the questions you want to ask her about your problems and think of follow up questions to ask. Show you are listening in your role play by nodding along and making good eye contact.

, What happens after you have stuck up for yourself is not as important as the fact that you stuck up for yourself. Sticking up for yourself is hard and you should be proud that you did it. It is a good practice that you will need to learn to do many times before things start to change because sticking up for yourself is not a one time fix thing. While you are in the confrontation, tell yourself that you are doing the right thing. And again after the conversation, remind yourself that it was good to talk to your sister and set your boundaries no matter how she handles it.

, Don’t be down if there were bad parts of your conversation or if your sister didn’t seem to listen to you. Think about what you did or said that you were glad that you did. Plan on saying things differently, listening better, or reacting to her better based on your conversation.

, People talk to themselves in their heads and sometimes that self talk becomes negative and starts repeating. When it comes to your sister, make sure that you don’t dwell on only the bad things in your relationship.It is good to think about the ways that we are not being treated right and stick up for ourselves, but we shouldn’t dwell on these things because it might make things worse. Learning how to change your negative self talk positive can help you to reduce your stress in other parts of your life, too.


For example, if you find yourself repeating negative things to yourself like, “I will never like her,” this might make you more bitter toward your sister. And feeling bitter or resentful will make it harder for you two to have a good relationship. Find ways to make your thoughts more positive. You don’t have to lie, but you can say something like, “Sometimes I feel like I really don’t like my sister, but occasionally she sticks up for me with our parents, and I can tell she cares about me.”
Refocus on the good things. After a bad conversation you can say to yourself, “No matter what happened, I didn’t lose my cool.”

, If you have a difficult relationship with your sister, your sister may feel like you don’t like her, and that might not help your relationship. Find ways to make connections with your sister. Think about what you have in common or what you might be able to do together that is fun. For example, if you both love watching movies, ask her if you could go to a movie sometime together, just the two of you.


Ask your sister how things are going with her. If you have some extra time, try to check in with her in a real way. You can say something like, “Hey, what’s really going on with you?” or “How are you really doing?” Most people like it when someone really wants to know what is going on with them.
Show appreciation for the things your sister does and says. This might be hard at first, but after you have done it a couple of times, it becomes easier. When you hang out with your sister or talk to your sister, make an effort to show her that you like her. For example, laugh at her jokes, ask her questions, and tell her things you like about her. If she feels like you respect her, she might start respecting you back.
For example, if you see her helping out a friend, you might give her a compliment by saying, “Hey, I think you are a really good friend.”
If she does something for you, tell her you appreciate it. For example, you can say, “Hey, thanks for sticking up for me when mom and dad accused me of taking the keys.”

,

Get outside support to help you in your relationship with your sister. Talking to other people can help you understand the situation better. Especially with your parents, they might have insight into the situation which will help you know how to deal with your sister in a better way. With your friends, maybe they have similar relationships with their siblings that they can tell you about and that will help you to hear about. In general, sharing about what is going on with you and your sister is a healthy way to improve your relationship with your sister.

Try to avoid only talking about the negative things about your sister. You don’t want these conversations to reinforce your bad feelings for her. If you can’t think of good things to say about her, try to focus on discussing things you can do to be a better brother or sister.

Work on solutions with your siblings directly.,
Protect your diary.,
Hide your prized belongings.",How to Sibling Proof Your Room2," If you were just fighting, have a cool-down period first. Then, if your siblings are old enough to understand this concept, suggest that you make a list of solutions together that you will both agree to. For example, agree to get permission before entering each other’s rooms.List which situations would make it okay for your sibling to enter your room without asking first. For instance, if your sibling is following the family pet.
An example of a rule is, “If I’m with friends, don’t come in.”

, In order to prevent your siblings from reading your secrets, place a lock on your journal. You can wear the key to it around your neck on a necklace, or hide it somewhere in your room. If your diary is on the computer, for example in a Word document, password protect it.


For example, you can hide your diary key under your mattress.
Don’t hide the key anywhere it could be accidentally washed with the laundry, like in a pillow case or pants pocket.

, Store your favorite, valuable, or breakable items in a locked chest underneath your bed or in a closet. You could also use a cupboard with a lock to put your personal items in. If your siblings are shorter than you, hide your belongings in the closet on a high shelf so that it is out of their reach. Just be careful that you don’t drop it on yourself when you’re taking it back down!For example, a filing cabinet with drawers that lock can be bought online or at an office supply store.

Prepare to be the oldest.,
Wait for the sibling to arrive.,
Look on the bright side.,
If you do tend to think any negative thoughts, tell your parents about them.,
Read children's books.",How to Prepare for a New Sibling As an Only Child1," When your parents tell you that you're going to have a new baby brother or sister, act mature. Don't get all whiny about it; whining won't change anything.


Even though you may hate the idea of not getting what you want anymore, there is really no use in whining about it. It's happening whether you whine or not, and your parents could become annoyed with your whining.;
, Ask to go to the hospital with your parents so that you can welcome your new baby sibling to the world. You will probably have to wait a minimum of several months before your sibling comes out.

, A new sibling doesn't always mean trouble, and it certainly doesn't always mean that your parents will give your sibling more attention than they give you. Instead of thinking negative thoughts such as ""My sibling will get all the love and everything that he wants, and I will get nothing"", think positive thoughts such as ""Me and my sibling will have an excellent relationship together"".

, It is important to do this, as you are more likely to get over these negative thoughts than if you kept them to yourself. If you feel that your parents will give your sibling more attention than they give you, for instance, tell them that you'd prefer it if they gave you both equal attention. This is something important to tell them, since it is not good for your sibling to get all the attention, and it is not good for you to be ignored.

, Children's books tend to make you more confident that your new baby will not be such an annoying presence, especially if they are about older children adjusting to new siblings.

Sing to your sibling.,
Help with the feeding.,
Help calm your sibling if he or she is crying.",How to Prepare for a New Sibling As an Only Child2," Lullabies are especially helpful in getting babies to sleep, so it is advisable to sing a sweet lullaby to your sibling. Avoid loud songs, as these could cause the sibling to become wound up. Try to sing something soft instead.

, When babies are first born, they tend to sit on high chairs and be fed baby food. Even helping your parents pick up baby food at the store (or make some at home) is very helpful.

, You could try singing to him, or, talking to him nicely and in a soft manner, for example.

Scare your sister while she sleeps.",How to Scare Your Sister," Find a moment when your sister is concentrating completely, whether she's playing a video game, drawing, painting, talking on the phone, or doing her homework. Then, carefully creep up behind her. When you're as close as you can get without her detecting your presence, scream ""Boo!"" and watch her shriek with terror. If you do this correctly, then this may be the simplest and the greatest prank of all. You get bonus points if you do this when your sister doesn't even know you're home.;
, This works best if your sister thinks you're sleeping or out at a friend's house. Then, wait for a time when she thinks she's alone in the house or just in her room, and sneak your hand into the room and turn off all the lights in the room she's in. If you do this correctly, then she'll shriek in terror, wondering what the heck just happened. If your sister knows you're home, then you can grab a book and pretend to be absorbed in it in the other room if she runs in screaming.


Alternately, you can put on a scary costume and then shine a flashlight onto your face from across a dark room, so your sister really freaks out!

, If you're on a long car ride together, or just sitting in front of the TV, pretend to doze off for a few minutes. Wait until you can feel your sister coming up close to you, or even moving in toward your face. When you think she absolutely thinks you're asleep and doesn't suspect anything, let your eyes bulge open and scream at the top of your lungs. If done correctly, you can give your sister a real scare in this unexpected way.

, Invite a friend over to tell ghost stories; when your sister wants to join in, tell her she really shouldn't because the stories are way too scary for her. She'll beg and plead and you'll eventually pretend to give in. Then, before you tell your story, say that you're not sure about telling it because it really happened, and you don't want to freak her out even more. Finally, ""reluctantly"" tell a scary story that has to do with something you can use around the house, such as a killer teddy bear or a mysterious old photograph. When you're done telling the story, you and your friend should pretend to go to bed; then, later, place something, such as the old teddy bear, from the story into your sister's room and wait for her to shriek in response.

, This will only work if your sister is the type of kid who is scared of clowns. This is more common than you think, actually, so if your sister is afraid of clowns, then you should get a clown mask and scare her with it. Pick a time when she's completely not expecting it, like when she comes home from school and knows that you're sitting in a reclining chair with your back to her. When she comes toward you, then boom, turn around with the clown mask on and give her a real scare!

, Go to a novelty store and get a handful of fake bugs you can scare your sister with. Almost all kids are scared of bugs at one point or another, and leaving the bug in an unexpected place can make your sister shriek. You can place one in her backpack -- this will definitely scare her, though you may not be able there to hear her scream. You can also place the fake bugs on her pillow, in the sink, on her plate, or on other places where you know she'll least expect them to be.

, If you tend to sleep in late and your sister is in charge of waking you up sometimes, then this is the perfect prank for you. Put on a scary mask, whether it's part of a Slenderman costume, a Jason mask, a clown mask, or whatever you know will scare your sister. Then, turn toward the wall and get all bundled up in your covers. When your sister calls your name a few times to wake you up, wait for her to get close, when she's sure you're really dozing, to spring out at her in your mask. She'll definitely scream because she won't be expecting it at all.

, If you really want to go all out, then you can tap on your sister's window in the night. Though climbing on your roof isn't usually a great idea, if you're sure you can do it super safely, then you can tap on your sister's window in the middle of the night to really freak her out. You can also throw pebbles at the window or tap it with a branch. Then, quickly return to your room and pretend like you're sleeping or doing homework so she doesn't suspect that you're behind it.

, Fake blood can always be perfect for scaring your sister, no matter how you use it. You can have her find you in bed with fake blood all over your face. You can cover yourself in fake blood and have her find you face-down at the kitchen table. You can pretend to get your hand caught in the garage disposal and pull it out of there covered in fake blood, screaming at the top of your lungs. Just be careful with this prank, because it can really scare your poor sister!

, This scary prank is totally worth it. First, you need a box that is big enough for you to hide in comfortably. Then, you need to place the box outside your front door at a time when only your sister is home. After that, you should ring the doorbell and quickly jump inside the box. When your sister opens the door and stares at the box for a second, you should jump out and scream, making her shriek.

, This one is a bit tricky, but worth it if you can pull it off. The first thing you do is to hide in your closet. Then, you should call your sister, pretending that you're not home. Tell her that you really need her help and that you want her to go into the closet to get something for you. When she opens the closet door, you can jump out at her. She'll be both terrified and completely confused! Of course, this will only work if your sister is willing to do favors for you.

, Just a drop of red food coloring on your sister's toothbrush or on the bottom of the soap she uses will make her think her mouth or hands are bleeding! Though food coloring is completely harmless, it should freak your sister out for a while before she realizes what's really happening. Just make sure your mom or dad doesn't use that bar of soap first by mistake.

, If your sister is old enough to have a computer, then wait until she gets up or goes to the bathroom. Then, change the background photo on her computer to something scary, so she has a little surprise waiting for her when she comes back. You can also try this trick on the background of her phone, if you can get it away from her.

, A fake spider on a long, clear string or a piece of fishing line is a great investment. Just stand far back and hoist the fake spider up the branch of a tree. When your sister walks by, lower the string and make the fake spider fall down right next to her, or even on her. She'll be screaming like crazy because she won't be expecting this at all.

, Who says all pranks have to be fancy? There's something to be said for keeping things simple. Just hide out behind a bush outside when you know your sister will be walking by and jump out and scream at her. She'll undoubtedly start shrieking because this is just not something that usually happens when you're walking by. You can even take a quick photo as you jump out to capture her expression. If you want to go all out with this, you can even put on a scary mask or costume.

, This is another prank that is simple, yet effective. Just get a light feather and sneak up behind your sister. When you're sure she's really concentrating on something else, just brush her neck with the feather. Do it firmly enough that she feels something there, but not so firmly that she can tell it's you. This will have her shrieking and turning around in no time. If you can swing it, try ducking or hiding when she turns around so she can't account for the mysterious sensation.

, Fake snakes can scare sisters of just about any age. Make sure her bed is made or that the covers are pulled up, at least. Then, place a big, fake snake either on her pillow or under her covers. Make sure she can't see it just by looking at her bed. Then, when she gets ready for sleep and pulls back her covers, she'll be screaming loudly enough for the whole house to hear.

, If your sister is still afraid of monsters under the bed, you can make this fear a reality. Just sneak up under her bed when she's resting and when you know she'll wake up soon. Then, when she plants her feet on the ground and yawns, getting ready to start her day, reach out a hand to grab her by the ankle and hear her scream like a lunatic. Bonus points if you can get your hand to be cold and clammy when you do this.

, If your sister loves to spend hours grooming herself in front of the mirror, this is a great opportunity to give her a scare. All you have to do is put on a scary mask, cover your face in fake blood, or do something else a little scary to yourself and then sneak up behind her so she doesn't see you. It won't take long for her to notice your scary reflection in the mirror and to scream her heart out!

, Once your sister has peacefully fallen into slumber, find a large, scary object to put in her bed. It can be a fake bloody head, a giant snake or lizard, a large spider, or really anything that you know will freak your sister out. Then, place it on the bed so that it's the first thing she sees when she wakes up. This will definitely give her an unexpected scare!

Personalize the room to each other's discretion.,
When changing, do not tell him to look away.,
When you want to be alone, ask him to leave.,
Compromise with him.,
Put your things on high shelves or in locked drawers so he can't reach them.,
Give each other space.,
Don't ignore each other.,
Be patient.,
Have him help with cleaning.",How to Share a Room With a Younger Boy Sibling when You're a Girl," You might want to paint the walls pink, but what nine-year-old boy wants that? He wants to plaster the walls in ""Star Wars"" wallpaper, but you're a thirteen-year-old girl, so that's not going to happen. This is where compromise comes in. It may be best to not paint at all. You can still decorate your half of the room with posters, curtains, pictures, and your bedsheets.;
, Either leave the room and change elsewhere, or wait for him to leave. Close the door and use the lock if you have one.

, If that doesn't work, try to get him interested in something outside the room. This may not always work, but it does most of the time. Otherwise, leave the room yourself and leave him by himself.

, Example: Say he can have the room while you're doing homework, but you want it after that. You'll have it right after dinner, but he can be alone in there right before bedtime. This can work with brothers six and up for sure. Keep in mind that you can be in the room together, it's just that, if you'd both like some ""alone"" time in there, you have to make a schedule so you don't get in each other's way.

, If he does get something, don't freak out. Either tell your parents if it's serious, or just tell him not to do it again. Do not take some of his things to ""show him how it feels"", as you may get in trouble for this.

, Don't claim most of the room and leave him with very little, or vice versa. Don't be on each others backs about stuff laying around. If you say it once, they will most likely do it. Split the room in half for the most part, but don't have exact boundaries.

, If he asks you something, don't pretend he doesn't exist. This normally leads to a tantrum or him telling your parents. You may not love sharing a room with him, but you are siblings.

, If he comes into the room and won't leave, don't get upset. Just ask him to leave. If he doesn't leave after five minutes give a count down, or do what's mentioned in Step 2.

, Don't act like his maid and pick up all his stuff. Put it in a pile and ask him to put it away. If that doesn't work, tell your parents or put it away temporarily. Leave his side of the room to himself and take care of yours.

Think about her interests.,
Check out what she already has.,
Buy fairly inexpensive things.,
Avoid getting clothes.",How to Select a Gift for Your Sister1," Young girls are interested in things like My Little Pony, Barbie, Littlest Pet Shop, Bratz, Sesame Street, and so on. If you aren't sure what she likes, try asking some questions, such as:


""I'm taking pictures today. Could I take a picture of you with your favorite toys?""
""What TV show would you like to watch most?""
""Genies are so cool. If you met a genie, what would you wish for?"";
, This will help in two ways: first, you'll avoid buying duplicates, and second, you can get some ideas. For instance, if she has lots of Littlest Pet Shop toys, you could buy some accessories or a new house for them, maybe. If she loves her American Girl doll, you could get some new clothes for it. Many toys work this way.

, Children's interests tend to change quite often. If she likes Frozen, buy her an Elsa doll for twenty dollars instead of an ice castle for a hundred dollars.

, While clothes are certainly a practical, simple gift, there are a lot of variables. You might get the wrong size or a color they hate. Not only that but kids are usually happiest when they unwrap a toy.


Clothes might be a very good idea for an infant sister, though. Just be sure you buy larger than you think you'll need; babies grow fast!

Get her a gift card.",How to Select a Gift for Your Sister2," A girl can be sporty, girly, geeky, scholarly, artsy, or a mix of many things. If you aren't sure about her interests, make a list of how she spends her time. If she goes shopping once a week, she might be a fashionista. If she plays three different sports, that's probably her thing. Some list ideas for different interests are listed below:


Art: a poster of her favorite artist's work, an easel, high-quality paint brushes.
Eco-friendly: a plant, a tree planted in her name, a new bike.
Geek: a poster or action figure, a t-shirt, other fan memorabilia.
Girly: nice perfume, a cute dress, jewelry.
Smart/School: a book, a telescope, a high-quality monogrammed pen.
Sports: water bottle with her name on it, autographed ball, jersey.

, This will help you in two ways: one, you can eliminate what she already has and two, you might get some solid ideas of what she likes. If she has Dr. Who posters plastered all over her wall, there's a good chance she'll love the TARDIS plush you buy her.

, Ask her what stores she'd like to go to, then watch what she looks at and loves.


If there's a dress she loves but can't afford, get a couple things and ask her to run ahead to the food court to buy you some food. While she's out, you can buy the dress and hide it underneath the other stuff.

, If you are utterly stumped or too nervous, buy her a gift card to her favorite store (or one that works at multiple stores).

Go the traditional route.,
Think about her interests.,
Try something handmade.,
Get her a gift card.",How to Select a Gift for Your Sister3," Jewelry is a classic gift, as are perfumes, skincare items and clothes. Try to find out what kind of jewelry and clothing are her style, first.

Cooking: a cookbook, a gourmet hamper or a cooking gadget
Sports: a jersey of her favorite team
Gardening: a beautiful new plant
An actor: one of their movies

, A mature sister (of any age) will appreciate a heartfelt gift because of the time, thought, and love that went into making it. Perhaps you could make her a scrapbook, paint her a picture, or sew her a decorative pillow. Look on Pinterest for more ideas.

, If you're too anxious about whether your gift will be perfect or not, give her a gift card. If it is accompanied it by a nice card and a heartfelt note, even better.

Seize opportunities to play together.,
Play what your siblings want to play, but don't be afraid to compromise with them.,
Plan special events that you can do together, like camping out in the living room or going to the swimming pool.,
If they are little, go easy on them.,
Let your siblings think they're smart.,
Don't be afraid of what people might think, just because you're playing with siblings.

,
Love your sibling.,
Try to have some alone time once a week, whether it's going out for lunch together or sitting down and watching a movie or your favorite cartoon.

,
Play the ""I Love You"" game with toddlers.,
Randomly grab them into a hug.",How to Play With a Little Brother or Sister," Going to the park? Bring your T-ball set along! Swimming pool? Bring pool noodles and inner tubes! Remember, in years way down the road, you and your siblings will want to look back on this period of your life and smile, because it was fun!;
, If they want to play freeze tag, and you want to play Truth or Dare, you can try to talk them into a game of whenever they get frozen in freeze tag, they have to pick truth or dare. Some siblings might stick to their guns only on what they want to do, however, so be ready to give in to them if you have to.

, Sometimes - as long as your parents are okay with it - spontaneous or random events can make your siblings surprised and happy, and will strengthen the bond between you.

, Let them win (on purpose) at games you play, but don't make that fact blindingly obvious. Make it look like you are trying your hardest to win but sadly lost!

, If they are little make silly mistakes while playing or ask questions like if you are running ""What do I do with my arms?"" Let them win!

,, Show them how much you love them by treating them to ice-cream on the weekends, bringing them to a museum with their friends, or reading them a story, kissing them and telling them how much you love them. If they know how much you love them, it will be less awkward and more fun when playing with them.

,, Have them guess how high you love them. Example: ""Do you love me to the roof?"" ""Higher."" ""Do you love me to that building over there."" ""Higher."" And so on...

, Hold them close and tell them that you love them for always. If you're lucky, they might say it back.

Think about why you want to read her diary.,
Know where her diary is.,
Don't read it yet.,
If her diary has keys, look for them.,
Grab it when she isn't around.,
Take it somewhere like the bathroom.,
Read it at night.,
Don't put it where it was.,
If she was away or didn't know it was missing, put it back where it was.,
Remember- which goes into being a good liar- what you would do if she /really/ asked you and you really didn't take it.,
Act normal.",How to Secretly Read Your Sister's Diary," Do you need to know if she's OK? Do you want to know what she thinks of you and/or other people? Are you just a snoop? Did she read yours? Blackmail? If you're just a snoop, you might not want to read it. But the other reasons actually make sense.;
, You can even look at articles about hiding your diary to find where she might hide it. If she's not so bright, it's probably somewhere simple.

, Wait until she is gone for a while- or better yet, out of the house. Make sure she won't come home yet!

, If they're with her, ex., on her neck, wrist, etc., you're out of luck. But some don't- and remember it might be unlocked. Your keys (if you have a lock diary) might work- just be sure not to break anything!

, If she puts it in plain sight, she'll notice it's gone- probably. But don't grab it when she's writing and left the room. You can take a peek, instead- just make sure she doesn't see! Follow step 3.

, Lock it- or at least close it. When you hear someone coming, make sure you hide it (if you don't have a lock). That way, they can't bother you looking for it!

, You're in luck if she falls asleep early. If course, if she's away, it doesn't matter what time you read it!

, This will tell her- if she already looked there- that it was put back. Put it somewhere else in her room like she misplaced it.

, But remember- if she doesn't tell about it she might not say she noticed it was missing.

, If you lie differently, remember the way you did and when she asks you again, lying or not, act the same way.

, Going into lying again. After it happens, just act normal. Act like it didn't.

, If you can, have snacks of fruit and vegetables in between. These will give you the energy needed.

, If you have electronics, put them in your room and charge them. If they don't have a charge, you will have nothing to do. If you have a game console that's not in your room, put it there. Get some food, water, and soda or pop in your room as well.

, If you can get outside, then do so. It can be a beautiful sight.

, Brush your teeth and if you're going to have a shower, make it colder than usual, to help you to stay awake.

Always Be Polite.,
If you are invited to a family event or anything where there will be many adults around, show good manners by asking or offering assistance to people for example: Washing dishes, clearing the table, cleaning up messes in general.

,
When an adult asks you a question answer it honestly, or maybe tell a non-threatening story.,
Try to make an individual connection with them.,
Feel comfortable... but not too comfortable.,
Do not work on one specific person.,
Be generous.",How to Make an Adult Like You a Lot," It is likely that an adult will ask you questions and sometimes they may even offend you, but if you always answer politely or politely say something like ""I don't feel comfortable answering that question"" they will find that to be acceptable.;
,, For example, if they were to ask you how your family is, do not tell stories about how much you dislike your own family, they will think you are rude and unappreciative.

, Find things they are interested in that you don't know much about and show an interest in it. Maybe ask them questions about the things they are interested in and ask them to teach you about them; people are known to feel special or important if they can share wisdom they possess with others.

, Depending on the person they may be very accepting or not as much. Feel comfortable in a conversation, make jokes that THEY will find funny and have an open sense of humor to their jokes. Don't fake laugh at their jokes if they are not funny, maybe add a comment to the end of the joke to make it even funnier and it will also make them laugh more.

, If you want one adult to like you, have both or all adults like you. Make the whole family like you if you can. Word spreads fast in families, if one person likes you they will tell others how polite and nice you are, and if you make the same impression on others, they will know it is true.

, If they take you somewhere and buy you food or something, next time you have money do the same for them, or at least offer. Maybe ask them if they would like a Starbucks or something if you are passing by in the vehicle and tell them you will treat them, and if they accept the offer they will appreciate you a lot.

Get a regular notebook.,
Get a decoy journal.,
Disguise your actual journal even further.,
Write ""in code"".,
Write in the decoy journal.,
Hide your real journal.,
""Hide"" the decoy.,
Pay attention to whether it's been read.",How to Hide Your Journal from Parents1," This will be your actual journal, try not to get anything too flashy (think regular school notebook).;
, This step is for those whose parents know they have a journal, but can be for those still concerned with privacy. First, get something obvious, it could just be a notebook with the words ""MY JOURNAL"" written on the front, or it could be a big, pink store bought diary; it's up to you. If you already have a journal that your parents keep reading, just use that, they'll recognize it and continue to read it thinking that it's your actual journal.


The purpose of this step is to draw attention away from your real journal, so that nobody will go looking for it, because they will believe that they have already found it.

, You can do this by labeling it something like ""Math Formulas"" or leaving the cover blank. Leave the first few pages (about 2-5) empty, and either write somethings pertaining to the cover (i.e. ""Geography Facts""--actual geography facts), leave them blank, or doodle some so it will seem like a casual sketchbook. This will act as a cover so if it is found it won't have much attention drawn to it and will appear as that of a normal notebook.

, Think of words for all the terms that you wouldn't want anyone to see you write. For example ""up"" could mean high, ""Today I got up and did some stuff with my friends."" Basically customize it to sound more innocent.

, Write in the decoy about once or twice a week, or however much you want, just as long as it appears that you are writing in it sometimes. Don't make up things in the journal, like drama, grades, crushes, events, etc. as these will be traced back to you.


Simply write things about your day you wouldn't mind your parents knowing like: ""Today me and Madison went and hung out after school. Then I came home and made dinner. Now I am just sitting on my bed listening to some music."" That seems like a pretty innocent day, right? Well, that would be because you left out that after you and Madison hung out for about five minutes, you went and made out with your boyfriend. Keep it innocent but not boring.

, When looking for a place to hide your journal ask yourself some questions, ""Where will my parents (or any other person) look? Sock drawer, under mattress, etc.?"", ""Would anyone stumble across it if I hid it here?"", and ""Would it be hard for me to get and put back?"".


A good idea is to find little areas in your house with extra space, some closets may have these, or anywhere that covers the object from view, it also depends on the age of your house too.
Get a box slightly bigger than your journal and tape it in a covered area so that it can be removed and put back, but is still out of sight.
Another good idea would be to hide it under drawers; to do this take the drawer out, place the notebook inside, and push the drawer back in. You need to find what works good for you, be creative and use your surroundings to your advantage.

, This step is optional, but if you usually hide your journal somewhere, and your parents know where that is, keep hiding the decoy there, or put it in an obvious place like under your bed. Basically, make it really obvious, so that it will satisfy anyone's curiosity if they decide to read it, and so they won't accidentally stumble across your real journal while looking for the fake.

, You don't have to do this to the decoy or your real journal, but you can. There are many methods for doing this:


Put a piece of clear, unnoticeable tape on the corner of the book so that if it's opened, the tape will be pulled off. Tape it at an odd angle so that if anyone opened it and tried to tape it back it would be different from how you left it.
Alternatively, simply cut the tape to where it was almost cut apart, but not quite, that way the force exerted on it from opening the book will rip it apart and the person won't be able to put it back together.
Another method would be to take a piece of hair and place it in between the pages, if it's gone it may have been read. However, the wind or other conditions could have also removed it, so this isn't exactly foolproof.

Set up an online journal.,
Keep your username and password secret.,
Be careful to use private browsing so that it will not show up in your passwords or history.

",How to Hide Your Journal from Parents2," Go to an online journal site. Set up an account and write freely.

, Make sure to not let anyone find out about this.

Get an app for writing.,
Password protect It.,
Hide it.",How to Hide Your Journal from Parents3," It could say Journal, or not. It's whatever you want.

, If it has a password, good, but if it doesn't download an app like ""applock"" to password protect it. This may not be a good idea though, as it may cause more suspicion.

, If your phone is capable of hiding apps, hide it, otherwise, you could move it to the SD card (if you have one) and in a worst case scenario, you could remove the SD card. Another idea would be to rename it and change the icon, there are apps that can do this.

Start talking to your cousin less and less.,
Start to ignore them whenever they tease you.,
When they try to text you, call you, or talk to you do not reply.,
Act like they don't exist.,
Always let them see you hanging out with other people, talking to other people and having a good time with other people.",How to Get Your Cousin to Feel Sorry for You," Like for example, start making conversations shorter and shorter each time you talk to them.If they try talking to you for a long time, say, ""Oh, I need to go to the restroom. Bye!"" or something like that then leave. Or you can let them see you with other family or cousins and whenever they talk to you, make the conversation really short.;
, Like if they say they hate you or you are ugly, just simply ignore them. They are obviously just doing it for attention.

, Or,if they text you, you can trick them by replying saying ""Who is this?"" and they will be all like ""What? They forgot about me?"" Or,they will just think you changed your number. (If they do, they will more than likely ask you. If they do ask you, make the conversation short.) If they call, do not call back. If they are talking to you or are trying to talk to you, pretend you didn't hear them. If you want them to be annoyed, just keep saying ""What? What? What?"" each time they repeat what they are saying.

, Like for example, when they stare at you, don't notice. Or if they call your name, do not notice. Pretend you didn't hear them if they try talking to you. Just as if they weren't there.

, This will show you are better off without them.

If your cousin is staying at your house, make sure you have everything ready. Things like extra towels and toiletries are easy to forget. Try to set aside some space, like an extra closet or drawer in the bathroom.You should also make sure your cousin's electronics needs are met. Know what kind of phones and computers your cousin uses. Try to find some extra chargers lying around to properly accommodate him or her.Create a homey vibe. Provide fresh sheets, pillows, and blankets for the guest room or sofa. Add something a little extra, like a fresh bouquet of flowers or a card welcoming your cousin to your home.Stock up on extra food. You may be eating out a lot. However, you should have options for meals at home as well. Breakfast food, like yogurt, fruit, and cereal, is important. Have some snacks, like chips and crackers, as well as some basic staples in case you decide to cook in one night.;
, Eating out is one of the most fun aspects of visiting friends or relatives. Even if your cousin just has a week off school or work, exploring food options in your own town can also be fun. Spend some time finding restaurants in your area.


Make sure to accommodate everyone's eating habits. Ask your cousin if he or she has any special dietary restrictions. Your cousin may be allergic to shellfish, for example, or vegetarian/vegan.
Find restaurants that meet these needs. Go for establishments within your budget. If your cousin is visiting from college, for example, he or she may not want to drop a lot of money at a 5-star restaurant. You can search restaurants by price-range on websites such as Yelp.
Ask friends and co-workers for suggestions as well. If you have a Facebook page, consider posting a status saying your cousin is in town or taking a week off. Ask people for suggestions of good restaurants and specifics on what you're looking for (e.g., something cheap, something with vegan options, etc.).

, A guest checklist sounds a little formal, but it can really help you plan a fun trip. If your cousin is visiting from another area, consider making a checklist to make sure all of his or her needs are met.


First, ask your cousin for his or her travel itinerary. You want to know when you need to pick him or her up from the airport or bus station. Jot these things down on the checklist so you remember.You should also list anything you need to do on your end. You may want to give your apartment a good cleaning. You might have to get the air mattress out of storage or change the sheets in the guest bedroom. If your cousin has any special accommodations, make sure you keep those in mind. For example, if your cousin is bringing her dog along for the trip, consider stocking up on dog treats.If you haven't seen your cousin in awhile, it may be nice to buy him or her a small present. You don't have to go overboard, but a nice card and a small gift, like a box of chocolates, could be a nice touch.

, Lastly, keep in mind what your cousin wants to do. When you have a guest in town, you may be overeager to show him or her your favorite places in town. However, keep your cousin's interests as the primary focus.


Ask your cousin to give you a call or shoot you an e-mail and tell you some things he or she is interested in doing. If you know your cousin, you may already know some of his or her interests. However, it's not a bad idea to let your cousin have some direct input.
If you live in a big city, there's a good chance your cousin already has some plans. It's a good idea to know what these plans are ahead of time so you can find the best ways to carry them out. For example, say you live in Los Angeles and your cousin wants to go to Venice Beach. You can see which days Venice is the least crowded to avoid traffic and difficulty parking.
Keep your cousin's personal interests in mind. If your cousin is a passionate animal lover, for example, do some research on local zoos.

, If your cousin is younger, make sure to take his or her age into consideration. Younger relatives may need special considerations.


A very young child may need a nightlight or other comforting objects to help him or her sleep. You may want to provide some age appropriate toys. You can stop by a local supermarket and browse the toy section. Toys are usually labeled by age group.
You may want to plan events appropriate for someone younger. Look into local parks, children's museums, and so on. If you work or go to school, a younger relative may require supervision when you're gone. Make a plan for a babysitter.
If your cousin is in high school or middle school, things may be a little easier. Children of this age are usually more independent. You may be able to leave your cousin home alone. However, make sure you plan events accordingly. For example, you obviously cannot take someone this young to an establishment that serves alcohol. You may want to look into fun, cool events targeted at teens. Maybe a local community center has a music night for teenagers.

, Many towns and cities have local parks. This can be a fun option if your cousin is in town. Taking a long walk through a park is a low-cost form of entertainment. Many parks have free or low cost performances on certain days of the week. Browse a schedule online and see if anything fun is coming up the week your cousin wants to spend with you.If you live in a big city, like New York City, Central Park can be a great place to take an out-of-town visitor. If the weather's nice, you can have a lot of fun simply walking through the park and seeing the famous landmarks and statues.
Some parks have street performers. If you live in an area where street performers are common, this is something your cousin may enjoy.If you have a younger cousin, a park or a playground can be wildly entertaining for him or her. On your end, you can look up some games to play with children. For example, playing tag in Central Park for an afternoon can be a fun activity for when your 10 year-old cousin visits New York City.

, Almost every city has some kind of museum or art gallery. If your cousin is visiting, consider showing him or her the local culture.


Remember, everyone's tastes are different. Try to cater to your cousin's personal interests. If you live in Chicago and your cousin is an art lover, she'll really enjoy the Art Institute. However, if she's more into culture and history, consider taking her to the Field Museum instead.
Look for deals on museums if you're on a budget. If you're a member at a particular museum, you may be able to get a guest in for free. Websites like Groupon often offer discount tickets for local museums.

, If you're cousin is interested in music or theater, be on the lookout for plays and concerts in your area. If you live in a small town, local theaters or colleges often put on shows for cheap. Bigger cities almost always have some kind of theater. As for music, be on the lookout for fun local concerts.


If you're on a budget, check out the local music scene. Many bars have local bands play for very cheap. There may only be a $5-$10 cover, for example.If you live near a college, you may be able to find tickets for a college production for cheap. If you live in a bigger city, you can often find discount tickets sold the day of a performance.
Once again, keep your cousin's tastes in mind. If your cousin is a fan of punk rock music, he or she probably won't enjoy a country music show. If your cousin is not a fan of serious movies and TV shows, the local production of August Osage County may not interest him or her.

, Going out to eat can be a fun way to socialize with your cousin, while also trying local cuisine. Make a point of going out to eat during your week with your cousin.


Be open to trying new foods, especially if your cousin has adventurous tastes. Together, you guys can try a type of food you've never before eaten.
Make reservations when it's necessary. If you're both hungry, waiting for a table on a Friday night can get tiring. If you're eating out on the weekend, reservations may be a good idea.
Try to find restaurants that offer other forms of entertainment as well. For example, a bar/restaurant with karaoke could be fun if your cousin is 21., When you have a guest in town, you want to make sure you include them in your plans. You can allow your cousin to meet your friends and keep him or her entertained in the process.You may have regular social engagements you attend. For example, maybe you always do trivia night on Tuesdays at a local pub. See if your cousin wants to join.
If you've been invited to any parties or get-togethers that week, bring your cousin along.
Talk to the hosts of any events ahead of time, however, and make sure you can bring a guest. You should always check with your cousin first as well. If your cousin hates bars and trivia, maybe you can sit out trivia this one week .

, It can be fun to show your cousin all your favorite places around town. If there's a coffee shop you love, take your cousin there. If there's an amazing local bookstore, bring your cousin there for an afternoon.


Do some research ahead of time, especially if you live in a big city. A trendy dive bar in the Wicker Park district of Chicago may be one of your favorite places. However, it may be completely packed on a Saturday night. It may be easier to hit it up on a Wednesday.
Let your cousin call the shots a little. While you want to show him or her your town, make sure you're choosing things that are fun for your cousin. If the idea of going to a local comic bookstore bores your cousin to tears, you may want to pick a local attraction more suited to your cousin's interests.

, If you're hosting a younger relative, keep age in mind. You cannot take someone who's not 21 to a bar, for example, and an adult-themed play may not be entertaining or appropriate for an elementary school student. Try to keep age in mind as you make plans.


For a cousin who is still in elementary school, be on the lookout for entertainment specifically marketed towards children. Look for children's theaters, children's museums, parks, petting zoos, and so on. If you have any friends who love kids, invite them out for an afternoon.
For a middle school or high school-aged cousin, you can provide a mix of entertainment options. A 14 year-old may have an interest in a play marketed for adults. However, a 14 year-old may still be shy about trying new or different foods. Keep a balance between kid and adult friendly entertainment. Take your 14 year-old cousin to a symphony, but go to McDonald's for dinner afterwards.

, If you're having your cousin stay with you, do not go overboard trying to impress him or her. It's okay to be yourself. If you're relaxed, both you and your cousin will have more fun.


You should keep your home relatively clean if you have guests. This is a common courtesy. However, you don't need to make your apartment immaculate. If you're the type that occasionally has a few dishes in the sink, don't worry about it.Allow your cousin to relax as well. If you have guests, they'll likely do things slightly differently than you. Try to let this go. Your cousin may put her feet on the coffee table or leave the coffee machine on for a few hours after brewing a fresh pot. Even if you prefer things differently, try to be laid back when you have a visitor., If you want to have fun at home, provide snacks. If you like baking, making a batch of cookies before your cousin arrives can be fun. You can also try to prepare some meals at home. Eating out can get costly. You and your cousin can plan to cook dinner together a couple of nights.Consider having a theme dinner night. For example, prepare an Italian meal. Make a batch of homemade lasagna and prepare a nice salad and garlic bread as sides. If your cousin is 21, buy some red wine.
If you grew up with your cousin, go for nostalgic snack choices. Maybe the two of you have fond memories of eating Twizzlers while watching scary movies. Buy a few packs of Twizzlers in preparation for your cousin's visit.

, If going out is expensive, stay in for the evening. Invite a group of friends over. You can have some drinks, if your cousin is 21, and just hang out. This can be a low cost option that can be great if your cousin is on a budget.


Consider scheduling a game night. Board games can be a fun means to entertain big groups.
Try having a pot luck. Invite each guest to bring a dish and pass the dishes around to share. This is a great way to take care of a meal while also socializing with your cousin.

, If you want your home to be warm and inviting, keep entertainment options available. For nights when you're staying in, you want to make sure there are things to do at your house.


If you have a television set, you could watch movies or play video games. Consider renting some movies, online or at a rental store, that your cousin would enjoy.
Pick up a pack of cards. Cards are very cheap and card games can be fun.
If your cousin has any hobbies, keep those in mind. For example, if your cousin loves crossword puzzles, buy a book of crossword puzzles.

, Chances are, you won't be around to entertain your friend all the time. You should provide some reading material. Set out some fun magazines and fun coffee table books for your cousin to browse while you're busy.


Short story anthologies are also nice for guests. Your guests can feel like they're accomplishing something as people are able to finish a short story in one sitting. A longer novel can be frustrating because your cousin may be unable to finish the story before the week is up., Sometimes, it can be fun to simply enjoy one another's company. If you haven't seen your cousin in awhile, take this as an opportunity to catch up. Have your cousin fill you in on her job, work, social life, and so on. You can also reminisce about old times. If you grew up together, you probably have lots of fun, childhood stories to recount.


Share your favorite memories. Try to start off a conversation with ""Remember when..."" and then bring up something fun from the past.
Catch up on what your cousin has been doing. He or she may have some fun stories to share from work or school.
Talk about other family members. If you don't see your Aunt Jean much anymore, ask your cousin how she's doing. Share news about your parents as well.
Minimize distractions to help conversation flow. Turn off the TV and keep music volume low.

, If you're hosting a younger cousin, you should make sure your at-home entertainment is age appropriate. You do not want your 12 year-old cousin to grow bored if you don't keep his or her age in mind.


Look for age-appropriate movies, TV shows, and reading materials. There is a special ""Kids"" section on Netflix you could browse. You can ask friends with kids for advice on children's movies. Look for magazines at the supermarket that are kid friendly. Buy some young adult books to keep in your home.
For a very young cousin, coloring books, crayons, markers, and other child-friendly craft options can be a great touch.
Look into what music your cousin likes. Create a Pandora station with all of his or her favorite artists.

Find a time to talk when your parent is not doing something else, like dishes, working in their home office, talking on the phone, putting other kids to bed etc.,
Schedule time to speak with your parents.,
Plan your strategy.,
Start with a statement.,
Ask them why.,
Ask them what their concerns are.,
Do not complain or whine.,
Keep the focus on what you want and what you feel, and be honest.,
Be respectful.,
Earn their trust.,
Be helpful and nice so they will be nice and helpful to you!

",How to Talk to Parents So They'll Understand," Otherwise, their mind will be elsewhere and they will either get irritated or not give you their undivided attention.;
, ""Dad, I want to talk to you about something. When would be a good time for us to talk?"" They will be thrilled that you (1) recognize the importance of scheduling time to discuss an issue with them and (2) your maturity and initiative in coming to them to discuss something. They want you to talk to them, are terrified you won't so they'll jump at the chance.

, Let's start with what are the issues? Put them on a piece of paper. Now walk through them by yourself, what would you do if you were the parent? Have you done something to cause them to say no? Did you break a rule? Did you break their trust? Then, figure out a way to earn that trust back. Let's say for example, that you came home at 11:00 and your were supposed to be home at 9:00. Your punishment is you are grounded. Offer to do something else so you can earn the right to attend this event. Got it? Maybe you do the dishes, wash clothes, babysit your brother, massage your mother's feet! You have to figure out a strategy before your meeting.

, Try not to say, ""You did"" etc. Calmly, open your meeting with a statement such as, ""I feel that it's unfair that I couldn't go to the party Friday night."" This statement explains the issue you want to address--stay focused and very crucial!

, ""Can you help me understand why I can't go out? If I don't understand the why, then you can't address what you need to change.""

, ""What are your concerns, Dad? Help me understand what your issues or concerns are?"" Maybe they know something you don't. You need to develop communication between the two of you and not just assume that it's for one reason or another. Keep your voice steady, not raised or excited. Maybe they don't understand why this is important to you.

, You hate hearing it; so do they. It's not going to get you anywhere--it will only make the situation worse.

, ""Dad, I feel really sad that you don't trust me and I want to know what to do to make you trust me,"" works a million times better than, ""You never let me do what I want!"" Be careful not to go overboard- being too smarmy will result in a quick ""No!""

, Even if they annoy you, they are your parents. And they'll respect you if you respect them.

, Understand that you need to earn their trust. Tell them you understand how important trust is. If you have broken their trust in the past, then you need to earn it moving forward. Ask them what you can do to earn their trust back.

If you don't have any fun books at home, search the internet. Lots of stories and/or books can be easily found on the internet for free.;
, You can watch anywhere you like: in your bed, on the couch, in a comfy chair and so on.

, It doesn't have to be knitting but something like a scrapbook or a collage would do nicely. Especially scrapbooking, collage making or drawing can be fun activities, and you can easily decide how many or how little time to spend on it.

, Take a relaxing (cold) shower or bath, do something fun with your hair, trim your nails, anything to help you feel fresh and clean during summer.

, If you have a tent, ask your parents if you can set up the tent in your back or front yard to spend one or two summer nights there. Invite a friend over to share in the fun.

, Use a garden hose or sprinklers to get yourself all wet and cooled off without having to go swimming anywhere. Just try not to raise the water bill too much.

, You can easily make your own Slip 'n Slide using a smooth piece of tarp. Lay down the tarp, make it slippery with a safe detergent or some smooth soap and hose it down every now and then to keep it slippery. Have fun sliding down the tarp!

, Simply sit or lie down on the grass, use a picnic blanket to sit or lie more comfortably if you like, and watch the skies. At night, do some stargazing.

, Practice any subjects you failed or didn't do so well in prior to summer. Perhaps use the school's website to find out which teachers you're dealing with next year and what sorts of content will be in your upcoming subjects.

, New notebooks and pencils are often needed.

, Is there anything you'd like to change? Go ahead and rearrange your furniture a bit.

, There's lots of fun things to do together.

,, Bake cookies, cakes or perhaps something you've never baked before. Just make sure you have all the ingredients you need before starting the baking project.

, There are lots of delicious meals to make using summer products.

, Sort out any stuff you don't want or need anymore, set a price (you can always negotiate with buyers if you're not sure) for everything and earn some money while making people happy with their wonderful secondhand stuff.

, If there's any stuff they want to get rid of, suggest you sell it. They might expect a part of the profit though, as it used to be their stuff which they once bought.

Give your parents the ability to stay updated.,
Ask your parents for help.,

Avoid bad habits in the future.",How to Show Your Parents a Bad Grade," Don’t get too worked up before showing your parents the grade. Anxiety and nervousness will cause you to overthink the situation. Remember, this will one day be unimportant and a distant memory. The sooner you explain what has happened, the sooner it'll be over, and you can start looking towards doing better.Take deep breaths and focus on pleasant thoughts.
Take your mind off of your grade for an hour by doing something that makes you happy, like reading a book or playing a game.;
, Think of positive things you have accomplished. This way, you can share the good news as well as the bad news. If you can’t think of any new accomplishments, come up with a plan for improvement. Prepare a solid plan or physical proof of how you plan to do better in the future.Plan a meeting with your teacher, or talk to your teacher about the bad grade beforehand.
Prepare a study plan.
Don’t hide or throw away the grade. It may be tempting to hide, “forget” about, or throw away your grade. Do not do this. Chances are, the bad grade will come to light eventually. The bad grade may need to be signed, or it will reflect in a poor grade on a report card.It is always better to go the honest route. The punishment and reaction will be worse if you delay the news.

, Try to prepare the right environment for breaking bad news. Don’t wait to tell them in a crowded area, or during a fun family outing. A good time to tell them would be during or after dinner, when they are unlikely to be caught up in other responsibilities.Don’t talk to them as soon as they come home from work. Allow them some time to unwind before you start a serious conversation with them.
Schedule a time with your parents if you are not sure when to talk to them.

, Don’t approach the situation in a defensive or rude manner. Your parents will respond better to good manners and a thoughtful approach. Talk to your parents as you were taught to speak to your elders.Never resort to inappropriate name-calling or cursing.
Do not raise your voice. Keep your voice calm and steady.

, When the moment is right, ask your parents if they are available to talk. You should take advantage of a quiet and private area. Try sitting down instead of standing, as the conversation may take a while.Approach your parents confidently and seriously. Don’t act silly or upset. Your parents will be more likely to react positively if you display the right behavior.

, Get straight to the point. Don’t build up the conversation by trying to pad the situation in your favour. For example, you can say something like ""I got a bad grade,"" or ""I'm very sorry, but I didn't do very well on a quiz/test/exam.”, Don't make excuses. It might seem easier to be dishonest about your grade, or make excuses about it. Dishonesty and excuses will not benefit you because they do not change your grade. Your parents will appreciate and acknowledge the fact that you were straight and honest with them.There is a difference between excuses and legitimate reasons for a bad grade. Differentiate the two. An excuse is, “My teacher made the test too hard.” A reason is “I didn’t understand the material.”

, Be direct with a simple statement at first, but your parents will probably want an explanation. Stay honest when you explain to them what happened. If you didn’t study, tell them. If you tried your best, but still failed, tell them.Something you could say is “I had a hard time understanding the material,” or “I didn’t study for the test, which led to me doing poorly on it.”Be honest with yourself about why you made a bad grade. Don’t convince that it wasn’t your fault if it was.
If accurate, tell them about how you know you should have studied more. That will show them that you've learned from your mistake.

, Lay out the plan you've made, and tell them how you plan to improve in the future. Show them comments from your teacher, your study plan, or tell them how you will avoid distractions.Tell your parents that you will make effort to do things like set up a meeting with your teacher, turn off your phone and television while studying, and study for at least an hour a night.
Physical proof or a well thought out plan will be more convincing than comments thought up during the conversation.

, You may typically be a good student. Remind your parents of this. This may keep them from overreacting if they remember what kind of grades you usually bring home. Do not, however, treat the bad grade lightly if it is an ongoing problem.Something you could say is “I may have done poorly on this test, but this is a rare occurrence for me. I will make an effort to do better next time.”
If bad grades are a recurring problem you could say, “I haven’t been doing well in school lately, but I am going to do my best to change that.”

, Know that your parents want what is best for you. Parents want the best for you, and it makes them nervous when they think your future is being damaged. Your parents have most likely been through school, and they have probably dealt with bad grade themselves. Take their advice, and understand their frustration is mostly concern for you.Do not talk back if they are lecturing you. Being rude and disrespectful will show that you do not take the situation or your parents seriously.
Your parents might be angry or frustrated, and that is normal. Being mentally or physically abused is not normal. Talk to your teacher or proper authorities if you think you are being abused.

, Before they give you a punishment, offer fair punishments. Tell them that you are willing to give up television for a certain amount of time, or that you won’t go the party you were invited to that weekend in favor of studying. Doing this will show your parents that you know the bad grade is a problem, and you are willing to fix the problem., Your parents may or may not accept your suggestion for a punishment. They may decide on a different and more appropriate punishment. Either way, accept the punishment. Do not argue with them, or try to deny the punishment.Don’t act out against the punishment. Don’t sneak out if they ground you, or don’t watch television if you are banned from it.

, Many school systems have a way of viewing your grades online. If they don’t already have the login information, give it to them. Alternatively, if your school does not have an online system, make an Excel spreadsheet of your grades, and give it to them weekly.Keeping your parents updated will motivate you to do better, and show your parents that you care about your grades.

, Suggest that your parents sit down and help you with homework. If you are struggling to understand your work, ask your parents if it is possible to get a tutor. If you aren’t sure how to improve, ask your parents what they suggest.Keeping your parents involved will likely make them more understanding if you get a bad grade in the future.

, Tell them about anything that is inhibiting your education. Don’t be afraid to tell them everything. Tell them about bullies, distractions, or trouble concentrating. Your parents are there to help you.Something you could say is, “There is an ongoing distraction at school (or home), that prevents me from concentrating on my studies.”
Tell your teacher if there is an ongoing distraction or bully in your class.

, There are many bad habits that lead to low grades. Avoiding these habits in the future will help you do better in your studies, therefore preventing stressful confrontations with your parents. Some of these bad habits are:Copying a classmate’s homework instead of doing your own work.
Not asking questions when you don’t understand the material.
Cheating on quizzes and exams.
Forgetting the due dates of essays, projects, quizzes, tests, etc. Keep a calendar for the due dates of your schoolwork.
Failing to take notes during class. Taking notes during class will help you avoid zoning out and not paying attention.

Listen to them.,
Create trust and unity.,

Surprise them.",How to Create a Healthy Family Environment (as a Child)," No matter what they do, how they look and how much they earn, your parents are the reason why you are loved, fed, clothed and warm. They chose to love you, be gentle and kind towards you, spend sleepless nights as you cried busting their sleep but still kissed your nose before they left for work while you slept contently tucked in. They chose to fret over every sickness and problem you faced. They read out stories to you and taught you the lessons of life along with the moral, values and ethics that eventually decide who you will be. They fulfilled every wish and desire you had, even if it meant changing important plans or breaking the budget, without you ever knowing the things that went behind getting the favourite toy or dress you liked. They did all this only for your smile and your happiness. So respect them for who they are. They will only want the best for you.;
, They have oddly around 30 years of experience of life more than you, so it's quite obvious why your parents will make many important decisions in your early life. These will range from your name to which school you attend, and in some cases and cultures, what job you choose or even the choice of your life partner.


There are some choices you cannot do much about, when you are actually too young to make any correct one. But as you grow up there are many other things where they include you in the discussion. This does not mean that you nod to whatever they say but rather try to understand their reason and put forward your own thoughts regarding that topic. Again, do not be as stubborn as a mule but still be respectful in sharing your reasons and opinions. It's very frustrating to be listening to someone 20 years younger than you, raise their voice at you. Avoid doing that. Your parents understand your individuality is the basis of your interpretation of the lessons you learnt from them and your own experiences and they respect it. Be attentive to them and take their wisdom and knowledge in the right intent.

, This is easy. It comes naturally to most of us. But as time goes on and we grow older, caught up in the hassles and entertainments of our own age, we lose the importance of spending time with our parents. On their part, they understand and quietly ignore it, being happy in the knowledge that you are happy.


It's difficult to make time but then that again is up to you. Is that movie really important to watch? Or that football match really important enough to go to? Can't you enjoy watching it from home where you can watch your dad turn into a teen again as he enjoys it with you? Can you not go out for an evening with your parents, taking them to some of the places you liked eating at with your friends?

, It may feel a little odd but just let yourself go and remember how you hugged them as a kid, because that's what you will always remain for them. Kiss your mum on the cheek before you leave for college. You don't know she might be missing it. Tell them how much you love them whenever you get the chance or when you feel it. And mean every single thing you say, because they always know when you are lying.

, Clean your room and do your laundry. Don't add on extra work for your mum. Help your dad with the car, the lawn, the pool, the fence and other chores. Take out the garbage. Go the bank and do the simple tasks. All these will teach you many things and help free your parents time.

, When was the last time you saw your mum sit back and relax while the food cooked itself? Chances are never. If she is not in the kitchen she will be tidying up some other room, cleaning up behind you. Help her out over weekends. Do the dishes and the vegetables. Talk to her all the while, tell her your college pranks and about the girls you like (depending on how cool your mum is with it.. haha.. ). Make her laugh. Help your dad out with his work. Confide in him, ask him what he used to do when he was your age, the pranks he played and how he met your mum. Play an indoor or outdoor game with them on weekends. Give them massages when their body aches. Take care of them when they fall sick in the same way they did when you were sick. Drive your dad to work if you are free. When he comes back home get him some water to drink before he asks for it. He has had a tiring day. Understand that. Save your pocket money and buy gifts for them for their anniversaries and birthdays. Make time for them, because that is what they crave for more than anything else - your time.

, Make them your best confidantes and you will never have to worry about your secrets leaking out. They really are the best keepers of secrets. And what do you know, they might just help you out with their experience.

, They grow old every single day as you do. But for many of us we do not notice the fine wrinkles and grey hair that slowly creeped into their institutions until we actually sit next to them. They grow old right in front of our eyes. Sometimes, they don't even need us. They are strong. But still we should look after them and care for them. They don't need many things - only our love and affection in the purest form.


So take care of them when old age knocks at their door, just as they cared for us and were tolerant with us when we were babies and errant youths, because the first people who truly ever wanted you to succeed and were joyful at the first step you took may need you in their last steps. Be with them, love them, respect them and support them. Always.

, They come in all sizes and shapes but most of us have their best memories growing up along with their siblings. They are mad, fun and completely crazy to hang out with. They may have different friends, groups, choices and likes/dislikes but all of them under one roof is one recipe for a fun-riot. Love them unconditionally and cherish them. They will be the ones who will always understand you.

, The more siblings you have the more choices you will have. All it means is some inputs may be valuable and some just to make you laugh. Also, if you are providing inputs, be careful about what you say and how you say it. It is possible that a true fact may upset your brother/sister but the way you say it will make the difference whether you are empathizing or having a laugh at their expense.

, Cultivate the habit of keeping secrets. This builds trust. Even if there are differences between you, be united and support each other when they need you. This will build a strength in your family that no one will be able to break.

, Help them when they need it. Even if they don't ask. Offer to help them and don't talk down to them. Motivate them to work hard be it sports, studies or whatever they like and appreciate every achievement heartily. Be proud of their achievements and don't be shy to push them harder. Nothing revs someone up more than the word of someone who loves and trusts you.

, Everyone likes to be surprised. Buy them gifts and the things they need. You don't have to wait for a birthday to gift your siblings. Or take them out for a spin or some trendy cool place you hang out at. Bowling and snooker are fun with siblings so are amusement parks and football matches. Plan some weekends together and have a refreshing blast. Because those who laugh together live together.

Be open and honest about your feelings.,
Write her a letter.It can be particularly difficult to confront a parent, especially in person.,
Ask a trusted friend or family member to get involved.",How to Get Your Mom to Stop Smoking1," The truth is, even though your mom probably knows you better than anyone, she may not fully realize the impact that her smoking has had on you. If you are concerned with her health and wish to protect yourself and others from the effects of secondhand smoke, the most direct way to handle this is through open communication.


Schedule some time to talk in a comfortable, private environment. No one enjoys being confronted about their habits. By going to a private place, such as a bedroom or sitting room, mom may be able to let her guard down and hear what you need to say.
Try not to nag or blame your mom for her smoking habit. Try to be compassionate, gentle and understanding.
Be sure to listen well. There may be some unexpressed feelings or perhaps she has tried to quit in the past and was unsuccessful. Hearing her out can ultimately make her more open to quitting.;
, If your mom is particularly defensive about her smoking habit, writing her a clear, thoughtful letter can allow you to get all of your feelings out in the open without her feeling confronted or attacked. This way she can process the information on her own and respond once she is ready.


Try starting off with, “Mom, I’m writing you this letter because I love you and want the very best for you and our family.”
Or, “Mom, lately I have been thinking about our lifestyle and how we can improve our health together.”
”Mom, it is sometimes difficult for me to express my feelings in person, but I am worried about you. Just know that I will do whatever I can to help you to quit smoking. You don’t have to do this alone.”

, If you still have difficulty getting mom to listen, bringing in an adult peer, friend or family member may help grab her attention in ways that you may not be able.After all, many parents do struggle when it comes to hearing their child out (even when they are adults), so bringing in a trusted peer may get her to understand the dangers of smoking once and for all.

Perform some quality research regarding the health hazards of smoking.,
Pick up a pamphlet from the local community health center or doctor’s office.,
Encourage her to join a Smokers Anonymous group.",How to Get Your Mom to Stop Smoking2," Your mom may not be ready to hear about the dangers of smoking. Give her the raw facts about smoking, so that understand exactly why she should quit.


According to the American Lung Association, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., causing over 400,000 deaths per year.Secondhand smoke causes over 40,000 deaths per year, in additional to several respiratory illnesses.Nearly 70 chemicals found in cigarettes are known to cause cancer, including lead, acetone, ammonia, arsenic and formaldehyde.When a person quits smoking, breathing becomes easier within the initial 72 hours.Lung function improves within the first 3-9 months.The risk of a heart attack, stroke or lung cancer are cut in half within the first few years of smoking cessation., Read it over by yourself first, then choose a good time to go over it with her. Pamphlets regarding the hazards of smoking usually include key information regarding how smoking affects the body as well as how it affects others (including children and pets).


The CDC has compiled a large list of informative pamphlets on the key aspects of tobacco use at http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/multimedia/printable/.

, Breaking a habit is a very personal issue where one often feels isolated and is not ready to handle it on their own.Smokers anonymous groups are a great way for those with smoking addictions to receive much-needed support, resources, guidance and encouragement from both professionals and fellow smokers.


Smokers anonymous groups (also known as nicotine anonymous) normally do not require that a person has already quit. The person has to simply want to quit in order to attend. Your mom will have the option of speaking with a personal sponsor who can motivate her when she is tempted to start smoking again.
To find meetings near you, visit https://nicotine-anonymous.org/find-a-meeting.html

Direct her to some alternative means of nicotine use.,
Encourage her to try vaping.,
Try nicotine replacement therapy through the use of nicotine gum, patches, lozenges, sprays, tablets and inhalers.These offer smaller doses of nicotine to reduce the discomfort of withdrawal symptoms and gradually reduce the amount of nicotine in the bloodstream.",How to Get Your Mom to Stop Smoking3," Many smokers believe that they will someday quit cold turkey they have to do is make a simple decision to do so.Nicotine is a powerfully addictive drug, so ending a smoking habit abruptly can result in uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms with both physical and psychological effects.

, Though much of the effects of vaping have yet to be researched, studies show that vaping allows users to gradually wean down their nicotine use over time. This reduces the addictive properties of smoking, while also reducing the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke inhalation.Many smokers have used vaping to successfully end their smoking habit for good.


Vaping involves no fire or combustion but a device which is used to vaporize the E-liquid for inhalation. E-liquid usually contains propylene glycol, flavorings and optional doses of nicotine.E -cigarettes are also battery powered devices which use liquid to produce a vapor for inhalation., Most nicotine replacement therapy products are available over the counter, with the exception of inhalers."

Check in.,
Help to relieve her stress.,
Promote overall physical and mental health.,
Suggest counseling.",How to Get Your Mom to Stop Smoking4," Ask her how it’s going, and if there are any ways that you can be of help. If your mom has made the decision to quit smoking, that’s just the first hurdle. Ending her smoking habit will take lots of time and effort. Be sure to listen to her struggles and reassure her that they are perfectly normal.


Reward or celebrate her achievements along the way. Incentive-based smoking cessation programs are highly effective, and can definitely give your mom great motivation to quit smoking. Track her progress, whether she goes without smoking for one month or just one day, ensure that she feels supported and encouraged.
Promise to do a few extra chores or help out more around the house for each milestone she reaches. If she goes a full week, tell her that you will mop the kitchen floor. After two smoke-free weeks, dust the living room, etc. Be creative, and perform duties that she will really appreciate.
Make an agreement that she will have to place a certain amount of money into a jar each time she smokes a cigarette. Research has shown that people are likely to quit smoking when it is associated with losing money. , Mothers often have so much to deal with on a daily basis, and it is possible that her smoking could be related to stress. Try taking on some of the tasks that she may perform so that she is able to relax and decompress throughout the day.


Make dinner a few nights a week.
Treat her to a spa day, or nice massage.
When she seems agitated, take her out for a short walk. A bit of physical activity can help to lift her mood., Getting your mom involved in activities such as exercise, yoga, meditation and healthy eating can help to shift your mother’s perspective regarding her health. Those who have healthier lifestyles and routine self-care are much less likely to smoke tobacco or engage in any other harmful habits.


Introduce your mom to mindfulness practices which have been shown to reduce smoking rates by creating an awareness of addictive behaviors, and developing techniques to overcome them such as, recognizing her craving for smoking, understanding why she may want to smoke at that moment and choosing to make a different decision.Many yoga programs include specific poses and deep breathing exercises, which can alleviate stress, improve blood circulation, increase oxygen to the brain and ultimately help with smoking cessation. Helpful poses include the cobra pose, child pose, bridge pose and triangle pose.

, If you believe that there are underlying mental health factors that may be contributing to her smoking addiction. It may not be a bad idea to suggest that she seek professional counseling. Many addictions are prolonged by co-occurring disorders such as anxiety, depression or genetic disorders.Oftentimes, treatment of the underlying problem can help one to rid themselves of any addictions which may have been lying beneath the surface.

Parent spins the blindfolded teen/pre-teen when they mismatch. (The number of spins depends upon the quality of the match, as determined by the parent)

,


In this activity, the parent spins their blindfolded teen/pre-teens as follows (do one teen/pre-teen at the time):

Teen/pre-teen with most points -- 2 spins (1 in each direction).
Teen/pre-teen with 2nd most points -- 3 spins (1.5 in each direction).
Teen/pre-teen with 3rd most points -- 4 spins (2 in each direction).
Teen/pre-teen with 4th most points -- 5 spins (2.5 in each direction).
Teen/pre-teen with 5th most points -- 6 spins (3 in each direction).


Immediately after their spins each teen/pre-teen needs to walk in a straight line while being closely supervised by parent. The audience votes for teen/pre-teen with who walks in the straightest line, and the winner of the voting wins a small prize.

,, Enjoy the experience, but perhaps more importantly, encourage parents to use the opportunity to open dialog with their teens and pre-teens.

, It can contain the photos from the program, as well as the responses from the teens/pre-teens for each participant.

Find a quiet uneventful time to have a chat with your parent.,
Let her know that you sometimes find yourself wanting to leave the home of someone who you are visiting either with your parent or by yourself.,
Tell your parent that you would like to be able to communicate to her your deep desire to leave, but that you don't wish to be rude and therefore you do not want to say something like ""Mom, can we go home now?,
Suggest that you set up a ""password"" for use in just such situations.

,
Practice using the password so your mother (and you!),
Use the password next time you are getting restless or uncomfortable when visiting someone.

,
After your mother makes an effort to leave and gets you out the door, thank her for remembering and for taking your feelings seriously.

",How to Hint to Your Mom That You're Ready to Leave Someone's House Without Being Rude," Make sure she/he is in a good mood and ready to really listen to you about this important problem you are experiencing.;

,, will remember what you are doing and will get used to watching out for password usage. The password can work both ways. Your parent can ask you, ""How was lunch today?"" for example, and if you say it was a bad lunch, that means they should come get you and if you say it was a good lunch that means you want to stay.

Start the act ahead of time.,
Exhibit symptoms.,
Be subtle yet convincing.,
Do not recover too quickly.,
Avoid faking sick too often.",How to Stay Home from School1," Your parents are more likely to believe you when you wake up and claim to be sick if you lay the groundwork the night before.The sooner you can start your act, the more time you have to allow it to progress. Show a little fatigue the afternoon before you plan to fake your illness. For instance, instead of running around outside when you get home from school, choose to stay inside and laze around your room instead.
Act lethargic around your parents. They should get the impression that you are tired or ""feeling out of it."" In the evening, don’t follow your normal routine. If you watch T.V. at all, lay down and look disinterested and mopey. You should also go to bed early and make sure your parents notice.
Consider kicking things up a notch by eating a little less at dinner or pretending to attempt to eat, then clutching your stomach and looking pained. Claim that you don’t feel well. Definitely skip dessert. You also might ask your parent for some hot tea to “soothe your stomach.”
Tell your parents that a kid at school projectile vomited or that a friend wasn’t at school. Be sure this is a friend that your parents don’t know. This information will suggest that something is “going around.”;
, Outwardly visible symptoms, such as a rash, can be hard to fake convincingly, so for the most part, you should focus on displaying external signs of internal aches and pains.


Frequent trips to the bathroom can give the impression that you have a stomach bug. Jumping up quickly, running into the bathroom periodically, and flushing the toilet a lot will suggest to your parents that you have diarrhea or food poisoning.
If you decide to fake a migraine, you should act sensitive to light and sound, indicate that your head feels like it is throbbing, and claim to be nauseous.You should avoid watching T.V. or listening to music.
To fake a sore throat, act like it hurts to swallow and ask your parents for warm tea or cold foods.Suck on a few cough drops and avoid talking as much as possible, insisting that it hurts to do so when asked why you are being so quiet. Consider faking a few coughing fits, as well.
Indicate that your symptoms developed throughout the night. You should start your coughing fits or trips to the bathroom sometime between midnight and 6:00 AM.

, One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to put a little too much into your acting. If you are too dramatic about your pretend illness, your parents are actually more likely to see through your act.


It is generally a better idea to fake a simple illness rather than faking an illness that requires evidence. Mimicking the sound or appearance of vomit, for instance, is a risky move since your parents might catch you in the act of planting your fake evidence. Likewise, faking a high temperature by sticking the thermometer in something hot can backfire in the same way.
Do not protest too much if your parents suggest that you should stay home from school. You might think that acting concerned about missing class will make your act more convincing since being too eager about staying home can cause suspicion, but if you truly felt as awful as you are pretending to feel, your parents would probably not need to convince you to stay home. Hesitate before agreeing, but do not act like you are suddenly concerned about missing school, especially if that concern would be out of character.

, Never forget that your parents can drag you into school late if they think you have suddenly recovered or find out that you faked your illness. If you plan to stay home from school with a fake illness, you need to have that fake illness throughout the entire school day.


You should recover gradually throughout the day. Rest and take things easy. By the afternoon, you should say that you are starting to feel better but have not completely recovered. By the late evening, your recovery should be just about complete.

, If you lie about being sick too often, your parents might not believe you when you really do feel sick and legitimately need to stay home from school.

Be honest with yourself.,
Know what you want out of the conversation.,
Take some baby steps.,
Arrange a time to speak.,
Rehearse what you want to say.,
Ask them to listen.,
Say what you feel.,
Use open body language.,
Don’t be vague.,

Listen to your parents.,
Ask for their feedback.,
Continue the conversations.",How to Open Up to Your Parents," Especially if this is your first time having a heart-to-heart, you might feel scared, nervous, or not know where to begin. However, talking to your parents doesn’t have to be scary. You just have to know where to begin.. However, talking to your parents doesn’t have to be scary, just know where to begin. Think about why you want to open up to your parents and what the outcome might be. Is it as big of a deal as you think it is, or does it just feel scary?


Confront your fears and ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could realistically happen?” Discussions rarely turn out worse than you imagine, and you might be happily surprised by what happens.
One way to be honest and face your feelings is through journaling. Spend some time writing your thoughts and feelings about talking to your parents before you do it.;
, Identify what your purpose is and what you want to achieve with a conversation with your parents. When you are able to identify your purpose, you will be more effective at articulating your needs. For example, if you want to have a conversation with your parents because you are having trouble in school, then you could say, “Dad, I really need to talk to you. I have been having some concerns at school, and I would appreciate your guidance.” Usually you’ll want your parents to do one or more of the following:


Listen and validate what you're feeling and experiencing while offering advice and feedback.
Give you permission, or offer to help and support with something.
Provide you guidance when you may be in a bit of trouble, without negative harsh criticism of your errors that you may already be aware of and feel guilty about.

, If you have some big news to share that is a big deal, work up to it. Have some mini conversations about something that has happened to someone you know in school or in the news. Ask for their reactions and share your own. This can help you gauge how they might respond to you.


For example, you might ask a question to lead into a discussion about being gay. Say, “What did you think about that news story about that girl coming out as gay?” From there, it might be easier to traverse into talking about it or waiting for a different time.

, You may wish to set up a time to talk with your parents. This can help everyone give their full attention without having to rush off to other obligations or appointments. If you have siblings, ask them to give you some space. You might consider talking after dinner but well before bedtime so that everyone is well-fed and not tired.Say, “Can we chat for a bit tonight?” or, “Maybe we can talk sometime tomorrow?”
Keep distractions away so everyone can focus on the conversation. Put cell phones away and keep the TV off.

, If you’re nervous or scared to talk to your parents, think about what you want to say ahead of time. Decide what you want to talk about and how you want to say it. You might write some things down or try different ways to bring things up. If you’re nervous about how your parents might react, try different approaches to see which one feels most comfortable or which your parents might respond to more gently.For example, if you want to open up to your parents about a something they may disapprove of (like having a boyfriend or girlfriend), think about how they might take it, and plan to talk about it in a way that may be better received.

, Parents may have their own reactions and start to give advice or provide feedback before you’ve finished speaking. If you want to talk to your parents in an open way, ask them to really listen to you before you start a conversation. Say that it’s important to you and that you don’t want to be interrupted.Say, “I want to be open with you, and for me to feel comfortable talking to you, I need you to listen. Please hear me out.”
If you do want advice, let them know you’d like to finish speaking first.

, It’s likely you’ll be sharing your feelings if you want to open up to your parents. Talking about feelings can feel uncomfortable at first, so know how you feel before you speak. Identify what you’re feeling (“I feel sad. I feel confused. I feel angry.”) If you feel angry, notice if there are any other feelings you might feel along with anger such as sadness, disappointment, or hurt. Take a moment to calm down before speaking from a place of anger.For example, if you’re opening up to your parents about a recent move, say, “I’m having a hard time with the move. It’s difficult to make new friends and I feel lonely. I miss my old friends and feel sad about all the changes.”

, If your body is closed off, chances are that your emotions will be closed off as well. Be open in your own posture by not crossing your arms or hunching your shoulders. Make frequent eye contact. Practice maintaining open postures to more easily open up to your parents.Point your hips toward your parents, keep your shoulders back, and don’t cross your arms or legs.

, If you’re often in the habit of responding with, “I don’t know” or, “whatever,” try to kick the habit. Often, what this communicates to others is, “I don’t care” or, “I don’t want to think about this.” If you’re tempted to respond this way, pause for a moment and see if you’re avoiding something uncomfortable. Try to answer questions with honesty.For example, if you’re having a challenging day, say so instead of avoiding the question. Respond with, “I had a hard day, but I’m not ready to talk about it quite yet.”

, If sitting across the table from your parents makes you nervous or uncomfortable, find a way to talk differently. You may wish to go on a walk, write back and forth in a journal, or draw pictures. Whatever you do, don’t feel like you have to only communicate during serious discussions. Mix it up., You may wish to choose a time when you’re feeling neutral and not highly emotional. If you go into talking with your parents already feeling defensive, angry, or upset, it’s likely the feelings will escalate. Choose a time when you and your parents feel neutral.Remember that the more frequently you talk to your parents during your youth about difficult topics, the easier it will get. It may help if you set a daily time to talk to your parents about your everyday stuff. This builds a bond between you that can help you cope better when it comes to more serious conversations.
If things start to get heated, take a pause. You can return to the discussion later or in a few days to let everyone cool down.

, If you’re scared to open up to your parents or feel nervous or embarrassed about it, trust that you’ll get through it okay. If you’re having trouble getting the courage to talk, remember that your parents were once your age, too. They know you pretty well. Talking with your parents can help you feel relieved, find ways to cope, and problem-solve.If you don’t know how to start the conversation, say, “I want to talk to you, even though I feel nervous.“
Start talking and it will get easier from there.
Finding something trivial to chat with your parents about each day will help you cope during more difficult conversations that make you feel embarrassed.

, When opening up, keep the language you use focused on you, not on other people. For example, if you’re talking about an ended relationship, don’t talk about how awful the other person is, but talk instead about how they make you feel. Keep the focus on you.Say, “I feel sad” or, “I am concerned about what’s next.”

, Don’t use times to talk as an opportunity to bring back grudges or mistakes. Keep the conversation focused on the here and now without diving into the past. Start fresh without dragging past problems up.if you notice yourself holding onto something you feel hurt about from the past, let it go and recognize now is not the time to discuss it. Save it for another conversation.
Ask your parents to do the same for you. If they start to bring up old things, say, “I want to focus on the here and now.”

, As difficult as it may be to hear your parents out, don’t dismiss what they have to say. While you may not agree with everything they say, do give them the respect of listening to them when they’re speaking. Don’t interrupt them or become defensive. Hear what they have to say.Just like you want them to listen to you, give them the same courtesy back. The more everyone can engage in mature talks, the easier it will be for both you and them to open up.
Give some thought to what they say. While it may upset you now, you might find it helpful if you take some time to cool down.

, Your parents may be shocked or surprised by what you have to say. If they don’t know how to respond, give them some time. They may need to have a think, do some research, or call a friend. For example, if you tell your parents you’re feeling depressed, they may want to know more about the symptoms of depression or what they can do to help.Say, “I know you may feel shocked, but I want to check on you. Have you given any thought to what I said? Do you have any ideas on what to do next?”

, It’s rare that a discussion happens once and ends there. If you want to be open with your parents, keep opening up to them and let them know how you feel. Follow up with your conversations and start new ones. Being open with your parents means feeling safe to go to them with what’s on your mind. If they respond well to you initially opening up to them, continue to do so and know that they will be there for you.


Follow up on conversations you start, especially big ones. Say, “Can we keep talking about my depression?” or, “Can I come to you when I am facing hard decisions?”

Let your parents know if you are sick.,
Stay home after a tragedy.For instance, if you have recently lost a family member, friend, or another individual who you were close to, your grief is a legitimate reason to stay home from school.,
Be honest if bullying is a problem.,
Ask to play hooky.,
Get permission for a “mental health day.” It’s important to talk to your parents about stress and anxiety.,
Stay home if weather or other environmental conditions require it.,
Take other special circumstances into consideration.",How to Stay Home from School2," This is the most common reason students have for missing school. If you genuinely do not feel well or believe yourself to be ill, tell your parents and ask to stay home.


Many schools will ask that you stay home if you have an illness or other condition that could be contagious. Staying home allows you to recover and also prevents the spread of disease throughout the school.
Generally, you should stay home if you have a fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, trouble swallowing, rash, unusual sores, unusual spots, earache, moderate to severe headache, moderate muscle ache, muscle pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing, red or burning eyes, or head lice.You might also need to stay home if you are coughing, sneezing, or congested.
Stay home until you are free of symptoms without medication for a period of 24 hours, if possible.

, Be honest with your parents about how deeply the loss has affected you.


If the tragedy affected you but did not affect your parents, you might worry that they will not understand your grief. Grief is a universal feeling, though, and most people can at least relate to it well enough to allow a grieving person time to work through it.
Understand that, by necessity, your initial mourning period will need to have an end. Intense grief might last for a long time, and you might not be able to do anything about it on your own. If you do not feel capable of going to school after a few days to a week, though, you should consider talking to a counselor to help you work through your sorrow.

, If you are the victim of a bully or group of bullies at school, talk to your parents or legal guardians about it.Explain how difficult school life has become as a result of the bullying and ask to take a day or two off while the issues get sorted out.


Many students make the mistake of keeping quiet about their bullying. You might worry about seeming weak, being labeled a “tattletale,” or making things worse by talking about it. Nothing will ever get better if you do not take steps to put an end to the bullying, and during your adolescent years, getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life is one of the most effective things you can do to get the bullying to stop.Bullying can have long-term effects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia.Take care of your future self by speaking up about bullying when it happens.

, Tell your mom or dad that you’d like a special day with them, and ask them to call in sick from work. This plan might work especially well if you are graduating and moving away to college soon, or if it’s a light work day for you and your parent (e.g., you don’t have any tests or assignments due and your parent doesn’t have a pressing deadline).

, While adults occasionally forget just how stressful school life can be, the truth is that it really can be tough. If you are dealing with ordinary school-related stress, it might be more beneficial for you to push through. If stress, anxiety, and depression become more serious issues, though, let your parent or legal guardian know and ask for a day off.If you suspect that you might have a serious mental health issue, like depression or an anxiety disorder, ask your parents to schedule an appointment with your doctor, as well. Doing so can emphasize to your parents the severity of your stress, and if you do have an actual disorder, a trip to the doctor can help you get the disorder under control.

, In the event of a massive blizzard, major flooding, or other circumstances that make traveling to school dangerous, your school system might close for the day, regardless. If the conditions are hazardous and the school does not close, however, consider staying home.


Usually, your parent or legal guardian can help determine if conditions are severe enough to justify staying home, so you might not need to do much persuading here. If your parents are staying home from work due to the weather, they will likely be more open to the idea of keeping you home from school, as well.

, A family vacation or visit from a relative who lives far away might give you a reason to be absent from school, but you should avoid missing school for reasons like this too often. Consider what you might miss if you go to school versus what you might miss if you stay home and work with your parents to decide of staying home is a valid option.


Note that many schools will not accept reasons like these as valid excuses. If this is the case with your school, you will need to let your parents know so that they can tell the school you will be absent without providing a reason.
Typically, if you know that you will be home from school ahead of time, your parent or legal guardian should write a note for you to take in a day or two before your planned absence. This will give your teachers time to prepare work for you to take home over your absence.

Be intentionally late.,
Miss the bus.,
Lose things.",How to Stay Home from School3," Plan some “lag time” into your morning routine so that you are just a few minutes too late to be able to get to school on time.Get dressed really slowly. Spill your breakfast on yourself so you have to change. Dress again… very slowly.
Pretend you can’t find something that you really need, such as one of your shoes or your required gym shorts. Find them, finally, but take five or ten minutes to do so.
Complain loudly about having a bad day; turn on the waterworks if necessary. If you are lucky, your parent might be sympathetic and let you stay home.
Be aware that your lateness affects others, such as your parents, who need to get to work by a certain time. Know that you may be putting their jobs in jeopardy, and decide if missing school is worth it.

, Missing the school bus might be an accident, or it might be planned. Either way, missing the bus just might get you out of class if your parents leave for work early in the morning or if they don’t have time to drive you to school.Get to the bus stop just after the bus usually leaves. You don’t want to be too obvious about planning to miss your ride. However, take a long time walking back home from the bus stop. If you are lucky, your parents won’t have time to take you to school by the time you get back home.If your parents aren’t home when you miss the bus, be sure to let them know after the point at which they might come get you and take you to school. Sound mildly disappointed about missing class so they don’t suspect you missed the bus on purpose. You could remark, for instance, that it's too bad you are missing the really cool experiment you were supposed to try in science class.
If a parent is still home after you miss the bus, they might offer to drive you to school on their way to work. Make a big deal about how you don’t want them to be late to work. Tell them that you are prepared to deal with the consequences of being late, but that you don’t want your lateness to affect their routine. Don’t come on too strong, though. Your parents are likely well skilled at telling when you are lying.

, You can’t go to school without your books or the flash drive with your homework on it, right? Search high and low for what you have lost. The messier your house typically is, the easier it will be to drag out your search past the time you need to leave for school.


The smaller the object, the easier to “lose.” For instance, your mom might find it difficult to believe that you lost your backpack or laptop.
The more important the object, the more it will be likely that you need to miss school if you can’t find it. Losing your glasses or a contact lens, for instance, is more significant than losing your notebook because it affects your learning ability throughout the school day (and, depending on how bad your eyesight is, possibly also affects your ability not to walk into things).
If you drive yourself to school, you could lose your keys. However, if you make this a habit, there may be tough consequences (such as your parents suspending your driving privileges and making you take the bus).

"
"
Persuade a parent or guardian to call in.,
Call in yourself if the school allows it.,
Get a doctor's note.",How to Stay Home from School4," This is standard procedure. Your parent or legal guardian will need to call the school and explain that you cannot or will not be coming in that day.


Most schools only require your parent or legal guardian to say that you will not be coming into class that day. Some stricter schools, however, might require a specific excuse, so be sure to check your school’s handbook. The idea behind this practice is to reduce the amount of unexcused absences and to keep tabs on the sorts of illnesses going around.

, Many schools require a parent or legal guardian of a student to call in regardless of that student's age, but some will allow a student who is a legal adult (age 18 or older) to make the phone call on his or her own behalf.

, For prolonged periods of illness, your school might require you, a parent, a guardian, or a family member to bring a signed doctor's note stating that you are legitimately ill and needing more time to recover.


A physician's note becomes necessary after your illness extends beyond a certain period of time. The exact amount of time can vary by district, so you will need to check your school's rules to know at what point the note becomes a necessity. This amount of time usually ranges anywhere between three to ten days, with ten days being more common.

List the ways in which you will be caring for the bird.,
Make a sample meal plan for your bird.,

Present solutions to potential problems.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get a Bird1," Ask your parents to sit down with you for a discussion during a time when they won’t be distracted (e.g. after supper, before the evening news). Arrange the time a day or two in advance to make sure that you have time to prepare. Right before your discussion, make sure to turn off the TV, radio, or anything else that could distract from your talk.;
, Begin your presentation by telling your parents what type of bird you want and list some of the things you like about it. Talk about the positive qualities of this bird (e.g. that it is a lively and entertaining). Mention the reason why you think this bird would be a good addition to the family.For instance, tell your parents that you want a pet cockatiel because cockatiels are intelligent, friendly, quieter than other birds, and family-friendly.
To make sure you give a detailed presentation and don’t forget anything, write down everything that you are telling your parents and read it out to them. If you wish, give them a booklet with all of your points and research listed clearly.

, Tell your parents exactly how much the bird you want will cost and where it is available. Contact local pet stores to see what birds they have available and what prices they are being sold for. If you can, visit the store to see which bird you like best and get pricing information in person., Show your parents that you have done a lot of research about the bird you want by telling them exactly what kind of indoor cage it will require. As a general rule, smaller birds like finches or canaries require a minimum of 1000 square centimeters in floor area, while larger birds like parrots need 15,000 square centimeters.Write down the specifications for the cage you need, and look into stores that sell cages like it.Look into a travel cage as well, for use in case of vet visits or emergencies.

, Outline the tasks that you will do regularly to care for the bird that you wish to get. For instance, note that you will feed it and change the lining of its cage daily (which is required for proper hygiene). Doing so may reassure your parents that they will not be the ones left to take care of the bird all the time., Research the type of bird you want, and then write a sample menu for what you would feed it in a given week to keep it healthy and satisfied. In general, birds are healthiest when fed high quality pellet food, with a side of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Take note that, contrary to popular belief, seeds are fattening and not as nutritious as other bird foods., Show that your bird’s health and well-being will be important to you by writing down a list of local avian veterinarians. In addition, write down any walk-in or emergency veterinary clinics that treat birds. You should also look up a number for poison control, in the event that your bird ingests something potentially toxic.


To find an avian veterinarian near you, visit the Association of Avian Veterinarian’s website at http://www.aav.org/search/custom.asp?id=1803.

, Try to guess what arguments your parents will give for not wanting to get a bird and write them down. Come up with answers and solutions to these concerns beforehand so you are prepared. If you have a well-informed response to their concerns, you will prove that you have done a lot of research and thought things through. For instance, if you think your parents will be worried about a bird chewing wires or getting caught in a ceiling fan, show them a plan for bird-proofing certain rooms in the house (i.e. hiding or covering wires, closing windows and doors).

If malicious gossip, rumour spreading, and lies become severe enough, not only are they forms of bullying, they can also become Human Resources issues as well.",How to Squelch Malicious Gossip," This gives you more credibility. If someone's bold enough to make up gossip about you then they probably do it to others as well, which means they will eventually lose credibility. Don't say ""Well she..."" say something like ""Those things aren't true, but I'll let you make up your own mind about so-and-so."";
, Find out who created the malicious gossip or rumours and who spread it. Make sure you are totally calm before you do it. Ask why the person spread the rumour. While one person may appear to be the source, they aren't always. A lot of rumors start from one miscommunication that turns into a bigger problem.

, Rumours are a form of social bullying and it is important that you don't let the bullying affect your life.

, Even if you hate their guts don't give them the satisfaction of thinking that it affects you.

, If you go out of your way to defend yourself it will seem as though you have something to hide.

, Ask to stay anonymous and report the trouble that you're having with this person. If the authority that you contacted doesn't pay any attention to your report go to a higher authority and so on.

, This will help you win the battle.

, After you win, the spreader will probably want to be your friend. Refuse the offer, even if you don't want to, so that people won't want to mess with you.

,, Remember, be extra careful concerning whom you confide in, as not everyone keeps information to themselves; and you never know who might be hearing and looking. Try to keep a low profile. If in doubt, check with someone you trust: e.g. parents, boss, trusted friend, relative.

, It can give them the morsels that you have something to hide. The best way is to be calm, honest, and concise.

, They might think you have something to hide, that you are being rude, or that they can get sarcastic or angry with you and say 'It is my business'. They can then spread it to others, and might press you for information even more.

, Even if you are not a confident person, you can always try to be one. Ooze confidence out of yourself, even in tricky situations. The key to being confident is knowing your assets, polishing them, and showing them off to the world, but remember to also be humble!

, Even if you have had the worst day imaginable, and you really can't handle them, stick at it. Keep your cool because you know you are invincible!

, Gossip, rumour spreading and lies can land someone out of a job and if serious, with the law as well (i.e. the offenses of libel and slander).

For example, your mom may want you involved in basketball because she wants you to have a healthy lifestyle where you're physically active. This insight will give you ideas of how to compromise. You need to figure out ways other than basketball to be physically active.If you're already involved in too many after school activities, compromise with them. Ask the why behind what club or sport they want you to be involved in.
If they want you to get money or scholarships for college, consider getting a job related to your desired major now to save up for it.
If they want you to gain valuable experiences, volunteer for fundraisers or organizations that you’re interested in learning about.;
, Tell them honestly about your daily activities. This makes your parents feel important and in the know about what’s going on in your life.

Run on the treadmill or exercise outside daily.
Play sports with your parents, and encourage them to exercise with you.
Read or review notes while you exercise. This will score you multitasking and bonus points with your parents.Drink plenty of water, not just juice, sodas, or sports drinks.
Opt for a fruit instead of the chocolate bar.

"
Choose an area of interest.,
Research the organization.,
Volunteer consistently.,
Get a letter of verification from the organization.",How to Convince Your Parents You Don't Have to Be Involved with Sports or a Club3," Whether it’s helping a cultural group, mentoring younger kids, or volunteering at the local stable, choose a position and topic you’re interested in.


If you need ideas, ask your school’s guidance office for help in finding something beneficial to do outside of school.
Volunteering can range from donating your used clothing to planting trees for Arbor Day.Consider teaching computer skills to the elderly or coaching a youth sport’s team., Once you've found an area of interest, you can look into organizations that explore that area. For example, you may find a local animal shelter to volunteer at if you love animals. You should do a little research to figure out how to volunteer. You should also make sure the company's ethics match your personal passions.


Learn about the volunteer process. How does one become a volunteer? Is there a training session? Do you have to be a certain age to volunteer without a parent? Can anyone volunteer, or do you have to meet specific requirements.
Also, make sure the organization is a place you would be happy to donate your time to. Not every organization will match with your values. Returning to the animal shelter example, maybe you feel strongly against euthanasia. You would not want to work for a kill shelter if this is the case.

, Most colleges and hiring managers like to see consistency and commitment when it comes to volunteer work. Stay at the organization for at least 6 months to two years.


Work volunteering into your weekly schedule. If you're quitting a sports team or club to volunteer, you can use the time freed up to volunteer. For example, if you no longer have hockey practice on Tuesday afternoons, maybe you can use that time to do some volunteer work.
Commit to the mission of the organization, and learn all you can in your time there. You'll want to be informed about an organization to come off as an active volunteer. Ask founding members about how the organization has grown and changed, and what their main missions and goals are.
Get to know the people there, and keep in contact with them after you leave. You can use people you worked with as references down the road.

, Often times, colleges or jobs will need letters of recommendation or proof that you were where you said you were. Ask someone who supervised you for a letter.


Most organizations will understand the need for a letter of verification, so don't be shy about asking. Simply approach the manager of the organization and say something like, ""If you have time, could you write me a letter of verification proving I worked here?""
If you need the letter for a particular application, make sure you ask well in advance. Volunteer supervisors may be busy, and you want to make sure you give them enough time to compose the letter.
By the end of your time with the organization, make sure you get your letter on official paper with the manager or your advisor's signature and dates of your service.

Pick a day to tell them.,
Write down, in private, what you want to say.,
Be strong in the face of their disagreement.",How to Tell Your Parents You're Not Interested in the Family Business," Make sure that it's not a busy ""business day"", or when the accounts are due, or when the taxes need to be paid. Try to get them when they are happy and fairly relaxed. Another option is to pick one parent - the most approachable one. Again, when they are in relaxed mode. This way, picking just one parent can make it easier on you, and also gives them time to digest the news and pass it on to the other parent in their own way.;
, This is important, because you want to come across as if you have given it some thought, which makes you sound quite mature. Writing it down also gives you the opportunity to sort out how you say it, and what plans you have for the future. If your parents can see that you have other ideas for your life that will make you happy (or happier) than the family business, they should be more agreeable. Every parent wants their child to be happy.

, Don't cry or whine or have a tantrum. Don't let them blackmail you. Make it clear that this is the path you have chosen and explain why it would make you happier. Even if they say something drastic like ""If you don't go into this business, then don't expect anything from me when I die"" stay strong. They probably don't mean it, and if they do....then they are quite disappointing as parents and you are better off doing your own thing anyway.

"
See for yourself if the person is a gossip - if you are just taking someone else's word that they are, then you'll never know the truth and will have been wrongly accusing them of gossiping.,
Be aware of what you say when you are speaking to them.,
Change the subject if you are uncomfortable with what you are discussing.,
Share good things with your friend about yourself.,
Make sure the friend knows that what you are telling them is private and for no one else to know, if you are intent on sharing personal information with them.,
Get them to really open up about themselves - one thing gossips love to talk about is themselves.,
Keep a close-knit group of friends and family who you can trust and depend on.,
Make sure other friends and family members who you can trust stop gossiping too.,
Confront and express your feelings to your friend if you have proof they have been gossiping about you.,
Consider terminating the friendship.",How to Talk to a Friend Who Gossips," If they openly share intimate details of their relationships or friendships with other people with you, then you can be fairly certain that they will be doing the same with your personal information. Note however that if you are exceptionally good friends, then they may not be doing this, but generally, it is a good way to spot a gossip.;
, Although it may be annoying, if you really want to stay friends with this person, then you can't let your guard down even for a moment. Try to keep off certain subjects which could portray you badly or sharing your deepest thoughts with the person and certainly do not give out other people's information as it will almost certainly got out that you leaked the information.

, If the friend pesters you to tell them, stand your ground and say that it's personal.

, This helps you build your confidence and will stop hurtful gossip spreading around, but make sure you don't over-do it otherwise you will appear to be a big-head with an ego. Remember that nobody gossips about nice things, so if you give the friend very little or nothing negative to say about you, then you probably won't be mentioned at all.

, Make sure you are persistent in telling them this, but do not treat them like an idiot.

, Although it may sound nasty, if they share something really personal about themselves, keep it as a back-up so that if they ever threaten to tell someone else your secrets then you can remind them that you also have heard theirs too. This will remain at the back of their mind when speaking to others and will help to keep your secrets safe. Of course, don't use this information, but in a friendly way mention that you both have shared so much with each other.

, It may not stop the friend gossiping, but you will know that if they hear anything, they will tell you. If you can trust them, ask them to keep an eye out to make sure that your friend isn't gossiping to others.

, Remember, gossipers are looking for acceptance and think that information is power (thus sharing all their gossip means they are powerful in their eyes), so if you make sure that none of your other friends or family are comfortable with gossiping, then the gossiper will obey and follow suit.

, Tell them that it hurt your feelings and that you trusted them with this information. Only confront the person if you are certain they have been talking about you - again, don't just go on someone else's word.

, If you really cannot make the friendship work, then it is probably best you both go your separate ways. At best, you could keep them as an acquaintance who you can make small talk with over a coffee or at the supermarket. If you want to end the friendship, do it gradually over time - if you get into a huge discussion about it then your friend will almost certainly start spreading rumours about you, but if you simply stop visiting as often, then you may be able to avoid this. Handle the situation with care and sensitivity, more so than any other. If all else fails, tell them to go tell your secrets - they will feel like they've lost their power over you and won't feel so eager to spread rumours.

Note if they are constantly whispering to other people, and when you come they abruptly turn back.,
If you suspect someone is talking behind your back, find more proof.,
Watch for signs of distancing.,
Avoid involving a friend in the matter because this will only get them into the fight.,
If you figure out your best friend is talking behind your back, then maybe they aren't really a friend after all.,
Think about the circumstances.,
If they suddenly stop talking (as in not even finish their sentence) and stare at you, then they probably are talking about you.

,
If you are speaking behind ANYONE'S back, anyone in the world, you might as well forgive them for it and move on forgiving yourself just for noticing.

,
If this person gossips about others to YOU, then they probably gossip about you to other people also.

,
Realize that if everyone were perfect, you wouldn't be facing such a thing, so being that nothing is perfect, you do have to expect as much from anyone.

",How to Know if Someone Is Talking Behind Your Back," This is the most obvious sign. However, do not assume someone is talking about you just from body language, such as staring, giggling, whispering when you're not around, and/or cutting off a conversation when you approach. Even though this can be a sign, it doesn't necessarily mean it. For example, if a group of people stop talking when you approach, but continue when you leave, they might be talking about something they don't want anybody to hear, not just you.;
, Don't just confront them automatically; it will make the situation worse, and if they weren't talking about you at first, after a confrontation, they certainly will. Find out if they are suddenly asking more personal questions behind your back.

, If they used to be your friend, they are now isolating themselves away from you.

, It is ok to ask friends for advice, but don't be upset with them if it doesn't go your way. Don't ever hurt the person you ""think"" might be talking about you because chances are they're not. Be careful of who you confide in and where you confide.

, It's happened to many before, and it hurts. Either build the relationship, or cut it off, depending on how serious it is.

, Who were they talking to? Why did they say it? What did they say? What did they mean by it? How much does it hurt? Who is the person who said it? Can I build back my relationship with them? Should I confront them (only to be done IF you know the person well , if you're certain they're talking about you, and if you're sure it won't make you look bad).

Figure out your goal.,
Prey on anxieties.,
Satisfy the public desire.,
Make the rumor believable.,
Keep it simple.,
Convince others to spread your rumor.,
Hone in on the bigmouths.,
Use several means to transmit the rumor.Aside from passing the rumor by word of mouth, see if you can spark the rumor elsewhere.,
Make the rumor hard to disprove.,
Keep your accomplices to a minimum.,
Don't let the rumor lead back to you.",How to Start a Rumor," Maybe you want to humiliate someone, maybe you want to break up a relationship, or take down a government. You might even want to start a rumor about yourself to get more attention. The reasons for starting a rumor are many, but in order to create the right rumor you need to have a goal in mind while you make it up.


Decide if there is a more ethical way of achieving your goal. Unless the rumor is true, starting a rumor involves lying and deceiving people that trust you. It may not be worth it.;
, Many of the most widely spread rumors trigger an emotional response in a great number of people. During World War II, both England and Germany made propaganda posters against gossip because the spread of war rumors caused such panic among the public.These rumors spread so fast because they made people nervous and afraid. If you create a rumor that preys on a common fear or anxiety, there will be a strong chance that people feel compelled to talk about it.


Try to make the topic one that is relatable to the most people. Most people generally have anxieties about their safety, how they look, money. For example, if you spread a rumor that you won the lottery you would probably find it spread pretty fast and influenced the way a lot of people acted around you.

, If many people want to believe the rumor is true, then they will take it as truth.If a movie is very popular, it would be easy to spread a rumor they are making a sequel. Whether it is true or not, a good number of people are likely to believe it because they hope it is true. People spread rumors about celebrities because they are jealous and hope to bring down the image of their target. The rumor catches on due to a mutual desire by a large number of people to spread the same impression.

, A rumor can be shocking, but it should not seem ridiculous. People might believe that you were attacked by a bear and survived. Most people probably won't believed you were attacked by a talking panda with a samurai sword. If your rumor is going to survive, make it plausible.

, Avoid adding too many details, so the main idea of the rumor is not lost. A single detail or two is okay to add a little context to the rumor. However, keep it simple and count on the snowball effect. Rumor spreaders are known to add their own details.


To give an example, if you were to start a rumor that someone had cosmetic surgery, you'd have very little details to distract from the actual rumor. If you say someone had paid $8,000 to have their lips done to look like exactly like Angelina Jolie after her first surgery, not her second one; it gets confusing. Is the rumor that she spent a lot of money, that she had surgery, or that she has some weird obsession with Angelina Jolie? Just keep it simple instead.

, The key to getting a rumor going is to convert someone to believing your story. Some people are more gullible than others and are more likely to accept a rumor as truth. Others might ask for evidence or your source. Try to avoid starting your rumor by telling anyone that has a very curious nature.

, If you tell the shy person, your rumor will probably be not be passed along very often. But if you tell someone that gossips a lot and has a lot of friends, the rumor will travel further.


It is also a good idea to point to a big gossiper as the origin of the rumor. Often times a big gossip spreader will talk so much that they can't remember what they heard and who it came from.

,


Try making a fake account on social media and spread the rumor online. Since almost everyone is connected through social media, rumors can spread very fast.
Leave evidence around. This can be difficult, but it will go a long way towards helping your rumor. If you start a rumor that you saw your target eating dog food, it may seem too silly to others. But if you also plant pieces of dog food around the target's desk or in their lunch and people notice, your rumor will suddenly seem quite believable and take off.

, Don't make up a story that can easily be disproven or the rumor will die quickly.If the story can't be discredited with proof, it will have a better chance at spreading.


As an example, if you say someone lost an arm in a car accident, the rumor won't hold up very long when the person is seen with both their arms intact. However, if you start a rumor that someone hit a homeless person with their car, it may be very difficult to prove as a lie.

, You may need an accomplice or two at times, but keep the circle small. The more people that are in on the rumor, the more likely it is one of them will confess the truth. Only involve people that you know can keep a secret. Sometimes it can be very hard to never take credit for masterminding a successful rumor.

, The best way is first tell the rumor to a friend you trust. Tell the friend if they tell the rumor to anyone else to say they did not hear it from you because you promised to keep it a secret. If for some reason the rumor comes back to you, your best bet is just to deny it since there is no proof anyway.

Make a Scale: Obviously, not all gossip is as juicy as others, so having a pre-set general scale will help when deciding how many points the gossiper gets.,
Awarding points should be done fairly, of course, but if a member of your clique constantly reports gossip that is not important/late/dull or otherwise untrue, then you are more than welcome to deduct half to a full point of Gossip points from their total.,
Gossip should be handled delicately, so even though you and your clique/friends find it totally alpha, and cool to gossip right in front of the victim(s), it's actually mean, and very bitchy.",How to Issue Gossip Points," For an example...



0 Points: The gossiper gets 0 (zero) points if... A) She/He is reporting a story that is as over as Britney and Justin Timberlake B) has repeated a gossip story told by another member of the clique and has not provided new information, or a correction to the previously reported gossip, or C) the gossip sounds highly unlikely and/or is verified untrue.

1-3 Points: The gossiper can receive between 1 (one) and 3 (three) points if A) She/He has re-reported a previously gossiped story, providing new details or corrections to the story (Exceptions: If the gossip is something very juicy, and corrections are provided, the gossiper can and should get 3 points and above. The maximum of points can be decided by the alpha and/or the rest of the clique. Smaller stories, though, can receive between 1-3). The gossiper can get between 1-3 points also if B)Its gossip about someone younger and otherwise not important to them C) If its gossip scarcely heard around school, but isn't a big deal or D) The gossip is highly untrue or unlikely but was funny.

3-6 Points: The gossiper can receive gossip points between 3 (three) and 6 (six) if A) The gossip is a minor story about someone who is B-List status and higher, B) The gossip is an interesting/humorous minor secret/story about the gossiper his or herself (""Minor"" story examples are things like new diets the gossiper may have started, or how they talked to a super hot guy the other day. The story, though, must be a little bit more interesting than ""Yesterday, I bought new undies from Victoria's Secret) C) If the story's likeliness is in question, but seems likely and is funny/about something of equal or higher status or D) is a complaint about another member or friend of the Clique- after all, complaints lead to cat fights, and that's worth 10 gossip points (Or more!)

6-8 Points: The gossiper can receive gossip points between 6 (six) and 8 (eight) if A) It's a juicy story about someone of lower status/unimportant to the clique, B) Its about a hookup with a crush or boy/girlfriend (More points may need to be awarded if the hookup went past the run of the mill making out), C) The gossip is a correction or more informed report of 'good' gossip that had previously been reported or D) Juicy gossip that isn't exactly 10-worthy.

8-10: The gossiper can receive between 8 (eight) and 10 (ten) points if the story is juicy, detailed, and verified true, or highly likely.

10+: You just know when a piece of gossip deserves 10+;
, So if Sally-Jane where to report that B-lister Becca Anne Smithy had her you-know-what and walked around with bloody pants all day four days ago, but Mimi Mindly and just about 50% of your grade had reported it to you the day it happened, Sally-Jane could have potentially received 5 points, but because she consistently reports untrue things and is very late with her gossip, she gets a 3, instead. If someone reports gossip promptly, the gossip turns out to be true most of the time, and consistently updates previous gossip reported incorrectly, then feel free to award an extra point!

, Everyone gossips, but do so with your friends in private. Just like the PC, gossip when you guys are carpooling together in the morning, or if you must do so at lunch, assume a ' gossip position' and speak in hushed tones. Also, gossip all together! If Marilyn and Gabby gossip while walking to class and both end up getting 6 points, then later the rest of the clique has no idea why, explaining the story may make the other girls feel left out, and also, doing so together gives everyone a fair chance to get their points. What if Bethy-Lou knew the story Gabby reported to Marilyn hours before Gabby did? Would it be fair, then, for Gabby to get the point? No it wouldn't, and tiffs like that can be avoided if gossiping is done together!

, Morals are the foundation to not creating drama and understanding how to address drama.  Instill whatever moral values you think are important.  This can include not talking about someone behind their back, remaining truthful, standing up for a friend, or being the person who stands up for anyone.  Your daughter can create drama by gossiping about friends or insulting other girls behind their backs, or she can support her fellow women by standing up for them.  If you have a shy daughter, remind her that standing up for someone does not always mean verbally confronting another, but can also mean leaving a conversation or changing a subject when someone is being unpleasant.

,  You, her parent(s), are there for her to talk about anything and to provide help.  Her school administrators are there to prevent bullying and make school pleasant.  Other adult figures, such as church group leaders, counselors, older siblings or other relatives, can also help her to deal with any situation.

,  She is a human, not an object, and she has worth regardless of how the ""popular"" girls act toward her or how many boys ask her out.  These are hard lessons to learn, but it is easier for girls to get over social drama in one aspect of their life if they have a fleshed out sense of personality and identity.

,  Respect your daughter as a person and understand if she doesn't want to talk about it immediately.  Sometimes, she can be embarrassed at her situation or her own conduct.  She might be confused or hurt or unsure of how to ask for help.  Give her time.

,  Attempt to figure out the situation.  Bullying can frequently be dealt with by school administrators, but having a parent contact them to inform them of the situation is a necessary first step.  Other drama might be less obvious but just as damaging, such as other girls commenting on your daughter's weight or eating habits.  Have healthy conversations with your daughter about common issues that affect girls of her demographic, including eating disorders or mental illness.  If you are uncomfortable discussing topics of this nature, buy books on the topic geared toward her age and make them available to her.

,  Have family nights or weekend trips.  Remind your daughter that she is loved and supported at home, regardless of whatever is going on with her friends and school.  Be there for her but don't push her.  This is a hard balance to achieve, and it's okay to make mistakes.  But make sure she knows she is loved.

,  If something like girl scouts or a sports team becomes more pain than fun, allow your daughter to pursue a different interest.

,  This might include helping her understand what she could say to stand up for herself or others in the future or how to reach out to a trusted adult.  Remind her that it's okay to cut people out of your life if they don't treat you well.  She doesn't have to be friends with everyone.

Talk to someone in authority.",How to Deal With People Talking About You Behind Your Back1," Though you may be tempted to act out or confront the person, sometimes the best response is to ignore gossip.

Gossip, but don't be a gossip.",How to Gossip," Make sure that your friends, classmates, and acquaintances all know that you are always there for them, and ready to be a sympathetic ear. If you're a helpful listener, people will seek you out when they have really juicy gossip to share. Help them to unburden themselves of those weighty secrets. Then, you know, spread them around.


Practice your active listening skills. Make eye contact when someone is talking, nodding your head along to encourage them. Repeat and summarize what they've said, and encourage them to talk more.
Sometimes, it's helpful to give a little gossip of your own to help get someone talking. If a friend seems bothered by some problem, say something like, ""You know, I've been feeling the same way. Tell me how you're feeling"" to get them started. Then just keep talking about them instead of circling back to you.;
, People typically want to keep secrets to themselves. If you want to bring gossip up to the surface, you've got to learn how to dig below and get at the good stuff.


Pay attention to body language when someone talks to you. If someone is shifty, uncomfortable, and won't make eye contact, it likely shows that they're feeling uncomfortable about a topic you're discussing.
Ask leading questions to keep them talking. ""What happened next?"" or ""And then what did he say?"" will help to keep the gossip rolling, even if the other person doesn't want to talk. Be insistent.

, If you like to talk, go where the talkers go, and hang out with people who like to gossip. Learn who you can trust with secrets, and who will spread them on to others by asking pointed questions. If someone gives you the goods when you ask, ""What's her deal?"" you know you've got a friend in dirt.


Added bonus: If you have a friend who is always blurting out secrets, it makes it easier to blame gossip on them, if necessary.
If your friends are unable to keep secrets, keep your own secrets under close lock and key. Be very careful you don't go from gossiper to gossiped-about.
Women often get an unfair reputation for being the gossipers of the world. In truth, studies reveal that men are slightly more willing to gossip, especially when it comes to workplace rumors and conversations., While the gossip of strangers is never quite as good as the gossip of people you actually know, good dirt is good dirt, regardless. If you want to find something good to gossip about, pay attention to what other people are saying around you. When you're on the bus, in a coffee shop, or just taking a walk, keep an ear out for good side conversations.


Pro tip: Wear ear buds or headphones when you're sitting somewhere in public, and pretend you're listening to something and can't hear. People will talk more freely if they think you're not able to hear what they're saying.

, Facebook and Twitter are great places to dig up some serious gossip. People tend to be less guarded and more loose-lipped when they're posting online, which means you can find out stuff they might not normally tell you.


If you know a couple train-wrecks, set your phone to send you a notification any time that person posts something, or change your settings to promote that person's stuff. Be sure you don't miss out on any ridiculousness.
When someone posts a big batch of pictures, make sure you look through it for signs of potential gossip. Where did they go? Why? What's going on there? Try to come up with good answers.

, Read celebrity gossip blogs and dirt-sheets as well. While gossiping about what one of the Kardashians is up to might seem less exciting than people you actually know, starting out by dishing on celebs can be a good way to transition into juicer gossip. Get the conversation rolling with red carpet talk, then dish on the real dirt.

, Gossiping requires a fine balance. You don't want to seem like an enthusiastic gossiper, because you want to Try to maintain your relationship as someone who is trustworthy to speak to. But at the same time, you also want to spread it around, because, well, it's fun. So, you've got to be a good actor.


When you approach some gossipy territory in a conversation, start looking over your shoulder, as if you're worried someone will hear. Ask if the other person has heard the news first.
If they haven't heard, make a worried face and wring your hands. Say, ""Oh, well, I really shouldn't say. It isn't right to gossip.""
When you get ready, lean in close and start with, ""Well, now, you didn't hear this from me..."" Your audience will be locked in.

, When you have good gossip, you can't just tell everyone you know, unless you want it to blow back on you. Besides, you don't have to tell a lot of people, just a select few.


If your good friend told you something in confidence, don't tell all your other friends. Instead, tell someone at work. If someone at work did something super-embarrassing, don't tell all your coworkers, tell your friends.
When and if the gossip does eventually get around, everyone will forget who they heard it from originally, most of the time, but you want to be sure to distance yourself from it as much as possible.

, Gossip shouldn't be something that you broadcast or speak about loudly, for everyone to hear. Make sure you take people aside, use very quiet voices, and don't let anyone you don't know hear what you're talking about. Even if you're spreading gossip, it's important to Try to limit it as much as possible.This goes for gossiping online, even more so. Private messages of gossip? Ok, maybe. Posting on your own, or someone else's board publicly? Just don't.

, Treat your gossiping like you're treating a friend to privileged information, not like you're just broadcasting gossip to anyone who will listen. Make sure that everyone you tell knows that this isn't something to spread around, even if they plan on spreading it around like you are. This is the code of the gossipers.

, In some cases, you can learn to suggest your gossip more than you trumpet it. Start telling the detail you want to spread around, but stop just short of telling the whole story. Tell enough to let the other person figure it out, but not so much that you'll need to feel bad about yourself.


If you know someone at school just made out with someone else, you don't have to say so to spread it around. Try this: ""Did you hear about James and Janet last weekend? I heard they got pretty up close and personal. Not that you heard it from me.""

, Gossip means chatting with a variety of people about things that may or may not be any of your business, but things that are true. This is considered socially rude by lots of people, but still relatively harmless. Spreading lies or rumors, however, is just mean. Don't do it.If you're not sure something you're discussing is true, or is harmless, then keep your mouth shut. There's no need to spread it around.

, If you're going to be a gossiper, keep your own secrets under lock and key. You should understand the impulses of the gossiper more than your average person, if you're one of them. So, any indiscretions, flubs, embarrassing details that come up for you? Talk to only the most trusted and close-lipped people that you know.


Usually, you can always trust your parents. If you really need to talk to someone about something, talk to them. However old you are, however old your parents are, that's an important part of a parent-child relationship.

, While Facebook might seem like the ultimate in gossip, make sure you don't leave too much evidence of your gossip-spreading. If somebody wants to accuse you later of spreading some gossip, don't do it on something that can be copied and pasted.


Social networking can be a great way to find good stuff to gossip about, but not necessarily a great place to spread that gossip. Never do it publicly.
Be careful about texts, too. Text messages can be forwarded and can be copied. Including pictures. Keep that stuff pretty guarded.

, If anybody ever confronts you about spreading rumors, deny it. Things get around in all kinds of ways, and it's always better to Try to keep yourself away from it, if possible. If someone is really stuck on getting you to admit it, say you didn't know it was that sensitive of a subject and apologize. Sound as sincere as possible.

, Gossip is one of those things that everyone does occasionally, but nobody is proud of. If you're regularly gossiping and seeking out details just for the purpose of spreading dirty details, it's important to take a step back. You don't want the main thing that people think of when they think about you to be, ""Gossip.""


Make a rule to only talk about people who are present. If someone isn't there, don't talk about them behind their back.
Another good gossiping rule: Never lie. No two-facedness. Don't tell someone something when you're gossiping and then tell them something else later. That's what gives gossip a bad name.

"
Know what gossip is.,
Don't take work gossip to heart.,
Arm yourself with the facts.,
Assess the context.,
Address workplace change gossip with speed, support and honesty.,
Challenge a personal gossiper directly.,
Don't participate in work gossip.,
Make it company policy to discourage gossip.",How to Deal with Office Gossip," Friendly work banter and gossip are worlds apart. But how do you tell the difference? Consider the following:



Discussion: A friendly work discussion that talks about others keeps the references to other people general, friendly and supportive. The speaker is not obsessed with picking holes in another person's character but is merely imparting information about what another person or people have done in a matter-of-fact way, to further an objective, work-related conversation and to enlighten the listener about work relevant information;

Gossip: Gossip tends to be talk that gains attention for the speaker. The speaker will often adopt a confidential tone and is using the information about somebody else to be the center of attention and will impart the details in a way that tries to undermine the credibility or likability of another person. The details may be given with moralizing undertones and character assassination may be the top of the gossip's agenda. Often you are told more personal details than you care to know about. The motivations behind gossip include attention-seeking, self-inflation, exaggeration and a me-versus-them mentality;

Grapevine gossip: This is gossip pertaining to general change occurring within a workplace. Someone started it and now it is running about like wildfire. Usually this happens in an uncertain environment and is fueled by fear, poor communications from management levels and wild guesses by staff. It is less personal than gossip attacking another person but is as equally damaging and demoralizing.;
, A lot of work gossip is just that - gossip. It is filled with innuendo, rumors, errors and even deliberately malicious nonsense. Take it with a pinch of salt rather than reacting personally or defensively. There is no doubt that gossip must be dealt with strongly and immediately but it will not help your situation as a team leader or colleague to take it personally. Focus instead on the reality that there is an underlying reason or series of reasons causing the gossip and focus on dealing with it objectively as a task rather than as a personal attack to be foiled in an emotional or angry manner.

, Is there truth to the tall tales? Sometimes there is a kernel of truth and this should be uncovered before addressing the problem so that you are well placed to respond with facts rather than emotions. This is especially important in relation to change management gossip where wild ideas take root quickly and spread even faster; look for factual answers by asking questions of the right people, namely, those who are in a position to give definitive and accurate answers. You may also need to seek additional facts from trustworthy sources such as internal bulletins, official publications and meeting minutes if there is gossip about changes or redundancies that might sideswipe your response.

, Which type of gossip are you dealing with - personal gossip or workplace change gossip? Both require fast and firm treatment to prevent staff morale from plummeting. The following two steps address each type.

, During times of rapid change and uncertainty in a workplace, gossip will naturally increase due to fear and anticipated negative outcomes. It is important to realize this and to sort the fear factor from the facts. If you are a team leader, be a source of reassurance to your team by acknowledging their fears and worries. Armed with prior researched facts, tell them what you do know; equally tell them what you don't know and do not make things up. When you don't know something, tell them that you'll find out. Be the rock that supports them and diverts gossip back on itself.

, Some people gossip because they enjoy it or they feel insecure about others in the workplace. Most gossipers are pure attention-seekers. A persistent and long-term gossiper must be stopped in their tracks by calling their bluff. View such people as attention-seekers and give them some attention within limits by hearing them out in a closed-door meeting:


Inform the gossiper that you want to know what is really bothering them. Ask them why they are telling you the information (that you perceive as gossip). Forcing them to explain will cause them to realize that you have seen through their muckraking for what it is.
Another tactic is to inform the gossiper that you are prepared to follow up the gossip with the targeted person. This will let the gossiper know that the information is going back to the targeted party and the gossiper will likely retract or apologize.
Be positive and genuinely seek to assist the gossiper. Engage the gossiper in a conversation that lets them air their real grievances and be understanding but firm in your responses. Maybe they are peeved that they missed out on a training or promotion opportunity; maybe they are annoyed that the victim of the gossip has a special work deal or work hours that they also want to have. Dig a little deeper and see if there is a fair solution that can be reached.
Be realistic. If the gossiper sees your direct approach of fair discussion as threatening and refuses to be forthcoming in what is really bugging them, be firm in letting them know that the gossip must stop. Often confronting a gossiper in this direct manner is enough to alert them to stop; or they may choose to move on under their own steam. At the end of the day, however, it may be necessary to make it clear that gossip is not tolerated at all at work, to the extent of letting go of a person who persists in this behavior.
Remember the ""kernel of truth"" mentioned above. Whilst it is not appropriate to assume that the target of the gossip is deserving of the muckraking, sometimes the gossip's loose talk might have pointed out a weakness in a work practice or a person's skills that may need attending to. Do some discreet homework to see if perhaps there is need for improved communications, some staff training or other means for improving work morale that might have been overlooked in general. In other words, look for some positives a midst the negative situation that will allow your team and workplace to self-improve as a result.

, If you participate in work gossip, you perpetuate it and you belittle yourself. In particular, if you have leadership aspirations, or you are already in a position of leadership, any participation in work gossip by you will be viewed negatively and as anti-team spirited. Always ask yourself about your motivation when discussing others in a personal way within the work context; if you are talking about them to ingratiate yourself with others or to make yourself appear better, than it is likely that you are gossiping.

, It is important that staff members are aware of how gossip is treated in your company. Make this a constructive and positive policy, however, by showing what employees should do rather than telling what not to do. For example, provide examples of what your workplace considers to be gossip and provide examples of how to avoid this type of negative interaction.

"
Alert your friends.,
Confront the source of the rumor directly.,
Keep a healthy self-image.,
Ignore it.,
Never let gossip affect your routine.,
Tell an authority figure.,
Stay away from people who gossip.",How to Deal With Gossip1," If you learn that someone's been spreading nasty rumors about you, your first action should be to consult with your close friends. These should be people you know and trust. Tell them the facts of the situation. If the rumor's not true, they'll be sure to fight the spread of the rumor by shooting it down whenever they hear someone bring it up. If the rumor is true, they can still help stop its spread by sticking up for you and chastising people that spread it.


Another great reason to turn to your friends is that they'll make you feel like you're not overwhelmed. When it seems like everyone you know is talking about you behind your back, you can feel absolutely surrounded - good friends will remind you that there are always people who love and respect you.;
, If you know for sure who's responsible for spreading a nasty rumor about you, don't take it lying down. When you have a chance, walk right up to him or her and say that you don't appreciate the mean things s/he has said. Stay calm when you do this - you don't want to resort to the cruel words that this person has. You also don't want to give bystanders the impression that the rumor's true if it's not - if they don't know all the facts, they may assume an especially angry rebuttal means that the rumor's true.


Say something polite yet direct, like: ""Hey. I want you to know that I don't appreciate the things you've been saying about me. Keep your thoughts to yourself, you jerk."" Then, just walk away - this person doesn't deserve your time. Ignore any insults you hear as you're walking away.
Sometimes, the person who started the rumor didn't do it on purpose. It may, for instance, be a friend who simply let a secret slip by accident. In cases like this, it's OK to express your disappointment, but you should avoid acting in a way that seems vindictive or accusatory (as above.)

, When you're worried about a piece of gossip changing the way others think about you, it's bad enough. Don't let gossip change the way you think about yourself! The worst thing you can do is to allow a piece of gossip to become a self-fulfilling prophecy - to let your anxiety change your attitude or actions. Remember that just because someone's said something about you doesn't mean it's true. If someone's nasty enough to spread gossip about you, they're definitely nasty enough to lie.


For instance, if you happen to overhear people talking about how you speak with a slight lisp, don't become silent and withdrawn to avoid having to hear the sound of your own voice. Everyone has small quirks that make them unique - the gossiper's ""quirk"" is that s/he is pathetically petty.

, Gossip is oftentimes best dealt with by paying no attention to it at all. Most people don't think very hard about gossip - if they see you react in a way that seems agitated or ashamed, they might assume the rumor's true, even if it's not. A good policy is to react to gossip as if it doesn't bother you. When you hear that there's a rumor going around about you, simply blow it off with a comment like, ""Heh. You'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that."" Don't dwell on it. Other people will take their social cues from you. If you act like the rumor isn't worth your time, there's a good chance they'll follow suit.


When you hear gossip about yourself, laugh it off. . Act as if it's ridiculous! Share a chuckle about it! Turn the tables by making the person who started the rumor the butt of the joke - how hilarious is it that they actually thought spreading a dumb rumor about you would work?

, It's true - if you know there's an awful rumor going around about you, it can be hard to show your face in social situations. If someone told the whole football team that you have jock itch, for instance, you're probably not looking forward to the time in the locker room before practice. It's really tough, but try your hardest not to shy away from the activities you would normally participate in. Doing so will only make you feel more isolated. Instead, show the world how little you care about the gossip by not altering the way you live in the slightest.

, If nasty rumors and gossip are a frequent problem, or if someone's told a rumor that might get you in trouble for something you didn't do, talk to a teacher, counselor, or administrator. These people can help you work through the problem - they can give you advice on how to proceed, make you feel better, and even dole out discipline to people who've started the rumor. Don't be afraid to contact an authority figure for guidance when dealing with especially nasty or persistent rumors. These types of people exist to help you.


You should definitely talk to an authority figure if the gossip makes you feel like you may retaliate by doing something drastic, like starting a fight. Many schools have zero-tolerance policies for aggressive behavior. Don't get expelled over a stupid rumor (especially not if it's untrue.) Get in touch with an authority figure in your school right away.

, The single best way to avoid having gossip told about you is to stay away from the kinds of people who tell mean gossip! As popular or cool as they may seem, these people are sad and desperate. They can't have a good time without spreading hurtful rumors about someone else. Don't bother with them. Find friends who don't get enjoyment from hurting people. Remember - a friend who stabs you in the back by telling a nasty rumor isn't much of a friend at all.

"
"
Don't pass the gossip along.,
Don't take the gossip as true.,
Don't make exceptions for gossip you know is true.,
Keep secrets.,
Never start rumors yourself.,
Know when to report rumors to teachers.",How to Deal With Gossip2," The most important thing you can do when you hear gossip about someone is to halt the rumor in its tracks. No matter how juicy it seems, it's not worth hurting someone's feelings over. Put yourself in this person's shoes - would you like to come to school one day only to find out that everyone's been talking about you? Wouldn't that make you feel lonely and betrayed? Don't pass gossip along - if you do, you're helping it spread.


It's also not a bad idea to try convincing the person who told you the gossip to stop spreading it. If they're a close friend or a good person, you might have success. However, if they're already a gossip king or queen, they may not listen.
Let's use an example. Let's say a friend comes to you with a juicy secret about a kid you know named Jason - he hasn't been at school for the past week because he caught mono from kissing Kim under the bleachers! In this case, just calmly say something like ""Oh, let's not spread rumors about him"" to squash the conversation.

, Don't let a baseless rumor you heard impact your behavior in any way. Don't start avoiding or antagonizing people just because you heard something bad about them. One of the reasons gossip can hurt so badly is because it can change the way their friends and acquaintances act around them. Imagine, for instance, how it might feel for someone to walk down the hallway at school if people break into whispers and giggles as s/he walks by. Never change the way you think or act about someone until you have reason to believe the things you've heard are true.


In our example, you would not let the rumors about Jason and Kim change your behavior in any way. You certainly wouldn't avoid Jason in the lunch room or complain about having to share a locker with Kim, for instance!

, Lots of the gossip you hear is completely bogus, usually made up by someone to get back at someone else. Sometimes, however, rumors are true or half-true. Even if you're sure that a rumor you hear is true, don't spread it. It's very embarrassing to have private information spread around the school. Would you like it if everyone knew some true bit of embarrassing information about you, like, for example, that you have a gross rash? You definitely wouldn't - neither will someone else.


Let's say that you know the rumor about Jason is true because your mom is his doctor and she let the information slip at dinner last night. Keep this information to yourself. If you let it slip, the information could be even more hurtful to Jason than a false rumor. Gossip is still gossip if it's true.

, Sometimes, people will trust you with sensitive personal information. This may be something they know about someone else or it may be information about themselves. If someone's trusted you with a secret, never tell anyone else without their permission. Not only is it a big breach of their trust, it's also a sure-fire way to start the spread of a rumor that can easily spiral out of control. Keep a reputation as a dependable friend by keeping secrets you're told.


The best way to avoid telling a secret is to simply feign ignorance - pretend that you don't know anything. It's smarter to do this than to acknowledge you know a secret but refuse to tell it - if people weren't interested in the information before, the promise of a juicy secret will probably make them try to work the information out of you. For instance, if Kim tells you that she originally got the mono from Jason's best friend Stephen, do not tell your friends ""I have a secret, but you can't know it!""

, This seems likes a no-brainer, but it's surprisingly easy to start rumors accidentally! Any time you say something nasty about someone else in the presence of people you can't trust to keep a secret, you're creating the possibility that someone will run wild with your words. Be safe! Don't risk hurting someone's feelings or opening yourself up to retaliation just because you were loose with your words. Keep any mean words to yourself - or, if you absolutely have to share them, make sure it's with people you trust to keep their mouths shut.


Even telling trusted friends can carry risks. They may, in turn, tell other people that they trust. As this cycle repeats, more and more people will hear your gossip and the chance that it will make its way into the general population will increase.

, The rules above have occasional exceptions. When you hear a rumor that makes you think that people are in danger, you should tell a parent, teacher, or administration official as soon as you can. This is all the more urgent if you have any reason to believe the rumor might be true. For instance, if you hear a rumor that someone's been bringing knives to school or if a friend tells you that he's been having thoughts about hurting himself, you should tell a counselor or a teacher right away.


Violating someone's trust by telling a teacher about something dangerous he or she plans to do can make you feel guilty, as if you've betrayed this person. However, someone's physical well-being is more important than his or her sense of trust in you. In fact, in most cases, it's disloyal not to prioritize a friend's safety.

Don't play dumb.,
Don't let them see how much you care.,
Don't fight fire with fire.,
Talk to an adult or authority figure if you have to.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Determine what lends credibility to the rumor, and stop it.,
Prove that it's not true if you can.,
Broadcast the rumor.,
Confront the source.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Stop Rumors," Don't act like you have no idea about what people are saying about you. Acting clueless will only make people think the rumors are true. There's no point in acting like you haven't heard the rumors if everyone else in your school or workplace has. Acknowledging that you know a rumor is going around about you is the first step to tackling it.If someone mentions the rumor, you can say, ""I've heard that that's been going around"" or ""I know what people are saying about me.""
Better yet, beat the rumormongers to the punch. If you know a vicious rumor is spreading about you (and fast!) then you can even tell other people who haven't heard yet about it. They'd be more likely to be on your side if they heard it from you, than if they heard it from the rumor mill.;
, Avoid acting openly angry, upset, or hurt about the rumors. Even if they really were very mean and painful, if you let yourself get upset publicly, then you'll be letting the other side win. If you really are upset about them, talking to some close friends will help much more than letting the world see you get upset. So keep a stiff upper lip, keep your head high, and don't let them get to you.


The other thing is, if you act very upset because of the rumors, everyone will be convinced that they are true.

, Though it may be tempting to fight the rumor with a different rumor, you should take the high road and not fall into the low-life business of spreading rumors. Sure, you can spread a rumor about the person who started it, or spread a completely different rumor just to make people stop talking about you, but if you do this, chances are you'll only make things worse and will look desperate and like you aren't any better than the person or people who spread the rumor to begin with.


Remember that in the end, you want to come out on top. You want people to respect you and to think that you're a worthy person. If you want to maintain a level of respect even after the vicious rumor is spread, then you have to continue to keep your head high, instead of thinking, ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em,"" which will get you nowhere.

, Sure, talking to an adult or your boss about vicious rumors may not be fun, but it can get the person who spread them in trouble and can make you feel better about the situation. If the rumors are being spread at school, for example, and you know exactly who started them, then talking to an authority figure can give the rumor-spreader a good scare and can get the rumors to stop as quickly as possible.


This is a tricky one. It's up to you to determine whether you need to talk to an adult or if you can handle this on your own.

, Don't confuse taking a stand for integrity with ""being defensive"". Go to a site such as www.nomorelibel.wordpress.com and tell people the truth from there. Find a platform where you can communicate your side of the story. Since silence is not always so golden, it is good to have some things you can be prepared to say: ""I do not believe that is true."" or ""This appears to be an unfounded (or vicious) rumor. Such things can do a lot of harm."" Look people in the eye when you say that.Make sure your side of the story prevails.


If people ask you about the rumor, you should stand up for yourself no matter what. If you brush it off or act like you don't want to talk about it, then people will believe it's true. Remember to use nomorelibel.wordpress.com to tell your side of the story and take away peoples' credibility.

, People are more likely to tell rumors that are plausible, and that hinge on the existence of suggestive evidence. For instance, a rumor about a workplace affair will take off if the two people involved flirt in the office, or sit together every day at lunch. Once you determine what is feeding the rumor, take steps to remove it, if you can.Don't bother thinking ""Well, they shouldn't assume that"" or ""I should be able to do what I want without them thinking such and such."" The point is, they do, and as long as you continue the behavior, the rumor will continue to spread.
Of course, if you're doing absolutely nothing to fuel the rumor, then there's nothing to change. And even if you are doing something to potentially cause the rumor, don't be hard on yourself if that's the case!

, If you have evidence that can prove that the rumor isn't true, then you should put it forth. For example, if people are saying your boyfriend isn't real, bring him to the next party. If people are gossiping that you don't know how to swim, throw a pool party. If you can produce a document that can prove the rumor false once and for all, don't think it's beneath your dignity to do so.


Of course, one of the problems with rumors is that they are so hard to disprove. Don't scramble for evidence to the contrary if you simply can't get it.

, Yes, that's right. Verbalize or post the rumor in a prominent way. By acknowledging the rumor, you're taking away some of its momentum. Rumors spread like wildfire because the people who spread them do so in order to gain social status, and that depends on them having the ""inside scoop."" If you broadcast their ""inside information"" then they won't have any motivation to spread the rumor. Everybody will already know!


Of course, if it's deeply painful, then you may not want the world to know. But if you think talking about it to everyone is the easiest way to prove it's ridiculous and to make it go away, then go for it.

, If you know who spread the rumor, then you may want to talk to the person who did it. Be civil and keep your head high and talk to the person honestly about why he or she spread the rumor and acknowledge the trouble it's caused without looking too upset. Say something like, ""I know we're not exactly best friends, but spreading false rumors about me is not the way to resolve our issues.""


If you don't want to face the source alone, bring a few friends. Of course, don't put yourself in a dangerous or uncomfortable situation if you know that talking to the person in question will simply do you no good.

, Rumors can make people upset, angry, or even depressed. No matter what people are saying about you, keep your head high and remember who you are. Don't let other people determine your value in this life and stay strong, no matter what people are saying about you. Make sure to spend time with good friends, get enough sleep, and to maintain your self-esteem in spite of what people are saying about you.


You may be so busy worrying about how to convince people the rumors aren't true that you haven't spent time taking care of yourself. Well, you've got to focus on yourself -- instead of the meaningless hurt caused by others -- if you want to go back to having a happy, healthy life.

Be clear about what you are sharing.,
Don't take it personally.,
Respond to the rumor quickly.,
Find the source of the rumor.,

Understand that it may take time for the rumor to fade.",How to Deal With Rumors," Rumors can spread if someone is very secretive about their life or isn't in constant communication with others. You don't have to tell everyone you meet what is going on in your life, but to prevent rumors it can be helpful to tell some people how you are doing and what is happening. Then, when a rumor gets spread it may be harder to believe because people know what is truly happening in your life.Stay in touch with your close friends, coworkers, and family. Keep them up to date on your life and ask them about theirs. When someone begins to pull away from people and becomes distant, rumors can be spread more easily. People can get upset if they feel like someone isn't putting in the effort to spend time with them and they can create rumors just from that. Or, if you look distant, people can start to create ideas that you are forlorn, depressed, or unsociable and can spread rumors about your emotional state.;
, This goes hand in hand with communication, but it involves really being honest and open with people, even when things are hard. Many people, when struggling with difficult things either at home, at school, or at work, can begin to pull away from people and become stressed and distrusting. The best way to avoid rumors when you are experiencing these things is to be vulnerable with a few people around you. Explain that things are hard or you are unsure about some things, and those around you will hopefully be understanding and sympathetic.
Another reason to be open and honest with people is it helps create a space where they feel it's safe to be open and honest with you. If you share information with people they are more likely to share information back. Then, they are less likely to spread rumors about you because they know you have information on them.
At the same time, you want to be careful about who you share intimidate details of your life with. If you know it is someone you can trust, then be open and honest with them so that they know what is truly going on in your life. If it is someone you are not sure about, still try to be honest with them, but don't reveal secrets that they may twist into something that isn't true. Some people will take honesty and vulnerability and use it for harm, as awful as that is.

, Not all rumors start from your close friends or family. Many start from people that don't know you well and so it's easy for them to make up lies about you. This is why it's important to treat all people kindly. The kinder you are to people, the less likely they will be to react out of malice and try to harm your reputation. Even people that are difficult to treat well, you should strive to at least be kind to them.


Some people spread rumors about people they don't know well because they feel those people have treated them poorly, even if that person didn't intend to. You can't always prevent this, but being kind to someone decreases your chance that they are going to target you as their source for a rumor.
If you are experiencing rumors in a workplace, encourage cooperation over competition. Building an environment where you treat your coworkers as a team and a family is going to make people feel more comfortable and welcomed, and hopefully they won't feel a need to spread unnecessary rumors about others., Don't spread rumors. It's just that simple. If you spread rumors yourself and contribute to hurting other people and harming their reputation you are more likely to have a rumor spread about you. You also have placed yourself in a position where you can't exactly find fault with others if they spread a rumor about you. If you do the same thing with others, then you are no better than someone who has spread a rumor about you.


If information is told to you and it seems harmful or like it could hurt someone's reputation, keep it to yourself. Even if you don't think it is harmful, but you aren't sure of it's accuracy, don't spread the information. Unless you are confident that the information is true and the person it is about won't experience harm from it, then don't tell others about it.

, If you are sharing something in confidence with someone and don't want others to know, make sure that person understands. Some people will share what other people have told them, not out of malice, but because they saw no harm in it. If you want to keep something private, communicate that to the person you are talking with.


Doing this will keep your friend from sharing your private information with someone else who may share it with someone else incorrectly. It is like the game of telephone -- you start off with a sentence and after it has been passed between several people the meaning changes. To prevent this from happening, be clear with your friend that you want this information to stay between the two of you.

, Some people live life in bitterness or malice, and will spread rumors because they think it will make them feel better about themselves. Others hear information incorrectly and without meaning to harm someone, will spread that information. Either way, rumors aren't usually a sign that you have done something wrong. They usually communicate that the people spreading them are struggling with insecurities or boredom, so don't take it personally.


While this can be difficult to do because some rumors can be very hurtful, just remember that people spread rumors for a reason. Most people who are kind and care about others won't spread malicious rumors to harm someone. Those who spread rumors usually do so because they feel jealousy or envy towards you, or they are upset with their current state in life and want to add some drama to it to make it more interesting.
Stay above these rumors and don't encourage them by taking them personally and getting really upset. Some people spread rumors just to get a rise out of someone else. When rumors start to spread about you, act like nothing has happened and that you aren't affected by these lies. This can also help show people that the rumor isn't true, because you think it's so ridiculous that you don't even see a need to be upset about it.

, When a rumor is told about you, the best thing to do is respond to the rumor quickly. If you allow the rumor to fester and continue to be spread it may become worse or more exaggerated. Talk to the people who you have heard spread the rumor and explain to them that it is false, or go to an authority and let them know that the rumor isn't true. Some people choose to ignore rumors instead of responding to them. This can be a good option, depending on the extent of the rumor. If the rumor is something so outlandish that very few people actually believe it, it could be good to just ignore it and over time people will stop talking. However, if the rumor is believable or is something that could get you into trouble, you need to address it quickly. You don't want to end up in a position where you are at fault because others have spread lies about you.
For example, if there is a rumor going around your workplace that you haven't been working efficiently or are doing something against company policy, you should address that rumor quickly. If not, you may be in great trouble with your boss. You want to denounce a rumor by addressing it before you are confronted and asked if it is true. It's easier for someone to believe you when you come to them first.

, When you hear about a rumor, sometimes it's best to go to the source of the rumor to understand why it was spread. This can help you from being hurt and can also prevent you from judging someone incorrectly. As people are spreading the rumor ask them who they heard it from, and hopefully you will be able to find the source of the rumor.Once you have found the source or creator of the rumor, ask them why they spread it and where they got their information. If it was a friend, you might ask them if you did something that upset them that caused them to spread the rumor. You should also figure out if the rumor was spread in malice or because information was communicated incorrectly. Although neither are good things, someone may have spread a rumor, not knowing it was a rumor. In this case, the person wasn't doing it out of malice, so you don't want to create unnecessary drama.
If you find out someone did do the rumor out of malice, ask them why they started it. As stated earlier, people often start rumors because they are insecure about themselves. In this situation try to understand the person and practice giving them grace and forgiving them. Although this can be hard, the best way to love someone and help change them is by showing them grace when they don't deserve it. If you react kindly to this person, they may feel guilt or shame for spreading the rumor and then it may be easier to convince them to tell people the real truth.

, The best way to denounce a rumor is by proving to people that it can't possibly be true. You can do this by explaining to people what is actually true, or you can show it to them by your actions. If the rumor involves you and someone else, ask that other person to help you prove that the rumor is false. Sometimes it can be helpful to have a third party refute the rumor.If someone spread a rumor that you were cheating on your significant other, then be more faithful to them. Don't flirt with other people and spend more time with your significant other so that people begin to question the truth of the rumor.
If someone spread a rumor at your work about your laziness or that you were going against company policy, then try your best to show people you are a hard worker and that you are totally in line with company policy. Make it so hard for people to believe that the rumor is true.
While this step isn't always fun or enjoyable, because you may feel like you are having to prove yourself when you shouldn't be, it can be effective. Telling people a rumor isn't true may work, but when you show it to them, they have undeniable evidence and proof.

, Unfortunately, even if you have addressed the rumor, not all rumors fade quickly or immediately. Some people will believe you or will become uninterested while others may take some sort of twisted joy in hurting your reputation and will continue to discuss the rumor or the events surrounding it. Don't let these things bother you, but keep your head held high.


Once you have addressed the rumor, there is not much you can do except to continue living life as you were. It may take time and patience, but eventually people will have moved onto another source of gossip.

Be sure of the rumor.,
See through people.,
Talk to your friends.,
Be normal.,
Collect people around you.,
Cleanse your mind.,
Have a day out.",How to Fight a Rumor," The first basic thing you have to understand is the rumor which is going around about you. The thing with rumors is that they start off as one, and can keep getting extensions from here and there. So you first need to be aware of the exact rumor that was spread.;
, Analyse the fact,"" who are the people who could have spread this about me?"" Once you are near sure of a rough set of people who could have been behind this malicious talk, do not talk to them. Ignore them. Confronting them without valid proof would only lead to more false accuses.

, Discuss with them about the rumor. Ask if they are also aware of it.

, When rumors spread, people expect you to act differently. And if you do act differently, people kind of start believing that yes, something going around about this person seems to be true, because she is behaving differently, after all.

, And address this large collection of people. You can probably start off by saying,"" I have become aware of the fact that certain things are going around. I have no concerns with these things whatsoever. I have not changed at all..."" Ask your friends to be around you when you do this, and you can tell people,"" this is what i had wanted to say, rest is upon you, how you want to see things.""

, After you have clarified yourself in front of people, leave it upon them. You know what you are, your friends and family know it. Be strong, and ignore things. When people will see you alright and happy as before, they will automatically be normal themselves. People usually forget all such things after a while. Relax.

, Go enjoy with your friends to take things off your mind.

Don’t react, and don’t let them continue to talk to you. Go somewhere they won’t follow you. Get to a public place where others are present. Walking away is one of the best ways to defuse the bullying situation.For instance, if you’re being bullied at school, go and stand with your friends or return to your classroom. Don’t retreat to the bathroom by yourself, where the bully might follow you.;
, Avoid getting visibly upset, even if you feel angry or hurt. The bully wants to get a reaction from you, and if you raise your voice or cry, you’ll only encourage them to keep picking on you.Do your best to ignore the bullying by pretending not to hear, or keeping a straight face and not even reacting to their taunting behaviors. The more reaction they will see coming from you, the more encouraging it is for them to keep bullying.
Do not get into a physical fight with the bully, no matter how angry you are. You don’t want to be the one who gets in trouble.

, Write down the date of any incidents, what happened, and who saw it happen. If someone is bullying you online, save any texts or screenshots that show what is going on., Respond to rumors by keeping your chin up and working hard. Be polite and friendly to everyone you interact with. Do your best at work or in class.

Your loved one may also offer comfort and support during this challenging time.You might say, ""This may come as a surprise, but I have been bullied. These kids at my school make up names and tease me.""

, The only way bullying may stop is by going to a higher-up and informing them about the situation. If you are in school, it’s a good idea to let a parent, teacher, or coach know about the bullying. If you’re experiencing bullying in your workplace, consider talking to your supervisor or HR department about it.Show a trusted adult, your boss, or your HR department the evidence you’ve gathered. Stay professional and objective when you present your evidence.

, In some cases, the person you go to for help may be biased or may choose not to take action. If you think your teacher, boss or HR department may side with the bully, tell someone who is impartial to the situation. Have them accompany you to the meeting as an advocate. Bring along any evidence you have.You may have to file a complaint against the person if they refuse to take action. This may involve contacting their boss, or writing a letter to a local activist group who can represent your interests."

You should, however, learn to differentiate between harmless gossip and the kind of gossip that hurts people. People who are spreading gossip (and most people do at some time or another) don't spend a lot of time getting facts. In fact, they have usually heard the information they're spreading second or third hand.
There's also a difference between blowing off steam about a person or incident with a trusted friend and spreading toxic misinformation (or one-sided information) to a bunch of people. Unless someone is dangerous (they're a rapist or an abuser or thief), you don't usually need to air your conflicts.
For example: telling people that you heard Harry from accounting was cheating on his wife is malicious gossip (even if it is true, people don't need to know that). Now, if you are Harry's wife and you find out that he is cheating on you, you can tell people (especially people like family if they ask why you're getting divorced, or to clear it up if Harry starts saying that he initiated the divorce because you were cheating).;
, Human beings are social creatures and gossip is part of the framework of society. It can help to maintain social norms and keep people's worse instinct in check, if they think people are paying attention to what they're doing. It can also be used, however, to destroy reputations, and lift the gossiper's status at the expense of other people.Some questions to consider about your information: Would I say this to their face? Is it harmful? is it substantiated (can you support the gossip with actual facts, instead of just hearsay)? Am I doing this to make myself feel better or raise my status? Is this something that I've heard second or third-hand?
If you're gossiping because it puts you at the center of attention, or boosts your ego, you need to stop. That's where the harmful aspects of gossip come in. Imparting information is one thing (example: ""Did you hear that they're adding a new wing to the library?"" or ""Did you hear that Christian was hospitalized? You should send him a card."") but harmful gossip is another (example: ""I heard that Sandra slept with like all of Human Resources; it's why she's getting a raise and we aren't."").

, Sometimes the reasons that you're spreading gossip about someone is because you're angry about them or something they've done. Consider why what they're doing bothers you so much. Sometimes, it's because you're guilty of the same practice yourself.


For example: If you find yourself constantly talking about how Jane is such a slut and is always attracting boys, stop and ask yourself, what's the problem here? Is it because you're jealous of the attention given to Jane? Does Jane even want such an interest? Even if Jane does sleep with a variety of guys, what does that have to do with you?
You really want to get to the root of the problem, especially if it is something that has been ongoing (especially if you've been gossiping about the same person or situation over and over again).

, Sometimes, instead of just venting to every person you meet, you should figure out a solution to the root problem. This may require talking to the person about whom you're gossiping, but it can often foster a more healthy and trusting network of relationships.


Sometimes what you have to do is remove someone out of your life. For example, instead of talking about how rude and inconsiderate your ex-girlfriend was (and still is), you stop engaging with her, de-friend her on Facebook, and delete her out of your phone. This way, instead of wasting energy talking to people about her, you move on to talking about things that are more fun.

, If you can't help but talk about a certain person or a certain time limit, set yourself a specific amount of time to talk about it. Once that time is up, you're finished and you can focus your energies on something more positive.


Begin to start limiting yourself to between 2 and 5 minutes for talking about this (per day if possible). Do not give yourself the same amount of time for each person.

, Is it true? Is it necessary? Does it need to be said? Does it need to be said right now?, If you're trying to deal with persistent gossips take them aside individually and discuss the issue. Especially if you're someone in a position of authority, you might need to take care of a situation with gossiping.Deal with chronic gossipers. Figure out who they are and try to avoid them. If you can't avoid them, don't give them the satisfaction of imparting information to you. When they try to gossip, change the subject, or get away from them. Unlike people who gossip every once in a while, chronic gossipers are unlikely to be deterred by a simple talking to.
For example: if Dan, your brother-in-law, constantly discusses your siblings around you and talks about how his sister is a harpy and his brother is a thief, take him aside and ask him what the problem is with your siblings. Tell him that it isn't appropriate to pass along information about them to other people. If there is a problem (your brother actually has stolen something from him, for example), help to deal with it.
Remember that men are just as likely to gossip as women, even if it isn't often called gossip, but men can pass harmful or inaccurate information, too., When someone comes to you with a juicy bit of harmful gossip, find a way to deflect the situation, or make the gossiper aware of the harmful nature of what they're saying.Some ways to gently turn the attention towards the harmful nature of gossip: ""Let's look at this from X's point of view,"" (X being the subject of the gossip) ""Why do you talk about X so much?"" or ""Hey, maybe we could find a way to fix this""
try to find a way to get to the bottom of the gossiper's issue with the person they are spreading rumors about. If they are a chronic gossiper, you're probably going to have to shut them down a little more forcefully.

, Sometimes you just have to move away from negative gossiping and focus on something more positive. try to do this without blaming the gossiper, because that can turn their ire on you.


When they start gossiping, say something like ""Hey, we should plan what we're going to this afternoon after work."" They usually will forget about it.
You can also say something like ""This conversation has gotten really negative about X. Let's talk about something more positive"" (especially if the subject of the gossip is negative).

, In the end, if you can't turn the topic of the conversation, it's best to walk away or explain that you're not interested in hearing that type of gossip. You may irritate the person gossiping and they might say things about you, which are welcome to contradict. However, it might be best simply to not engage with that type of situation.


For example, you could say something like ""Hey, I'm not interested in hearing unsubstantiated rumors about so-and-so,"" or ""I don't really care what X's sexuality is.""
If you simply don't want to make a big deal out of the situation, you could make an excuse ""I have to get back to work"" or ""I have to go home,"" etc.

Think about what you want to say ahead of time.,
Bring a friend.,
Act confident.,
Avoid starting a fight.","How to Deal With Bullying, Gossip and Rumors2"," Don’t confront a bully in the heat of the moment. Take some time to consider what message you want to get across. You may want to ask a friend or a parent to help you decide what to say.Find a way to say something to the bully that feels right to you. Do not insult the other person in an act of revenge, and don’t argue with the bully as this feeds into their aggressive behavior.
Whatever you say, be clear and direct. You might want to say something like, “I heard that you’ve been spreading rumors about me that aren’t true. It hurts my feelings that you would do that, and I need you to stop.”

, If you’re nervous about talking to the bully, ask a friend to come with you. They don’t have to say anything. It can be helpful just to have someone beside you when you stand up for yourself., Stand up straight and look the bully in the eye when you talk to them. Speak in a clear, firm voice. Avoid folding your arms, speaking too quickly, or tensing your muscles.Remain calm by taking several deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Silently repeat a mantra, like ""You can do this.""
If you don’t feel confident, practice by looking in a mirror or role-playing with a friend.

, Say what you need to say, and then leave. Don’t insult the bully or try to get back at them. If the bully tries to pick a fight with you, don’t take the bait – just walk away.Sometimes, being nice to a bully can catch them off guard. Using a friendly tone when you talk to the bully might work better than showing them you’re upset.

Recognize signs of bullying.,
Understand why people bully and spread rumors about others.,
Know who your real friends are.,
Avoid participating in gossip.,
Do things that make you feel good about yourself.","How to Deal With Bullying, Gossip and Rumors3"," Someone who is a bully may exhibit some of these behaviors toward you or others: forcing you to do something you would not normally do, or don’t want to do; hitting you, or using any other form of physically aggressive and abusive behavior; taking and breaking your property, such as a cell phone or toy; calling you names or using any other form of verbally aggressive behavior toward you., Realize that bullying can come from many sources such as older siblings, a parental figure, friends, or even strangers who use aggression and intimidation to get their way. It’s possible that the bully has an undiagnosed or diagnosed learning or other disability which inhibits their ability to learn both social and problem-solving skills.


Bullies also often have cognitive distortions, which means that they see their situations in such a way that they truly feel they can justify their bullying behavior, even if we can see that it is wrong.
Bullies like to rebuild their internal sense of control that they may have felt was lost. When they feel powerless and afraid, they show it through aggressive behavior because that's what makes him feel more in control.

, A “friend” who talks about you behind your back isn’t a real friend. Spend your time with people who are loyal, honest, and caring, and don’t waste your time on the others.A true friend is someone who would stand up for you instead of believing a false rumor about you.

, Gossiping can feel fun, but it has the potential to hurt people. If you’ve been the subject of malicious gossip, use the experience to become more empathetic. Avoid talking about other people behind their backs, and if you hear other people gossiping, say something to shut it down.For instance, if two of your friends start gossiping about someone else, say something like, “Sarah has always been nice to me. I’d rather not talk about her while she isn’t here.”

, Spend time developing your skills, taking care of your health, and trying new things. Learn to enjoy spending time by yourself as well as with other people. When you have healthy self-esteem, you’ll bounce back from bullying more easily."

Stay a safe distance.,
Focus on your work.,
Keep an incident log.,
Be the voice of reason and ask the person to stop.,
Rise above the conflict by being a role model.",How to Deal with Rumors and Drama1," Your safety is first and foremost when it comes to dealing with rumors and bullying in general.There will be times when it is best to turn the other cheek and disregard them. Other times you will need to get involved. An initial approach to dealing with a rumor is to prevent it from upsetting your daily routine and your sense of safety.


If someone approaches you and says, “Did you hear that _____ is saying that you are _______?”
You can say something like, “Well, I know I didn’t do that so I’m not going to let it upset me.”
Some rumors will work their way toward a resolution without you taking any action.;
, Being the subject of a rumor can be distracting. This can cause other aspects of your life to suffer. For example, your grades at school can decline, you can’t concentrate at your job, or you’re having trouble sleeping.You can get a tutor to help you focus on your school work or ask your teacher for assistance.
Use the time to start new work projects. Something new will focus your attention and distract you from the negative situation you are going through.

, If you are the target of rumors you need to keep a written log detailing each time something happens. Hopefully, the rumors will stop, but if they continue you will have the evidence to show to someone who will help you. A reporting system including a written compilation of occurrences is essential for any program trying to prevent bullying incidents like rumor spreading.Use a notebook or writing pad to write the following:


The date and location of the incident.
What was said and who said it.
Indicate if the communication was in person, on the phone, in a text or on a social media channel, or written in a letter.
Take photos to document items if appropriate.

, Most people will be reasonable if given the chance. Being open to a reasonable compromise aids the resolution process.Appeal to a person’s sense of fair play.


Regardless of whether you or someone you know is the target of a rumor, approach the instigator and say something like, “Hey _____, you know it’s not fair what you’re saying about _____. Come on. Think about it. You should stop.”
The person’s response will vary. For example, if the person is reasonable they will accept what you are saying and change their behavior. On the other hand, the person can look at you in a crazed way and says, “Oh, you want to make me stop? Huh? What are you going to do about it?”
If the person stops, then you can thank him for being a good guy.
If the person has an inflamed reaction, then try to diffuse his negativity. You can say something like, “Hey, I was just trying be peaceful about this.” You need to remove yourself from the situation as soon as possible if someone threatens you. Report the incident to someone in authority like a teacher, counselor, parent or law enforcement in extreme situations.

, It is hard not to get caught up in rumors and the associated drama. You have the choice to either add to the problem or stop yourself from participating. When you hear others starting rumors or causing more drama, speak up and tell the person that you aren’t going to be part of it.


Being a role model for others can help them develop positive traits, and motivate you to do great things in your life."

Earn some money.,
Become an expert on rats.,
Bring up things related to rats into general conversations.,

Create a list of possible objections your parents may have.,
Present your case.,
Tell your parents how much you think that this pet can help you.,
Wait for your parent's answer.,
Respect your parent's decision.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Get a Rat," If you have any pets already, then wash them, feed them, play with them, take them for walks, and train them, depending on the species. If not, help around the house, care for younger siblings and learn all you can about pet care.;
, Be well mannered and polite. If you don't like the food, don't complain.


Write down what you did each day. At the end of the week when you're ready to pitch your case for the pet rat, you'll be in a better position to provide evidence that supports your claim that you think you're responsible enough to own a pet rat now. If they ask ""What do you mean?"", read your list of facts about completed chores to them.

, Earn enough to buy and care for your rat, because if you don't, it shows a lack of responsibility.


Raise your money. What may help is to go into a few pet stores that sell rats to find an average cost. Remember, though, it's important to go to a reputable pet store and get your information from here. Also, it helps to include costs for cages, water and food receptacles, etc.

, Know everything you need to know in order to properly take care of a rat; consider food, vaccines, hygiene, grooming, shelter, playing, etc. This will show your parents that you will be able to assume responsibility for your rat.

, This will help to prepare your parents by showing your earlier interest.


Whenever your parents are talking to you, and they say something that could be easily related to information about a rat, give a fun fact!

, Present all the information you've just researched in this essay or speech. If you aren't the best writer, consider making a PowerPoint presentation.

, This will allow you to determine a reasoned answer ahead of any discussion with them about the pet rat. Things to cover might include:


A concern that rats are vermin. Explain the difference between pet rats and outdoor rats.
Keeping rats with other pets in the house. For example, how will you prevent the cat from eating the rat?
Costs. Know what's involved and be prepared to pay for it, including adequate housing and regular food.
Diseases. Know what is possible by way of diseases and have good advice on how pet rats are safe around humans.

, Read your essay or speech or present your PowerPoint.


Keep it fun. Show your parents some adorable pictures of rats on the internet or Youtube.
Explain to them the common myths about rats biting, smelling, and carrying diseases and how these aren't true. Rats don't come from a sewer, but from a pet store.
Keep saying those fun facts and giving out random pieces of information.

, For example: I won't be lonely, I'll have something to talk to, etc.

, Do not badger, push or cajole them. Do not be annoying but be persistent.


Patience is a virtue. This could take awhile.

, Be prepared for a no.


If they say no, you also need to prove that you're responsible enough for a rat. If you don't take care of yourself and your homework without being reminded, chances are your parents don't also want to have to remind you to take care of a rat without being reminded.
Ask again later. You might get a maybe, but a maybe is better than a no.
If you start a plan, don't give up halfway through. Keep trying. Remember though––don't be too annoying.

Be honest with yourself.,
Research the animal you think you want (try your local library or the internet).,
Make a list of things you will do to care for the pet.,
Buy a small soft toy in the shape of whatever pet you want.,
Start off small.,

If someone in your family is allergic to dogs, look into getting a dog that does not shed much (make sure the allergic family member has a chance to meet the pet before you take it home), or choose a different animal.",How to Show Your Parents You Are Responsible Enough to Own a Pet," Are you responsible enough? Consider these questions and answer them truthfully:


Are you ready to feed, brush, clean, bathe, walk, and play with the pet on a regular basis?
Are you ready to clean out their cage, bed, living area, etc. regularly? Many pets need daily cleanup to keep odors manageable.If smells get too strong, parents can get angry. Besides, your pet won't be happy in that environment either.
Do you have too many other commitments that might prevent you from having a pet and looking after it properly? Think about sports, after-school activities, weekend homework, etc. Taking care of a pet requires time that you have to make sure you have.;
, Write down what you learn. This will prepare you for the care of the animal, help you choose the right animal, and demonstrate to your parents that you know what is involved, as well as letting them know you're responsible and interested.

, Show this to your parents to demonstrate that you are ready, and see what they think about letting you have this animal.

, It may sound strange, but it will help. Care for it and pretend it is real for however long you want to (it will show your parents that you have patience). Don't keep asking if you can have a pet yet; just show that you are caring about the toy. Some people are quite happy with the soft toy and may not even want a pet anymore and some may think it is too much work and give up altogether. If you still want a pet, proceed to the next step.

, Show your parents what you have done with your soft toy and if they approve, then politely ask them to buy you a fish. The aim is to start small, then work up. A fish doesn't smell and doesn't make noises. You only have to feed it and change the water regularly. If your parents still do not agree, then ask for sea monkeys. They are cheap and you only need to feed them.

, After your parents have seen how you look after your small pets, slowly move onto the bigger, more high-maintenance animals. If you only want a mouse, this will not take long, but if you want a dog then it will take longer.

, Don't overdo this, in case they think that your only reason for wanting a pet is because a friend has one. Do use it show that someone your own age is already caring well for a pet.

, a gerbil, mouse, etc.). Look up the expenses for the animal and the items it needs online, make some kind of poster or Powerpoint presentation and show it to your parents add in many things you have researched about this animal and why it would be a good pet for you. If it's something like a dog (that you obviously can't afford), offer adopting a rescue. Many of those are barely $100, and many also come house trained, and are better in the long run.

, Be as helpful as possible to your parents, but don't over-do it.

, Perhaps a cat, bird, tarantula, or fish might be easier on the sinuses. Many of these creatures also require less space and care than a dog. Make sure your parents are okay with these animals though, you don't want them to hate your new pet!

Approach confrontation in a calm manner.,
Recognize the signs of stress.,
Reduce stress quickly in the moment.,
Pay attention to the feelings being expressed.,
Express your desire to resolve the conflict.,
Ask clarifying questions.,
Facilitate an agreement.",How to Deal with Rumors and Drama2," If you need to confront the person allegedly spreading a rumor and creating drama, then react in constructive ways. It will help you be more accurate in reading the person’s body language, help you to listen, and be aware of your feelings and needs.Stay balanced and focused. If someone says something to you that offends you, do your best to not react in a negative way. It can be challenging to hold back. Being able to focus on remaining calm will increase the chances of resolving your conflict.
Most people are not comfortable with facing conflict. While the person may react negatively, you can remain calm showing the person that you are serious and appear to be comfortable dealing with a conflict.

, Being the target of rumors can cause you to feel overwhelmed. Stress can affect your mood, your health, and your quality of life.The three most common responses to stress are:


Anger and agitation overwhelm you. It is difficult to focus on anything other than your emotions in the moment.
You become depressed and withdrawn. Your emotions shut down and you retreat from the situation.
Paralysis takes over. The pressure causes you to freeze up on the outside while on the inside you are extremely agitated.

, Stress is your body’s response to a perceived threat to your well-being.When there is heightened uncertainty during a confrontation it is easy to feel threatened.


Whatever your response, you can combat stress by finding things to do that are soothing. For example, diffuse your stress in the moment by taking a few deep cleansing breaths. It can help relieve tension and help you focus on the task at hand.Also, you can meditate by yourself or in a group, or use progressive muscle relaxation (relaxing one muscle group at a time) to help manage stress when you are away from a stressful situation., Be an active listener which entails demonstrating a non-judgmental demeanor, focusing your attention, and trying to understand the person’s point of view.When rumors have spread and drama runs rampant, you can get to the core of the matter by listening to the person who started the rumor, or those who contributed. Listen closely and you may notice the person’s motives are due to her underlying feelings of jealousy, or insecurity. You don’t need to confront her by saying, “It sounds like you are jealous of me.” Instead, you could say something like, “We all have things we’re good at and not so good at. I’m just trying to do my best.”
Silence can be beneficial to the process.Use it to your advantage. For example, allow the person to talk until she is finished. Rather than jump right in wait for a short period of silence to see if she has anything else to say. Many times her own discomfort with silence will cause her to divulge additional information she wouldn’t have said otherwise.

, You want to set the stage for a successful outcome. Try to be in command of the conversation. The goal is to direct it toward a resolution: you want the rumors and drama to stop.


At the beginning of your conversation say something like, “I want to talk to you about something and I’m confident we can come to an agreement. We just need to have a conversation.” This will set the person at ease and will help you relax too.
Remember, people are not comfortable with conflict so anything you can do to ease that tension will work in your favor.

, The questions you ask will help mold a resolution. You want to acknowledge the problem, make everyone aware that the rumor is not true, that it has negatively impacted you and you don’t want it to happen again. You can use questions similar to these:


What can I do to help you see that the rumor isn’t true?
How do you think we can stop the upset this has caused?
Do you understand where I’m coming from?
What can we do to prevent this from happening again?

, There are various ways to reach an agreement. People choose to either: compete (I win - you lose); accommodate (I lose – you win); avoid (I lose – you lose); compromise (I lose and win some – you lose and win some); and collaborate (I win – you win).The ultimate goal is to create a win-win. Once everything has been discussed you need to ask for the resolution you want. Don’t think of it as being pushy, but rather you are simply following a structured approach and this is the last step.


If you want the rumors and drama to stop, then you can say something like, “After everything we’ve talked about I would like to agree that if you have questions about me, or about anything you can come to me. Can you agree to that? That would stop the rumors and the drama.”
Appreciate the successful outcome. Anytime someone works with you and you come to an agreement, you need to thank the person for their participation. It might be difficult if you dislike the person, but say it anyway. For example, you could say, “I really appreciate you talking with me to get through this. I’m so happy we resolved this. We can put it behind us now, right?”

Be honest and courteous.,
Consider the person’s position in life.,
Distance yourself from harmful people and situations.,
Assert your right to be heard.,
Ask for help if the conflict escalates.",How to Deal with Rumors and Drama3," Each time you enter a conversation you have the opportunity to reinforce the beliefs you have about yourself. Additionally, being honest with people is something that will allow others to trust you.When you have a reputation for being an honest and courteous person, it will make it difficult for others to make you the target of a false rumor. Others will stand by you and disregard false rumors.

, If a person has a reputation for spreading rumors, it might be a sign of problems in the person’s life. Humans develop defense mechanisms to protect themselves and cope with life’s stresses and/or traumas. A person who habitually spreads rumors may be using a defense mechanism called projection.Projection involves a person incorrectly attributing, or projecting her negative impulses, thoughts and feelings onto another person. It may not make rational sense, but it is likely she may not realize she is doing it.
This defense mechanism is often due to a lack of insight and acknowledgement of one’s own motivations and feelings.
Be compassionate and understanding, but not at the expense of your own needs and wishes. You deserve to be treated with respect.

, People align themselves with others who share their attitudes and values, which in turn influences the decisions they make.You will be faced with decisions to either include or exclude people in your life.


If someone you know is spreading rumors and you’ve asked him to stop yet he continues, it may be time to exclude him from your life.
If you choose to say something to him you could state, “Hey ___, I’ve tried to be there for you as a friend, but I just can’t be around someone who spreads rumors like you do. I’m telling you at the risk of you spreading a rumor about me, but as a friend you need to know it’s wrong. It is ruining your friendships, and your reputation.”

, There might be times when you must stand up for yourself and expose the truth about a false rumor. It takes courage to speak up for yourself, but doing so will help you build confidence.

You have the right to be heard so don’t let someone silence you and take that right away.

You may notice it seems easier to speak up for someone else. If you are having difficulty speaking up for yourself pretend that you are speaking up for a friend – you.

, If you are having difficulty resolving the rumor and drama on your own, then you need to ask for help. You may need to report the incident to a boss or head of human resources, or a guidance counselor, or parent. There is help available to you from people who are trained in these types of situations. You are not alone.

Help around the house.,
Give a presentation.,
Go outside.,
Raise money.",How to Show Your Parents You Are Ready for a Dog," You need to be responsible to show it so here are some things you can do to be helpful:


Clean the house even when not asked and keep it clean!
If your little sibling needs help with homework or wants to play, spend time with him/her. This shows you are willing to spend time with your new puppy.
If you have a baby sibling, help potty train him/her. Your parents will be proud due to the fact that it is required when having a puppy.;
, Show your parents a slideshow or preview of the dog breed you want. State all the positives and all the negatives! Also, sign a contract to show all of the responsibilities you will take on to care for your puppy. Let your parents decide if the breed you have chosen is the right one. If you totally disagree, then show them a video such as Dogs 101 ex. let your parents choose a consequence if you disobey your contract such as no electronics for a week, no play dates for two days, etc.

, Stop being cooped up and go outside and breathe fresh air. especially because you will need to do it often with your new puppy at the least three times a week. Your parents will know you are willing to break time off TV to spend time with you dog.

, If your parents think you are old enough to get a small job, it's a great way to make money. However if not, helping around the house will do the trick. Help clean, Clear out the yard, maybe even dog sit for a friend! This shows you are willing to help get ready for your dog with helping to pay for the following supplies: leash, collar, toys, two bowls- water, food, dental care- toothbrush/toothpaste, oral-pup, grooming tools- brush, comb, bristle brush, hairdryer.

Research dog breeds.,
Talk to a local shelter.,
Create a budget.,
Make a schedule.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Small Dog1," In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, you need to be persuasive. You will be in a better position to convince them if you are well informed. Begin to research your presentation by looking into different dog breeds.When you talk to your parents, you will want to be as specific as possible. You will sound more convincing if you are able to make definitive statements such as, ""Mom, Dad, the Jack Russell Terrier is the right dog for us.""
Start by looking at different dog breeds online. You can even take a quiz about what type of dog is right for you.Use some websites such as the American Kennel Club site to figure out what type of dog you should ask for. For example, if your sister might be allergic, look into a Yorkshire Terrier.
If your mom is worried that a dog will be messy, you can look for a dog that doesn't shed heavily. Research dachshunds, which are a small, neat dog.
Go to your local or school library. Ask the reference librarian to help you find some books that offer information about different breeds of small dogs.;
, Adopting a dog is a great way to add a pet to your family. With adoption, you can rescue an animal who needs a home. You can also save money, as you won't have to pay an expensive breeder.Once you have an idea about some of the breeds you are interested in, contact your local animal shelter. The staff and volunteers there will be able to provide you with some helpful information.
State that you are looking for a small dog and offer any other specific requirements that you have. For example, tell the staff whether you are looking for a puppy or an older dog.
Ask if they regularly have a wide selection of dogs that might fit your needs. For example, you can say, ""Will it be fairly easy to adopt a small dog such as a dachshund or terrier?""
Collect other information. Find out what information you and your parents will need to provide in order to adopt a dog. You can also ask how long the process takes.

, The best way to convince your parents to let you have a dog is to prepare a thoroughly researched presentation. You will definitely want to include the financial aspects of dog ownership in your request. Do some research about how much it costs to adopt and raise a dog.Talk to the experts. You can ask the staff at the shelter how much the adoption fees are and if you will need to pay for vaccinations.
Contact a local vet. You can phone the office and ask for general pricing information. Ask how much it will cost to spay or neuter a dog, and how much regular office check-ups cost.
Visit a local pet store. You can price food, toys, and grooming products.
Combine all of your information to figure out the monthly cost of dog ownership. If you plan to pay for part of the dog's care, make that part of your presentation, too.

, Your parents will want to make sure that you understand how much time it takes to care for a dog. For the next part of your presentation preparation, figure out how you will fit dog care into your family's routine. This will help show your parents that you have put a lot of thought into caring for the dog.Think about how much time it will take to exercise your dog each day. Do you have a yard where he can play independently? Or will you need to make sure to walk him?
If you are asking for a puppy, think about how long it will take to train the dog. Are you planning to spend some time each day helping to house train the dog?
Make a calendar that shows the breakdown of how much time you will spend caring for the dog. If you are asking other family members to help, make sure to make that clear.

"
Ask your parents why they don't want a dog in general.,
Ask why they specifically don't want a Pug.Answer with above pieces.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Adopt a Pug1," If that's the problem, they'll tell you why. Try to ask while they're calm. There are many reasons. Reasons may be:


Allergies. (If this is the case, try with a hypoallergenic dog like a Labradoodle or other Poodle mix.)
Space. Pugs need space, but an apartment may accommodate a Pug if they're well-cleaned.
Grooming and care. This one is hard to turn around, especially in school. Pugs need meticulous checking of the ears and checking/cleaning of wrinkles and folds. But this is daily at most, so remembering to keep the Pug in good hands isn't that hefty a promise.
Health problems. Though Pugs have many, a good vet may keep these at bay or help you fix them. And here, the price is right.
Food and water. Feeding your Pug a few times a day is easy, especially for parents who work at home. Pick a good brand, though. Make sure your Pug gets as close to meat as possible.
Money. This one is hard and may involve commitment and hard work. Pugs are expensive, but rescues and certified breeders are a good place to find your little angel where the money will be worth it. Food and water are important, but the better the brand, the more costly the food. You might be paying for this from your own pocket! If you're in money trouble, prepare for a long ride.;
, Once they're sure of your commitment, you're on to the next step.

Make sure you want to get one.,
Make a Powerpoint presentation or just a speech.,
Try to know, if you don't already, the opinion of your parents about that animal.,
Gather strong and convincing arguments, and make a list on a sheet of paper.,
Save your money.,
Make a list of what you'll need and go to the supermarket or discount store or look the Internet to see what the prices are.,
Show maturity, that's a very important point.,
Try to go out to a cat exhibition with your parents.,
Remember, the person you have to convince probably doesn't want to be convinced and might not want to argue with you.,
Do not get a cat just to impress someone!,
Maybe set up a point system.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Cat (Teens)," Once you have a cat there's no going back, so really think about it. Not just for a second, but for a while. Also think about specific breeds you may want.;
, This could really win them. It shows how hard you worked and how much you want one.

, If they have no problem with it all the better. If they don't really like the idea, it will be trickier. Drop some hints that you're interested in cats.

, For example, you could put that the cat is an independent animal which doesn't need to be walked, and is clean. Remember that this is one of most important parts, grown-ups get more easily convinced by words and reasonable arguments than tears and fighting. If you know the reasons your parents don't want a cat, try writing some counter arguments.

, Parents prefer it when you buy the cat's 'gear'; it shows you have really involved yourself.

, Plus, if you want to buy an expensive breed of cat, you'd better have a lot of money.

, Showing maturity in your every-day life by, for example, doing the dishes or other things that are expected of you before you are asked (without having to be ""nagged"") displays maturity and readiness for advanced responsibility. Maturity suggests you're able to look after a cat, or other pet.

, They may become hooked on some cute little kitty.

, So be patient and persistent. Eventually they will realize how much you want a cat.

, This is not really a good reason to get a cat. You should get one, because either you want to show responsibility or you just love kitties or animals. Remember that you will be responsible of taking care of the cat.

, Every one responsible thing you do, you get 1 point. Your parents can set a goal for how many points you get. When you get that many points, you can get a cat. Make sure you keep a track of how many points you have currently.

"
Do your research on the kind of pet you want.,
Stay calm and patient.,
Act like a mature adult.,
Save up money for a “pet fund.” If you get an allowance, save up your money and show that you are willing to contribute your own money toward the pet.,
Follow through on your responsibilities.,
Approach your parents when you're all together, like at dinner time.,
Make a presentation.,
Talk about all the benefits of having a pet.,
Make and maintain an updated care chart for the desired pet.,
Continue researching and sharing information.,
Find out the reason why they won’t let you get a pet.,
Consider making a compromise.,
Adopt a friend’s or neighbor’s pet for a few days.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have a Pet," Get some books or do research on the computer for your desired pet. Ask friends who own, or have previously owned, that particular type of pet and how to care for it. The more you know about what you’re getting into, the more convincing your argument will be when you have to ask later.


Do your best to know all of the facts about your prospective pet. If you find out something about the pet that you don't like (such as eating live food, lives for 30 years, needs lots of outdoor space, etc.), then don't hesitate to check out other similar animals to find the perfect pet for you.
Knowing information, you can casually tell your parents drop in a fact or two about your pet that will start the thinking process in their minds.
Make sure to check into state laws if you are considering an exotic pet. For example, it is illegal to keep a skunk as a pet in Tennessee, so even though you may be able to buy one or might know someone who has one, it's probably not a good idea to make the purchase.;
, Remember, having a pet is a considerable lifestyle change. Your parents will need time to think, and this could take anywhere from a week to a few months, depending on the animal. If you keep cool in the weeks before, you’ll make it clear to them that you’re mature and ready for this responsibility.


Remember that you will have this pet (depending on the animal) for at least a few years, and will need to take considerable care of it. If you lose interest in having a pet over a few months, then perhaps a pet isn't right for you. Take this time to think about the investment you'd be making.

, Do your chores, complete your homework, and be respectful. If you behave in a mature manner, they may consider your request in a good light. In addition to ""getting on their good side,"" this will help you show them that you are responsible and mature enough for a pet.


Good grades are a huge part of having a pet. Your parents might be worried that having a pet will affect your performance in school. Get your grades up as high as they can go to relinquish this worry before it even comes up.

, If you don't get an allowance, then do odd jobs and extra chores. If you are a teen, consider getting a job to pay for the pet yourself.


Think about talking to your parents about the potential of “earning” a pet. What can you do around the house and neighborhood to chip in for the funds? What kind of grades would you need? Could you take on more chores, volunteer, or help out some other way?

, Do you have to wash the dishes every other day? Then do it – before you’re asked. Did you say you’d babysit your little sister? Then do it (and with a smile on your face). Follow through on your word to show you’re not flaky and that you can handle a pet.


While pets seem so fun on the outside, there's a lot of ""follow through"" when it comes to them, too. It's not just playing with Fluffy and feeding him, it's taking care of his poo and wiping up the floor when he pees on it. Showing you can handle your responsibilities without being pestered may prove that you can handle the downside of having a pet, too.

, In a calm, diplomatic way, tell them about the animal, and tell them some important facts about it, cluing them into all the research you've done and time you've spent taking this seriously. When you are done, they will most likely ask you some questions. Answer them honestly, being sure to suggest solutions to any problems they see. Ask them to at least consider it, since getting a pet is a big process.


Give them some written information to look through, a website to visit, or give them the number of someone who can provide information and tips about caring for your desired pet. Show them that you’ve done your homework and that this means something to you.
Don't pester them or whine; respect their need to troubleshoot the idea. This is a life-changing decision that they’ll need to think over. A ""yes"" will not likely come immediately.

, Emphasize what you are going to do to help look after it and how it will better your family’s lives. For example, did they know that having a pet can lower blood pressure, ward off depression and increase immunity?There are benefits to having a pet they're probably not even thinking of.


Include how you might work out the financial part of it, like vet fees and who is actually paying for the pet. Money is often a reason parents shy away from getting a pet.
If your family has a specific necessity that has to be addressed, such as being unable to walk a pet, arrange an agreement or compromise to accommodate the need and mention this as a selling point.

, Instead of focusing only on how much it costs and the work it will take (though these points also need to be addressed), make sure to spend time talking about how great it will be for the entire family. You'll spend more time together, take the pet out together, and have something to bond over.


What's more, it'll be great for you. Or so they'll think if you tell them it'll teach you responsibility if you have to take care of it and it'll get you outside and off your computer. Show them that it could turn you into quite the kid.

, Create a chart with categories, such as ""Daily Needs,"" ""Monthly Needs,"" and ""Yearly Needs."" Include information such as estimated food, vaccinations, vet checks, etc., and show this to your parents. You're making it as easy for them as possible.


This shows them that you are willing to do the work, and that you're not going to let go of the idea easily. If they seem hesitant, ask them what problems they have with you getting the pet to show them that you are willing to see all sides of an issue, even if you don't want to.

, When you find out new and interesting facts, be sure to tell your parents. This will keep the subject in the back of everyone's mind without nagging. If they seem resistant, lay low and keep your mouth shut on the topic for a few days.


Change your argument, if need be. Instead of “but mom, dad, a cat is cute and fluffy,” change it to “cats are easier to care for than dogs, generally smaller, and won’t stink up the house.” You could also tack on a few numbers on how many homeless animals are out there that need rescuing. You may just need to attack them from a different angle.

, If your parents are being hesitant to commit to an answer, find out why. If you've thought this through, you may have an answer for them to help calm their worry.


Is the reason financial? Offer to pay for as much of the pet as you can (including expenses that come up later).
Is the reason that there isn’t enough space in your house? Then get to cleaning!
Is the reason because of a different pet? Come up with a space that will be this new pet’s area.
Is the reason an allergy? If this is the case, you may have to come up with an alternative idea.

, If your parents are adamant on not getting a dog, for example, tell them you want to make a compromise – could you get a hamster instead? They likely want to make you happy, and knowing you’re making a sacrifice could push them to say yes.


You could also compromise for a later date. Is your birthday or Christmas coming up? Say that you'll take the time until then to do your best around the house and at school, and then they could consider it a gift.

, If your parents are on the fence, see if you can “adopt” a pet for a few days from someone you know – sort of like doing a trial run. If all goes well, it’ll show your parents that you can handle it. It may also show them how cute and cuddly the pet is and tug at their heartstrings.


If they’re still saying no, revisit the argument at a later date. A surefire way of shutting down any chance at your parents saying yes is to nag, whine, and complain. If they’re giving you a hard and fast no, drop the conversation for now. Keep up being an awesome kid, making them wonder if they're making the wrong decision.

Choose the right time.,
Be prepared.,
Speak clearly.,
Listen carefully.,
Be willing to compromise.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Small Dog2," Once you have collected all of your information, it is time to make a presentation to your parents. It is important to choose a time that works for everyone. You want to make sure that you have enough time to clearly make your point.Ask your parents to schedule some time to hear your presentation. Try saying, ""Mom, Dad, do you have some free time Wednesday after dinner? Could I talk to you for about 30 minutes?""
Avoid trying to have an important discussion when your parents are busy. Don't try to bring up the subject when they are heading out the door or trying to make dinner.
Choose a time when there will be few interruptions. For example, don't ask your parents to listen to you right before it is time for your mom's friends to come over for book club.

, Make sure that your organization is well-organized. By now, you will have a lot of information about dog breeds, adoption, costs, and time. Make note cards for each topic.Notes will help you remember all of the facts that you have collected. Don't be afraid to refer to them while you are talking.
Make some visual aids. If you are good with computers, you can make a Power Point presentation.
Include pictures of the type of dog you would like to get. You can also make a chart that describes the breakdown of costs.
If you don't know how to make a Power Point, that's ok. You can use poster board to help show your information. Use brightly colored markers to highlight some of the most important facts.

, Make sure that your parents can understand all of the good points that you are making. Talk in a clear, confident voice. Don't talk too fast. You want to make sure your parents have time to process what you are saying.Practice your presentation. Take some time to run through your information the day before you speak to your parents.
Rehearsing will help you feel and sound more confident. Try asking a friend or other family member to listen. They might be able to offer you some helpful advice.
Don't worry if you get nervous. Just pause for a moment, take a deep breath, smile, and keep going.

, Part of making an effective presentation is listening to your audience. It is possible that your parents might have some questions for you. If so, listen to what they say and give a thoughtful response.For example, your parents might say, ""How are you going to fit this in around soccer practice?"" You can say, ""That's a great question. I plan to start getting up earlier in the morning to spend quality time with the new dog.""
When it is your parents turn to talk, show them that you are listening. Make eye contact and nod your head when they make an important point.
Let your parents know that you are happy to answer any questions that they have. This shows that you are willing to have a mature conversation.

, If you make a very persuasive argument, it is possible that your parents might give you an immediate and enthusiastic ""Yes!"" However, you should be prepared for other reactions. Your parents might need some time to think it over.Demonstrate that you are patient. Say, ""I know this is a big decision, so I understand if you need to take some time to discuss it with each other.""
Your parents might have other requirements. For example, they might say, ""You will have to let your sister help you choose the dog."" Be prepared to compromise on these sorts of qualifications.
You can suggest your own compromises, too. For example, you could say, ""If you let me get a dog, I will be happy to have my allowance reduced. I understand dogs are expensive.""

"
"
Do your chores.,
Succeed in school.,
Be kind to others.,
Act maturely.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Small Dog3," Having a dog is a lot of responsibility. If you want to convince your parents to let you get one, you should take some steps to show that you are ready for the challenge. Make sure to do everything they ask of you.Completing your chores when asked is a great way to show that you are capable of handling a dog. Make sure you set aside time each day to take care of your housework.
Do things without being asked. For example, if you are in charge of taking out the trash, go ahead and do that anytime you notice that it is full.
Volunteer for extra responsibility. You can say, ""Mom, I want to show you I am responsible. How about you let me be in charge of packing my own lunch this week?""

, Try your hardest to be a good student. Success at school shows your parents that you can handle challenges. Make sure to spend plenty of time on your homework.Make a study schedule for yourself. This will show your parents you are capable of sticking to a routine.
Wake up on time. Don't make your parents come in to your room several times to get you out of bed.
Getting up early will be important once you have a dog. Show that you are ready to handle early morning walks.

, Animals deserve a loving owner. Show your parents you are capable of handling that responsibility. Be kind to others to show them that you are the type of person who will be kind to your dog.Show consideration for your family members. If you see your dad out mowing the yard on a hot day, bring him a glass of iced tea.
If you have siblings, be nice to them. If you fight less with your brother, it shows that you are a kind, responsible person.
Be a good friend. Showing kindness to your friends will help your parents see what a great kid you are. Offer to let your buddy ride your new bike.

, You want to show your parents that you are growing up. Let them know that you are mature enough to handle having a dog. One way you can do this is by communicating with them.Don't throw fits. If you don't get your way, don't stomp off. Instead say, ""Ok, I accept your decision.""
Use your words. If you are upset by something, talk to your parents. You can say, ""I'm upset that I can't spend the night at Sarah's this weekend. Is there something I can do to earn the privilege?""
Work on creating a relationship based on trust. This will help your parents see that you deserve to adopt a dog.

, You will also need to keep bringing in enough money to take it to the vet, buy the food and any other unexpected expense.

, Get on your computer and put these things in an attractive format for your parents:


Costs. Write out the things you will need to buy and how much you expect these things to cost. The cage, bed, litter box, litter, water bottle, food dish, harness and leash, food, ferret first aid kit, carrier, ferret shampoo, treats, toys, and the ferret itself.
Write out the positives about ferrets. What makes them good pets to have. Write about how they're not destructive to furniture, they're quiet, they're small, they're in a cage sleeping while you're away and not pooing on the carpet.
What you also need to tell them they can be destructive like they can dig under furniture in the soft fabric and how they can poop in the house when their not litter trained. But how these things can be prevented by watching them and how you can litter train them or buy them already litter trained and they might be happy at you for telling them the downsides to but how those down sides can be prevented or fixed.
Write about how you plan to work hard and save money to take it to the vet when needed. Will it be neutered and De-scented when you buy it? If so, write that too.
If your parents have any specific concerns about the pet, address these concerns, too.

, Wait for a time that is convenient to your parents, not right before they go to work or when they're driving. Make sure you all have time to sit and discuss things. Do not whine or beg. Be sure to discuss the matter in a mature manner.

, Be sure they know that you don't need an answer right away. If they have a few days to think it over it may be more likely they will give you a favorable answer and it shows that you are mature enough to delay gratification.

,,, Ferrets live 6 - 10 years. Will you take them to college with you if you go? Will you be able to find apartments that allow ferrets? Your parents will want to know you have thought of the options and are ready for the commitment.

Listen to your parents' response.,

Avoid pestering your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Horse," Do your research as widely as possible, including prices. You may want a horse to ride cross country, a horse for dressage, a horse to pull a trap, or flat race or something else. There are many, many ways to enjoy horse ownership. Make sure you know what you want, don't focus on getting a particular breed of horse, unless you know it will make all you horse owning dreams come true. If you are not convinced about the type of horse you want, you'll never convince your parents to buy you one!


Buy or borrow some books on caring for horses. Research online too. Read through the books and articles thoroughly. Increasing your knowledge may result in you finding more points to persuade your parents and will help to demonstrate your commitment to caring for your own horse.;
, Include how you intend to finance the purchase of the horse. Explain in your plan where the money for on going costs will come from, such as vet fees, feed, tack, farrier costs, etc. Make sure to include who will look after the horse, don't forget to include some contingency ideas. Such as if you go on holiday or are unwell. Find all the answers to the questions you might be asked. Fill a small notebook with the details. Cover the prices, all the equipment you will need and where you can keep the horse. It's also a good idea to put in a timetable for the week, incorporating leisure time and other clubs, and schoolwork. This will show that you've thought about the effort needed and how to balance this with other essential parts of your life.


Be frugal. Spend as little money as possible. When you get money such as allowance and holiday present money, stick it in a safe place where you will forget about (but not lose) it.

, Taking lessons is an important and vital step to horse ownership for most people. You can't learn everything from books. You almost certainly need to know how to ride, even if you for some reason want a companion horse only. Remain humble at all times and remember that no matter how many years you have spent around horses, you can always learn something new.


Find a place where you can be with horses and start learning. Offer to help out at the local stables on a weekend or take riding lessons somewhere and improve your skills. If your parents can see your dedication and know that you're really serious, they may realize that this isn't just a passing thought.

, If you have another pet, such as a dog or even a hamster, go all out with taking care of that animal. If you and your siblings often argue over who has to walk or feed the dog, do it without being told and without the usual argument over who should feed the pet. If your pet has to be brushed, brush it with every animal brush you have. Use any products that you can find. Has Mom been asking you to bathe Fido? Do it before she even gets home. Start taking charge with other things as well, such as your schoolwork, your chores, and cleaning your bedroom. If you have one, put your dishes in the dishwasher after dinner instead of making Mom do it. The most important direction: Take charge.

, If you see something that is poisonous to horses, don't be afraid to say so. Just casually mention it as if you are commenting on the weather. Get a book or two and read it thoroughly so that you actually do know your stuff.

, If you aren't already, go horsey. Cover your room, binders, schoolwork, wardrobe, bedroom door, everything with horses! No matter what anyone says, especially that you are obsessed, go horsey. You could even buy hats, backpacks, and shirts with horses or horse related things on them. Try not to spend too much money, however, because that is irresponsible and shows you parents that you aren't ready for an animal like a horse.


A good idea is to get calendars, that way once the year is up you can cut the pictures out of the calendar instead of purchasing posters. Print pictures off the internet too.

, If your riding instructor thinks you are ready for a horse of your own, let them know that your parents need to know that! If you don't tell them to tell your parents things, they won't even think about it.

, You obviously will never get a horse if your parents don't know you want one. If you have friends that own horses, tell your parents about them a lot.


Go on YouTube and search videos where kids (or even young adults but not too old or you may get it into your parent's heads that adulthood is the only good age) were surprised with a horse of their own. Make sure your parents are in the room when viewing these or they obviously have zero effect. Mention that it would be amazing to be surprised like that.

, Suggest that you all sit down together at a time when everyone is comfortable and doesn't need to rush off to work or anything else. A weekend might be a good time, when everyone is relaxed.

, Let them know that you have done your homework and want to tell them the facts about owning a horse and some information about how you can fit a horse into your schedule.

, Show them that you have done a lot of research on the types of horses and the one specific type you're interested in. Show that you've researched the costs of buying the horse and where the best deals are. Show them too that you have researched the ongoing costs of keeping the horse.


Also explain where you think the horse would be housed. Is it going to be on your own property or in agistment (on someone else's land)?

, Explain how you are willing to do your part in meeting both.


Perhaps you have some savings to contribute, or you have a job that can help towards the costs.
Maybe you're happy to go without birthday or other gifts for a bit, accepting that the cost of the horse is the gift for a while ahead.

, Do not interrupt or whine while they explain how they see it.


If this is the first time they've heard of it, they will probably need some time to think it over, so be willing to allow for this without looking upset or annoyed. Say thank you for considering the request if they adopt this approach.
If they say an outright ""no"", gently say that you understand this is a big deal and a big change. Ask that they at least think it over before making a final decision. Ask them if there is any other information you could provide to help their thinking process.

, If your parents are really adamant that a horse is not for you, resist the temptation to argue or cajole them. Instead, set about finding ways to make this work, such as finding funds or finding a perfect place to keep the horse, and so forth. Then, raise the issue again a few months later. On the the plus side, if your parents were worried that this is a passing fad, they'll be aware that you really mean this if you do wait and then raise it again with them.


Have your rider instructor call up your parents and say what a great rider you're becoming.

, If you do nothing else than go on and on about wanting a horse, this risks angering or irritating your parents. Be more constructive about your approach than that.


Begging and whining and throwing tantrums will get you nowhere. It may even throw you back.

Think about any recent fights you have had with her.,
Consider her own personal life.,
Remember that she may be just jealous of you and your life.",How to Love Your Big Sister Even Though She Can Be Really Annoying1," Be sure to look at the relationship from her perspective as well, and not just yours. Remember that she has feelings as well. Consider the following:


Is our relationship strong or weak?
What are the positives of my relationship with her?
What are the negatives of my relationship with her?
What can be done to improve my relationship with her?
Have I done anything wrong in the past to hurt her deeply?

If so, could her hostile behavior towards me be a result of my mistake?

;
, What subject did those arguments mostly circle around? Were they petty or important fights? If you two fight frequently, you may want to try to lower the number!

, Has she been dealing with problems at school or outside of the family? If she has been, she probably is taking out her frustration on you - one of the few or many things she is able to pick on easily. If this is the situation you are looking at, remember that she has feelings just like you do, and she may actually going through a hard time.

, Siblings can easily get jealous of one another, and wish they had their siblings' successes or life. If that is the case, treat your older sister nicely, and bring everyone's attention to her excellent qualities and talents. Speak nicely of her, and make sure people know that she is a good person.


Be careful of who you tell your sister's qualities to, as this could end badly. It's best to tell your friends about how talented your sister is, so that they will look up to her.

"
"
Now that you've had some deep thought about your relationship with her, first focus on the wounds that you need to heal.,
If she responds badly to your apology, take it quietly.,
Ask her if you had done anything in the past to offend or hurt her.,
Show kindness towards her, and do pleasant things for her, such as letting her have the last bit of ice cream, or giving her the biggest cookie.,
Immediately leave her alone if she tells you to go away.,
If she tries to pick a fight with you, refuse to continue the fight.,
Give her privacy.,
Most importantly, tell her that you love her!",How to Love Your Big Sister Even Though She Can Be Really Annoying2," If you have had a recent fight with her within the past few days or so, go to her, and sincerely apologize to her.


Make sure you go to her at the right time, such as when she isn't in her room. If you interrupt what she is doing in the privacy of her room, she may be unwilling to accept your apology.
If you can't remember any recent fights, apologize for anything you have done in the past to hurt her. Make sure you mean it, and you aren't just saying it.

, Tell her that you're sorry that she feels this way about you, but mention that you still are sorry for anything you've done to hurt her in the past. Then, leave quickly and silently to give her no time to throw another insult at you. Don't wait for her reaction.


If you return an insult, it will only provoke your sister's anger further, and she will refuse any following apologies for a while.
If she calls you back, cautiously return. Don't look too eager or quick for her forgiveness, but don't move slowly or she will take it as reluctance, and perhaps be offended.

, Have a simple, but pleasant tone. Don't sound haughty or reluctant to apologize for anything.


If she tells you, immediately apologize after she is done talking, and don't interrupt her. Assure her that you will make sure it doesn't happen again on purpose.
If she refuses to tell you, mention that if she wants to talk, you will listen. Still tell her that you're sorry.

, Be willing to share with her, but don't be too eager. Although she still may not be nice to you, your kindness to her will eventually rub off on her.


If you're too nice to her, she may get annoyed and/or suspicious. Keep your kindness to an appropriate level.

, Don't argue or whine about it, or you will drive her anger further. Take a deep breath, and be the mature one, no matter how angry she may make you.


If you don't leave, you will just see a door slammed in your face.

, If she starts the fight, you will end it simply. Take a deep breath, tell her you don't want to fight, and walk off. Don't look back, and don't listen to any insults she shoots at you, no matter how bad or crude they are.


Refrain from being a tattletale, but do let your parents know if she has been abusing or hurting you in any way, verbally or physically.

, This will work well, especially if you are a kid or a tween, and she is a teenager. Privacy is one of the most important parts of her life, and she is probably going through a stage where she just needs some space. Allow her to have it, and she may be a little more nice to you.



Never go into her room without her permission. Think of her room as off limits for you, unless if she opens the door for you to come in.
If she does allow you in her room, take it a special privilege. Don't touch any of her belongings, no matter how tempted you are, or she may kick you out, and never allow you back in. Respect her privacy and boundaries, and only touch what she allows you to touch.

If she does allow you to touch something, be extremely careful with it. Don't drop, damage, or spoil it.
If you do damage a belonging of hers, buy another for her, or fix it (if possible).



, Even if she seems to get grossed out by that, telling it to her will make her feel special. Tell that to her on a daily basis, but don't make it like clockwork. Tell it to her at the most important or meaningful times, and fill it with meaning - not just empty words filled with air.


If you don't tell her that you love her, she will not know that, and will becoming even more annoying because of that. She will believe that you don't love her, when really, you do.

Cats are a very controversial topic, especially if you're getting a smaller pet. If you have a cat, try to convince your peers that your new pet will be far from danger.
If you're asking for a bigger pet, such as a dog, try to come up with strategies to prevent conflict between the two.







, Make some kind of deal with with your parents; for example, if you keep your room clean and do all the things a perfect angel child will do, they'll consider getting you a pet. #*Never explicitly say, ""Get me a pet."" It's everything that you'll do stacked up on top of each other that'll help convince a parent.

, If your parents have to fork over $200 to buy you a pet, that is almost a guarantee you will get a no. Save up--if you aren't willing to spend some cash on your friend, maybe you shouldn't have him/her after all.

, If your parent has a serious reason that you can't get a pet, like if you want a dog, but you already own one that hates other dogs, and for some reason you can't separate them, then try suggesting another pet, like a ferret, hedgehog, or hamster.

Nobody thinks your sister or brother is better than you.It's okay if your sister draws really well, and you're not so good at that. Everyone is good at different things.
There are things you can do well, that your sister or brother can't. Don't brag about it or try to make them feel bad.;
, You can't have all the attention, all the time. But when you feel like you're not getting enough, it can feel pretty terrible.

, If your sister keeps borrowing your things and not returning them, tell her that this makes you want to stop loaning her things.

It is always best to talk things out, and get problems into the open., Remember that kids are treated differently at different ages. Does it seem like your little brother gets all the attention?

Plan your opening.,
Call a ceasefire.,
Reach out in a personal way.,
Give them time.,
Avoid involving other family members.",How to Mend a Relationship with Your Sibling2," There are certain times in life when change is more likely. When other major shifts are occurring, people tend to be more emotionally available and they may be more receptive to mending a relationship with you. The dynamics of your relationship are more fluid at these times, so it may be easier to redefine them. If possible try to time your approach to coincide with a major life event.The death of a parent, a divorce, or the birth of a child or grandchild often makes people reconsider other relationships in their life.
People are also more open to change when their children leave home for the first time, or right after they retire.

, If you have the feeling that your sibling wants to repair the relationship as well, call a ceasefire. Acknowledge that you are both contributing to the animosity, and agree to stop attacking each other. However, both parties have to want to make peace, and they also have to want it at the same time. If you try to push the other person when they aren't ready, they will resist, or they may even pretend to agree while secretly resenting it., When you are ready to ask for a reconciliation, you can contact them initially via text or email if that is the usual way you communicate, or if that's the only means of contact that you have. But never try to have the actual conversation via email – this will almost always lead to miscommunication and to more hurt feelings, which will only make things worse. Always have the main conversation in person, or on the phone, where you can talk in real time and hear the tone of each other's voice., Reach out, but then give them time to respond so they can adjust to the information and prepare for the conversation. Depending on how serious the rift is between you two, it might take awhile for them to decide if they want to speak to you at all. The worst thing you can do is try to push them into a dialogue before they are ready., Parents, spouses, and other siblings will only complicate the situation members complicate the situation at this point. It is best to speak for yourself, rather than having other people try to put their spin on the situation. Your brother or sister may also resent the interference and become defensive, if they feel that another family member has taken sides against them. This will make it nearly impossible to work through the hurt feelings on both sides."
"
Avoid blaming statements.,
Acknowledge hurt feelings.,
Apologize.,
Be willing to forgive.,
Agree to disagree.",How to Mend a Relationship with Your Sibling3," Accept your share of the responsibility and don't blame them for the problems you are having. Ask them to explain how they feel, and listen to them without becoming defensive. Be open to what they have to say – don't assume you already understand how they feel.
Give them time to talk, without interrupting. There might be something you don't know about the situation.

, Begin by acknowledging that a problem exists. Investigate the cause of the conflict, and try to figure out where it began. Tell your sibling that you realize their feelings are valid, and assure them that you will do your part to work toward a loving sibling relationship. When you let down your guard and begin to communicate openly and honestly, it will be easier to forgive each other.

, Understand that you created part of the problem, and figure out where you went wrong. Then apologize sincerely, without being defensive or flippant. You can mend a broken relationship over time, but the process must start with a real apology.


If trust was breached, be honest and tell them why you did what you did, and what you were thinking at the time. You may need to do some soul-searching to determine your motives, so you can give them a genuine explanation.
Avoid making excuses. Don't try to rationalize your behavior, because your sibling won't be fooled by this and they won't believe that you genuinely want to change.

, In order to move forward, at least one of you must apologize. If the situation involved bad behavior on both sides, your sibling will want to apologize as well. Be sure you are open to their explanations, and accept their apology. Don't harbor resentments, or you will never be able to move on.

, Some issues can't be resolved, and sometimes you won't be able to truly understand why your sibling behaved as they did. You may not always agree on every point. If you both want a relationship, you can agree to accept each other's differences and leave room for disagreement."

Plan one manageable change.,
Be on the lookout for emotional roadblocks.,
Stand your ground.,
Continue to work on your communication.,
Spell things out.",How to Mend a Relationship with Your Sibling4," Once you have figured out what is at the root of your disagreement, try to make one small change in your behavior to try to change the relationship dynamic. If your sister habitually comes to you for help and you sometimes feel overburdened, try coming to her with a problem that she can help you solve. Be specific regarding steps she can take to help, so she won't have to guess.
Changing a relationship is a process. Take small steps at a time, and you will feel that you are making progress.

, Changing the familiar pattern of a relationship can be unsettling to everyone involved. Don’t be shocked if your sibling tries to return to your usual dynamic. Be aware of this, so you won't automatically react in your old manner, and make things worse.For example, if your sibling has always relied on you, and now you want to expect mutual support, they may resist at first. They may suddenly come to you with a new problem to solve, so be on the lookout for it.
Family members may complicate matters at first, by reinforcing old patterns. A spouse, for example, may express suspicion that your sibling is being genuine, stirring up negative emotions. Ask family members to support you and your sibling's decision to change.

, Change can be frightening, even when it is change for the better – it is easy to fall back into old patterns of behavior, simply because they are familiar. Pay attention to your sibling's reactions, and resist falling back into your old ways. Remind your sibling that you decided together to try something new., Once things have begun to improve between you, open another dialogue and ask your sibling what your ideal relationship would look like to them. What changes would they like to see, going forward?, Decide together how you want to communicate. Don't try to guess how your sibling feels, or what they expect from you – that is how you got to this point in the first place. Decide in advance what will happen if boundaries are not respected, such as a temporary break from each other when the rules are broken.


If there are hurtful words that are off-limits, agree to avoid them.
If you haven't always communicated as well or as often as you should, come up with a schedule of how often you will speak, and how. Is email sufficient? Would your sister be happier if you spoke on the phone instead? Who should call whom, and how frequently?

, When and where you talk can impact whether or not your parents say ""Yes."" Talking when your parents are busy or stressed may result in them not listening. Find a place free of distractions when both of your parents will be free and relatively relaxed.For example, if you have a quiet dining room in your house, try asking here. If your parents, say, sit in the dining room and have coffee on Saturday mornings, this will be a good time to ask as they'll be relatively relaxed.

, Try to make a new dog sound enticing. Bring up the potential positive aspects of having a new dog. For example, you can talk about how a new dog could keep your current dog company. You could also talk about the potential benefits for the family. Have a new dog to train, walk, and play with will give everyone more exercise. You can also have more family time together, as you can take the dog on weekend hikes or attend obedience classes together.

, A lot of kids decide they want animals on a whim. Your parents may feel you have no thought this through on a practical level. Illustrating that you have will make you look responsible enough to handle a second dog, so tell your parents how you plan to care for the dog.Talk about how you understand there will be extra work. For example, say, ""I'll make sure to let the dog out and feed it.""
Bring up anything you learned while researching introducing a new dog into the home. For example, say, ""We can introduce the dogs slowly. The new dog can stay in my room until Sparky gets used to having another dog here.""

, Your parents may be hesitant to say, ""Yes"" if you come off as entitled. Showing a little gratitude can go a long way in terms of getting a ""Yes"" answer. Tell your parents how much you respect them when asking for a dog.For example, say something like, ""I know how hard you two work and I really appreciate you getting me one dog. I know raising a kid and a dog is hard when you're both working full time.""

, Do not interrupt when your parents are sharing their perspective. Remember, there are two sides to every story. Your parents may have good reasons to be hesitant to get another dog, so try to hear them out.Let your parents speak. After you've stated your case, be quiet and allow your parents to contribute to the conversation.
Try to empathize with your parents when they talk. Your parents work hard to make money, and want to spend it wisely. A new dog may be costly. It will also take a lot of time to introduce a new dog to the home. Your parents' time may be limited, so they may be hesitant to get a new dog.

, If your parents say ""No,"" or express uncertainty, avoid arguing. The more mature you are, the more likely your parents are to allow you to get another dog. Dogs take a lot of responsibility, so you want to show your parents that you are responsible.Instead of arguing, listen to your parents in a calm fashion. Do not say, ""It's so unfair you won't let me get another dog."" Instead, say, ""Okay, I understand why it would be a lot of work for you.""

, If your parents say ""No,"" it can be helpful to ask why. This will allow you to better understand their perspective and possibly find a solution or compromise.Ask respectfully. Say something like, ""I understand you don't want to get a second dog. Could we please talk about why?""

, Your parents may want you to learn the value of work and responsibility. If you can offer to earn the dog in some way, they may agree to get one eventually. For example, you can offer to bring up your grades in exchange for a dog.If your parents say ""No"" initially, gently introduce the topic of you earning the dog. Try asking first. Say something like, ""Is there any way I could earn the dog as a reward?""
Provide your parents with some examples of what you would do to earn the dog. For example, ""I know you're not happy with my math grade. What if I tried to bring that up in exchange for the dog?""

, If cost is an issue, offer to pay. If you have a part time job, or are willing to get one, see if your parents would agree to get a dog if you paid some of the the expenses. You can offer to pay the adoption fee at the shelter, for example, or to pay for things like new supplies.Say something like, ""If money is an issue, I can pay for the adoption fee. I can start saving money from my paper route until I have enough.""

, Even if you ask calmly and maturely, your parents may still say ""No."" A dog is a big responsibility for both you and your parents and they may not be up to get one right now. Instead of arguing, maturely accept the ""No"" answer for now. In the future, your parents will be more likely to reconsider if you take a ""No"" with grace in the present.End the conversation on a good note. Say something like, ""Okay, I understand you don't want a new dog right now. Thank you for listening to me anyway. I appreciate it.""

Try family counseling.,
Try One-Person Family Therapy (OPFT).,
Enlist the aid of a neutral family member.",How to Mend a Relationship with Your Sibling5," In the US, romantic partners are ten times as likely to seek counseling as sibling partners. Siblings often live far apart, and they don't need to find ways to deal with things together on a daily basis, like money or children. Siblings don't always invest as much in their relationship as they do with their significant other, simply because it is easier not to.While few adult siblings sever ties with their family completely, as many as one-third describe their relationship as “rivalrous” or “distant.”
Counseling for siblings can be just as effective as marriage counseling, if both partners are genuinely willing to work things out.
Experts say the number one cause of rifts between siblings is an inheritance or family assets – money is also a leading cause of divorce., If the rift with your sibling is causing you emotional distress, but your sister or brother is not willing to try therapy, consider going on your own. One-person family therapy is based on the idea that family dynamics can be affected, and eventually altered, by changing the behavior of just one family member. Learning to understand the underlying problems in your family may help you change the way all of you relate to each other., If there is a family member or good family friend whom you and your sibling both feel is a neutral party, consider asking them to mediate your discussion. An outside party who is able to listen to you both – without taking sides – may be able to spot the root of the problem when you can't.


A caring mediator will offer support for both of you, which may help you get through a potentially unpleasant, emotionally-charged conversation.

Find out why your parents don't want you to get a cat.,
Ask a friend that has a cat to tell you all the good things about having a cat.,
Sit down with your parents and have a talk with them.,
Show your maturity.,
Take care of the pets you already have.,
Save up.,
Be nice to your parents.

,
Prepare an agreement.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Cat," Is somebody in your family allergic? There are many problems that may arise, but that's all okay. It is all going to turn out fine, as long as both you and your parents are willing to work around them.


Is somebody in your family allergic to cats? Don't worry, there are actually some hypo-allergenic cats out there! Research where you can find hypo-allergic cats in your area and go visit them. Bring along the person in your family that is allergic to them, so that you can see if they have an allergic reaction or not. If they don't, great! If they do, keep looking for other kinds of hypo-allergenic cats.
Does your landlord not allow pets? If this is the case, sadly, you're pretty much stuck. However, you can still get the cat owner experience, with someone else's cat. Become a pet sitter and look after other people's cats. Or, you could volunteer at animal shelters and work with the cats there. It's a win-win for both you and your parents, although not quite as good as really owning a cat.
Is a cat too much money? You've seen those pet store prices, and they can be pretty high. However, you can save a little money on the initial purchase of your kitty by going to your local animal shelter/rescue group. There are many great cats there that need a great home like yours. Because these animals need to be adopted, the prices for them are several hundred dollars lower than those pricey pet stores. If your parents decide that getting a shelter cat would be a good choice for your family, congratulations! You'll get the kitty of your dreams while being a cat-saver. Be warned that you'll need to pay for more than just the cat. You'll also need to buy its food, toys, vet bills, etc., which can rack up to a large sum of money.
Do your parents consider cats to be dangerous to the wildlife and birds? If so, suggest a cat run to keep the cat away from the wildlife and living indoors mostly.
Do your parents not want to deal with the litter box, and if you have other pets, such as dogs, are worried that they will get into it? Tell your parents you will keep it in your room and keep your door closed. Now this may seem like a bad idea because of the smell, but if you clean it daily, you shouldn't have too much of a problem.;
, Put this together in a talk to help explain these things to your parents. Hopefully, they will be convinced that getting a cat is a good idea.

, Tell them you will care for the cat, and you will use your own money to buy what is needed for the cat. If your parents say no, no means no. Quit bugging them and stop asking.

, If your parents don't think you're responsible or mature enough for a cat, try your best to prove them wrong. Do extra chores around the house. Look after your neighbor's pets while they're away on vacation. This will teach you a lot about animal care in the process, too. Look after your younger siblings/family members to show your guardian that you're responsible enough for a cat.


Respect your parents and help out around the house. For example, help wash the dishes, help clean up around the house, etc. Doing this may make your parents think that you are responsible enough to care for a cat.

, If you can't even take care of the pets you already have, then there's no reason why you should expect your parents to get you a cat.

, If your parents decide that your financial situation isn't suitable for a cat at the moment, you might just have to wait a few years until you can afford a cat. Do odd jobs and save up your money to show that you're truly dedicated to this outcome.

,, If all else fails, write your parents a letter or make up a contract saying that you'll be fully responsible for the cat and that you'll take full care of it. Only do this if you are very serious about getting a cat.

Spend time playing with your sibling.,
Talk to them.,
Tell them that you like them.,
Don't hesitate to get silly!,
Listen to them and validate their feelings.,
Love them for who they are.",How to Help a Developmentally Disabled Sibling1," Chances are, your sibling may be interested in stereotypically ""younger"" pastimes, so interaction will be easy and relaxing. Find a pastime that the two of you both like, and engage in it. This might be...


Playing dolls
Watching cartoons
Driving toy cars on the furniture
Board games or games on phones
Dancing;
, Tell them about your day, and then ask them to tell you about theirs. When you engage in back-and-forth conversation, it lets them know that you care about their thoughts, and want to share your experiences with them.


Don't be afraid to ask ""Could you please repeat that?"" if you didn't catch what they were saying.

, Life can be hard for kids with developmental disabilities. It helps to know that there is someone on their side at home. Here are some little ways to let them know you care:


Praise them for being nice and working hard. Tell them you're proud of them.
Give them little gifts—a candy bar, a drawing, or a handmade toy book for your dolls to read
Spend time hanging out.

, Many kids love silly humor, and won't judge you for whatever you do. Put your pants on your head! Spin in circles! Use funny voices! They'll giggle right along with you.

, Acknowledge that it's okay to feel the way that they feel, no matter what that is.


If they say that something is difficult or painful, take their word for it, even if it's fine for you.
Practice statements such as ""I'm sorry to hear that"" and ""I see.""

, Sometimes family members fall into the trap of ""I would love my sister if she just didn't have autism"" or ""I'll be happy once my brother learns to use complete sentences."" Don't let these thoughts consume you. Love them now, and be happy now. Accept your sibling for who they are, let them grow in their own time, and focus on what matters most: your relationship.

Read stories together.,
Model good social skills.,
Try teaching skills through playtime.,
Discuss how people act in books and movies.,
Gently explain if they do something wrong.,
Teach them self love.,
Keep it fun, and don't overdo it.,
Expect to learn from your sibling too.",How to Help a Developmentally Disabled Sibling2," You may read to them, or they may want to read to you. Choose books that are appropriate for their reading level.


See if there are any books about your favorite movie characters. For example, if your brother loves Frozen, try finding picture books about Princess Anna and Queen Elsa.
Try picking books that teach life lessons, such as The Berenstain Bears. Many children's books teach stories that range from handling bullies to understanding diversity.

, Every kid needs to learn social skills, and siblings are one of their teachers. Teach them about good manners, and use them yourself. When they see you doing something, eventually they'll pick it up from you.


Practice asking questions about others. ""I had a good day. Would you like to tell me about yours?""
Model how to deal with feelings. ""I'm feeling frustrated, so I want to go to my room to be alone. Please let me be.""

, This works best if you are using dolls, or some other sort of social interaction toy. Have the dolls model good and bad choices. For example, when it's bedtime, have the child dolls pick up their toys before putting on their pajamas. Then have the parent doll(s) praise them for putting away their toys. Your sibling will think that maybe they should do the same thing.

, Many kids' shows will teach social lessons, but you can enhance this power by asking questions and making comments. Here are some examples of ways to encourage social skills development:


""How do you think he felt about that?""
""Is that a good idea? No, it's not? What is a good idea for her to do?""
""Wow, he's not being a very good listener to her, is he? She's trying to tell him something important, and he won't listen!""

, Assume that they didn't know that their actions were inappropriate, or that they didn't understand what to do. Listen to find out why they did it, explain why it was a bad choice, and help them find a better choice.


For example ""No, you can't walk around in your underwear when we have guests over. It's not polite. I understand you're hot, so we can turn up the air conditioning and I'll get you some ice water. Does that sound good?""
If you don't think you can explain it well, that's okay. Ask an adult to explain.

, Many disabled children get ostracized or bullied. Practicing unconditional love will help them view themselves the same way.



Compliment them. ""You're so sweet!"" or ""I'm proud of you for being such a hard worker!""

Celebrate their good traits. Maybe your autistic sister can't talk, but she can write computer code. Complimenting her coding skills will help balance out all the negative attention on her being nonverbal.

Don't let disability become a bad word. Treat disability like a natural part of the human experience, just like your peanut allergy or love of punk rock.

Love yourself. Tell yourself that you're awesome until you believe it. Your sibling will copy you.

, Remember, you're the child's sibling, not their teacher—and spending your free time on teaching will be exhausting to both you and your sibling. Teach them as you go, but keep it light, and let the parents/caregivers deal with the heavy stuff. Let your relationship be based on fun, and let the life lessons be extra.

, Children with disabilities are all unique individuals who have something special to give to the world. Listen to your sibling and learn to see things from their perspective. They may just change your life."

Don't expect perfection.,
Don't feel like you need to be constantly available.,
Communicate any concerns with your parents.,
Tell your parents if you feel left out.,
Focus on loving your sibling.",How to Help a Developmentally Disabled Sibling3," It's natural to be upset with your siblings sometimes, and a disability doesn't change that. You will get mad at your sibling, and sometimes you will treat them less-than-perfectly. This doesn't make you a terrible person.


If you feel bad about something, apologize to your sibling, and make it up to them. Then let it go. You did your best, and that's what counts.
If you have any longstanding issues between you and your sibling, tell a parent or trusted adult. They can help you work it out.

, You have boundaries too, and you should be able to have alone time when you want it. If you don't want to hang out right now, tell them.


""I'm tired, and I'd like some quiet time right now, okay?""
""I don't feel like playing right now, but I'd be okay with watching cartoons with you if you wanted.""
Besides, learning how to set boundaries is an important life skill—when your sibling sees you doing it, they will learn it from you!

, You are not your sibling's caregiver, and you are not responsible for solving their problems. If any of the following happens, ask an adult for help.


A meltdown or outburst
You suspect your sibling is being bullied
Your sibling won't respect your boundaries (e.g. refusing to leave you alone)
Your sibling is afraid of therapy (Some disabled children are hurt by their therapists without the parents knowing.)
Your sibling is upset and you don't know how to handle it

, With all the fuss about therapies, special ed, and other things related to your sibling's disability, you might feel that your parent(s) have forgotten about you. You deserve attention, and they probably didn't realize you felt ignored. Calmly take them aside and explain how you feel.


Avoid laying blame. This is not your sibling's fault, and your parent(s) probably didn't realize you felt this way.
It is not needy or selfish to tell your parents about how you're feeling. Don't keep frustration locked away.
Ask if they could set aside a certain time to be with you. (For example, every Sunday morning, bead bracelets with your mom.) A concrete solution will help fix it.

, Don't let your thoughts about disability, or the bad days, define your relationship with your sibling. Have fun, laugh, and enjoy growing up together.

Save money for the pet.,
Stay on top of your responsibilities at home.,
Write a letter to your mom.,
Ask your mom in person.,
Speak with confidence.,
Discuss your options with your mom.",How to Convince Your Mom to Get You a Small Pet," Don’t ask for a rabbit if you don’t have space for a hutch, and don’t get your heart set on a gerbil if you have a family member who can’t stand them. Think about the environment of your home and what type of animal would fit in best.Ask yourself: How big will the pet be once it is fully grown? Will it require any special medical care (shots, etc.)?Consider your schedule, too. Are you active in extracurricular activities? If so, do you really have time for a pet?
For example, you may opt for a pet like a rabbit or a hamster if you have a busy schedule as they are low maintenance and do not need a lot of attention to thrive. A pet like a snake or a lizard may be a good option if you have a passion for reptiles and enough time to care for them.;
, Your mom is more likely to take you seriously if she sees that you’ve taken the time to really think about what kind of pet you want, rather than just asking her for any pet. Look online or in books about pets to find which type of animal would suit your desires best. Then, have a first and second choice of pet.For example, you may have your heart set on a small animal like a rabbit or a hamster. This may be your first choice.
After you have identified your first choice for a pet, think about a second choice that would still make you happy if your mom doesn't go for the initial suggestion. For example, you may have a lizard as your second choice, as it is easy to care for and maintain.

, Do research into how much it will cost to buy the pet from the pet store or from a breeder. A small pet like a fish or a rabbit can often be bought at a pet store for $20-$50. A pet like a small dog or cat will cost more and may be bought at the pet store or through a breeder.If you are worried about the cost of an animal, consider adopting a pet from an animal shelter. It usually does not cost much to get a small pet from a shelter.

, You’ll have a stronger argument if other people are willing to help out, too. If you have brothers and sisters, check to see what kind of pet they might get excited about having. Then try to come to an agreement on what type of animal to get -- even better if you can agree on a plan to divide the responsibilities.


If you and your siblings cannot agree on a pet, you may need to advocate for a small pet on your own. Remember that in doing this, you will be solely responsible for caring for the pet.

, Your future pet will definitely require at least a small financial investment -- think about all the supplies and food your new pet will need. Then create a budget to show your mom how much you think it will cost to maintain the pet.


Factor in things like a living space for the pet, food, toys, and trips to the vet. Write down the costs for each aspect of owning the pet so you can present the cost to your mom.
For example, if you wanted to get a pet rabbit, you would need a cage, a water feeder, and a food bowl for the rabbit. You would also need rabbit food and a vet check for the rabbit.

, Your mom may be reluctant to let you have a small pet because she is unsure whether or not you can take care of it. Show her you can by putting together all of your research into a written plan.


Write down a daily or weekly timeline for what caring for the pet will look like. Talk about how you plan to make time to care for the animal.
For example, you may write out a care plan where you come home from school on weekdays and feed the pet at a set time. You may then note when you are going to play with the pet during the week. On the weekend, you may spend more time playing and caring for the pet, including weekly cleanings of the pet’s cage.

, You can really show your commitment to getting a small pet by saving money to cover the cost of the pet. This will show your mom that you are serious about wanting a pet and are willing to be financially responsible for the pet. Save money for all the things you will have to buy for the pet like a cage, wood chips, or pet toys.If you are too young to get a job, think about ways you can help out around the house, or see if there is a neighbor who would be willing to let you mow their grass or clean up for a little extra money. It can help to let them know you are saving for a pet.

, While you’re working to prove you can handle a pet, it’s extra important that you stay on top of your homework and chores. Your mom is unlikely to be convinced that you can care for a pet if you fall behind on responsibilities before you even get one.Commit to getting all your responsibilities done at home on time. Make sure your mom sees how hard you are working to get your chores done as well as your school work.

, If you have asked your mom for a pet before but she hasn’t taken you seriously, maybe it’s a good idea to write her a letter. That way, you can put all of your research into it and give her plenty of time to think about your request.


For example, you may list all the ways you are responsible and mature enough to care for a small pet in the letter. You may write, “I promise to take care of the pet when I get home from school and to stick to a regular feeding schedule for the pet.”

, If you think it’s best to ask your mom in person, plan for a time to make your request. Choose a time when you and your mom can talk one on one and in person. Pick a comfortable setting, such as at the dinner table or in the living room.Set up the discussion by saying “Can we talk about something?” or “I have to ask you something. Are you free to talk?”

, If you have done your research and have a plan of action ready for your mom, it will be easy to ask with confidence. Start the conversation off by saying something like, “I’ve given it a lot of thought and I think I’m ready for a hamster. Here’s how I plan to care for it.”You may print out a copy of a feeding schedule for the pet and a list of responsibilities you will fulfill to care for the pet. This way, you can show your mom the document and make it clear you have given your request a lot of thought.

, Once you have presented your case, discuss your options in detail with your mom. Listen to your mom’s response to your argument. See if you can both come to an agreement. If your mom seems doubtful, ask her what else you can do to convince her. Suggest that you both revisit the idea in a few weeks. Leave the discussion open.


Revisit the idea a few weeks later with your mom to see if you can sway her to let you have a pet. During this time, fulfill all your responsibilities at home and be a model child to convince your mom to let you get a small pet.

You should be equipped with an arsenal of knowledge so you can respond to any questions your parents ask you about guinea pigs. A few facts about guinea pigs to get you started are:Guinea pigs live about five to six years and are very social creatures.
A cage for a guinea pig should be at least two feet wide by four feet long for each guinea pig.
Guinea pigs need a diet rich in Vitamin C. They can only store Vitamin C for a short period of time because they lack the enzyme necessary to break it down.;
, Write down all the information you learn about guinea pigs in a multi-subject notebook. You’ll use your notebook for reference when you’re answering your parents’ questions.


Make sure your information is organized.

, Give your parents hints that you’re interested in guinea pigs. Find ways to show your parents some of your research. Tell them interesting facts about guinea pigs. They’ll be impressed. Say things like:


“Did you know guinea pigs come from South America and were domesticated by the Incas over three thousand years ago?”
“Did you know guinea pigs weigh between one and a half and two and a half pounds and can grow up to ten inches long?”
“Did you know that guinea pigs can have up to thirteen babies at a time?”, Find a shelter in your town that takes care of guinea pigs and ask your parents if they’ll take you to volunteer there. You’ll gain hands on experience taking care of, cleaning up after and taming guinea pigs.


The shelter will also be a great place to meet people who may be able to take care of your guinea pigs when you need them to down the line.

”Taking care of guinea pigs will teach me responsibility.”
“Guinea pigs are herbivores so all they require is fresh vegetables and pellets. They don’t like the expensive animal-based treats that dogs and cats do.”
“Veterinary bills for guinea pigs are usually much smaller than those of larger animals.”
“Guinea pigs can entertain themselves for long periods of time with cheap, homemade toys like toilet paper rolls stuffed with hay. I’ll still have time to take care of my other responsibilities.”

Guinea pigs are hide and run animals and they need to have a dark place to hide when they get apprehensive or nervous. Each guinea pig should have their own hide. There should also be one extra hide in the cage.
You’ll need pellets, hay and fresh produce to feed your guinea pigs.
You’ll need materials to make toys for your guinea pigs.
You’ll need to actually buy the guinea pigs. If you know of a local reputable animal shelter, you’ll likely be able to get a good price on healthy guinea pigs from the shelter.
You’ll need veterinary care. Include the price of neutering male guinea pigs and treatment for common illnesses guinea pigs can get.

, Show your parents that you’re serious about owning guinea pigs by putting your own money towards the cause. Find out how much of your own money you can spend on your guinea pigs.

, If you don’t have enough cash to cover your guinea pigs, offer to pay your parents back in chores around the house. Show them you’re willing to work hard to earn your guinea pigs. Say something like “I may not have enough money to pay for the guinea pigs on my own, but I’m willing to do any jobs you need me to in order to pay you back.”


Mow the lawn.
Wash the car.
Paint the house.

, Ask your parents what concerns they have about your proposal and listen to what they have to say. Take some time before asking this to contemplate what your parents’ concerns might be so you can come up with ways to respond to them. Some things they might be worried about are:The time commitment of owning guinea pigs might cut into your other responsibilities.
Keeping guinea pigs may smell bad.
Who’s going to take care of your pets if you have to leave town?

, Show your parents that you can handle all of your responsibilities. They’re not going to let you have guinea pigs if you can’t take care of the duties you already have.


Get good grades.
Do all your homework when you get it.
Help out around the house.
Stay out of trouble.

, Stay calm. Don’t try to force your parents to give you an answer right away. Try to see things from their point of view. If you try to push them too hard, their answer will almost definitely be no. If they say no to having guinea pigs, don’t take it personally. They may have a very good reason or it may not be the right time.Say “I respect your decision but I’m dedicated to showing you that I can handle owning guinea pigs. I hope I can change your mind in the future.”


If you handle your parents denial maturely, there’s a better chance that they’ll say yes later on.

, Even if your parents say no, continue to show them that you’re responsible. They may just need to see you consistently handling all of your business for a little longer. Remember that your parents want you to succeed and may be trying to teach you a lesson about earning the things you want., Continue volunteering at the shelter and gaining experience with guinea pigs. Remind your parents periodically that you still would love to have your own guinea pigs. Say things like “Today, I learned how to build a homemade guinea pig cage. It was so exciting.”


Don’t bring up the issue too often. You don’t want to appear pushy.

Understand.",How to Have a Better Relationship With a Younger Brother," Older siblings must find common ground with their younger brother, it can be girls/boys, sports, art, music. Especially, if you have not spoken in a long time, this serves as a good ice-breaker. Also, do not be afraid to share the meaning of brotherhood, or what your brother means to you.;
, While talking is good, spending time with your brother is also a good thing to do as well. Keep in mind, that you should set a specific day and time for hanging out, especially if you both live hectic lives. Try to alternate ideas on what and where to go, so that everyone can be happy.

, Learn ways to show an emotional bond to your brother. Although this may be strange to hear, emotional bond, think about it clearly. Some younger children, as well as older children, often feel as though they are alone, and that no one loves them. This gives way to the younger sibling, and/or the older sibling, finding outlets to persons and groups that they should not, in an attempt to find the all important ""love"" and ""acceptance,"" that they already have, yet do not feel.

, Many Families, and many cultures do not accept certain things from their children, and/or loved ones. This could be as simple as piercing, tattoos, sexual preference/orientation, etc. Someone wise once said, ""It is not what we are that is important, but who we are that is."" Children who often find difficulty in being accepted will go out of their way to experience acceptance for others, and not their family. As a big brother, it is your job to show acceptance of your brother, no matter what.

, A man's spoken word, is who they are. Remember that in many ways you are a role model for your growing brother. If you say you will do something, or give something, keep your word and your promise. It may not seem like a lot now, but down the road it helps build a strong, healthy relationship with your brother.

, At times, your brother may come to you asking for advice about a particular problem, the key is to be open to different possibilities that you did not see before. You have to listen, and think about ""what is"" versus ""what you think."" Speak clearly, and do not give advice that is what your brother wants to hear, but give more of a heartfelt tough lesson if necessary.

, Many people think that just because you have a younger brother, or an older brother, you have a built-in eternal friend. This is not true, a large number of brothers do not even like each other. This is not to say that they do not care about on another, but merely that along the road of life, they walked a bumpy path with one another, and complicated things have happened. Having a brother, a real brother, should always be a blessing. Learn to keep the paths of communications open, and clean. Learn to be the guiding light that shines upon confusing times. Be there for your brother, and remain sure they know you as a friend also.

, Every sibling relationship, is bound to have a fight or two. One important thing about fighting with a sibling, is learning to take blame, where blame is due. Another is to learn to apologize, and move on after these events. Do not hold onto something, when you know deep inside you should have let it go. Do not keep getting aggravated at something that already happened. When it's done, it's done. What's best is to apologize and not let history repeat itself. Believe it or not, at times, one of the most important people in a younger brother's life is the older brother they look up to. At times, refusing to ask for or give forgiveness does damage subconsciously, and may lead to a false belief that, ""My brother does not love me. Why would he keep fighting and arguing with me if he did?""

, Giving gifts to your sibling may seem like an okay thing, but that all depends upon the type of gift, as well as the meaning behind the gift. Gifts should be meaningful, as well as a way for one brother to express themselves. It has been proven that males, are far less likely to express themselves emotionally for fear of being labeled. However, to have a healthy brother-brother relationship, expressing emotions, feelings, thoughts, ideas, and so on, is part of the process. Although different than the dating and marital process, these are still an important part of the relationship. So giving a gift, such as a Christmas gift, or a birthday gift, is a simple way of showing that you, the Big Brother, took the time and patience to choose something your brother may want or need. It also shows a level of caring.

, Sometimes events occur that play a part in changing your relationship with your brother, either taking away from it, or helping it grow. For example, breaking promises takes away from the brother relationship, and the brother bond. Sometimes, difficult things occur. The key is understanding. Yes, at times it hurts, but the point is you have to show a level of understanding. ""I love you"" versus ""love you."" Again, love is an emotion, and while many men clearly love their older, and younger brothers, they do not always show or say it. It is unhealthy to let negative and/or positive feelings reside within one's heart, without finding an acceptable way to express those said negative/positive feelings. Sometimes a simple ""I Love you"" can be the key to making one's day seem brighter. Pay attention - there is a difference between ""I Love You,"" and ""Love You."" ""I Love You"" shows deeper and more personal appreciation for the emotion. ""I Love You"" shows through word and action that it is one individual's love for another. While ""Love You"" is merely an agreement that love for a person exists, it does not show that that the love is personal towards another.

It not only prevents things from escalating into an argument, but can keep you from saying words you’ll later regret.


When you feel yourself getting angry take a moment and count to 10. If you still haven’t calmed down, excuse yourself and leave the room.
Always remember that your words are a reflection of who you are. Chances are, you're not showing others your best side if words are getting you into trouble.The things you say to your siblings can last well beyond an argument. Harsh words can, unfortunately, shape how your brother or sister views you moving forward.
If you’re already in a bad mood avoid talking to your siblings until you’re in a better mindset. Lashing out at others is often the result of anger and frustration felt in another part of life.;
, Instead of always placing the blame on your brother or sister, try using “I” phrases. “I feel hurt when you do that.” “I don’t appreciate when you take my things without asking.”


“I” statements encourage assertiveness without making the recipient feel defensive.Don’t overuse the “I” phrases. If you rapidly fire off “I feel this” or “I feel that” and don’t give the other person a chance to respond, your tone may be viewed as aggressive.
An example for the correct way to use an ""I phrase,"" is: ""I feel frustrated when you take my clothes without asking. In the future, I'd appreciate if you could ask me before you take anything.""
It takes time to feel comfortable with and incorporate “I” phrases into your language. Don’t feel bad if you slip and forget to use them. Keep practicing - you’ll get there!

, Apologizing can be a hard thing to do. Admitting wrongdoing can be difficult, as emotions and pride often get in the way.Though it may be hard to do so, get into the habit of apologizing to your siblings. Whether you said something you shouldn’t have or did something that was hurtful; be the bigger person and apologize.
Be sincere in your apologies. It will only make matters worse if your apology is sarcastic or forced.
If you’re on the receiving end of an apology, accept it with a smile. Forgiveness is equally important!

, Hopefully you're able to improve your communication apart from your parents. However, tensions between siblings can often arise and it helps to have the support of your parents if that happens.


Your parents should be the last resort. Don't use them as a means for telling on your sibling or getting them into trouble.
Ask them to mediate the situation. A mediator simply oversees the conversation to make sure everyone gets a turn and keeps the tone from turning negative.

, If you’re like most people the idea of sharing with your siblings doesn’t come naturally, particularly if you already share a room with them.


Whether it’s clothes, music or, for younger siblings, toys, sharing seems to breed a lot of arguments and hostility.
Set some ground rules about sharing personal belongings. Inform your sibling that they are welcome to borrow your items as long as they ask you first.
If there are items that are off limits be sure to let your brother or sister know.
Don’t get too angry with them if they forget to ask you the first time they borrow something. Nicely remind them about your rule.

, This is particularly relevant for older siblings, as it’s often younger siblings who want to hang out with the “big kids.”


While it can be annoying to have your younger brother or sister around constantly, it’s also nice to include them from time to time.
Set boundaries. Let them know when it’s acceptable to spend time with you and your friends.
Be sure you’re only including them in age appropriate activities. For example, if you’re watching a violent movie and have a much younger sibling, it would not be appropriate to include them.
Older siblings, this is applicable to you as well. Just because you’re older, doesn’t mean your younger siblings don’t want to be included anymore! If you’re going on a girls trip, invite your younger sister to join.

, Though it may not seem as obvious as letting your brother borrow your car, sharing your wisdom and expertise is still sharing! In fact, giving your sibling advice, can often be the very best form of sharing.


Regardless of your age, siblings are always in need of advice. Brothers and sisters can be our best collaborators, co-conspirators and role models, but can serve as a cautionary tale as well.The fact that they are older or younger doesn’t matter much either, as everyone has some piece of knowledge worth sharing!
Don’t offer advice where it’s not wanted. Let your sibling know that if they ever need your advice, you’d be happy to share it with them. Otherwise, you shouldn’t butt in!

, Sharing a space with your brother or sister can be difficult. Do your best to be generous when it comes to your living arrangements.


It's particularly important to be generous if your sibling is living with you for the first time. Maybe they've just moved into your room or apartment. Make them feel comfortable with a what's mine is yours mentality.
If they want a particular side of the closet, let them have it. Learning to share your space and not get into petty fights is a great start to getting along with your sibling.

, Even if you don’t like to run or play video games, try to do something your brother or sister enjoys. They’ll appreciate that you showed an interest and, even more importantly, will enjoy spending time with you.


Take the opportunity to ask them more about the activity they enjoy. This will allow them to open up and can get the conversation going.

, Regardless of how old (or young) you are, games are a great way to bond with your sibling. Try to learn a new game together or pick one from your childhood that brings back memories.


Don’t choose a game that has a history of causing arguments. If, for example, you can’t get through a game of Scrabble without name calling and arguments, be sure to pick another game.
Playing a basketball game outside or a good, old fashioned game of miniature golf counts too!

, Relive happy moments together by looking at family photo albums. You’ll enjoy looking back at some of life’s best moments and will hopefully remember all of the good times with your sibling.

, Whether it's a weekend trip or a movie marathon, establish a tradition with your brother or sister.


You can do it on a monthly or yearly basis. For something like a trip, it may make sense to do it yearly.
Movie marathon's though, can be done on a monthly basis. Try alternating who picks the movies and snacks as part of the tradition!

Get on your sister's good side.,
Persuade her gently that she can get along with her parents and that things will be better for your family if you all get along.,
Maybe she is having hardships in her life and is picking on your parents as a way to get back.

,
If this is the case be really friendly to her try to find out her problem and help her deal with it as nicely as you can.

Support your sister's achievements.,
Set boundaries respectfully.,
Do chores together.,
Treat your sister more like a friend.,
Do not be jealous of your sister's talents.,
Appreciate your sister's good qualities.,
Keep your mind on the future.,
Avoid labeling your sister.,
Find some time to spend with your sister.,
Think before reacting.,

Talk things out with a parent.",How to Get Along with Your Sister," If you want a good relationship with your sister, make her feel supported. Instead of becoming jealous over your sister's achievements, be her personal cheerleader. This will make your sister feel valued and strengthen your bond.If your sister achieves something, offer her a sincere congratulations. For example, say something like, ""Good job! I'm so proud!"" if she gets straight A's one semester. If you're supportive of your sister, she's more likely to be supportive of you in return.
Remember, it's normal to be jealous at times. Sometimes, you may wish you were the one achieving something. However, just because you feel a negative emotion does not mean you have to act on it. Try to put your own negativity aside and try to genuinely congratulate your sister.;
, Boundaries are important for any healthy relationship. Without solid boundaries, positive relationships are difficult. You are entitled to your own physical and emotional space. When your sister invades your space, let her know politely instead of responding with anger.If your sister is upsetting you, you have the right to ask her to stop. Siblings sometimes take awhile to understand one another's boundaries, and your sister may occasionally inadvertently make you uncomfortable. In these situations, respond accordingly.
Ask your sister to stop the behavior, but do so in a mature fashion. Do not say, ""Get out of my room! I don't want you here!"" Instead, say something like, ""I need some space to myself sometimes, and I don't like it when you're in my room when I'm trying to read.""
Sometimes, your sibling may not understand you are trying to establish boundaries. Do not hesitate to ask a parent for help if your sibling is not respecting your boundaries.

, A great way to improve your relationship is working together. Try to help your sister with some of her chores, and ask her for help in return. If the two of you work together on, say, the dishes, this will encourage teamwork and a sense of togetherness.Making chores fun can help strengthen your relationship. If washing dishes seems tedious, the two of you can try making up songs to pass the time.

, Many people have a tendency to take siblings for granted. You may fail to see your sister as an individual if you're used to viewing her as just another family member. Try to treat your sister like a friend. Many siblings eventually become good friends.Think about how you treat your friends from school. Chances are, you do not do things like tease and torment them, which you may to do your sister. Try to offer your sister this same kindness.
Hang out with your sister sometimes. Just because she's family does not mean the two of you can't hang out like friends. Invite her on a bike ride. Play a board game together.

, Jealousy is very common in sibling relationships, and can be a major cause of tension. If your sister is, for example, a bookworm, she may get a lot of attention from relatives. Instead of being jealous of this, admire your sister's talents.Remind yourself of your own talents and skills. Your sister may have read all the works of Jane Austen, but maybe you're an excellent basketball player. Your sister may be great at figure skating, but you excel at horseback riding.
Remember, everyone is unique. There is no sense comparing yourself to your sister, as the two of you are different people. It's okay that you have different skills.

, If you're sometimes angry with your sister, keeping her good qualities in mind can help. Instead of focusing on things she does that irritate you, think about the reasons you value her.Throughout the day, pause and express appreciation for your sister. When she does something you like, make a point of saying so.
For example, ""Chloe, I really appreciate that you helped me with my math homework tonight.""
If you're able to appreciate your sister regularly, you will be less frustrated with her when conflicts arise. You will remember why your sister's good qualities outweigh her bad ones.

, It can be difficult to get along with a sibling when you're still at home, especially if the two of you share space and personal items. You may find yourself frequently frustrated. In these moments, think about the future. Remind yourself that you won't always get to see your sister every day. This can help you appreciate her more.Many siblings turn out to be good friends as adults. Even if the situation is tense now, you may one day think of your sister as your best friend.
Keep this in mind when you feel frustrated. Remember, a single moment does not define an entire relationship. Having perspective will help you let certain frustrations go.

, If you're living with someone, sometimes it's hard to see them as an individual. You may think of your sister in terms of a family role. For example, you may think, ""My sister is the smart one"" or ""My sister is the goody two-shoes."" Try to look beyond these definitions. Push to see your sister as more of an individual.Pause when you find yourself labeling your sister. Take a second to question the validity of this label. Does your sister see herself this way? Is there anything about your sister that does not fit with this label?
Focus on aspects of your sister's personality that don't fit with the label you have. Maybe you think of your sister as a jock more than an intellectual. Pause and consider the fact she just aced her chemistry final.

, Spending time with your sister is vital to learning to appreciate her. The two of you will bond if you share activities. Work on spending some time with your sister each week.Attend your sister's basketball game after school. Accompany her to her next piano lesson. Ask her to join you in turn. You could, for example, invite her to your upcoming art show.
Hang out during the day as well. Watch a movie with your sister after school. Play a game together. Talk about things like movies, books, and music.

, The worst thing you can do in a conflict is react right away. If your sister hurt your feelings, pause before reacting. Take a few deep breaths and try doing something like counting to five. This will prevent you from blowing up at your sister, potentially making the situation worse., Use your words to handle conflict. Do not scream and yell, as you are not really communicating. Never resort to physical violence, as this will only make things worse. You also do not want to accidentally hurt your sister during an argument.Let your sister know when she's hurt or upset you. Use simple language to explain the unacceptable behavior instead of getting angry in return.
For example, say something like, ""Ella, do not pinch me. Pinching hurts."" This is more effective than yelling or pinching back.

, Certain topics may simply cause arguments. Maybe your sister dislikes discussing something at school. Maybe there's an issue you simply disagree on. If certain topics tend to only lead to conflict, you may be better off avoiding them. No one sees eye-to-eye on everything all the time., If you're having trouble managing an issue with your sibling, talk to a parent. Your parents want you and your sister to get along. They will be happy to mediate if the two of you are having an issue.Do not bring it up in a negative way. You do not want your parents to think you're being argumentative or mean. Present yourself as wanting to resolve the issue rather than get your parents on your side.
For example, say something like, ""Dad, I'm having trouble with Sophie lately. Can you give me some advice on how to talk to her about how she read my diary?""

Listen when they say “enough” or “no more.” Autistic people are easily overwhelmed with sensory information.,
Pay attention to their “stim” cues.,
Try sitting next to them.,
Give them their space.,
Encourage them to draw.,
Compliment them often.,
Talk to them.,
Interpret their attempts at wandering.",How to Deal with an Autistic Sibling1," They're not trying to be rude. They're trying their best to be comfortable in the world.Talk with your parents about using “break cards” with your siblings. A break card is simply a card that says something like “I need a break.” Especially helpful for non-verbal children, the card provides another way for your sibling to communicate that they need to get away from someone or from an activity that is stressing them out.If you decide to use a break card, be sure to talk through how it will be used. Will your sibling point to it, or carry it with them? When will the break end, and what will happen during the break?;
, Physically, autistic people engage in self-stimulating behavior (often called “stimming”). These behaviors (such as flapping hands, rocking, twirling, or repeatedly playing with the same objects) calm them down, make them feel good, and help them feel balanced.Most of these stimming behaviors are safe but will seem unnerving to people who do not understand the connection the behaviors have to the autistic child's life.
Don't let stimming worry you. If your autistic sibling is stimming, treat it like a natural behavior, and continue doing whatever you were doing. Alert a parent if your sibling is doing self-injurious stims, so they can ask a therapist about finding a better stim for relieving stress.

, Not every autistic child prefers close physical proximity, but some do, especially while your parents are teaching them about personal space. For kids (especially non-verbal ones) who like standing or sitting close, the proximity can help them focus or calm, so instead of sitting across from them, try to sit next to them when you talk with them., Not every autistic child prefers close physical proximity, and most will enjoy having space to themselves. Sometimes your sibling just won't want to play with you or hang out next to you. Be patient with their mood changes.

, Many autistic people, especially non-verbal people, are highly visual thinkers and as a result, they can often enjoy expressing themselves through art—and it can be a fun activity you can share with them., Use specific praise to reinforce the positive behaviors you are helping your sibling to learn. It takes a lot of energy and concentration to follow the rules and act “normal.” Let them know you are happy with their efforts., Now that you better understand your sibling in theory, interaction will be easier. Even if your sibling repeats words or doesn't talk, they are still capable of thinking and understanding you. Talk to them as if they were a friend. If they don't talk, watch their body language or stims for cues.


Don't yell at them or treat them like a baby. This will hurt their feelings and make them distrust you.

, When autistic people attempt to physically wander off, it is usually a form of communicating “I want,” or “I don't want,” or “I need” something. Paying attention to the situation leading up to this behavior will help you learn more about what your sibling is trying to say—and will also help keep them safe."
"
Work on calming them instead of yelling.,
Avoid their triggers.,
Try to be empathetic.",How to Deal with an Autistic Sibling2," Meltdowns can be frightening, but remember that your sibling is simply trying to find balance. The best you can do for them at these times is talk to them gently and be respectful, and engage them in a calming routine that your family can practice for just these situations.For instance, if you ask ""Do you want a hug?"" and your sibling says no, don't hug them. Your sibling still loves you and needs you, but might not be able to handle human touch at the moment. It's not personal.
Don't hold on to your anger. It is natural to get angry at times with your sibling. Everyone in the history of siblings has done it. The key is to remember that you love them.

, Pay attention to what has led up to the meltdown, so you can help your sibling in the future. Autistic people meltdown when they feel overwhelmed, so chances are good that the signs for the meltdown were noticeable before it happened—you just have to recognize those signs., Your sibling isn't a toddler having a tantrum—they are just someone struggling with communicating in the ways you are familiar with. At times they may say inappropriate or tactless things, and their stimming may seem strange to you. Remember that they almost always mean well, and try not to take odd actions personally.

"
Help them use visual/picture schedules.,
Give them choice and topic boards.Like picture schedules, these are boards with pictures that represent a variety of choices within a given activity or time-frame.,
Spend time with them.,
Help them with homework.,
Get along with them.Autistic children normally do awkward things, like failing to respond to a ""hello"" or saying that their clothes look strange, without realizing that it's rude.,
Be there for them.",How to Deal with an Autistic Sibling3," This can be a poster or actual board with pictures on it that show all the steps of an activity in sequence. Especially useful with non-verbal siblings, the pictures on the scheduled will help you communicate by reminding them, through pictures, of what they need to do or remember.A variety of pre-made schedules exist online, for free and through purchase. You can also make your own! Talk with your parents about the materials they feel are best to use.

, The ability to point to pictures that represent their choice will allow your sibling to have some control and tell you what they want.

, Do what they want you to do, even if it sounds ridiculous or embarrassing. It presents a great bonding opportunity. Find a simple activity you can enjoy and bond over.Watch television and film programs with them, and put the closed captions on. Your sibling may want to watch their favorite program repeatedly. Instead of getting annoyed, recognize that they are expressing their comfort and enjoyment with something about the show.
If your friends find out and ask what you're doing, you might have to tell them that your sibling is autistic; however, it will only help you in the long run if your friends can learn about autism in a positive way and help support you in dealing with its life challenges.

, Some autistic children have difficulty with homework and may require help from you. Speak in a gentle tone and don't rush. If they grow frustrated, take a break from homework help and ask an adult to help your sibling calm down.

, There's nothing wrong with taking your sibling aside and explaining that it isn't polite. If they've hurt your feelings, say so. Your sibling is likely to feel surprised and remorseful when they realize they've done something wrong.


Your parents can teach you appropriate ways to handle your sibling during play and in other situations. They want all their children to get along, so remember that your parents can offer advice and encouragement.
Be hopeful. Your parents and your autistic sibling all need your positive energy. Having a religious support has been reported to be effective, but what is important is that you embrace the wonderful and unique perspectives on life that your sibling can provide to your family.

, This is extremely important. Autistic people are often teased because they are unusual.Stick up for your sibling and if they cry, comfort them. Treat them as you would treat your best friend.


If your autistic sibling is slightly older than you, you will probably find their behavior as normal, since you lived with them since you were born. However, other people will feel sorry for you, saying things like ""Oh, I'm so sorry your brother is autistic,"" while others will dote on them, talk over them, or avoid them.
If other people express condolences or say something judgmental, an easy way to make them reconsider is to ask ""Why?"" For example, ""Why are you sorry that my sister goes to the special needs classroom?"" is likely to make people realize that they made a rude assumption.

Keep yourself and your siblings safe at all times.,
Keep a list of emergency numbers.,
Make sure your siblings eat regularly.,
Remind siblings about bathroom breaks and change diapers at regular intervals.,
Call your parents with questions or needs..,
Talk to another trusted adult if you feel uncomfortable watching your siblings.",How to Care for Younger Siblings1," Ask your parents or guardian to sit down and have a serious conversation about the rules and regulations when it comes for caring for your younger sibling. They may envision something totally different than what you think, so it’s a good idea to understand what they expect from you.


There may be different things they expect you to do if you’re caring for your siblings alone opposed to when your parents are present. Make sure to clarify this when you talk to them.
This is also a great time to ask any questions that you have about caring for your siblings.;
, When you care for your siblings and your parents aren’t around, it’s very important that you monitor what they are doing. If you’re outdoors make sure that you always see where they are. Around 2,000 children go missing per day in the U.S.When you’re inside the house make sure they aren’t damaging anything or breaking the rules.
Don’t ignore them to play video games or watch TV.
When taking care of a sleeping baby make sure you have the baby monitor with you at all times.
If your younger sibling is sleeping, check on them every 15 minutes., Don’t let a younger sibling climb on top of counter-tops, or play with silverware because they can seriously injure themselves or someone else. Other things to watch out for is if they are touching electrical equipment, putting things in their mouths, or running around the house.If you’re the one in charge, take control when it comes to safety by being stern and authoritative.
If your siblings are old enough, explain why the behavior is dangerous and why they shouldn’t do it to prevent it from happening in the future.

, Have your parents write down a list of emergency numbers in case anything goes wrong. Make sure that they include people in your neighborhood who can help if you need it. Have a cellphone or lan-line phone so you can call people on the list.


Dial 9-1-1 if there is a serious emergency, like your younger sibling seriously injured themselves, there is a fire or smoke, or someone trying to break into the house.If your siblings are prone to allergic reactions or other health issues, make sure that your parents educate you on how to care for them under these circumstances.

, Remember to feed your younger siblings, especially if your parents aren't going to be home for a longer period of time. Only use kitchen equipment if your parents have given you permission.


Microwavable food or cereal are things that you can prepare that don't require using the stove or oven.
Don’t let your siblings eat or drink anything your parents would disapprove of.

, If you are taking care of a toddler or a baby, it's important that you remember to clean their diaper at regular intervals to avoid diaper rash.Remind younger siblings to use the bathroom regularly, especially if they are prone to accidents.


If your younger sibling does have an accident and they are not a toddler, have them take a shower and change into different clothes.
Practice changing diapers under their supervision so you can do it if you’re alone.

, There might be a time where you’re not sure what to do, and you should call your parents if this is the case. At first, try to take initiative to solve the issue, but don’t do anything that could be dangerous or cause a problem later on.


If your parents text and the problem isn’t urgent, this might be a better way to ask them a question.
The more you care for your younger sibling, the more you’ll learn how to react in different circumstances.

, Sometimes parents will get busy and it becomes unfair and unsafe for you to watch your siblings constantly. If you feel like you are watching your siblings more than your parents are, have a conversation with a close family member or trusted adult. It might not be appropriate for you to watch your siblings for the amount of time that your parents expect you to.


If you are in your early teens, you may not be ready for the responsibility. This is another circumstance in which you should speak to another adult.
If you don't have any family members you can talk to, speak to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor.

Sense her mood and try to act accordingly.,
Know when to back off and let her be alone.,
Ask her how she's feeling, or if she wants to talk about it.,
Do something nice for her to show that you care.,
Give it time.",How to Comfort Your Sister when She Is Crying1,"


People can experience pain from a fight or break up in different ways, and your sister is no exception. Don't just assume what she is feeling; it will vary depending on who the fight was with or what the break up entailed.
If she looks devastated, now is the time to step in and show some love; don't say anything along the lines of, 'Your boyfriend was a jerk anyway"" or ""You deserved better than a fight like that"". Maybe hug her or bring her a bowl of ice cream.
If she looks angry or frustrated, show her that you feel the same way. Help her express her anger positively, whether it's screaming into a pillow or going to a karate class.;
,


If she is in the middle of crying her heart out, you should give her some space. While you may think bringing her some chocolate will help, it could come across that you don't care about her pain and are trying to change the subject.
It is crucial to let your sister be alone and figure out her emotions herself if you are the one who started the fight or made her upset. You can cheer her up and say your apologies later when she is done crying and has had some time to think.
If your sister is angry or frustrated and yells at you when you try to comfort her, back off. She obviously doesn't want your help if she verbally told you so. This also goes for if she is having an anger episode or expressing her emotions violently (screaming/yelling, kicking, punching, throwing things, etc.)

,


If she says no, respect that and say something like, 'That's okay, we don't have to talk. I'm happy just to sit here with you' and hug her. If she does talk about her feelings, genuinely listen and say something like, 'I'm here for you' or 'this must be hard for you'.
Sometimes this will help her feel better, but in some situations it may not be the best option.

,


Make her a special breakfast in bed, give her a homemade card, do something with her that she loves, or anything that will show her that you're there for her in her time of pain.

,


Just because you're there, doesn't mean she'll chin up immediately. Sad, angry, and frustrating emotions can sometimes take a while to go away.
Keep doing nice things for her and expressing your kindness and love until she gets better.

Do fun things together.,
Support each other.,
Keep talking.,
Appreciate your differences.",How to Get Along With Siblings1," It's very important that you find positive ways to interact with your sibling. One of the best ways to do this is just to do fun things together, things which you both like to do. Playing games together or going for a bike ride together will help you get to know one another while in a relaxing and fun atmosphere. In order to have a good relationship it's important to be involved in each other's lives and spend time together.


This doesn't mean living in each other's pockets, but rather making time for your sibling and looking for positive ways to interact.
Having a reservoir of good experiences will help act as a buffer when a problem or conflict arises. You will work together more effectively if you can draw on happy memories of having fun together.;
, As well as doing fun things together, you can help develop a strong relationship by demonstrating that you are there for your sibling and you support him. For example, if your brother has a big sports game go along and cheer him on. Even if you are not a big sports fan you are supporting your brother. He will appreciate you making the effort to be there and showing that you care, even if he doesn't tell you that.Supporting each other also means saying kind things, like congratulating your brother on his report card, and offering to help out with a chore or some work every now and then.If you complete chores as a team you will become closer as you learn to cooperate more effectively.
For example, if you have to wash up, split the tasks so one person does the washing, and one does the drying.

, Try to maintain good communication with your sibling even if you are having difficulties getting along. Just making small talk can help to ease tensions which might otherwise escalate if you are not talking. You need to learn to understand each other and if there is a specific problem just listening to your sibling's concerns is the best way to start doing this. Take time to listen and acknowledge any grievances and work constructively to talk them through.


When your sibling is talking really ask yourself ""what does my sibling want me to know, what are they telling me?""Remember communication is about giving and receiving information, so listen carefully and don't assume to know what someone is going to say.
You can involve your parents and have family meetings to talk about any problems you are having with your sibling., Although you are siblings, you are not the same person. You have different personalities, different interests and different strengths. An important part of building a strong and lasting relationship is understanding and appreciating these differences.You might want to play soccer all the time, but your brother wants to play music or do some reading. Don't think of your differences as things that divide you.


If your parents keep signing you up for things because your brother likes them, politely and calmly say that you have other interests.
If your brother is going to play soccer suggest you do something you like at the same time. Then you can compare notes afterwards.
Part of growing up is learning who you are as an individual, so it's perfectly normal to want to distinguish yourself from your sibling."

Be fair even if it’s not in your favor.,
Take the high road and maintain maturity.,
Try to solve problems when they arise.,
Enforce house rules about privileges.,
Don’t flaunt your privileges in front of your sibling.",How to Care for Younger Siblings2," In order to gain your younger sibling's respect, it’s important that they see you are a fair person. If you’re in a situation where you’re in charge, don’t take advantage of your power by being unfair. This could include controlling the TV programming, hogging the computer or game console, or taking what’s not yours.


Try to share with your younger siblings so they come to appreciate when you have to care for them.
If you have more than one sibling you have to look after, make sure to be equally fair to all of them.

, Younger siblings can be incredibly annoying and stubborn at times, but it’s important to keep your cool. Allowing them small, inconsequential victories will boost their self esteem and make them feel better. As a result, you'll also avoid unnecessary conflict. Don’t fight with your siblings. Be the authority and example they can aspire to be like.


A younger sibling may not always accept your authority.However, you can condition them over time as long as you maintain your maturity.
Letting your sibling win in a videogame is an easy way to make them feel good., Your younger sibling will trust you the more that they see you can solve problems when your parents are away. They will come to you for guidance if they need something and the more you’re able to act like a parent, the more they’ll respect and look up to you.


Clean spills or messes before your parents come home.
Helping younger siblings with homework will also show them how knowledgeable you are.

, You could confuse a younger sibling if your rules are different than when your parents are around. There should be house rules that are established that never change or deviate.Be firm when you reprimand a sibling for breaking the rules. They need to know they did something wrong so they don't do it in the future.

, One way to build distrust is to brag about how much later you can stay up, or the types of movies or music you’re allowed to listen to. This will only make a younger sibling feel resentment towards you.


Avoid talking about the special things you're allowed to do. Instead, enjoy that you’re able to do them.

Talk to your younger sibling.,
Be friends with them.,
Put yourself in their shoes.",How to Care for Younger Siblings3," Your younger sibling won’t want to listen if you don’t have a good relationship with them. If you’re not used to talking with them, start opening up to them by asking them how their day went or if they learned anything new at school.


Listen, and allow them to talk about their problems.
A good way to build trust is to give them advice when they’ve done something wrong at school.

, Sometimes we don’t get along with our siblings but it’s important to know that your relationship with them later in life is often affected by events early in both your lives.The earlier that you start building a friendship with them, the more likely they’ll come to respect you.


You don’t need to let your younger sibling tag along all the time, but the more you do things with them, the more your friendship will grow.
The sibling bond is the longest lasting relationship most people will have their entire lives., Acknowledging your younger siblings emotions is important to develop a good relationship, even if you think that the topic is silly.Try to remember what it was like being their age, and try to relate to how they are feeling.


Don't simply say ""it's against the rules."" Explain to your brother or sister why the behavior is bad or dangerous.
Try to be more relatable by telling them your past experiences.

Give your sister a hug.,
Talk about her feelings if she wants to.,
Don't be afraid to sit in silence and offer support in other ways.,
Be with her as much as you can.",How to Comfort Your Sister when She Is Crying2,"


This will help comfort her and show her you care about her during this difficult time. Hug her until she finishes crying, or until she wants to talk about it.

,


Don't force her to talk about anything. A good first step is to acknowledge the situation and say 'I heard your ___ died'. Using the word 'died' will let them know you are willing to talk about how they really feel; trying to sugarcoat the situation will only make it worse. Express your concern by following up with 'I'm so sorry' and kindly asking if they want to talk about their feelings.
If she chokes up while she's talking, tell her that it's OK to cry, and that she can stop if it makes her uncomfortable to go on.
Don't hide your feelings. Saying something like 'I don't know what to say, but I want you to know that I really care' is perfectly fine. If you feel the urge to cry, don't fight it. You may be grieving too, and crying alongside your sister will let her know you feel the same way.
Ask her if there's anything you can do. This shows that you are willing to help her feel better.

,


If she doesn't want to talk, simply holding her hand, hugging her, or sitting next to her can show her you care.
You could also comfort her by doing things like making her breakfast in bed or doing her chores.

,


Grieving can sometimes take a long time. Be with your sister as much as you can, and do compassionate things to help her through her loss.
Sit next to her at the funeral service, or make a memorial in the backyard together. Do something to help her remember the good times when this person, pet, or plant was still alive.

"

Be compassionate.,
Hug it out.,
When she has stopped crying kindly ask her if she wants to talk about it.,
Reassure her that you're there for her.,
Do something fun together that she likes to do.",How to Comfort Your Sister when She Is Crying3,"


If your sister is injured, grab her a bandage and help her clean out her wound.
If she is sad, you could bring her a favorite stuffed animal to keep her company and bring her comfort.

,


Keep hugging your sister until she has finished crying or wants to talk.
Even holding her hand or patting her on the back will make her feel loved.

,


If the answer is no, say something like, 'That's OK. If you change your mind you can talk to me anytime.' If the answer is yes, give her your full attention and don't make suggestive comments or give advice unless she asks for it. If she chokes up, tell her she doesn't have to go on if it makes her too uncomfortable.

,


Tell your sister 'Its going to be OK' or 'I love you and I'll always be here for you no matter what' and give her another hug. Just this small reassurance could help brighten her spirits and let her know you really care.

,


Grab her favorite board game, or take her to her favorite ice cream place. Anything that will make her happy and hopefully take her mind off of whatever made her sad in the first place.

Don't consider yourselves in constant competition.,
Understand boundaries.,
Don't lose your cool.,
Identify and avoid particular triggers.,
Respect each other's space.",How to Get Along With Siblings2," Is it very common for siblings to think of themselves as being in competition with each other for everything from their parents' affection, to the last slice pizza, or the best grades. Try not to compare yourself with your sibling, but understand that you have different strengths and weaknesses. If you support each other you will develop a better relationship than if you are constantly trying to better each other.If your brother gets the best grades in maths, don't judge yourself against this, but think about what you do well.
For example you could say to yourself, ""my brother always get high grades in maths, but I always win races at school""., An important part of any relationship is having clear and well-understood boundaries for behaviour. This is especially important for siblings who spend so much time together and grow up together. Your parents should help outline what is not acceptable and you have a responsibility to stick to this.If you feel like you don't understand the boundaries or that your sibling is not respecting them, be honest and open about it.
It's important to be able to recognise the boundaries without your parents' intervention.
For example, if your brother is annoying you, you can walk away. If he follows you, he may have crossed the boundary.

, If you are jealous, annoyed or frustrated it can be very easy to lose your cool and lose your temper. This will most likely inflame a situation and make it worse. If you can control your temper you will be better able to defuse a problem without it escalating. If you reach boiling point, take a deep breath and a step back.


Try to work out what has provoked you and why. Are you annoyed with your sibling or more annoyed with the situation?If you can recognise when your sibling is becoming irritated, step away and don't provoke them.
You could say to yourself, ""I know he is angry when his voice gets louder and his cheeks turn pink, so I will walk away"".

, As you get to know your sibling better you will gain a clearer understanding of what things irritate him the most. If you want to stay on good terms and have a good relationship you need to respect him and not provoke him. You can say ""I know he gets annoyed when I go on about soccer all the time, so I'll talk to somebody else about the last night's game"".


If your brother gets annoyed with you leaving lots of mess or not clearing away your toys, try to understand his concerns and be considerate.

, Siblings spend a lot of time together and it can be hard to escape sometimes, so it's crucial that you each respect each other's space. Everyone needs time to do their own thing and to be alone.If you share a room it's even more important that you respect everybody has a right to their own space and understand the boundaries.Sometimes you might want to play with friends rather than your sibling. This is perfectly normal, just be sensitive and take it as a compliment that your sibling wants to spend time with you.

Be ready to compromise.,
Understand that actions have consequences.,
Know when it's gone too far.",How to Get Along With Siblings3," If you are having a disagreement with your sibling, you both need to learn to compromise and accommodate each other. Try to divide things fairly and evenly and understand both sides of the dispute. Your parents will be very impressed if you learn to deal with problems with your siblings maturely by talking it through and compromising.Learning to deal with problems on your own by talking is a big part of building strong and lasting relationships.
Remember, it takes two people to argue so it takes two people to resolve the argument.

, If you find yourself in a dispute with a sibling, you both need to understand that there are consequences to what you do. Understanding this can help you to avoid conflicts or stop them from escalating. For example, if you break your brother's toy, you might be the one who has to replace it from your allowance. Likewise, if he breaks something of yours he will have to pay for it.This is one way to learn about the consequences of actions and encourage more measured ways of dealing with problems.As well as the material consequences, there are emotional ones too. If you say to your brother ""you're so stupid"", it will hurt really his feelings.

, It's a good idea to maintain good open communication across your whole family. Talking at meal times and having family meetings are good opportunities to raise any problems. If your fights have become physical and violent, you should talk to your parents straight away. Violence and bullying is never acceptable and goes beyond normal sibling rivalry.It's normal for siblings to argue, but there are differences between typical behaviour and abuse.


If you are always the victim, and your sibling is always the aggressor, and the roughness and violence increases over time, this indicates an abusive situation.
If there are any sexually inappropriate elements you should talk to your parents straight away.
Alternatively, call a child abuse hotline to talk to someone about it, who will be able to give you advice on what to do, and contact any necessary authorities"

Find out what interests her and what bothers or irritates her. Knowing these things will help you to have an idea about what you should and should not do around her.;
, Whether or not she has personal things to do that require privacy, you know you need to keep your distance. Otherwise, she will tag along with you everywhere around the clock.

, So she's a kid and kids get in trouble all the time. Whether at school or at home, make sure to support her. If she is being scolded, you could be the one to whom she can run for a shoulder to cry on. Treat her well and never bully her.

, Just give her a big bear hug, or pat her on the back or the head. High five her. Invent a cool handshake. Be her friend.

, With a girl sibling, you may want to try playing her girly games or doing her hair or applying make up. Try helping her with homework, dropping her at her classes or her friend's place. Be involved. Help her choose clothes and earrings.

, This doesn't mean you have to make fancy food. You could simply make sandwiches and milkshakes or just make an omelet. An occasional batch of cupcakes or brownies would be fun too.

, Don't always insist on your shows; choose her shows too. Sure, they may be a little annoying, but do it for her. One show a day will do. You can even do other things, such as IMing or texting, in this time. But this doesn't mean you should ignore your sister; watch enough to be able to engage in a conversation about the show with her.

, You are the elder one. Sure you'd know a thing or few more than her. Teach her that. Teach her how to swim or ride a bike. You could teach her decimal system for maths if she's old enough. Get her to learn tables if she's around 7-8 years. Read books together. not novels. Picture books or something she wants to read.

, It's hard to be the one in charge and not go overboard. If you need something from her, ask her firmly but in a kind way.

, In this way she can learn to look up to you and trust you. You will feel happier as well.

, It's hard to not fight with your sister every day if you're always wanting what the other has. Through sharing you can learn to put aside your neediness and selfish attitude and realize that there is always enough love, time and things to go around. Showing her the way to sharing is an important part of being the more mature person.

Apologize.",How to Be Nice to Your Little Sister," Many of us are frustrated by younger siblings, especially when they’re being mean or annoying. The first step to addressing this frustration is putting yourself in her shoes. The more you relate to her, the easier it is to be nice to her.For example:


Does she look up to you? Many younger sisters idolize their older siblings.
How old is she? Were you a lot like her when you were that age?
Think about the things that frustrate or anger her. Do they also frustrate you?;
, Show an interest in her life by talking with her whenever you see her. This behavior tells her that you care about her experiences and thoughts. For example, ask her about her day and quietly listen to her answer. For example:


”Hey, Jane! What did you think about the new Avengers movie?”
”Who are your best friends at school? What do you guys do together?
”What do you like to do after school?”

, When you treat someone with respect, you show them that you’re interested in their good opinion. Additionally, if you’re respectful towards your little sister, she will eventually be respectful towards you as well. For example:


If she makes you angry, resist the urge to yell at her.
If she’s bothering you while you’re trying to do homework, nicely tell her that you’re busy.
Don’t use her things without permission, even if she uses yours., Many older siblings struggle with jealousy towards their younger sisters. They often think that their younger sisters get more attention from their parents. Even if this is true, it’s not your little sister’s fault. She has no control over the behavior of your parents. Instead, talk to your parents about your feelings and offer solutions.For example:


Schedule some time to spend alone with your parents each week.
Ask your parents if you can stay up an hour later than your sister. This will give you one-on-one time with your parents.
Schedule family activities that will let you spend time with your parents and your sister together.

, When you congratulate your sister on something, you’re showing her that you admire her.She will enjoy knowing that you’re impressed by her, especially if she looks up to you. Someday she may even start congratulating you in return! Some examples of achievements include:


Graduating into a new grade
Doing well on a test
Successfully climbing a tall tree
Doing well at a dance recital

, Talk to your little sister about fun activities that you can do together. Try to find something that you both want to do. If you can’t, compromise by doing one activity that she wants to do and one activity that you want to do. Ask her about her favorite activities by saying:


”What do you like to do for fun?”
”What fun things do you like to do at school?”
”Let’s play together! What do you want to do?”

, Since you’re older, you have a better understanding of schoolwork than your little sister. If she’s struggling with a math problem or has trouble spelling, offer to help her. Carefully explain the assignment and help her answer each question on her own.


There’s a difference between helping someone and doing their homework for them. If you give her all the answers, she won’t learn anything., A great way to hang out with your sister is to do quiet activities together.First, invite your little sister into your room to hang out or go into her room. Next, tell her that you want to do quiet things while you hang out. This can include:


Reading books
Playing video games
Drawing
Playing on your phone

, Many of us get bored with our regular schedules. Add some excitement to your hang-out time by going somewhere fun. However, make sure you have your parents’ permission to leave the house with your little sister. Examples of fun places to go include:


The park
A local fair or festival
A mutual friend’s house

, If you’re too busy to spend a lot of time with your sister, you can still show her that you care. For example, if you have a driver’s license, see if you can take her with you on a few errands. Other examples include:


Making her breakfast in the morning
Leaving a nice note in her lunch box
Taking her with you when you hang out with friends

, If you lose your cool, the fight will escalate out of control. First, take a deep breath and count to ten. If you can’t relax, leave and come back later.Once you’ve calmed down, being nice to your sister will help keep you composed. For example:


Speak calmly and respectfully even if you’re upset.
Listen to everything your sister says and think about her words
Resist the urge to hit or push your sister

, For example, if you’re angry that your parents gave her one of your toys, you shouldn’t be mad at your sister. She has no control over the situation. Instead, talk to your parents.


Remember to stay calm when talking to your parents about your feelings.

, If your sister is upset with you, you can avoid a fight by letting her explain her feelings.Many people get frustrated when they think no one cares about their feelings. Show her that you care by listening to her frustrations and acknowledging her anger. For example, you could say:


”I can see that you’re upset with me. Why is that?”
”I’m sorry I hurt your feelings. Tell me why so I won’t do it again.”
”Why are you upset? Is there anything I can do?”

, Try to find a solution that will help you stop fighting. Keep in mind that you both may have to let go of something you want to come to an agreement. This can make you or your sister upset. If you’re both having trouble staying calm, you may need a parent to act as a mediator.Examples of compromises include:


Taking turns using your favorite toy
Sharing a piece of clothing that you both like to wear
Taking your sister along sometimes when you hang out with your friends

, If your sister is upset, apologize to her for upsetting her, even if you don’t feel like you did anything wrong. When apologizing, think about her feelings and the reasons that she’s angry. Use these reasons to help you create a good apology.For example:


”I’m sorry that I used your favorite hair brush. I won’t do it again.”
”I apologize for hurting your feelings. I really didn’t mean to.”
”I’m sorry about eating the last cupcake. I didn’t think about whether or not you would want it.”

You can either make her a card or buy one in store.
You can also give her a card after she achieves a milestone. Maybe she got all A’s on her report card or got a new job. Let her know you’re proud of her accomplishments.;
, Buying your sister a gift is a great way to show that you care. When buying her a gift, consider her likes and dislikes. If you know she has been eyeing a pair of earrings or a certain sweater, get that for her. Also, consider her favorite color in buying gifts as well.


You can also make her a gift. Handmade gifts can often be even more thoughtful than ones bought in stores. Check out Pinterest for cool DIY gifts.Don’t buy her a gift to bribe her into being nice, but do so to let her know you’re thinking of her and love her.

, A smile can go a very long way in both being nice and in encouraging niceness in others. Make an effort to smile each time you see your sister for the first time in a day and say ‘hello’ to her, even if she ignores you. If she feels that you are genuinely pleased to see her, her interactions with you could change.


You can try other gestures like leaning your head slightly to one side while she is talking to you as well to acknowledge that you are listening to her.

, You may find that you fight with your sister because she takes your things without asking or always wants to use your things. However, show kindness to her by allowing her to borrow things if she requests them.


Exercise caution, however, if she has broken or damaged your items consistently in the past. You may only want to let her borrow things that you don’t put much value in if she is careless with your items.
Also, if you have had problems in the past with your sister borrowing things without your permission, have a discussion with her about boundaries. You can say something like “I love you and don’t mind sharing with you, but when you take things without asking, it really bothers me. Can you ask me for permission in the future and I’ll make sure to do the same thing if I want to borrow something of yours?”

, If your sister is younger or if she has fewer friends, she may feel upset if you hang out with your friends without inviting her. Though you certainly deserve your own time with your friends, it wouldn’t hurt to ask her to join you occasionally.


Invite her to see a movie or go to the mall with you and your friends. She will likely appreciate the gesture.

, All people, whether they are mean or nice, need help sometimes. If you see that she is overwhelmed with something, extend an arm to help her. A thoughtful gesture like this can be a great way to show her a kindness that she likely will not forget. Helping others can also make you feel good, as well.


Some ways that you can help her include assisting her with her homework if you know the material or helping her clean her room.

, Though this may seem small, many fights between siblings have erupted over the television, especially if a family only has one TV. Make an effort to allow her to pick what you watch more often or find new shows to watch together that you both enjoy.


Compromise, as well. If you chose the show for the last 30 minutes, allow her to pick the next show or two.

, Food is a great way to bond and your sister will likely be very appreciative if you take her out for a meal. If you are younger or unable to take her to dinner, you can cook her something instead or make her a small snack. Watching a movie together of her choice is also a great way to show her kindness.

, The ultimate display of kindness will occur when you show your sister the same level of love and affection that you desire to be shown. If you wish that she hugged you more, hug her instead. If you wish that she talked to you more, talk to her instead. Model the behavior that you desire to see

., Most people enjoy being complimented and often times that kindness will linger with them even after the moment is over. Think about the attributes that your sister has that are special and make it a point to let her know.


For example, is your sister very smart or quick witted? Let her know that you think so.
You can also compliment her by telling her that she is pretty.

, Getting outdoors can be a great way to clear the air and recenter your and your sister’s relationship. Invite her to walk with you around the block or at a local park. This can also provide a great opportunity for you to talk to each other and develop your bond.

, If your sister has been unkind to you, the trust between you may likely be broken. Work on building the trust in your relationship.


One way you can build trust is through sharing secrets with each other. Tell each other one thing that the other doesn’t know and make a pact to keep the secret.
Another way to build trust is through honesty. Be honest with your sister about the ways you feel hurt by her and ask her to be honest as well. Being nice to your sister does not mean that you should lie to her.
Keep your promises. If you tell your sister that you will do something for her, then do it. Your sister will trust you more if you are dependable and reliable.

, Bonds are often developed through communication. Sit down and have a discussion with your sister about her day, school, work, her friends or any topic that you are interesting in knowing more about in relation to her. People often enjoy talking about themselves and will often open up if asked questions. This will indicate to your sister that you have an interest in her life and will bring you closer together.


You can begin a conversation with your sister by saying something like “how was your day?”; depending upon her answer the conversation may spark from there, but if it doesn’t you can try saying something like “what was the best part about your day?”
Consider all of the things you have in common and begin a conversation based around those. If you and your sister both love soccer, consider discussing the latest soccer game or your favorite soccer player with her.

, One great way to bond with your sister is to do something the two of you have never done before. Conquering your fears together or exploring a new hobby is a great way to deepen your bond and give you new memories to share and reflect on.


You can try something as exciting as riding a rollercoaster for the first time or something as small as binge watching a new show together. Either way, your relationship will grow.
Other ways include cooking, exercising, taking a class together, or going dancing.

, Take some time to sit down with your sister to have fun. You can play a board game with her like monopoly or checkers, charades, or cards. Games are often very fun, which is important because laughter can go a long way in repairing bonds.

, You and your sister have undoubtedly shared some memories together, despite the times when he has been mean. Thinking about those good times will make it easier for you to be nice to her.


Pull out those old photo albums and reflect visually on these memories. You can also pull up photos on your social media accounts.

, Your sister could be upset about something you have done to her in the past that perhaps you have not considered. If your sister was previously sweet to you and then she changed abruptly, think about ways that you may have offended or hurt her.


Apologize for any wrongdoing on your part. After self reflection and an honest evaluation of your relationships, you may discover that you have done some bad in your relationship with your sister, as well. Apologize to her genuinely for any specific things that you may have done.

, If after significant thought about your relationship you find it difficult to identify a time that you have hurt your sister, talk to her. You may have done something to her that, while insignificant or forgettable to you, has caused her pain.


Try using a talking stick. In some cultures, particularly within certain Native American tribes, the use of a talking stick is employed to have a constructive conversation. The general premise is that you have an item that is held when speaking and only the person holding that item can speak. Once the speaker is finished, the item is transferred and that person speaks uninterrupted while they hold the item. This is a great way to foster communication that is mutually respectful and based around purely listening.
Use “I” statements. If your sister has hurt you, don’t resort to name calling or being accusatory. Instead of saying things like “you are mean” say “I feel hurt by what you said”. This is a way of communicating your feelings of hurt or anger while being less threatening., Though it can be difficult to admit, sometimes we find that the problems that we see so clearly in others are also within ourselves. Be mindful of your interactions with you sister and consider your facial expressions, tone, and the things you say or don’t say. You may find that you have been mean to your sister as well and that small tweaks in your behavior can drastically improve your relationship.


Do you frown when your sister is speaking? Practice slightly smiling instead.
Perhaps you raise your voice a bit to speak to her. Practice using a calmer tone instead.

, Your parents are the people who probably have the greatest insight into your relationship with your sister. They are likely able to provide you with advice specific to the issues in your relationship as well as information on how to correct it.


Your parents have also certainly dealt with conflict resolution before and likely with their own siblings. See what they have done to repair or remedy their own relationships with brothers or sisters.

, If you have a friend with a sibling, talk to them about what they do to manage their relationship when it gets stressful or about nice things they do for their own siblings.


If you and your sister have mutual friends, speak to them. Similar to your parents, they have a knowledge of both of you. See if they have advice on how to improve your relationship with your sister.

, Sometimes, talking or thinking about something is not enough to provide full clarity. Take some time to journal or jot down your thoughts about your sister, good and bad, as well as your thoughts about the relationship. This can often provide you with the clarity that you need to understand how to move forward.

, When your sister is being mean to you, take a moment to calm yourself. Step away from the situation and count to ten to allow yourself to deescalate. Don’t allow yourself to get worked up or to say something mean or untrue out of anger.

, Even after all of this kindness, your sister may be still be mean to you. Continue to love her anyway. Don’t judge her for the worst things she has done just as you don’t want to be judged similarly. Instead, practice forgiveness daily.

Identify and stop the “silent treatment.” Does your brother or sister fail to respond when you ask a question or make a remark?,
Schedule a talk with no distractions.,
Use “I” statements.,
Aim for a solution.,
Speak out against sibling bullying.,
See a therapist for emotional issues associated with estrangement.",How to Connect to a Sibling Who Ignores You1," Intimidating and punishing others with silence is a common abusive tactic. On the surface, it may look like your sibling is ignoring you, but they are just purposely withholding attention in order to make a point or get you to do what they want. If this is happening to you, there are two ways you can handle it.


You can call out your sibling for the silent treatment by saying “Hey, when you give me the silent treatment it destroys my positive feelings for you and makes me want to stay away. I want us to have a supportive relationship, and do not feel supported when you do that.”
You can also try addressing the cause of the silence directly: “I can tell from your silence that you are mad at me. I want to talk about this and work through it. Please let me know when you are ready to do that.”
You can appear relaxed and positive when faced with the silent treatment. In a gentle, friendly manner, smile or sigh when the person is punishing you with silence. Do this with the hope that, by not getting the negative response they were hoping for, (e.g. you getting angry, begging, or conceding to their demands), the person will eventually get tired of the act and stop.;
, If your sibling's ignoring does not fall under the umbrella of the silent treatment, you will need to have a candid discussion with them to get to the bottom of it. Maybe your brother simply got a new girlfriend and doesn’t have as much time for you now.You’ll only know what’s going on if you ask.


Say, “Joey, I really need to talk to you about something. Do you have a minute?” Go to a place where you can speak undisturbed for a few minutes.

, When you talk to your sibling about the ignoring, you want to take ownership for your own feelings and avoid making the person feel like you are blaming them. “I” statements are a good way to do this. Such statements decrease the other person’s potential of getting defensive.A “you” statement may sound like “You keep ignoring me and it’s making me mad.” This won’t lead to a productive discussion. Instead, start off with something like “I have been feeling ignored by you lately and it hurts. We used to have such a good relationship and now we hardly ever speak. What’s going on?”

, The goal of your discussion is to figure out the underlying reason for the ignoring and, hopefully, come up with a plan to improve your relationship. Rather than dwelling for too long on the technicalities of why you are being ignored, it will be more helpful to focus on what you are going to do about it.


Learning to solve problems together is a great way to initiate a stronger connection between you and your sibling. Assuming you both want the relationship to improve, try to come up with possible ways you can decrease your feeling ignored and increase your feeling connected. It may help for each of you to try and put yourself in the other’s shoes.Possible solutions may include giving your older sibling space when they get home from school to relax before initiating conversation. Another solution may include setting aside a few minutes each day to talk about how your individual days went.

, There’s a chance your sibling is in a bad place emotionally or socially, which is causing them to purposely ignore or exclude you. If this is happening, discussing the problem with them and brainstorming the solution may not be effective. Although it’s rarely discussed, sibling bullying is a serious problem that can lead to negative consequences for the victim.If your brother or sister is using relational aggression to make you feel bad or left out, you need to tell someone. Go to your mom, dad, or a school counselor and explain what’s going on between you. You might say “My sister acts like I’m invisible. She never asks me to do things with her, and when I try to talk to her, she just ignores me. She even tells her friends not to speak to me when they come over. It’s been going on for a long time and it makes me feel really bad.”

, As hard as it is to accept, sometimes, when an adult sibling ignores you, there may not be anything you can do to fix the situation. Prolonged sibling rivalry, differing values and beliefs, or simply a major age difference can cause a sibling to sever ties with you.If you are trying desperately to connect with a sibling who has become estranged from you or the whole family, it may help to discuss your situation with a therapist.

Don't overreact.,
Make a joke out it.,
Smile.,
Relax.",How to Ignore Someone Who Is Purposely Creating Drama Online," It can be very irritating when you're in a discussion, especially a heated one, and then having some person make a rude comment or a smart remark. The main thing is don't overreact to this. All this person wants is to get a rise out of you and see you get mad. So if your on the screen, just take a deep breath, drink some water and calm down. If your having a face to face problem, then walk away from the discussion or, say well you are entitled to your own opinions. That clearly states that you don't want to fight about it.;
, If this person makes a remark about your looks, use that as a joke to show it doesn't bother you. An example would be: Other person-""You're so ugly!"" You-""You're right, I should go around wearing a Cinderella mask."" Have fun with it and show the person you're not bothered with it. Then if they are trying to be malicious, they will stop because you will become a boring target.

, If someone is trying to make you look bad in front of people, then just smile. That will accomplish many things!

, If you are always fluid and calm, then what can people do to you?

Work on chores together.,
Share a hobby.,
Be encouraging.,
Plan more family gatherings.,
Show respect for your differences.",How to Connect to a Sibling Who Ignores You2," Research has shown that when kids complete chores, it results in benefits like higher self-esteem, greater sense of responsibility and better frustration coping.Additionally, doing chores also helps you feel more connected to the family, and offers a wonderful opportunity to connect with your sibling over a shared task.


When your parents assign a task for you to do individually, offer to help your sibling so that you have a chance to talk. Say, “Hey, we can get the garage cleaned much faster if I help Toby… Is that cool with you, Toby?”

, Although you and your sibling may have huge differences in your interests and personalities, you can get closer to a sibling who ignores you by showing interest in one of their hobbies. Participating in a shared hobby — or a newly discovered hobby — offers you the chance to work with your sister or brother and create lasting memories.Suggest to your brother or sister that you would love to start playing basketball, going swimming, or learning the guitar. If they are highly experienced, you may even ask if they could teach you. This gives you the chance to work with them, and them the chance to proudly display their skills. “I really admire your commitment to learning guitar. Can you spend a few hours each week teaching me?”
Or, you can say “Hey, Rachael, I heard they are offering a new dance class at the Y. I thought it would be fun if you and I went. Are you interested?”

, A divide may exist between you and your sibling because you seem to live two separate lives with very little overlap outside of the family unit. Even if you and your sibling are completely different, you can foster a deeper bond by showing support for them.


When you know your brother has a big chemistry test coming up, offer encouragement by saying ""Hey, I know you're going to rock this test tomorrow."" Or, even better offer to call out some terms for him to define and help him study.

, If you and your sibling are adults who live in different households, it can be a challenge to find meaningful ways to connect. Use the entire family as a way to forge a deeper bond with your distant sibling. Plus, family gatherings offer a positive social experience for both adults and children.Make the suggestion that you would like to start having Sunday dinners together. Say, ""Hey, everyone... I was thinking that it would be nice if we started eating dinner together on Sundays. I miss you guys and I want us to spend more time together.""
Then, use this opportunity to connect with the sibling who is ignoring you. You might suggest ""Hey, Tom, why don't you join me in setting the table,"" in order to strike up a conversation with your sibling.

, Your sibling will have a deeper respect for you if you demonstrate that you respect them. Respect doesn’t mean that you have to agree with your sister or brother on every subject, or suck up to them. Instead, it means showing consideration for their feelings, privacy, personal space, interests, and beliefs.For example, if you tease your older sister about being a vegetarian, she’ll view you as immature or uninformed and persist to ignore you. If you show respect for her choice by asking more information or trying to understand her perspective, she may be less inclined to ignore you.

Initiate conversation around their interests.,
Check in.,
Practice active listening.,
Disagree respectfully.,
Exercise patience.",How to Connect to a Sibling Who Ignores You3," One of the best ways to engage in conversation with another person is by showing genuine interest in them. How do you do that? You can stimulate conversation with others by talking about the things they like to talk about. People like to talk about themselves and their interests, so showing curiosity can get your sibling talking and deepen your bond.For example, if your brother is obsessed with Doctor Who, you might ask, “So, what’s you all-time favorite episode, and why?” Using an open-ended question format ensures that your sibling won’t just give a one-word reply.
Plus, allowing your sibling to share more about something they’re passionate about makes them feel good about themselves and about you.

, Sometimes silence is about not knowing how to bring up hurt feeling or difficult topics, or fear of being overwhelmed by such conversations and the emotions that come with them. If you can break down that barrier by checking in, it can help facilitate communication and stop silence.

Try asking your sibling: “Is everything ok? You seem really quite today.”

, The best listener is an active one. That is, someone who listens to understand rather than listening to reply. When you attempt to engage in conversation with your sibling, you want to make sure that they have your full attention. Follow the strategies for active listening and watch how communication between the two of you starts to improve.


Active listening involves using body language and verbal cues to improve the communication process. Body language includes having an open and relaxed posture (e.g. arms and legs uncrossed), making occasional eye contact, turning towards your sibling, and giving visual cues such as nodding or smiling when appropriate.
The verbal components of active listening include:


Paraphrasing, or restating the message in a different way (e.g. Original message: “He told me I was a loser in front of everyone, so I ran to the nearest restroom. I cried for hours…” Paraphrase: “It sounds like you were very upset.”).

Clarifying, or bringing greater understanding to vague aspects of the message (e.g. “Let me see if I heard you correctly. You’re saying…”)

Showing empathy, or addressing the speaker’s emotional experience (e.g. “I get the sense that you felt humiliated when he said that in public.”)



, No matter how much you and your sibling have in common there will come a time when you disagree with one another. Disagreement does not have to be a bad thing. In fact, it can be an opportunity to learn more about each other and become more open-minded. Here’s how to disagree politely.Focus on the action or concept rather than disagreeing with the person as a whole. (Instead of saying ""You're a jerk,"" try ""I was really hurt by what you said."")
Use “I” statements to express how you feel.
Be an active listener when it’s time for the other person to talk.
Avoid putting down the other person’s opinions or beliefs (e.g. “That’s silly!”)
Take a deep breath. If you find yourself getting angry, take a few moments to return to a calm state.

, If your sibling has been ignoring you, you may feel desperate to re-establish or build a connection with them; however, you should allow your bond to deepen at its own pace. Forcing your sibling may seem inauthentic, so give them time to warm up to having a connection with you.


As the relationship gradually deepens, be sure to celebrate the minor successes that you notice. For example, if your sister starts to stop by your room and chat for a few minutes after swim practice, pat yourself on the back. You two may not be staying up gossiping about your crushes just yet, but at least you’re making progress.

Let go of any rumors.,
Avoid getting involved.,
Ignore people whom make fun of others.,
Keep your private life private!,
Identify your friends.,
Accept other people's opinions.",How to Deal With Drama at School," No one is going to remember rumors and gossip in a few years. It should not matter if you kissed the geekiest person in school. It is your business and no one else. Let everyone that asks know you did, and then they'll get over it.


Attempting to hide something you did will make it worse. If you show that you don't care, the person who is questioning you will actually subconsciously feel stupid and respect you more. (This happens because they realize how immature they are being for trying to stir up drama - even if they don't admit it.);
, If you or your friends are fighting over something, just don't get involved. Tell them both you value your friendships, but you are not a vigilante. If anything, try to help them work it out through logic. But, if you are going to do this, know your limitations. Not everyone is able to get involved in an argument without choosing a side or making it worse.

, They are looking for attention, and giving comebacks or engaging in ""Facebook Wars"" is just going to give them exactly what they want. If you must say something, make your point and move on.

, People will always talk. Don't give them anything to talk about, don't discuss your sex life, your grades, and your family life to people you don't know if you can trust. This will only lead to trouble.

, This is a huge struggle for most teenagers. If you get a feeling that someone's 'friendship' isn't good for you, you're probably right. Everyone has faults, but some people purely enjoy stirring up drama., Don't change yourself because of their opinions - be who you want to be. It's hard to do, but it's worth it and will bring you more happiness in the end.

Spend time with each other and create memories that will strengthen your bond. Your sibling relationships will last a lifetime and your kindness will pay off in the long run.Do activities that help your siblings become better people. Help them study, read together, give them tips before an interview, find them a job at your workplace.
You can insist on your need for having time to yourself or for spending with your friends. Be clear that you are not rejecting or purposefully excluding your sibling. Say: “I need to have a private conversation with my friend today. Next time, I’ll invite you to join.”
It can be difficult to develop relationships with step-siblings. Blending two different family experiences takes time. Be patient as everyone will need a different amount of time to grow comfortable with the new family dynamic.;
, It can be tempting to protect your things from the potential wear and damage that your siblings might inflict. Not only are material possessions less valuable than strong relationships, those possessions can help you share your tastes and interests and develop a sense of mutual trust and friendship.


Maintain boundaries. If your sibling wants to borrow something that you need to use, like a car that you rely on daily, explain your reason for saying no. Make clear that you will not change your decision.
Also, make sure that you ask before you borrow something that belongs to one of your siblings. This will help to foster respect between you.

, Everyone wants to receive clear confirmation of the fact that they are liked and valued. The best way to do this will depend on your family dynamic and how you personally express affection. You might share hugs, high-fives, or gifts. Whatever way your family shows affection, regularly include your siblings. Every expression of affection counts for establishing a good relationship.


Compliment your siblings. Make it a daily point to compliment your siblings. Even if you cannot spend significant time with your siblings, you can cultivate a strong relationship by expressing your admiration for them.
You can also show affection through gratitude and encouragement. For example, saying ""thank you"" to your siblings can be helpful, even if you are only acknowledging little things. You can also encourage your siblings, such as by saying ""Great job!"" after a watching a sibling participate in a sporting event or perform in a school play.

, Listening is a good way to develop a pattern of being nice to your siblings. Listening well can be a difficult art form: allow your sibling to explain an idea fully, interject only to ask clarifying questions or to show that you understand what they are feeling, and occasionally summarize what they have said. Resist the urge to give advice until you they ask for it. Maintain eye contact. Your siblings will see your patient listening as kindness.A great way to show that you are actively listening is to ask questions that will encourage your sibling to clarify or elaborate: “How did that make you feel?” “Why did you make that choice?” “What do you plan to do about that?”

, Let friends and classmates know that you are proud of your siblings. When needed, defend your sibling against rumors and be supportive. Tell people that you respect and love your sibling and make clear that you will not tolerate anyone putting them down. Whether they are there to witness this, or hear about it later, your siblings will be happy to know that they do not face challenges alone.


When you have the chance, share some praise for your sibling’s talents: “My brother has a great sense of style that inspires me.” “My sister is great at math, she helped me understand my algebra homework.” “My sister gave me great advice for surviving school, she really understands how people interact.”

, Emotions are often amplified during an argument. Acknowledge your emotions but engage arguments calmly. Rather than focus on fully expressing how you feel, focus on the source of the conflict. When your sibling says something hurtful, tell them that you are not going to respond to insults.


Take deep breaths. This can help you regain a sense of perspective when you feel yourself losing control of your emotions. Inhale and exhale deeply and count as you do it. You will be able to engage an argument better as you will be able to step out of the fight or flight pattern of confrontation.Repeat reassuring phrases. Give kind and measured responses to aggressive accusations until your sibling understands that you are going to remain calm regardless of what they say. Have a mantra, like “Nice words or no words” to signal to your siblings that nasty statements are unhelpful. Tell them: “I understand that you’re hurt, and I want to address this once we can talk calmly about it.”

, Arguments can grow worse if you and your sibling do not understand the true source of conflict. You can turn an argument into a productive discussion by taking time to make sure that both parties specify what they want to resolve or accomplish.Ask your sibling “what do you want me to know,” or “what do you think is the most important issue to talk about?” After you listen, tell them your answer to the same questions.

, Not only will needless fights waste time, they can undermine your strategies for dealing with significant issues. Be the stronger person and walk away from taunts, teasing, and pressuring tactics. Remind yourself that childish behavior is best met by ignoring it or deflecting the topic. By not responding, you will encourage your sibling to avoid petty arguments in the future.


Be polite when you confront your sibling. For example, if a sibling is talking to you while you are trying to pay attention to a TV program, say “It's rude to talk while I’m watching TV. I’ll talk with you when the program is over.” Do not start an argument by addressing them angrily.
If your sibling teases you or tries to get a negative reaction from you, say matter-of-factly that that you're hurt by their behavior and disappointed that they don't treat you with the respect that you deserve. Say “I'll come back for a friendly and mature discussion when you are ready.”

, No matter how close you are with your siblings, some issues should be off limits. If your sibling criticizes you about something that is not their business, clearly tell them that “You have crossed a line, this is not your business and I won’t discuss it with you.”


Siblings know you how to get a reaction from you since they shared your formative experiences. If they cross a boundary, tell them this immediately. Not everyone understands personal boundaries the same way, so help them respect your limits by articulating them., Even when emotions are raw, your siblings usually don't mean to hurt your feelings. In many cases, their desires may lead them to overlook your needs. They may be surprised by how an argument impacts you, so approach arguments with the assumption that respect can be restored through open dialogue.


Vocalize your trust in order to turn arguments into productive discussions: “I don’t know if you realize how hurtful that statement is.” “I think that you said that to hurt me, but I also think that you don’t really mean it.”

, Adult sibling relationships offer support and understanding that outlasts many friendships and marriages. These relationships are also linked to greater life satisfaction. The work that you do now to get along with siblings will help you secure important support throughout your life.Caring for aging parents is a significant challenge that overwhelms many adults. Adult siblings will be able to offer unique support as you care for your aging parents. They share your formative experiences, understand your parents’ needs, and they are as personally invested in this difficult task as you are. Years of being nice will pay off as you face this challenge together.
As important as the bond between siblings is, it does not always lead to supportive relationships. It you are estranged from your siblings, it is important to realize that you are not alone in this., It can be difficult to maintain relationships, especially with siblings, as you grow up and move on to new stages of your life. Make a point to spend time together periodically so that you continue to share new experiences. Checking in on your adult siblings is one of the clearest ways to be nice to them.


If you live in the same area, you can alternate hosting dinner for each other’s family. If you live in different cities, you can arrange to visit your parents at the same time or plan a vacation together.
Call regularly. You do not need to speak for a long time to maintain your relationship. You should, however, speak often enough that you will all know what is happening in each other’s lives.

, No matter how many people you meet, no one will share quite the same experiences that you have shared with your siblings. Even if you do not feel as close to your siblings as you do to your friends, they share a perspective with you that others will not be able to replicate.


Even contentious sibling relationships can grow into a source of great support. It is possible the childhood rivalries may resurface between adults, but adulthood will provide opportunities develop a more equitable friendship."

Demand cessation.",How to Handle Drama in Middle School," If you really want to avoid drama, stay away from it in the first place! Start by distancing yourself from people you know are gossipers or who tend to have drama following them everywhere. Don't push away any real friends, but try to change the subject when gossiping comes up. If you get the reputation of being a gossiper, people will start to gossip about you. It's a never ending cycle, really.;
, We all know that one kid who went to the office for something minor, and as the story spread it became more and more complicated and their crime increased. If you don't want people whispering that you were in the principals office and making a huge story about that fist fight you had, don't go to the office in the first place!

, Don't stop being you, but there's a thin line between self confidence and arrogance. Here's an example: let's say you accidentally ran into someone in the hall and they dropped their stuff. No big deal right? By apologizing and helping them pick up their stuff, you're steering clear of gossipers who could quickly change the story. Let's say you didn't help them but continued to class. This story could quickly turn into: You book checked someone in the hall and ran off so they were late to class. By doing the right thing, you've stopped a nasty rumor about yourself.

, This section is all about how to deal with it.

, If there is a rumor going around about you, stop it in its tracks. Do not go up one table in the cafeteria and yell out: ""The rumor about me is a lie!"". Try a more subtle approach. If someone mentions it while talking to you, just laugh and explain what actually happened instead of punching them in the face like you really want to. They will explain to the next person that brings it up around them, and so on. Don't force it into the conversation, but don't just sit there and do nothing either. If you explain what happened to your friends, they will stick up for you.

, What if your friends are the problem? Maybe they started something, or a rumor pushed you apart. Try to work it out first. If you two really can't come to agreement about something, distance yourself for a bit. This will give both of you time to cool down and think about what happened. When you see them at school, act friendly but try not to engage in a full conversation until something is worked out. This conversation could turn into accusations very quickly. Try talking with a teacher or parent, and, if you must, another friend. Make sure this friend will not increase the drama and tension between you and the other friend fighting.

, If someone makes fun of what you are wearing, don't take it personally, they are just trying to hurt your feelings, do not be rude just say ""you are not wearing them, I am,"" then just walk off. Do not say it rudely, say it with confidence.

, If someone calls you names like loser, dork, Muppet, brat, etc, just do not respond and act like you don't care.

, It will show that you are confident and strong.

, If they are your real friends and not fakers, they will really help with all the drama and be there for you.

, Tell whoever put you in a bad mood to just back off and leave you alone! Hopefully they eventually apologize

, If the drama increases to the point of a fight, here's what to do. First, out your hands up with your palms open and out, the universal sign of stop. If a teacher or witness sees this, it looks better then you two with your fists raised at each other, and you look like the victim that you are. If punches start to get thrown, don't fight back. Try blocking with your arms that are raised in the air.

Don't expect an overnight friendship.,
Communicate your expectations.,
Try to be impartial.,
Recognize the stepparent’s challenges.,
Let your stepparent know if you are uncomfortable.,
Let your biological parent(s) help.",How to Deal with Step Parents and Step Siblings1," You won’t immediately become close with a stepparent, and that is okay. In fact, his or her relationship with you will never be the same as with your biological parents. If a stepparent is coming on too strong, let him know know you just want to take it easy for a while. There is nothing wrong with letting a relationship develop naturally over time., Your stepparent(s) have a ""job"" in the family and in your life. They won’t have the same role in your life as your biological parents, but they will still be around. Tell them what you want them to do for you, and what you don’t want them to do. Don’t approach them intending to tell them how they’ve upset you, but to establish a line of communication.


For example, try telling them if you would like their help with doing your schoolwork.
You also might tell them that you would rather your biological parents give you relationship advice.

, When conflicts arise, children are more likely to agree with their biological parent than their stepparent.Recognize this and try to view her words and actions without factoring in your relationship with her. She will appreciate you siding with her on an issue even though you may not have come to appreciate her yet.


If you find yourself upset at something she says, take a step back and think about it. If your biological parent had said it, would you still be upset?
Try to appreciate her contributions to the family as you would your biological parent. For example, if she organizes a barbecue, try to enjoy it as you would your mom or dad's event.
Most importantly, try to see her side in family disputes. Sometimes, you may be what holds the family and stepfamily together.

, You may not like that your parent remarried, but the stepparent has an uphill battle winning over the whole family. Give him time to get used to being around new children. Being understanding with him should help reduce the amount he gets frustrated with their new family.

, It is common for relationships between a stepparent and a stepchild to suffer from gender confusion. For example, a stepfather may be confused about whether it’s appropriate to hug a stepdaughter the same way as a biological daughter. If he is being too physically affectionate for your comfort, let him know.This should be communicated to him in a caring way. For example, you might say: ""I know you just want to be close to me and I appreciate that, but I'm not ready for you to hug me tight yet. I'll let you know when I am.""

, If you are less laid-back than your siblings, you may have trouble adjusting to the new stepparent. Let your parents know that you want the family to be happy, but want them to help you adjust. Communicating that you want to do your best to get to know your stepparent will improve your relationship with your biological and stepparents.


For example, you could tell them: ""I'm trying to get used to this new family situation, but transitions can be really hard for me. Can you help me take this new father-son dynamic slow for a while and let it develop?"" This doesn't put them in the driver's seat, but it does put them in the passenger's seat, helping you navigate the waters.

See it as a ""blended family."",
Look for common interests.,
Accept that you have different privileges.,
Stay positive with your step siblings.,
Be willing to share.",How to Deal with Step Parents and Step Siblings2," Your new step-siblings aren’t an addition to your family, nor are they entirely separate. Rather, you have blended two families. They are different from friends, since you interact with each other in the home, but you don’t need to see them in the same light as your original nuclear family., It will be a big step forward if you can find one or two things both you and your step sibling(s) enjoy. You don’t have to want to spend every minute together, but inviting them over to watch a football game, for example, can go a long way. Making an effort to get along with your step sibling(s) will also improve your relationship with your new stepparent.


You could also connect by trying something you know your step-sibling likes. For example, if he enjoys building and playing with remote control cars, ask if you can join some time. This will show that you're putting forth an effort to be a part of his life, rather than only the other way around.

, One source of conflict with a new step-siblings may be that they are allowed to do different things, such as stay up past 10pm. You can’t change their household rules, and you can’t force your biological parents to give you the same privileges. If one of their privileges really bothers you, let your biological parent know. He may be able to come up with a compromise for you.If it is an age-related difference, such as a later bedtime, you may be allowed the same privileges when you're your step-sibling's age.
If it is simply a parenting difference, like using a parent's car to see friends, talk to your biological parent. He may not be prepared to give you that privilege, but telling him the difference in privileges bothers you should be a sign to him that you aren't entirely satisfied with the way things currently are.

, If your step sibling(s) do something differently than you, don't criticize or comment. You don’t have to be best friends with them, but you will have to interact with them whether you get along or not. Accept their customs. If they criticize you, try to keep your cool. Explain why you do something the way you do, and accept that they still may not respect you.

, If your new stepparent also has children, especially if they are younger than you, it is important to share. Let them know what they aren't allowed to touch. Also, keep things you wouldn't like them to be looking at somewhere where they are less likely to find it.


For example, you could invite your step siblings to your birthday party. Introducing them to your friends is a good way to share your life with them.

Avoid gossip and behind-the-back insults.,
Keep money out of the equation.,
Don't be rude.,
Ask for some alone time with your biological family.,
Accept that your stepparent is different.",How to Deal with Step Parents and Step Siblings3," You may notice quirky or even unfriendly behaviors in your new step family, but it's best to keep your comments to yourself. Focus on their positives instead. You may think your biological family agrees with your comments, but it may make them uncomfortable. They may be trying to adjust to this new life, and you are getting in the way., Asking for a little spending cash can be a recipe for disaster. Step parents should take steps to treat step children like their own, but they should also respect their biological parent's rules.Stepchildren shouldn't see a new stepparent as an extra well of cash. They are not your personal bank, so don't put tension on the relationship by trying to make a withdrawal.

, Do not expect your stepparent to allow you to act out simply because he or she is not your biological parent. You may be upset about your new stepparent or step siblings, and that's okay, but don't use it as an excuse to be outright rude. Remember that this is a struggle for them, too, and they still deserve to be treated with basic human respect.

, It may seem like the best way to form new bonds is by trying hard all the time. This is not necessarily true. Ask your biological parent if you can do something just the two of you. You shouldn't try to exclude your stepfamily from every single event, but it's good for you to get some one-on-one time with your biological family, too.

, Expect your stepparent to have different behaviors and reactions reactions than your biological parent. Know that your stepmom might not be cool with something your biological mom allows you to do. Don't make assumptions about how your stepparent will behave or react.

Even if you like your stepparent, you may still struggle with feeling like your other parent is being replaced.Especially if your other parent has died, it can be difficult to accept someone new coming in to your family. No one can replace your other parent, and just because you like your stepparent doesn’t mean your other parent has been replaced or that you care about your parent any less.Ask yourself whether you genuinely don’t like your stepparent, or if it has more to do with not liking that your parent has remarried.It’s okay to admit that you like your stepparent while still loving both of your parents. Accepting and liking your stepparent doesn't mean you love your biological parents any less.

, You may miss spending time with your parent, or miss having special things that you and your parent did together. Now those times may be gone with the entrance of a stepparent.

Some things will be great, while others may be unpleasant. It’s okay to feel confused on how to feel, or to have mixed feelings about your stepparent. You might love some things your stepparent does, then hate other things. Know that while you will experience difficulties, it’s unlikely they will last forever., When you explain your side calmly, this helps your stepparent to see you as mature and not a child.

, Listening shows that you respect the other person and care about what is being said. Don’t try to think about what to say next or cut off your stepparent in the middle of a sentence. Allow your stepparent to talk, and genuinely listen.Even if you really want to say something, wait for your stepparent to finish speaking, then talk.

, When someone accuses you of something, it really hurts. Don’t use name-calling and don’t intentionally say something you know is hurtful to your stepparent. It may feel good to say “You’re not my real parent!”, but this can be really hurtful. Words can do a lot of damage and can cause a lot of pain.A fight is not an appropriate time for sarcasm.
Instead of saying, “I can’t believe you’re so stupid, how can you say that?” consider saying “I disagree with you and feel misunderstood.”

, Recognize that you’re not the only person struggling. It can be hard to be a stepparent and enter into a new family and have a new role as “stepparent.” Realize that the changes aren’t new to just you, but the are new to your stepparent, too.

Expect the unexpected.,
Make sure your parents have indicated their preferences for care.,
Put a sibling agreement in writing.,
Put your parents’ well-being first.,
Hire a family counselor or an elder mediator.",How to Resolve Disputes Between Siblings About Elderly Parent Care1," Old conflicts from childhood can have a way of reappearing when you and your siblings start taking care of your parents, but it is just as likely that this major change will bring about new dynamics between you and your siblings. Don't assume that just because you and your sister fought as children you won't be able to work together to care for your children. Or maybe you will have some heated disagreements with the sibling you were always closest to. A parent's illness and impending death brings about unpredictable results, and you can't know how anyone (including you) will react.


Accept your siblings for who they are, and you’ll have a better starting point for resolving conflicts and improving your relationships.You and your family are entering unchartered territory, and things may shift when your parents become ill or pass away. How you deal with illness and death may change drastically in the time between when one parent passes and when the next passes.;
, It can be practical for your parents to complete documents to indicate which of their children will hold the power of attorney and who will hold the power of guardianship if they become incapacitated. Having these questions settled ahead of time can prevent a lot of sibling conflicts before they begin.For example, you might sit down with your parent as a part of a proactive health plan and say, ""Mom, have you thought about who you would like to make decisions on your behalf if you ever become incapacitated, and what your wishes would be? I think we should talk about this early on, so that your wishes are followed in the event it ever happens.""
Respect your parents’ choices, even if you don’t agree with them. If your parent asks you to fulfill a role that you don't think you could handle (for instance, if they would want you to take them off life support if they are brain dead, but your religious or moral beliefs conflict with this), then tell your parents so they can assign that role to another sibling.
Remember that no one expects these things to happen, and it may be un pleasant to talk about, but it is necessary and can save you a great deal of strife later on.

, You can prevent disagreements down the line by establishing expectations and allotting tasks ahead of time. Sit down with your siblings and decide who should be the primary caregiver, how you will handle expenses, and where your parents will live. Put this information in a document that all of you can reference.If you can, make your sibling agreement while your parents are still in good health, not when you have emotionally-fraught decisions hanging over your family.
A mediator can help you write your sibling agreement if you and your siblings have a hard time negotiating with each other.

, Remember that the most important part of elder care is keeping your parents as healthy, safe, and happy as possible. Fighting with your siblings distracts you from this task and stresses your parents out, too. You can’t control what your siblings do, but you can take the high road to avoid conflict as much as possible.There are some situations when you shouldn’t look the other way for the sake of preventing conflict. If you think that one of your siblings may be coercing or stealing from an elderly parent, contact your local Adult Protective Services.

, If you and your siblings cannot get along, it may be a good idea to get a third party involved. Family counseling can help you address relationship problems and learn to cooperate better. If counseling is not an option, an elder mediator can help you and your siblings reach agreements about your parents’ care.If your parent's have a family attorney overseeing their affairs, this individual can probably refer you to other professionals with the experience needed to help you resolve any disagreements in a peaceful manner.

Assign tasks based on people’s abilities.,
Find ways for distant siblings to help out.,
Avoid trying to divide tasks equally.,
Let your siblings know if you need more help.",How to Resolve Disputes Between Siblings About Elderly Parent Care2," Talk with your siblings to decide who should take on which responsibilities. Split up tasks based on what your siblings are good at or what they can do easily.For instance, if your sister is an accountant, maybe she should be in charge of your parents’ finances.
Or, if one sibling is having an exceptionally difficult time dealing with the parent's illness, do not assign them the role of healthcare power of attorney.

, Just because one sibling lives far away doesn’t mean they can’t contribute. Perhaps they can chip in extra money towards your parents’ care, find ways to visit more frequently, or call their parents several times a week.Avoid making decisions about your parents’ care without talking to far-flung siblings first. They may want to help just as much as you do and feel upset if you leave them out.
Remember that this new situation means that roles and dynamics may be changing, so don't assume that a sibling who was not involved with the family in the past won't want to be very involved now.

, It will probably never be possible for you and your siblings to split elder care tasks equally, especially if you have different income levels or live in different locations. Accept that one of you may end up doing a bit more work than the others, and focus on finding ways for each sibling to contribute to the best of their ability., Avoid assuming that you shouldn’t have to ask your siblings to help you out more. They may not realize you’re feeling overwhelmed unless you tell them so. Instead of letting your resentment build, tell your siblings what kind of help you need.Ask for help in concrete terms. Say something like, “Can you start picking up groceries for Mom every week? I’m having a hard time fitting it in with my other errands.”

Schedule regular discussions with your siblings.,
Meet in person if possible.,
Include your parents in your discussions.,
Check in regularly.",How to Resolve Disputes Between Siblings About Elderly Parent Care3," Meet with your siblings as early as possible to discuss how you will care for your parents. In your family discussions, focus on keeping everyone up-to-date on your parents’ current health and their wishes for their care in the future.It’s best to start talking about elder care options before your parents have a health crisis or become otherwise unable to take care of themselves. This may not happen, of course, but it is a proactive way to handle caring for an aging parent.

, Getting together in person will help all your siblings feel involved in your parents’ care, if they are not closely involved in care-taking. Try to schedule your family meetings on long weekends or at other times when everyone can be present. If it’s not possible for all your siblings to be at a meeting, schedule a conference call so that you can still talk face-to-face., If your parents are still of sound mind, have them come to your family meetings and give their input. Including your parents in the decision-making process will ensure they get the kind of care they want, and it can head off some sibling disagreements before they develop.As a rule-of-thumb, it may be best to have a pre-discussion to analyze options and hash out disagreements before the parents enter the conversation. Disagreement between siblings may cause anxiety or frustration in elderly parents. What's more, they may be overwhelmed by too many options. Narrowing down the choices between you beforehand can help the discussion go more smoothly.
Use your judgment about when to make decisions without your parents’ input. Avoid involving them in conversations that might upset them. For instance, if you and your siblings think your father shouldn’t drive anymore, it’s probably best to discuss the issue without him at first.

, Elder care is an ongoing process, so it’s important that everyone is kept updated. Schedule regular meetings, either in person or via conference call, to stay in touch with any caretakers and stay informed about your parents’ health and needs.Avoid leaving some siblings out of the loop about your parents’ care, even if they live far away or don't seem very interested. This is a whole-family process, and leaving them out can lead to resentment and hurt.

If all else fails, tell the kids how you feel.",How to Win over Children As a Stepmother," If she walked out on her family for another person, you probably won't need to deal with the children missing their original mother or wishing she was there. But they might be used to having their remaining parent all to themselves, in which case they could become jealous of you. On the other hand, if she died, (especially recently) you may have a hard time supporting and making allowances for the kids in their grief, and they may feel their parent is being disloyal to her memory. Basically, find out:



Why she is no longer with their other parent. Did she leave of her own accord or was it a mutual decision between the two parents or even the whole family? This will change their behaviour to you because they may feel you have no right to be taking over from their ""rightful"" mother in some situations. If she died, they may feel their other parent is being unfaithful to her memory.

How long their parents have been separated. If they're still trying to accept the fact that their parents are divorced, or their mother has just died, throwing a new parent into the mix will just confuse and hurt them even more. But if they're used to the situation, they'll be much more accepting and may even be glad you're making their parent happy.

What their current relationship with their mother is (if she's alive). Do they still see each other? Do they live together? Do they dislike her? The stronger their current relationship, the more they will feel they would rather have her back, and they may be trying to get their parents back together (younger children, who can't understand that their parents don't love each other anymore, often try to do this). Of course, you should never try to weaken their relationship with their mother.;
, Kids will find a ""step-girlfriend"" much easier to deal with than a ""step-mother"", even though there is very little difference. Once they accept your relationship with their other parent, marriage will seem much more acceptable to them and they may even welcome it, if they like you.

, Don't make children feel uncomfortable - especially at the beginning of the relationship - with extensive displays of affection. A quick peck is fine; a prolonged, full-frontal make-out session is not.

, Try to take an interest in their personalities, and what they have to tell you - remember what they say to you and make references to it later to make it clear you really listen to them. Try going for days out with them, such as the cinema or theme park, when your partner can't make it. If you like them for themselves, chances are they'll like you more.

, If the children really want a dog, and their parent is opposed, but you feel he is in the wrong, say so . Don't agree with them just to make them like you, but say what you think and support them when you feel they have a point. Don't start big arguments over small things, and don't act as if you are their parent and have the right to choose for them against your partner's will, but state your opinion and back the kids up.

, Learn about them from your partner beforehand or just listen to what they say and act on it. For instance, if one of them is just crazy about animals and you're a vet, you could make their day by offering to show them some of the animals, or if you have a pet, invite them over just to see it and play with it. Have conversations about things that interest both of you.

, This is very important, so they don't feel they're being deprived of either of them. Let them do things alone with your partner while you catch up with old friends; it'll work out better for everybody.

, Don't try to win their pity or make them feel bad, but tell them that you love their parent very much, you want to make sure everyone is happy, you're not trying to change anything... say what you think. Ask them if anything you do gets on their nerves, and act on it.

It can feel like a stranger is imposing themselves into your home, but they have been invited., It can be really hard to accept a new step parents into your life because the first thing you think of is often about how they seem to be trying to take your regular parent's place. Realise that they are probably already very wary of taking any such role and want you to know that your parents come first, and they're willing to be friends, not replacements.


Try to be more open and respectful to your step parents and you'll find that this is a great way to start off the relationship.

, Building a new relationship takes time and work, so don’t put too much pressure on yourself to be instantly close with a new stepparent. You have to give it some time and some space for a relationship to develop. You might not get on great to start with, and everyone will be a bit anxious about it all, so try to stay relaxed and avoid confrontations., While it's important to be fairly relaxed about the new relationship at the start, you should always make the effort to be polite and civil to each other. It’s much harder to develop a good relationship if you start with disrespect and rudeness.Simple things can make a big difference in these early getting to you know you stages.


Just think, if you met a stranger and they were rude to you, you probably wouldn’t want to spend time with him or be friends.

Give your stepchildren time.,
Do not expect to occupy the role of mother.,
Set some boundaries.,
Create a judgement-free environment.,
Stick to your word.,
Don’t take things too personally.,
Spend time alone with your stepchildren.,
Respect family traditions while creating new ones.,
Attend your stepchildren’s events or activities.,
Don’t play favorites.,

Make sure your partner is involved in disciplining the kids.,
Never speak badly about your partner’s ex.,
Establish a good relationship with your partner’s ex, if possible.,
Take time to recharge.,
Nurture your relationship with your partner.,
Talk to a therapist if you need to.",How to Be a Good Step Mom," Women are more likely than men to feel responsible for making their stepfamilies perfect. However, remember that most stepchildren will need time to adjust. Some may be open from the start, while others may be more reluctant to engage.Recognize that the transition is hard for them. Be patient. It may take two years or longer for some children to feel comfortable.Shy children and older children, especially teens, may take longer to open up to you.;
, While your role may evolve into a “motherly” one as time goes on, do not expect this from the start. Sometimes, stepparents take on more of a mentorship role, particularly for teens.What matters is that the relationship is healthy and satisfying for stepparent and stepchild.

, Children need rules. While you might be tempted to forgo all rules in attempt to win over your stepchildren, this will only create more problems. Be firm, but kind, sort of like a camp counselor. You shouldn’t be the primary disciplinarian, which could strain an already sensitive relationship. Let your partner take on that role.Say something like, “In our house, we don’t do that.”
Speak calmly and avoid screaming.

, Let your stepchildren know that they can communicate honestly and openly with you without fear of judgement. This will help strengthen your relationship.Say something like, “I care about you, and I want you to tell me how you feel.”
Set an example by communicating openly as well. You might say, “When you don’t listen to me, it makes me feel like you don’t value my opinion, and that hurts.”

, Divorce can make children wary of trusting the adults in their lives. Your stepchildren will need to feel safe and secure. Keep your promises and always be supportive. , Your stepchildren will likely have a hard time adjusting, and their loyalties may be divided. While you shouldn’t put up with rudeness, don’t expect gratitude or affection right away. All that may come later. In the meantime, continue doing your best and try to be patient., Get to know your stepchildren by spending one-on-one time with each child. Ask them about their day, their interests, or their hobbies. Show you value them and their ideas by listening attentively.If you live with your stepchildren, try to find some one-on-one time every day. You might want to start a project together, like a rock collection or a craft.
If you do not live with your stepchildren, try playing online games together, or taking them to their favorite store or restaurant.

, Family traditions are important, and you should respect those that were in place before your arrival. However, you shouldn’t be afraid to create new ones. Family routines and rituals can be effective tools for bonding. Create at least one new family ritual. Choose something everyone in the family can enjoy.You might plan a weekly trip to the beach, a game night, or bi-weekly family dinners.

, Maybe one stepchild has a soccer game, and another is starring in the school play. Attend these activities with enthusiasm—it will show you care., If you have biological children, be certain not to show favoritism. Do your best to show that you value each child, biological or step.At the same time, beware of overcompensating by showing more affection to your stepchildren than to your biological children. Try to spend one-on-one time with your biological children each day.

, Talk to your partner so you can come to a clear understanding of your role in the family. Talk about what you expect from each other in terms of your own marriage and your relationships with the children.Ask about any boundaries your partner’s ex wants you to maintain with the children. This is especially important for stepmothers, who are generally more involved in childcare than stepfathers.Respecting boundaries will create a happier, more functional household.

, Your partner may feel guilty about the divorce, and ease up on disciplining the children as a result. However, acting as the sole disciplinarian can cause the children to resent you. Make sure you take turns enforcing the rules.You might tell your partner, “I need you to help me out with disciplining the kids. It’s hard for me to work on bonding with them when I’m the only one enforcing the rules.”
Make a concrete plan with your partner. Say, “Today, I’ll tell the kids to make their beds. Next time they forget, it’s your turn.”

, Avoid saying negative things about your partner’s ex, and make sure your partner does the same. Continued fighting after a divorce can hurt the children., Stepchildren are often resistant to developing a relationship with their stepmothers because they don’t want to be disloyal. Your stepchild might view their resistance as an act of solidarity with your partner’s ex. Establishing a cordial relationship with your partner’s ex can remove this barrier, allowing you to connect better with your stepchildren.Call your partner’s ex and try to set up a time to meet.
Be open to what your partner’s ex has to say, and try not to get defensive.

, Making a stepfamily work can be an extremely challenging process. You won’t be able to help the family to the best of your ability if you are exhausted and depleted. Set aside a little time for yourself each day, and reach out to friends for support if you need it., While you may find yourself putting nearly all your energy into building a relationship with your stepchildren, it is important that you don’t neglect your marriage. After all, you and your partner should model a healthy relationship for the children. When your relationship is strong, everyone benefits.Set aside time during the week to go to dinner, lunch, or coffee without the children.
Avoid arguing in front of the children. Make sure your are on the same page and present a unified front.

, Step families are complicated, and you shouldn’t blame yourself for familial hardships. If you feel your relationship with your stepchildren is especially strained, consider trying family therapy."
"
Have some family meetings.,
Talk to your parent.,
Speak to your stepparent.",How to Deal with Step Parents2," It can useful to talk through things when the whole family is present, so everyone can contribute and everybody can hear from each other. If you have an issue you want to talk about, don’t be aggressive, but stay calm and try to explain yourself as clearly as possible. Family meetings can be useful for discussing things you will all do together, such as holidays., If you are feeling alone and left-out, don’t be afraid to talk to your parent about the situation. But, remember that they care deeply about your stepparent and will want to spend time with her as well as you. Try to see things from their point of view and be understanding and generous. If there are problems, try to work them out together.Your parent can talk to the stepparent about the matter in his or her own way, to help smooth things out too.
Be sensitive and moderate, say something like 'I'm not really feeling happy with how things are going, and I am hoping we can sort things out together'.
Stress that you are looking for ways to improve things: 'What do you think I can do to feel happier and more comfortable?'
Don't blame everything on your stepparent, saying things like 'I hate her!', 'She completely resents me!'
An understanding and less confrontational approach will be more successful and gain more sympathy from your parent. If you say something like 'I know you really love her, and I want you to be happy, but I feel left out', your parent will talk with your stepparent about how to address this.

, Keeping an open line of communication with your stepparent is important in helping you get used to each other and understanding where you are each coming from. You may not feel comfortable talking about serious things with them for a while, but don’t retreat and just ignore them altogether.


Just having some idle chit-chat can help you feel more comfortable together.
Tell her how your day was, and return the favour asking 'how was work today?'
If you talk to your stepparent, it's better to avoid starting your sentences with 'you', which can direct the blame, but rather say 'I feel' or 'I think'.Listen carefully to your stepparent's response and think about it.

"
"
Make an effort to connect.,
Plan a shared activity.,
Create new family routines and rituals.,
Choose a name that reflects fondness rather than step-something.",How to Deal with Step Parents3," The first step to the process of improving your feelings towards your stepparent, is to build the relationship. Sit down with your stepparent and learn a little about her, ask what she likes to eat, what she likes to do, etc. After listening well and learning, point out the things you have in common.


You can invite to to join you going somewhere.
If you have a sports match or a music performance, make the effort to say 'I was wondering if you'd like to come and watch me play at the weekend'.

, After you have learned about your stepparent, try to do something they said they liked. Sometimes it might require a big sacrifice on your behalf, such as trying something you're not really into, but the relationship will benefit from your caring effort greatly. They will also be looking for things that you like that they can do with you, so there is some give and take. You could both discover new hobbies.Trying something new shows how much you are trying to build a relationship, which will not go unnoticed.

, Making new routines and rituals can be an excellent way to form an identity as a new family unit. These don’t have to replace rituals you already have, but can add to them in a positive way. If you can do this it will give a new reference point, and be something that you build together with your new stepparent that reflects both of your characters.Some rituals you could develop include distinctive regular family meals, like steak Fridays.
Regular trips to a particular place you both like, such as the beach, or a sports match.
Or watching a TV show you both like together.

, After you have had some fun together, work on not calling her your stepparent. This does not mean you have to call her Mom at all! You could perhaps call them your Bonus Mom, or a first name or a kindly nickname. Even a slightly jokey nickname can be nice if you are comfortable teasing each other a little bit.


Getting into the habit of calling your stepparent something other than ‘stepparent’ will help you move beyond that step status and let you build a more natural relationship.
They will feel more welcome and close to you should you make this small effort.

Don’t feel bad about being upset.,
Talk to a friend.,
Keep a journal.",How to Deal with Step Parents4," Change like this can be very upsetting and difficult to deal with, so you definitely shouldn’t give yourself a hard time about feeling a bit odd about everything. You should do what you can to help things, but it’s perfectly normal to feel confused and conflicted at times.

, It can help you to talk about your feelings with people outside of your family, and a close friend is a good person to turn to, especially if they have experienced something similar. Friends can share tips for coping or just give you a sympathetic ear and a hug, as well as a place to get away from any stress you may have at home so you can think about something else for a while., If you don’t feel like talking to someone, or don’t quite know how to express your feelings, keeping a journal is a good way to work it through yourself.Amongst the advantages of writing things down are that it can be completely personal and just for you, and that you will have the chance read it back through and think about it again.


You might find it interesting to look at how your feelings change over time.
You can also write down a letter to someone if you find it difficult to talk about things in person.

"
Let them know you love them in time.,
Expect some tough spots.,
Allow room for the relationship to grow.,
Realize that these steps only provide the basics.",How to Deal with Step Parents5," Help them to see that you are willing to let her into your life. Don't try to manipulate or your parents against each other, because that will only make things worse for you, not the parents. (After all, your parents and the stepparent are much smarter than you think!)

, As with any relationship there will be ups and downs so try not to react too strongly to any bumps in the road. Control your feelings and try to look at the big picture, rather than focussing on specific incidents. Enjoy the good moments, and don’t get knocked down by the bad ones., It will not happen suddenly, but you will hopefully find that over time your relationship develops in a new way. It is important to help facilitate this by being open to spending more time together as you become closer, and not pulling down the barriers too quickly., Every relationship moves slowly and is formed within the context of who you are, who your stepparent is and your family dynamics. So, take it slowly but surely and always seek the best from the relationship. Once you have done the above actions with a happy heart and a great attitude, your relationship with your new parent will be better than you could imagine!

Spend more time with your siblings.,
Avoid criticizing or making comments that could offend your siblings.,
Express love.,
Do things to show that you care.,
Remind yourself about your plans.",How to Prevent and Work Out Problems with a Sibling1,"  It may sound silly, but in reality, it is a great boost for your relationship, which can help prevent a fight or argument.


If being around your siblings for even a short amount of time is hard for you, try starting with something simple, like chatting before you leave for school, or sitting by them at dinner.  If you're ready for something big, however, you can set aside 20 minutes or an hour a day with them.
When spending time with your siblings, make it all about them.  Don't talk about you, instead ask them sincere questions about their art project, or how their math test at school went.
It's important to decide whether or not you want to specifically tell them that you're working on improving this relationship.  If you think they are likely to protest or be offended by this, it's probably a good idea not to say anything.  But if your siblings whine or complain about the amount of time you spend with them, you may want to let them know that you are making a conscious effort to do better.
Try to have both times that you spend with individual siblings, and times you spend with all of them.  If you worry that your siblings will fight and ruin your quality time together, however, it may be a good idea to start with just individual time.  Keep in mind, though, that by having good times with your siblings all together, you may set a good example for them.;
,


Before you speak, analyze what you're about to say, and make sure that it doesn't have a high probability of hurting someone's feelings.
If you have continual problems with saying hurtful things, try being quiet for 60 seconds to let your brain calm down.
When you say something rude, stop and apologize.
Every time you think something you wouldn't want to say out loud, tell yourself to stop.
Do not interrupt a sibling.

,


Try to say at least one nice thing a day to your siblings.  If you're ready for more, try saying 10 nice things, or one nice thing every time you meet.
Make sure to compliment them, but be wary of saying ""I like/love you because...""  This can make it seem that you will only appreciate them if they continue to do or be something.
Write notes, signed or anonymous, that let your siblings know how you feel about them.
Expressions of love can be as simple as ""Nice shirt,"" ""Good job,"" or even ""Hey, how's it going?""

,


Make a sibling's bed or clean their room.
Do a sibling's chores.
Give them a turn on something you're using (the phone, a game, a certain toy, etc.)
Let them have part of your dessert.
Agree to a certain activity with a sibling who really enjoys it.

,  Different things work for different people.  Here are some ideas:


Wear a special bracelet or tie a rubber band around your finger to remind yourself to be kind.
Every morning, stand in front of the mirror and say, ""I will be kind to my siblings today,""
Write down a few things you are going to do each evening or morning.
Tape a note or homemade poster to your bedroom door or inside your school locker.
Tell someone you trust about your plans.
Constantly think good things about your siblings.

"
Beware that the children may also have their biological father as a father figure.,
Be patient when waiting for your new stepchild to respond to your caring, affection, and love.,
Spend time with the stepchild in his or her activities.,
Balance the time and gifts you give your own children with the stepchild.,
Invite the stepchild to participate in your own activities.,
Communicate clearly and calmly.,
Be openly caring.,
Respect the child's private space.,
Raise the child in alignment with the child's mother's wishes, not contrary to them.,
Help plan the future of the stepchild.,
Be a good example to your stepchild.,
Remember, being a step-dad is a leadership role as part of a team.,
Try to forget that he/she is not your biological child.",How to Be a Good Stepfather," Don't try to compete with the biological father.;
, Often, the child is deeply wounded by circumstances involving their biological mother and father and the breakdown of their primary, original family unit. For many, building a new relationship is threatening to them. Time is the best healer but so is keeping actively positive and supporting yourself whenever you're around the child.

, Helping with schoolwork, projects, and attending sporting events or clubs like scouting they're involved with will show them you're willing to support their efforts. The more involved you are, the sooner the child will accept you in your role of alternative dad and be grateful that you're a part of his or her life too.

, Both your own children and your stepchild are a part of your family now. Avoid playing favorites under any circumstances; each child is to be treated as equal, and no child deserves to be treated as an outcast.


Keep a watchful eye on how your stepchild interacts with your own children, if you have any. Jealousy is toxic to any relationship. If this appears to be occurring, try to head it off immediately. To maintain a happy family atmosphere, step-sibling anger must be dealt with fairly and prudently.
Never treat your stepchild like he or she is not worthy of your time or affection just because he or she is not your biological child.
Never make your stepchild feel like you don’t care or like them, or that they are in the way of your relationship with their mother.

, If you fish, golf, or do other hobby activities, where it is appropriate, take your stepchild along. Not only does this give the child a chance to see what you enjoy, but it gives his or her mother a break. On the other hand, never force the child to do what you've asked––if he or she shows a disinclination toward fishing or rewiring the house, don't force it. Given time and your enthusiasm, the child might come around to trying it. But if he or she is never interested, then that's just a reflection of his or her interests, not a reflection on you. Pushing the child to do things he or she hates just to try to prove you're buddies will backfire. Instead, keep looking for common ground until you do find an activity the child would like to share with you.


Spend time with your stepchild and teach him or her ways to become a responsible adult.
Show the child you're willing to help out in housework. It is important for children to understand that keeping a household is a family job, a shared household responsibility, and not just the mother's. Don't be old-fashioned, even if the child's real father is.

, Let your stepchild know that you are available to talk whenever needed and be a good listener when your stepchild does come to you for a chat. Be open-minded and accepting of difference, as the child has had different experiences before you came along. Make your own preferences known without being harsh or intimidating––always explain your actions and preferences with sound reasons.


Never let the only interaction you have with your stepchild that day be yelling and screaming. You should always try to focus on the positive things they do and not always the things they are doing wrong.
Keep your negative opinions of the child's biological father to yourself. Unless you're asked directly, don't bring up your opinions of him in front of the children or anyone else. If you are asked directly, be circumspect and tactful, as there is often a risk of an emotional overflow. Each parent's parenting style is different and unless the father is not taking part in parenting at all or is abusive in any way, you don't need to pass judgment.
Never argue with the child's mother in front of the child. Be especially careful about making derogatory remarks about her where the child may hear. The child will be highly alert to any disharmony, mostly due to a sense of protectiveness toward the mother and holding a strong hope that this new relationship will result in creating a happy family arrangement.

, The child/ren will need your love and affection at all times, they will need you to be there whenever they need you, no matter what the situation. Moreover, they will need you to be the better parent at times, they will need you to stick up for them no matter what, and they will need you to give them a pass once in a while.

Be ready to listen to them and understand what they are going through or what they are trying to say.
Give them your fatherly shoulder to cry on at times or even just a hug or a kiss on the forehead or just a simple ""I love you"".

, Any child, from preteen through their teen years deserve a reasonable amount of privacy and private space, and unless there is serious concern about the child's behavior or activity, the more space they are given, the more trusted they will feel.

, This means having open lines of communication with the mother about her expectations and intentions for raising your stepchild, and having clarity on the direction both of you will take. As much as possible, defer to her preferences unless they are dangerous or threaten to destabilize the family or relationship the two of you have.


Respect the child's mother's disciplinary and homework regimens. Even if you think they may be out of line, don't raise this in front of the child or make passing remarks that undermine her. Instead, talk to her privately about your concerns and try to reach a compromise that benefits the child.
Discuss decisions which affect your stepchild directly or indirectly with his or her mother. Don't sign the child up for a summer at a military academy or sports camp without talking it over with her. Don't buy the child firearms, fireworks or even seemingly harmless ones like paintball guns or BB guns without her knowledge and consent. Never take the child out on an ATV, snowmobile, micro-light or other potentially dangerous recreational vehicle without her express permission.
Talk about computer games, video games, and other cultural influences with the child's mother. Social pressure will often press on mom to let the child do it, whatever ""it"" is, because everyone else is doing ""it"". Each family should have its own standards and ethical codes to live by. The child's mother needs your support and input on deciding whether to let the child have violent or graphic video games in the home, or allowing them to go to ""R"" rated movies with their friends.
Understand that your spouse is a mother and cannot always be free to spend alone time with you. There will be times when she will have to help the child or spend time with the child when you would really like her to be spending time with you.

, It may fall on you to begin a savings plan for college expenses, the first car, and helping to find that first job. Be actively involved in working out what is needed for the child's future, talking to the mother first and then including the child where appropriate.

, Smoking, excessive drinking, and recreational drugs have no place in a home with children in it. This may not be the politically correct position, but from the effects of secondhand smoke on young lungs, to the acceptance of illegal drugs as a ""norm"", these are not good behaviors to model for children. If you have problems with addiction to substances, seek help. If you must smoke, always smoke outdoors, away from the child.

, Accept the unique qualities of each team member, the limitations, even the eccentricities. There will be good times, even great times, but there will be conflict, disagreements, and letdowns. Patience, love, and a sympathetic view should help you through these challenges. You are the adult, no matter what the situation, you should remember that, and that problems may seem huge, but often will be forgotten in tomorrows rush, or laughed about next year.


Be yourself. It is almost impossible to set up pretense of doing, being, enjoying, or acting in ways that are not you. You may impress your stepchild for a while, but the real you will emerge sooner or later.
You chose to enter into a relationship with a woman with children, so you ultimately chose to be a role model and a parental figure to her child or children.
It is a good idea to keep a good rapport with your stepchild's biological father, except in cases where he is not welcome in your stepchild's life. A large proportion of stepfathers are good friends with the biological fathers of their stepchildren––both men are acting in the best interest of the child and collaborate. If both men are reasonable, impasses are uncommon.
Never pass up an opportunity to tell you stepchild that you love him or her.

, Sometimes always thinking about it would make you feel uneasy and unnatural around your child. Just treat him/her as you would your own child: if you love your spouse so much, why shouldn't you love her child?

"
"
Recognize that you (or one of your siblings) is becoming upset.,
Make a conscious effort to calm down.,
Resume discussion with your sibling, but be extra careful not to get upset.",How to Prevent and Work Out Problems with a Sibling2,"  This step is extremely important, because you can't fix a problem if you don't know it's there.  Some signs of tension are:


You or a sibling are raising your voice.
You or a sibling are saying rude things, or becoming frustrated.
You feel your heart start to beat faster, you breathe more quickly, or you start to sweat or shake.
You find that you can't think clearly or are jumping to conclusions.
You or a sibling are becoming upset because of small things that normally wouldn't be a problem.

,  You can:


Breathe deeply.
Think about something else.
Close your eyes and silently count to three.
Repeat to yourself, ""I will not fight or argue with my siblings.  I promised myself that I wouldn't, so I won't.""

,


Speak in calm, even tones.  Don't talk to fast or too loudly, and don't project anger into your tone.
Be careful not to interrupt your sibling.
Think about what your sibling is saying, and try to see it from their point of view.
Make sure there is a pause between what you are saying and what your sibling is saying.
If you find yourself getting too upset, or things don't seem to be calming down, excuse yourself and leave.  Don't run or stomp away, this will make it worse.  Instead, walk calmly and quickly (but not too fast), away from the tension.  If you are in a situation where you cannot leave (driving in a car, for example), explain that you need to stop talking for a little while, and then focus on something else.

"
"
If you and a sibling do begin to actively argue or physically fight, make sure to stop immediately.,
Once you have left the situation, it is time to recover from the issue.",How to Prevent and Work Out Problems with a Sibling3,"


Take a deep breath, excuse yourself, and leave (if the situation is too intense, or you worry you do not have time to explain, just leave).
Do not go back to the argument until both you (and your sibling) have calmed down, and then some.  Depending on the urgency of resolving the issue, this could be a few minutes, hours, days, or even weeks.  But it is important to resolve the situation (whether by apology or by choosing a verdict).  Do so with an adult, if you feel it is necessary.
Do not stop to retaliate or leave any closing remarks.  It will often only cause trouble.

,


Go to a place where you feel safe (your bedroom, attic, backyard, the library, park, or even the woods).
Take a few minutes to calm down completely.  You can entertain yourself briefly if that helps.
Congratulate yourself on leaving the situation.
Make a list (mental, on paper, or on an electronic device), of the events that went on in the argument/fight.
Think about what you did that was good, what you did that was not good, and what you did that was somewhere in between.
Ponder what might have happened if you had done things differently.
Make another list of the things you have done wrong.
Wait until you think your sibling has calmed down, and then approach him/her with an apology.  Make sure the apology is sincere, and do not include things in it like, ""...but I was really upset..."" ""...you had pushed me..."" or ""...but even so...""  These things usually make the apology look like a lecture instead of what it really is.  Remember, this is you admitting your wrongs, not the other way around.
If your sibling does not accept the apology, or does not acknowledge his/her own wrongdoing, leave it.  Prodding them will most likely provoke another argument.

"
"
When your other siblings are fighting with each other, it can be very hard, especially if you feel like it is your fault, you're trying to set a good example, or the fight is drastically affecting you.,
Continue to set a good example.",How to Prevent and Work Out Problems with a Sibling4,"


Don't get involved in it (don't pick sides, snap at your siblings or others, and especially don't physically fight).  Help from outside is better than another person out of control.
Watch and observe (if it is an argument), and see if anything you could do might help (remind your sister that you have a ticket as well, but aren't going to use it; that she can use your brush for today, etc).
If it is a physical fight (or an extreme argument), go get help from an adult that you can trust.  If none are available, try calling or texting one, letting them know the basic situation and how urgent it is.
Don't panic.  Your siblings may need you as outside help, even if there's not much you can do even there.
Don't say anything unnecessary (besides something that could let them know that you have a good solution, and probably nothing at all if it's a physical fight).  Often, when people are upset, they don't want anyone else interfering.  This can make them angry, and they may choose to take their anger out on another sibling.
Don't give up.  Keep trying to get help, and stay composed.

,  This can do more good than you know.


Sometimes (but not always), all someone needs is a good example to follow.
It doesn't matter if you're the oldest, the youngest, or somewhere in between.
Adults often are impressed by people who set a good example, and it can help build trust between you.
Learning to stay in control can be a great skill for later life.
Someone has to start, and even if you begin very basically and quietly, you're doing something.

Focus on your own interests.",How to Be an Awesome Sibling2," You can create a garden, build a doghouse, or make a painting. When you work together, you have fun and solve problems as a team.Choose an activity you both can enjoy, get the supplies, and go do it!


If you have problems trying to find something you both agree to do, pick something neutral than neither of you have done before.

When problems arise, make sure you tackle them as a team.
When you finish your project, you’ll both have a sense of satisfaction from building something together.

, Functional families smile and laugh together.Find things you both enjoy and go do them. This can include watching tv shows you both enjoy, putting together a comedy routine, or having your own inside jokes that only the two of you understand.

, Treat your sibling the way you want to be treated.Do you want to be made fun of, teased, or laughed at? Probably not. So, when you interact with your sibling, say things you would like someone to say to you. Avoid being mean or doing things that you know will upset your sibling, even if you think it’s funny.


Be respectful and be thoughtful in your words and your actions.

, Find your niche and allow your siblings to have theirs, too. You may excel at school while one sibling excels in gymnastics and another in dance. Be supportive of your sibling’s activities and don’t try to compete for the limelight. If your sibling is a great dancer or excellent artist, be happy for her. Try not to be jealous if your sibling is really talented at something. Remind yourself that there are things you are really good at, too.

Tell your sibling how you feel and how you want things to be for the future.You may have to find a middle path or find a solution that benefits each of you separately (like your sibling gets to watch tv first, then you get to watch your show afterward).

Say, “I don’t want to fight” or “I think it’s better if we go get mum.”
You can also walk away.

, When you hurt your sibling, apologize.If you say mean words or accuse your sibling of something he didn’t do, make sure you make it right and say “I’m sorry.” Don’t let feuds or fights last days, weeks, months, or even years. Show that you are sorry and make sure your sibling sees that you want things to be different.


Be specific in your apology, don’t just say “I’m sorry” and expect things to go back to normal. Say, “When I said those words, they were really mean. I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, and I’ll do better not to say mean things to you in the future.”

, Especially if your sibling is older than you, you may be jealous of the privileges he has that you don’t. You may feel jealous about attention, privileges, or territory (like who has the biggest room or the nicest things).Find ways to feel more even in the dispersion of these things.

Make a plan for how you'd like things to be.,
Discuss this plan with your new husband and come to joint arrangements on how the two of you expect things to play out.,
Talk with the family.,
Trial-run new routines.,
Always be an active listener and be available to talk.,
Avoid giving off the impression that you don't want to mother the new children.,
Avoid being too motherly.,
Avoid being the disciplinarian.,
Show your love openly for their father.,
Be compassionate and fair.",How to Begin a Marriage As a New Stepmother," Write this down on paper and list your own wants, needs, and goals. Consider which of these might coincide with how things are already running in the family you have married into, and those things that will be completely novel for them. Know which items are non-negotiable, either for you or your husband, and where there is more flexibility.;
, At all times, show a united front; don't create the good cop, bad cop routine as this is unfair to both parents, and creates schisms in the family. It is also important to discuss discipline and the beliefs surrounding this, as well as how the step-parent will handle particular situations in which the biological parent may be seen as the more appropriate discipline giver.

, Depending on the ages of the children, there will need to be different approaches taken. Talk to teens as if they were young adults and ask them what they expect; respect their wishes to the extent that these can be accommodated and consider ways that everyone can compromise where their wishes clash with yours. For younger kids, it is also important to let them talk about what they'd like to happen and to see how some of their wishes can be included in the future arrangements. In both cases, it is important to listen for things that are not being said, as much as for the things that are said.

, Let everyone know the importance of assuming new routines as quickly as possible but also explain that there is a great deal of flexibility in suggested routines until everyone feels settled into the new family. This permits changes of direction as needed and reduces the potential for conflict when children realize that if a suggestion doesn't work, it is not set in concrete unless it is an issue of personal safety or health.

, Being there for the kids will impress them from the moment they get to know you; they will feel happier and more comfortable around you, and come to you. With teens, don't try to act smarter than they are, or know-all, or even too friendly – just be a friend, a listener, and don't judge them.

, If you married into a new family with the hope that the children might just ""go away"", then you married for the wrong reasons. Your husband's first responsibility is to his children, and his second is to you. If your new marriage responsibilities mean new children, you have no choice but to make the most of the situation. If the children sense your reticence, this will create a lot of resentfulness and challenges for you.

, First and foremost, remember that you are not the mother of these children - no matter how much you, your husband or the children might wish it were so. Things will go much smoother and easier for all of you if you keep in mind that you will need (at least in the beginning) to walk a fine line between being the kind, caring and loving parental figure, and a good and trusted friend. If you attempt to be too motherly, the children may perceive that you are attempting to ""replace"" their mother, and this may engender hostility or resentment toward you.

, If you are the stepmother, it is wisest to allow your husband to discipline his own children. You are free to tell the kids that any behaviors that need addressing will be discussed with their father, and then to do so. Sometimes, (especially) older kids and teens will push envelopes, either consciously or subconsciously. In those cases, you'll have to decide whether to take it up with their father or not. Whether you do or not, insist that your husband be the one to mete out punishments and or rewards - if he does it, the children will not hold it against him. If you do it, you risk being seen as the harpy who stole their father from them. His children are ultimately his responsibility. Don't get between your husband and his kids.

, This will always win over kids' hearts.

, If you have children of your own coming into the marriage, be sure to treat all the children fairly and as evenly as you can. Talk to your own children in advance about the importance of fitting in to the new family and extol the benefits of their being a part of this new family. Don't threaten them and don't deny them access to their real father unless there are valid legal reasons for doing so. Remember that if one set of children visits, rather than living with you, make them feel as much at home as possible without favoring them overly. But do make sure they feel welcome, no matter what. Making the visitors feel like intruders is a sure way to set them against the children who live with you, and/or against you or your husband, or both.

Challenge your misconceptions about your new step-parent.,
Show respect for the relationship, even if you don’t agree with it.,
Refrain from comparing.,
Direct attention to your own life.",How to Adjust when an Adult Parent Remarries1," If you find yourself immediately against the idea of Mom or Dad getting remarried, check your motives. Try to identify what’s behind your dislike of your future step-parent. This could help you reduce the negativity surrounding the union and prevent a potential rift between you and your parent.For instance, if the step-parent is significantly younger than your parent, are you playing into societal stereotypes about age-gap relationships? Perhaps you are worried that this person is only marrying your parent for their money
If this is the case, acknowledge this by having a candid conversation with your parent and seeing them with their future spouse. You can say, “Dad, I’m a little concerned about you marrying such a young woman.” See what he says. Getting your worries off your chest early can prevent any explosive issues down the road.
You can also spend more time with the new couple. Seeing your parent with their new love can help abate any concerns you have about your new step-parent, and help you see how happy this person is making your parent.;
, Even if you come to realize that you are not so fond of your parent’s new love, recognize that you parent doesn’t have to have your permission to remarry. However, they probably would love to have your support. At the very least, show respect for the relationship by being polite with the new spouse and avoiding gossip or bad-mouthing with others.As hard as it may be, show respect. Call the new spouse by their preferred name and be cordial as you would with anyone of their age group, such as saying “Yes, ma’am” or “No, sir.” Showing this level of deference will actually put you on Mom or Dad’s good side since they will be pleased you are trying to be welcoming to their new love.

, When you see a new man or woman on your parent’s arm, it’s typical to hearken back to the days when that person was your other parent. Tread carefully, however. Remember that you’re opening yourself up for disappointment if you continuously compare the new spouse to your own parent. If you catch yourself doing this, stop right away.Try to remind yourself that your parent’s new spouse is companion for your parent. Consider how you might like your family to treat someone new that you brought home and try to treat your parent’s new spouse the same way.
You can also minimize comparisons by trying to find some positives in this new person. Notice how they make your Mom’s eyes light up whenever she’s paid a compliment. Pay attention to how your Dad’s new wife enjoys baking. Think of all the ways this person is helping your parent, rather than dwelling on how they are alike or different than your other parent.

, Chances are, if your parent has been single for a while, you may have been devoting a great deal of your attention to caring for them or keeping them company. Now that your single parent has found love, you can focus more attention on yourself again.Rather than taking the negative approach and thinking that this new person is encroaching on your time with your parent, see it as an opportunity to re-focus on yourself. Now that your mother or father has a new spouse you can dedicate more time to reaching your own goals.
Consider taking a new class, reviving your social calendar, or traveling more. Think of ways you can use your additional free time to bring positive changes into your life.
Remind yourself that the new situation is positive for your parent even if the new spouse has affected your life in some way, such as reducing your parent’s free time and limiting their ability to watch your children for you when you are at work.

Receive the judge’s order.",How to Change Your Stepchild's Last Name to Yours," You should try to get the other parent’s consent.For example, if you have married the child’s mother, then you should speak to the father and ask if he will agree to a name change.


For example, you could say, “You haven’t been around much the past few years, and I know Jonah wants to have the same last name as his brothers and sisters. Do you think you’d object if we changed his last name to mine?”
If he agrees, then you can usually pick up a form for him to sign. It should be available at the courthouse in the county where you live.If you don’t know where the other parent is living, then you will need to try and find them. For example, you can do an Internet search and ask friends that you have in common if they know where the parent is located. Be prepared to tell the judge the steps you took to find the parent.;
, Even if the other parent won’t agree, you can still petition the court to change your stepchild’s name. There should be a printed, “fill in the blank” petition available for you to use from the court clerk. Stop in and ask.


Your spouse (your stepchild’s biological parent) may need to complete the paperwork. Involve him or her in the process.
There may be other forms you need to fill out. For example, in New York, you need to prepare an “order” for the judge to sign. Make sure you get everything from the clerk., In some states, such as New York, a child must consent in certain situations. For example, a child who is at least 14 must sign a consent form, agreeing to the name change.You should check with the court clerk.


Have an honest discussion with the child. The name change might be the child’s idea. However, if it isn’t, then be prepared to give reasons to the child why you want the name changed.
You might say, ""I've loved being your father for the past five years and would like to have the same name as you. You're part of my family no matter what you decide.""
You should also have the child’s biological parent involved in the conversation.

, Complete the forms neatly, using a typewriter if available. If you must print, then print as neatly as possible using black ink so that the judge can read your information. Answer all questions on the forms.


When you are finished, you should make a copy for your records and submit the completed forms to the court clerk.
You may have to pay a filing fee. The amount will depend on the court.
Include any necessary attachments. For example, if you had the father’s parental rights terminated, then you should attach a copy of the termination order.You may also need to file a copy of the child’s birth certificate., You must give the other parent a chance to object to the name change request. For this reasons, courts will expect you to send the other parent a copy of your petition. You should follow the method your court allows for making service.


In some courts, you can mail the forms certified mail, return receipt requested.In other courts, you will need to have the forms hand delivered to the other parent. Typically, you can pay the sheriff or constable to make delivery for a small fee. If not, you can hire a private process server or ask someone 18 or older to make delivery (provided they are not part of the case).
If you don’t know where the parent is living, then some states allow you to make service by publication. Generally, this means you publish notice in a newspaper where you last knew the parent was living.

, The court can schedule a hearing in one of several ways. In some courts, you need to get a hearing date when you file your petition. In other courts, the clerk will wait until everyone has submitted paperwork before scheduling a hearing.


If the other parent agrees to the name change, then you may not even need a hearing.

, If the other parent objects, then they can file an objection with the court, explaining why the name shouldn’t be changed.You will be sent a copy through the mail or by hand delivery. You should read the response closely and look to see what the parent is arguing.


Alternately, the parent might not file a written objection but instead show up the day of the hearing to object.

, In some states, you may be required to publish a notice of the name change in a local newspaper. The court might work directly with the newspaper and can submit the information for you.In other areas, you must make arrangements.


Generally, you have to pay a fee, which will vary depending on where you live.
You also need someone at the newspaper to fill out an affidavit, which identifies the dates the advertisement ran. The newspaper should have an affidavit or you can get one from the court clerk.
Keep a copy of the completed affidavit and file it with the court.

, Essentially, you need to argue that a name change is in the child’s best interests. A judge will look at a variety of factors, including the following:How long your stepchild has had their current name. It might be harder to change a name the longer they have had it.
What changing the name will do to the child’s relationship with their parents. If your stepchild has no relationship with the parent objecting to the name change, then you should point that out.
Whether the child has suffered harassment or embarrassment based on their name. For example, you could argue that the child feels alienated from their siblings because they have different last names.
Your motives in wanting to change the name. For example, you might want to relieve your stepchild of embarrassment or stress.
What the child wants. If the child is old enough, then their desire to change the name will also be a powerful argument in your favor.

, It is critical that you don’t miss the hearing, so give yourself plenty of time to get to the courthouse. You may need to find parking and probably go through security. Don’t bring any food to the courthouse.Also remember to turn off your cell phone before entering the courtroom.

, Wait for your case to be called by the court clerk and move to the front of the courtroom. Since you are requesting the name change, you will get to present your argument first. Remember the following tips for making a strong argument:Make only your strongest points based on the factors a judge analyzes. You won’t have a lot of time to argue.
Speak in a loud, clear voice. Sometimes people talk softly when they get nervous.
Don’t interrupt the judge. If the judge asks a question, stop talking and listen to the question. Ask for clarification if you don’t understand it.
Answer the judge’s question directly. Don’t hem and haw.

, The other parent gets to make an argument after you finish. You should stand quietly and listen. If the parent says something you want to respond to, then you should write a note. Don’t interrupt the parent or raise your hand to speak.When the other parent finishes, ask the judge, “Your Honor, may I speak?” Then quickly respond to the other parent.

, At the end of the hearing, the judge will decide whether to change your stepchild’s name. If so, the judge will sign the order. You should get a certified copy from the court clerk.


You will probably have to pay a fee to get the certified order. The amount will differ by court.

Make an appointment to talk.,
Understand your sibling's perspective.,
Avoid name calling.,
Find a solution that helps both of you.,
Try to work things out on your own.",How to Be a Good Little Sister2," If there is an issue that needs to be worked out, set up a time that you will meet to talk. Tell your sibling how you feel and then listen to their side. Try to stay as calm as possible.

If you and your sibling are not good at working things out on your own, ask a parent to be there during the talk. Your parent can make sure that things do not get too heated.
Try to stick to the specific issue you are having. For example, if the problem is that your sibling is spending too long in the bathroom before school, do not bring up how your sibling never lets you pick a show on the television.

, When you are fighting, it can be hard to understand how your sibling feels. For example, maybe your sibling kicked you out of their room because they wanted to be alone. You may feel that your sibling is being mean to you and does not want to spend time with you. However, your sibling may have had a bad day and need some alone time.


Instead of jumping to conclusions, ask your sibling, ""Why did you say that?"" or ""are you feeling ok?""

, If you and your sibling are not getting along, calling them a name or putting them down, will only make things worse.

This can be really difficult if you are upset. If you are too mad too talk, get away from your sibling until you calm down.Tell your sibling, ""I'm really mad right now. I want to be alone. I'll talk to you later.""
Even if your sibling calls you a name, do not say something mean back to them.

, To resolve a conflict, both people involved should get something that they want. If the solution is one-sided, only one person will be happy and the fighting may continue. You may have to give up something or offer something in return.


For example, if you want to play with your sibling's phone you may say, ""You can play my video game if you let me borrow your phone."" You offer something you have that your sibling wants, so you can get something that you want.
If you are not sure of a good compromise, ask your sibling, ""What would make you happy?"" or ""Is there anything I can do for you/give you?""

, If you and your siblings are fighting, try to work it out on your own before you get your parents involved. Try to talk and find a solution that works for the both of you. Solving problems on your own will strengthen your relationship and show your parents that you are responsible.


If your sibling refuses to compromise with you, physically hurts you, threatens you, or bullies you, let your parents know.
Deal with problems as they happen. Do not let things build up."
"
Do not bother them when they have company.,
Ask before you borrow something.,
Never eavesdrop.,
Don't be a tattle-tale.",How to Be a Good Little Sister3," When your siblings have friends over (and that includes boyfriends/girlfriends), don't bother them. You might want to talk and hang out with them or play with them, but they deserve their time alone. Wait until they call you. They will appreciate that and more likely want you to come back.If you start to hang out with them and they ask, ""Can you get out now?"" say, ""Sure"" and go and do something else.
If you know that your sibling has company coming, already have some activities (e.g. play outside, read, watch a movie, play video games, color, etc.) planned that you can do.

, Your siblings probably have something that you like and would like to use from time to time. Always ask to borrow the item before you use it. Your sibling may need it or might not want to share with you.Say, ""Hey, can I borrow your ___. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.""
If you do borrow something, take care of it and bring it back in the same condition that you got it. For example, do not borrow their phone and bring it back with a cracked screen.
If your sibling says no, you can politely ask them why. You might be able to convince them if you know the reason.
If your sibling refuses to share with you, do not beg or whine. Accept their answer.

, Eavesdropping will get you nowhere. You usually want answers, and you'll end up right back where you started because your sister/brother will find out and you'll lose their trust. If your sibling wants you to know something, they will tell you.


If you do eavesdrop and overhear something, do not repeat it to other people (e.g. your friends, parents, etc.)
If your sibling is on the phone or having a conversation that does not involve you, go to another room and do something else.

, If there is something small that your sibling did, don't run to tell your mom. Talk to them before you tell your parents. If you can't work it out, then tell them. If your sibling is in danger or going to do something illegal, you can go ahead and tell your parents.


If you are a tattle-tale, your siblings will not be able to trust you.
Keeping secrets is a special, fun part of having siblings.

Try not to be jealous.,
Do not compare yourself.,
Understand that you may have different interests.",How to Be a Good Little Sister4," You may get jealous of your sibling for many reasons. Maybe they get more attention from your parents, make better grades, or receive more compliments from other people. Getting jealous from time to time is normal, but you should not let it affect how you treat your sibling.

Anytime you feel jealous, remind yourself of something you accomplished. For example, if your sibling made straight ""A's,"" think about how well you did at your dance recital.
Congratulate your siblings when they accomplish something. If you support them, they are more likely to support you.
If you begin to feel jealous, take a deep breath and as yourself, ""Am I upset with my sibling or do I wish the situation was different?""
If you are having problems with jealousy, talk to your parents or write your feelings down in a journal. It is best to deal with your feelings instead of keeping them in., You probably compare yourself to your older siblings. They may have special privileges or get to do things that you do not get to do. Your parents may also deal with them differently than they deal with you. This is not because you are not special or that your parents love you any less.Your siblings have different privileges because they are older. You will get more privileges as you become older.
Your siblings may also be able to do things that you can't do yet. For example, your sibling may be able to ride a bike really well, but you are having a hard time. Remember that your sibling has had more time to practice, and they were not always good at riding a bike. Just keep practicing.

, As a little sister, your siblings may not always be interested in the same things that you are. This is more likely to happen if there is a large age gap between you and your siblings. Having different interests is normal and healthy.


For example, maybe your sibling is a teenager and has begun dating. They may spend less time with you. Remember that nothing is wrong with you and that your sibling still loves you.
Spend time doing the things that you are interested in and spend more time with your parents and friends. If you are busy, you will not be as sad about your sibling doing things without you.

Get closure about your parents’ relationship.,
Express your joy that your parent found love.,
Make an effort to build a relationship with your parent’s new spouse.",How to Adjust when an Adult Parent Remarries2," Adult stepchildren may be resistant to a parent remarrying because you have identified with the previous family unit for so long. You may feel that a accepting a new marriage is disloyal to your deceased or divorced mother or father. Building a relationship with a new stepparent may feel like a betrayal to the memory of your original family unit.Keep in mind that these feelings are normal. Allow yourself plenty of time to adjust to the new situation.
This can also happen if you have not fully dealt with your grief surrounding the previous death or divorce. You can find closure surrounding your previous family unit by performing a ritual of sorts. Try writing a letter to both parents sharing your feelings about the new marriage. Write out your fears, worries, or dislike. Then, rip up the letter or throw it into a fire symbolizing you releasing these feeling and welcoming the new change. Don’t allow the letter to circulate because this may cause problems.
It may also be helpful to see a professional therapist regarding unresolved grief. A therapist can offer additional exercises to help you find closure and develop the necessary acceptance you need to support your parent’s new marriage.
Remember that this situation may be even more difficult for you if you were close with your parent or if the divorce/death was recent.

, It can be hard to accept the marriage if you don’t like your parent’s new love interest, or you feel disloyal to your other parent. However, there is one thing that should be relatively easy to do regarding the new union: be happy because your parent found someone.


Temporarily set aside your own feelings about the relationship to perform an honest assessment. Does your father or mother appear to be happy with their new mate? Do you notice them smiling or laughing more often? Are they trying new things or getting out of the house more now that they have found love?
Despite your reservations, you can demonstrate happiness that your parent has found companionship. Say this, even if it is difficult for you. For instance, you might say, “Mom, I still feel resistant to the idea of your getting remarried, but I can see how happy you are with Paul. I’m glad you’re happy.”, One of the main reasons you could be struggling to accept the new marriage is because the new love interest is mysterious to you. If you remove the mystery, you may find that you actually like your parent’s new spouse. Trying to get to know this person may help you gain acceptance and figure out the role this person will play in your life. Plus, it will demonstrate to your parent that you are trying to welcome their love into the family.Offer to go to lunch alone with your parent’s new partner to better get to know them. You might even break the ice by being candid with them about your reservations. Say something like, “Molly, I’ll be honest with you…I’m very protective of Dad. I want to make sure you have his best interests in mind.”

Host a gathering so everyone can make acquaintance.,
Maintain one-on-one time with your parent.,
Be open and honest with your parent about sensitive topics.",How to Adjust when an Adult Parent Remarries3," Help make the new spouse feel welcome and get some points from your parent by planning a family gathering of sorts. Invite all your siblings and step-siblings to attend so that everyone gets an opportunity to meet and break the ice. Remember, just because you are making an effort welcome the new spouse into the family does not mean you are betraying your other parent.Try to reinforce being respectful and polite to your other siblings or children who may be resistant to the new spouse. You might say, “Dad clearly loves her, guys. Let’s try to give her a chance for him. Okay?”
It can especially help if the other divorced parent gives his/her “blessing” about the new marriage. This can help all the rest of the family show more support and respect for the new spouse.
Try to be patient with other family members who take longer to warm up to the new person. They might just need more time.

, A common fear for adult step-children is that they will lose Mom or Dad’s attention to the new partner. Thinking that you won’t get to see your parent as much can cause you to feel resentment towards the spouse.Overcome this barrier to blended adult step-families by scheduling regular alone time with your parent.


Make it a weekly or monthly event to take your parent out to lunch on Sundays or attend a matinee showing at the Cinema the first Friday of every month. That way, you can assure that you spend one-on-one time with your parent just like before the new marriage.
Be sensitive about your parent’s schedule and need to spend time with their new spouse.

, Adult step-children are frequently concerned with how a new marriage affects the financial affairs of their parent or changes their inheritance. This is yet another reason why you may be hesitant to welcome a new spouse into the family.


Instead of harboring resentment for the new spouse, have a direct conversation with your parent about any sensitive concerns you have. You might say, “Mom, I hate to be so forward, but how will your new marriage affect our inheritance?” or “Dad, I understand that spouses are usually in charge of these things, but is it okay if I remain in control of your health care and estate for a while? I just don’t want to overwhelm your new wife with all this responsibility.”"

Know thyself and to thyself be true.,
Know your family.,
Know what you are talking about.,
Listen.,
Know how and what you want to say.,
Don't argue.,
Have as much manners as you expect from the family member.

,
Don't nag.

,
Suggest, don't direct.

,
Make it fun.

",How to Address Concerns As a Stepparent," Know where you are from, what is your history in a family setting, what expectations do you have and most importantly, how do you feel toward the members of your new family (Each of them) and how this affects your thoughts towards them. knowing how you think and feel, gives you a context from which you address issues.


Self awareness enables you, not just to know how you feel, but how you think and feel towards these feelings.;
, When you know yourself, it is important to 'put yourself in context'. Simply put, know how you fit into the family; how is the teen daughter likely to react to you smoking, considering their previous parent didn't? Will the sixth grader son expect you at every baseball game? Will the two year old expect something too?


Knowing your place in the family allows you to structure your response to a situation; whether corrective or positive in nature. Will the son understand why you didn't show up for his biggest match, when a day ago you just mentioned how stupid baseball is? Will the daughter think you genuinely care for her well being when you made it clear boyfriends are out of bounds in your house?

, Avoid talking for the sake of it; it's okay not to know all the answers. Don't answer to prove you're a clever parent. Don't condemn without understanding and most importantly, don't be afraid to ask for clarifications.


Focus on the issue at hand and do not bring up any old problems-including what you know of their previous family-you're not the family historian here.

, When addressing concerns as a parent, there is the temptation to be problem focused.Listen without formulating replies in your head. Avoid designing solutions as you listen to your partner or child.


Use clarifying clues such as, ""Ok Jane, so let me get this straight, Justus was in the house then..."" However, don't complete their sentences for them and don't interrupt them in mid-sentence, even when they are repeating information you know. Talk only when you're sure they are done explaining, and avoiding asking ""Are you done?"" It gives the impression of impatience and insinuates that you already have a solution without focusing on the problem.

, You are probably in this family because the previous one broke, or lost the person in your position. Your every word is a connotation, and most of the time form an opinion in the family about you.


Measure your words. It's safer to admit you don't know something than to speak out of emotion and regret it later. When addressing an issue it is helpful to use what is famously known as SBI (Situation, Behaviour, Impact). Using this format, you give suggestions, not directives or rules. typical SBI sounds like this ""Jake when you came back home late (Behavior what was done, not what has accumulated over time) yesterday (Situation-be specific, time & place) it made me and your dad/mom worried (Impact, what it made you feel-not think). You then work on a solution from there.

, This doesn't mean you act the Mr Right in a conversation, doesn't mean you are intolerant to the other person's opinion; but that when you feel a bone of contention, be strong enough to concede some ground at times. If the other party is interested in making you look bad, let them have their day.


Remember, the content of the argument is insignificant as compared to the context,i.e how and why you argue is more important that what you're arguing about. If you want to walk out of an argument, don't use the cliché ""look, I'm tired of this, I'll go out for some air."" Instead, let the other person finish what they are saying (Knowing that you have decided not to talk anymore) and when they are done, politely excuse yourself without seeming to be running from the conversation.
Say for instance that you need to think about it, instead of say, pretending you understand their position, if your argument has matured, the most likely answer will be ""You don't! Isn't it why we're arguing?""

Keep in contact.",How to Be a Good Big Sister," Being respectful is a very important skill for people to have, in order to get along well with others and succeed in this world. If you want your siblings to have an easier time in life, set a good example by being respectful to them, your parents, friends, acquaintances, strangers, and even yourself!


Don't talk back or be rude to your parents or teachers, not even people you don't like at school!;
, Responsibility is also a very important life skill. Avoid things like drugs or alcohol. Instead, do things like getting good grades in school and helping out around the house. You can even get a job to earn your own money, to show your siblings that you can get what you want if you work hard. Responsibility means being responsible for your actions, and apologizing if you are wrong or do something wrong. Don't blame other people for your choices and your actions.


However, stay humble about all of these things. Never lord it over your siblings or your parents. Let responsibility be its own reward.

, Speaking well is usually a sign of a good education and intelligence, so you want your siblings to be able to talk like reasonable adults. Do this by not teaching them lots of bad words and instead by speaking with a good vocabulary and the best grammar that you can manage.

, Kids who learn that violence is cool or a good way to solve problems will have a lot of just that in life: problems. Don't let your siblings see you being violent, either to them or to anyone else. Instead, solve your problems by talking them through.

, Teach your siblings to love and respect themselves for who they are by always setting a good example and doing the same. Take good care of yourself, never get too down on yourself, and always work to make yourself a better human being. Pursue what you love and ignore the haters.

, Always do the right thing, even when it's hard to do. Protect those who can't protect themselves and teach your siblings that it's worth it to stick up for the little guy. You should also apologize or admit when you've done something wrong. Teaching your sibling to always do the right thing by setting a good example will make both of you better human beings.

, This sets a bad example by teaching your sibling that it's okay to talk to or treat people like that. Also, if you do that, they won't respect or appreciate you, and lack of respect will inevitably lead to arguments. Treat them like equals because they are your equals.

, It doesn't matter how you go about it, but if you want to start having a better relationship with your siblings then you're going to want to spend more time with them. Find ways to play with them or just hang out. Do whatever you enjoy doing together.

, Your siblings will have a much happier life and they will love you a lot more if you help them to love themselves and feel confident. Do this by complimenting them when they've earned it and focusing on their triumphs instead of their mistakes.

, Your siblings should be able to trust you, so that they can come to you when they have problems that they might not be able to discuss with your parents. Create a space of trust by not only letting them know that they can talk to you, but also by never laughing at them when they tell you something serious, never judging them.

, Be happy that they are who they are, instead of trying to make them more like you. Appreciate the hard work they put into the things that they love and try to join them every now and again in enjoying those things.

, Arguments happen and you will get mad at each other sometimes. However, if you stop and try to see things from their point of view, you might find it easier to stop fighting. People usually do something wrong because they thought they were doing something right or they were trying. Understand that you make the same mistakes and you'll have a much better relationship with your siblings.

, If your siblings ask you for help with anything in their life (as long as they aren't hurting themselves) do whatever you can to help them. It may be something small or it could be something large: nothing's too much for you! However, if they don't want help, you should respect their wish and stand aside. Sometimes people have to do things for themselves, and it's better for you to respect them.

, You should encourage your siblings to look for more out of life: reach for the stars and pursue the things that make them happy. They will be happier people over the course of their life if they're doing things they love. This means that you shouldn't tease them for enjoying something. Instead, try to help them find time to do that thing and even join in sometimes, so they don't feel alone.

, Whether they are getting bullied or hanging out with people who lead them down the wrong path, you should help to keep your siblings away from things that get them into trouble. Stand up for them when you can and try to steer them away from bad crowds by letting them hang out with you and your friends or by finding them a new place to hang out.

, It can feel terrible to feel unwanted, especially by a sibling you really love or admire. Make sure your sibling never feels this way by finding ways to include them in your life. If you are trying to do your homework and your sibling is bothering you, first kindly ask her give you some alone time. There are times when your younger sister doesn't realize she is bothering you.

, Don't try to be a parent to your younger siblings; your parents are always there for that, or other authority figures if your parents aren't around. You should watch over your siblings, but treat them more like friends. This will create an easier, healthier relationship.

, Whether your sibling needs a hug and some advice or just a silent shoulder to cry on, you should be there for them, bringing comfort whenever they need it. Make sure they know they can come to you, and watch for their moods and notice when they're sad.

, It's fun to give your sibling a hard time but from time to time you should do really nice things for them. You'll find all sorts of little ways to help out in a given day, but you can also seek out nice things to do for them, like fixing a broken toy, doing their chores, or mowing their lawn (if you're older).


Never hold it over their head that you did something nice for them. This makes the nice act selfish, because it becomes about you rather than them.

, Make them feel good about themselves by complimenting them when they've earned it or you just feel like saying something nice to them. This can mean a lot, especially if you have a rough relationship and fight sometimes. It shows them that you do really love them and can find good things about them, even if you complain a lot.

, When it's a holiday or your sibling's birthday, don't just get them something boring that could be for anyone; get them a gift that is perfect for them, even if it doesn't cost very much money. Get them something that reminds you of a great time you had together in the past or things that you enjoy doing together. This will show them how much you care.

, Now is not the time to be selfish: you and your siblings should share whatever you can, whether it's the tasty part of dinner, a favorite computer game, or family heirlooms. Be generous with each other, because if you can't be generous with your siblings then who will you be generous with?

, If you and your siblings live far apart, either because you're in different homes or because you're older and have moved apart, you should make sure to stay in touch. They still need all of the wonderful things that you have provided for them in the past and nothing can replace as big sister who is always there for you and loves you. Call them when you can, write ""letters"" over facebook or email, and visit them whenever you can.

Have competitions.",How to Avoid Boredom with Your Younger Sister (Kids and Teens)1," Yep, those are oldies. For these games, if you have a younger sister who is a lot younger than you, you might need to slow down a little with the running, or she may get discouraged. You can also make up rules like there is no ""goo"" for you.;
, Warning - a very young child might not be able to do this one, or might be easily scared by games like this. You can use sticks as the ""weapons"" but be careful not to actually hurt your sis. You can decide how many hearts to have, and each touch of the other person's ""weapon"" eliminates a heart. You can find little white stones to act as the medicine. Each stone retrieves a heart for you. Put all the stones and sticks in the middle, start counting, and run!

, This is a fun game that only needs a few hula hoops and maybe some jump ropes. You can take turns making the obstacle race, for example, you can put a jump rope in front and then a hula hoop, then have the other person jump over the jump rope and walk around the hula hoop. The possibilities are endless! Make sure to compliment your younger sister's obstacle race.

, This is only if you have some rocks worthy of climbing or pretend climbing. You can bring a ""lunch"" with you, like a few bars or a water bottle. Of you go! Pretend that it's a great challenge and sometimes you might even fall! (pretend) If you have a big rock that you actually can climb, make sure you stay safe and keep your sis safe.

, Everyone loves winning. You can make races, see who can roll the hula hoop the farthest, have a hula hoop contest, a cannonball contest if you have a pool, the possibilities are really endless! Be sure to let your sister win some of the games.

Apologize and acknowledge when you are wrong.",How to Be a Good Big Brother or Sister," Perhaps the easiest and most direct way of being a good big brother or big sister is taking the time to ask your sibling how her day went and listening to what she has to say. Try to pull your sibling aside once a day and have a brief conversation with her, especially if she is an adolescent or in her early teen years. Often, younger siblings want to be acknowledged and listened to by those they look up to.You should practice active listening in your conversations with your sibling, whether it’s a brief check in talk with her or a heart to heart. To actively listen to your sibling, you should go into the conversation with the intent of improving mutual understanding and respect between you and your sibling. The conversation should be a learning opportunity, where you get to know your sibling better and have a meaningful discussion.
Focus your attention fully on your sibling and let her speak without interruption. You should then acknowledge what your sibling told you and respond thoughtfully and without judgement. This will keep the conversation open and encourage your sibling to confide in you more often.;
, Though siblings tend to squabble and have small fights, you should make an effort to avoid having big, dramatic arguments with your sibling. This may mean being the bigger person and letting your sibling have the victory for a trivial fight. You should also try to offer your sibling a compromise, where you get a little bit of what you want and she gets a little bit of what she wants. This will help her to feel supported and respected by you, but it will also help her learn that she cannot always get her way.If you are not able to resolve a conflict with your sibling on your own, you may reach out to other authority figures for guidance. This could be an older friend, an older family member, or a parent. Often, conflicts between siblings are minor and can be worked out among the two of you. But there is no shame in also reaching out to others for help. This will show your sibling that you are not afraid to ask for help when you need it., Your sibling will likely experience a range of trials and tribulations, and she may confront a difficult challenge of some kind or even fail in her attempt to do something great. Rather than shame your sibling for her failure or make her feel bad about messing up, you should comfort her and support her.You can comfort your sibling by telling her to keep her head high and be proud, even if she did not achieve what she wanted or if she failed. You can also encourage her to remember that the failure is just one in many and she will have other opportunities to do better.
Another way to comfort your sibling it to distract her from her failure by taking her out to her favorite restaurant or to her favorite hang out spot. Sometimes, distraction can help to cheer someone up and make them dwell less on their failure.

, Teaching your sibling about boundaries and autonomy, or her ability to be her own person separate of others, can show her how to respect others and herself. You should respect your sibling's body autonomy by not tickling her, picking at her, or touching her body without her consent. You should also respect her mental boundaries by not trying to enforce your opinions or ideas on her, and by not trying to control her thoughts.Another way you can respect your sibling's autonomy is by not trying to force her to grow up too fast or do adult things when she is still a kid or a teenager. It is important that you let her experience life as a young person, even if this means making mistakes or dealing with conflict, and be there as a support for her as she tries to figure it out on her own. If she wants to do adult things with you, like go for dinner together or go to a show just the two of you, you can certainly do this. But do not try to force her into doing adult things if she does not seem interested or engaged in them.

, You can also support your sibling by offering her advice when she asks for it. Avoid giving her advice when she does not ask you for it as this can feel pushy or forceful. Only give advice when your sibling asks for it and only after you have listened to what she has to say. Rather than give your sibling general or vague advice, you should consider your own personal experiences and how you managed to resolve or deal with a certain issue. This will show that you have empathy for your sibling and want to support her in an honest way.

For example, perhaps your sibling is struggling with balancing her academics and her extra curricular activities. She may tell you she is not sure how to do well in school and also do well in all her sports training or art classes outside of school. You may tell her, “Well, when I was in high school I also struggled with time management. I ended up making a weekly schedule where I blocked off time for each thing I had to do each day. This kept me organized and made me feel less stressed about all my commitments.”
Your sibling may also ask you for romantic advice. If you have experience in this area, you should encourage your sibling to talk about her feelings and the specifics of the situation. You may then be able to offer advice on how to have a healthy, responsible romantic relationship with someone. You may also be able to offer some perspective on relationships, especially if you have had a few experiences that taught you valuable lessons around romance and love.

, One of the kinder things you can do for your sibling is offer to help her with her homework and her other school work. If she has an oral presentation coming up, offer to listen to her present her presentation. If she is struggling with her math assignment, sit down with her and help her work through the assignment. Focus on practical ways to help your sibling succeed by offering your knowledge of particular subject or simply a helping hand so a project gets done on time.You can also offer to help her complete her chores around the house or split them with her if she is working on a tight deadline for school.

, Maybe your sibling has a performance coming up or a big sporting event. Make an effort to be in the audience and cheer her on from the stands. Attending her special events will be a nice thing you can do for her as a way to show your support as her big brother or big sister., As the older brother or older sister, you should watch out for younger sibling and stand up for her if she gets into any awkward or sticky situations. This may be confronting the school bully if he starts to pick on your sibling or mediating a fight between your sibling and your parents. Try to stay on your sibling’s side and work with her to resolve any problems or issues with others. Having your sibling’s back will show her that you are willing to be there for her and support her.

, A good big brother or sister will act as their sibling’s champion and encourage their sibling to be the best they can be. Take notice of your sibling’s abilities and talents, and then actively work to help her develop and improve them.If your sibling shows an interest in painting, for example, you should encourage her to take classes in painting or to set up a painting studio at home. If your sibling shares a personal goal, for example, a desire to go to an Ivy League school, you should work with her to help her achieve this goal. This could mean helping her with her college applications and helping her draft her personal statement.

, Be a good role model for your sibling by doing well in your studies and following through on your commitments at home. Your sibling will likely take notice if you are diligent about doing well in school and are also able to keep up with your responsibilities at home, such as sports practice or household chores. Working hard on your own needs and responsibilities will allow you to also be a good mentor to your sibling, as you will have enough of a grip on your own life to support your sibling.


Keep in mind that though you should work hard and do your best, you should also be willing to fail in front of your sibling. Though you may want to appear like the perfect role model, your sibling will likely respect you more if you show her you are human and prone to making mistakes. This will also make you seem more relatable and honest, as you can share your challenges and failures with your sibling, just as she will share hers with you.

, Another way you can be a good role model for your sibling is to try to maintain an active and healthy social life. Being able to connect with a group of friends can set a good example for your sibling and show her how to be social around others.


If your sibling is struggling to make friends and connect with others, you may want to ask her to hang out with your friends for a night. This will help her feel included and allow her to learn how to be social by following your example.

, Be respectful when your parents speak to you and be polite when you are around other elders, such as your teachers or your friends’ parents. Maintaining a good relationship with the elders in your life, from your parents to your teachers to your mentors, will help you develop into a good role model. It will also demonstrate the importance of respect for your elders to your sibling.

, A good role model is willing to admit when they are wrong and make a sincere apology for their mistake. If you make a mistake, you should be ready to apologize and acknowledge your misstep. Do this in front of your sibling to show her the value of an apology and the importance of being humble and honest, even when you are wrong. This will allow your sibling to understand that it is okay to make mistakes and that it is essential to acknowledge them so you can move past them.

Go to the movies!,
Go to the local pool.,
Go to community events.,
Take trips to amusement parks.,
Have fun at parks, plain old parks.,
Go camping.",How to Avoid Boredom with Your Younger Sister (Kids and Teens)2," This may seem obvious, but you usually don't do it. You can do this in the comfort of your home, but a big theater with a big screen is very appealing. Choose a movie that you both love and convince your parents to bring you there sometime.

, Not every town has a pool, but if you are lucky enough to have one nearby, it usually doesn't cost a lot. The year memberships are really a steal, but if you are not going to go there a lot just pay every time. It is also a great opportunity to meet new friends!

, There is probably an event at your local library next Saturday, or a big town picnic in the park tomorrow. Great place to meet friends and hang out with your sis. Make sure not to leave your sis deserted while you talk to your friends!

, They may cost a lot, but they are worth it. If you can convince your parents to bring you there, it may be a memory for life!

, Everyone has a park close to them. It is awesome to play there with someone else, and can strengthen your relationship with your sister. You can even walk there if you're close enough, which means no parents required! Girls' day out? Awesome!

, Take a tent, pack a bag, and you're ready to stay in the wilderness for a night! It's best to go out, even if not the real wilderness, but maybe a camping place. Or your backyard will do.

Play ""lava"".,
Try card games!,
Play family.,
Put on a fashion show.,
Play the word game.,
Try hand games.,
Sing!,
Play with electronics.",How to Avoid Boredom with Your Younger Sister (Kids and Teens)3," This is a fun game that you might have played before. You pretend the floor is lava and you cannot touch it otherwise you will burn. Hop around on chairs and sofas and tables! Use a blanket as a raft. Climb the stairs with two towels under your feet! ""Ahh! I got burned!"" Depending on how old your sister is, you can create rules.

, This might seem really old. But a fun game of Go Fish or War may just be the cure to your boredom.

, This is a pretty popular game. You can choose to be the mom or the big sister, or maybe you can even fill in as the baby and have your sis take care of you! You can include the supernatural or maybe some school romance.

, This might sound too hard, but it's not. Take some scarves, hats, little skirts, and get ready to go crazy! Put two hats on your shoulders and a scarf wrapped around your waist, and be Prince Charming! Put on a twirly skirt and a hat with a scarf as a highlight, and be a dancer! Or you can just put on random things on random places. Show off your creations to your sis!

, This is a harder game, so younger sisters may not be able to play. Starting from A, you try to think of the longest word. For example, you might put ""alphabetically"" for A, and your sis might put ""applesauce"" and you would win that round because you have more letters. Continue the game until Z, or just keep playing if you want a rematch!

, Pat-a-cake, Pebbles, and Miss Sue may seem old, but doing them will be fun. Especially going on the internet and memorising new ones together.

, Something most kids enjoy. Dance to a new song or pretend you are a singer on television. Maybe you can even make an interview for your sis later if she's really good!

, Video games, tablets, and handheld game systems can be tons of fun, especially on multi-player.

Offer to help them with chores or other commitments.,
Suggest they speak to a professional.",How to Be a Supportive Sibling1," If your sibling is going through a difficult time, such as a break up, the loss of a friend, or the loss of their job, stay in touch with them on a regular basis. Call them or text them daily with a friendly, “How are you?” or “How’s it going?” Send them funny videos or images to cheer them up, especially if you know they are not feeling great.Staying in contact with your sibling will let them know that you care about them and that you are there for them.

, If your sibling is struggling with their mental and physical health, you may suggest that they speak to a counselor or a therapist. Part of supporting your sibling is being honest with them and letting them know you are worried or concerned about them. They may need help beyond what you can provide as a sibling and a professional therapist or counselor may be the right answer.You may contact a mental health clinic nearby to see if there is a counselor your sibling could speak to. If your sibling lives on campus or goes to school, you can suggest that they speak to a school counselor.

Acknowledge your part in the drama.,
Apologize.,
Don’t feed the drama.,
Find common ground.,
Don’t immediately label something as “drama.” Sometimes you might be tempted to label something as drama when you don’t really want to deal with it.,
Recognize the difference between bullying and drama.,
Breathe.,
Use “I” statements rather than “you” statements.,
Be mindful of your own emotions.,
Don’t yell or raise your voice.,
Keep an open and assertive but not aggressive posture.,
Assess the situation.,
Determine whether you’ve given a sincere attempt to diffuse it.,
Walk away from the situation.,
Assess the type of relationship you have and what you want with the other person.,
Walk away from the relationship, if possible.",How to Deal With Drama," Humility is one of the best ways to diffuse drama, as it takes the energy out of someone’s drama. By explaining where the mishap or misunderstanding occurred on your end you can start to diffuse the drama. If you did something intentionally, such as “forgetting” to mail an invitation, or refusing to send a thank you note to your mother-in-law, you need to own up to that and explain why you acted the way you did. You’ll also need to offer to make amends, if possible.If you made a mistake that led to the drama, you might say, “I misheard you the other day when you said we were meeting at seven. I thought you said eight, and so it’s my fault that I was late to the meeting.”
If you did something hurtful or unkind that led to the drama, you might say, “I felt that I was being silenced when you said you’d invite whomever you wanted—that’s why I ‘forgot’ to send the invitation to your best friend. It made me feel like my opinion didn’t matter. I can call them to extend the invitation now. It’s not too late.”;
, An apology can go a long way in diffusing drama. This goes beyond acknowledging your role, and includes sincere remorse, and often an attempt to ameliorate the situation or offer amends. You should apologize in person, if possible. Subtle cues that let the other person know you are sincere are oftentimes lost in texts or emails.You might say, “I’m sorry I said that I thought you weren’t contributing enough. I felt that I was doing a lot and I couldn’t see the behind-the-scenes work you were doing.”
If you are having trouble with feeling like you ought to apologize, try to conceptualize the other person’s feelings and why they might feel that way. You might also want to reflect on why you’re having trouble. Is it truly because you believe you did nothing to cause the drama or is it because of pride or fear?

, This is where you give the other party the reaction they’re looking for. Often, people want, whether they realize it or not, to escalate the drama. They want to feel vindicated for whatever wrong they feel has occurred, even if it is only minor.If, for example, you are late to dinner, and they get angry, don’t say, “Well, I would have been on time if it hadn’t been for having to pick up your dry-cleaning.” However true that might be, it will only feed the drama. Instead, you might say, “I see why you might be angry. I know you’re hungry because you had to skip lunch at work, and they were refusing to take your order until your entire party was here. Can I pick up your tab to make up for it?”

, Oftentimes, people who create drama feel misunderstood or like people aren’t interested in taking the time to get to know them. If you can find common ground, you may be able to diffuse the drama. This means taking the time to reflect on their experience and your experience of the situation and figuring out how you both can reach your goals.For instance, if you are making plans with a friend and they say, “You always pick the restaurant. I don’t understand why I can’t choose for once. You always want sushi, and I’m tired of it.” Whether or not this is true isn’t the point. You might respond, “How about we go to the food court at the mall, so we can both get what we want?” By offering something that the other party might find amenable, you can help diffuse their anger.

, It can create drama to call something “drama” that isn’t. For instance, if your friend is upset because they were harassed by someone on the street, and you say (having witnessed it), “I think you’re just taking it too seriously. Stop making everything so dramatic.” This is dismissive and will likely cause the drama you want to avoid. You should avoid labeling the following as drama:When someone discloses a traumatic experience.
When you are called out for racism, sexism, homophobia, or any type of bigotry.
When you passionately disagree with a friend about something important to you both.

, Drama is typically an overreaction by a friend or acquaintance, whereas bullying is any behavior that is aggressive, unwanted, repetitive, and used to assert power. If you feel you are being bullied, go to a teacher, supervisor, human resource representative, or counselor. Drama can turn into bullying, but not all drama is bullying., To deal with drama effectively, you’re going to have to remember to breathe—and deeply. When you breathe deeply, your body works to calm you down physiologically. Take several deep breaths before continuing the confrontation, and keep reminding your self to breathe slowly in the midst of the confrontation. This will help you keep a cool head as you attempt to diffuse the drama., When you’re in the midst of drama, you might be tempted to use a plethora of “you” statements. Avoid saying something like, “You did this! What were you thinking? You were the one who made this mess. You’re making me very angry.” Instead say, “I feel like you contributed to this situation. I feel angry that you weren’t there when I needed you.”, This means not acting impulsively on every emotion you feel in the moment. Instead, name the emotions to your self and ask yourself, “Are these feelings representative of reality?” If they aren’t, then let them go. If they are, ask yourself what they best way to convey them is, and what you hope to gain by conveying them. This way, you understand what role your emotions are playing in the drama, and whether they are likely to escalate or diffuse the drama., The tone you use can diffuse drama. By keeping your volume at a normal level, you are showing that you are calm even as they try to stoke the flames of the drama.Yelling is a sign that our bodies are physiologically aroused. It can also be damaging to others’ health and wellbeing. So, not only will yelling increase the drama, it hurts people and relationships., Keep your posture open. This means uncrossing your arms and relaxing the shoulders. This will help to diffuse the drama as it sends subtle cues to the other person that you are calm, but assertive. It can unnerve some people who are loud and aggressive on the outside but insecure and fearful on the inside. To avoid being aggressive in your posture, don’t invade other people’s space. You’ll also want to refrain from being rigid in your stance., Before walking away from drama, you’ll want to understand what’s going on and if the conflict can be resolved. You’ll want to weigh the various factors, the people involved, the cost of walking away (Will you lose your job? Will you end a friendship?). Assessing the situation should help you gain perspective of what you should do., Sometimes it’s tempting to give up without even trying. Unless there’s a pattern of drama that never seems to get diffused (with a co-worker, for instance), you might want to at least give diffusing the situation a fair shot., Sometimes, you may just need to walk away from the situation for a small time. You might both be too emotional to solve the conflict in that moment, or the drama may have distorted the situation. In any case, sometimes everyone needs a breather, especially when the drama is from someone we love., Are they your spouse, a co-worker, a friend or a casual acquaintance. Do you want to work through the drama? You’ll have to discuss this with them, and tell them your feelings. This might create more drama for a period, but that might help you make a decision about whether you want such a toxic person in your life. If you can work through it, then your friendship will be the stronger for it., Sometimes this might mean formally ending a relationship (quitting a job or firing an employee) or simply creating distance between you and a dramatic friend. This is a hard choice, but if someone is constantly being toxic, and causing you emotional distress over small things, you need to evaluate the relationship. If someone wants to be friends again and you don't, it's perfectly okay to tell them that. You get to choose your friends, and if you don't want to be friends with someone, no one can force you to do so. You might say, ""I'm sorry that I can't be friends with you right now. I've been really hurt by your drama in the past, and I'm not over it. Maybe someday we can be friends again, but not right now.""

Distinguish between healthy drama and real problems.",How to Deal With Drama Among Friends," Communicating with your friends and trying to work problems through is one of the most important ways to smooth over drama. Ultimately, by opening dialogue and avenues of communication, you'll help your friends figure out a way to get past whatever drama has put your friendships at risk.


Ask friends involved in drama if there is anything you can do to help.
When talking to them, try to identify the problem and see if there is a larger issue going on. Talking is the only way to find out if someone is in an abusive relationship or is suffering from some other difficulties in their life.
Explain that ""talking it over"" with a non-interested third party might help solve the problem. It might give them perspective.
Don't get directly involved, but rather, be the person who is happy to listen and offer feedback.;
, If talking is not enough, you might need to take action and become a peacemaker and mediator to make sure your friends and friendships stay together. If there is drama in your social circle, you can choose to try to intervene in order to avoid further complications among your friends. Remember, though, if you take on the role of mediator, you might put yourself in danger of alienating one friend in order to preserve another friendship.


Make sure everyone knows you are neutral and you have the friendship of the group as your main objective.
Send messages to your friends over social media that encourage them to talk about their problems with each other.
Set up a meeting where you invite people involved in the drama and then act to have them work out their problems.
Send social media messages to the group explaining the different perspectives of everyone involved in the drama.Relay messages between friends who are not on speaking terms.

, One of the best ways to reduce drama is to promote a positive climate in which people focus on each other's positive qualities and avoid negativity. This way, drama will be averted and any drama that does occur may be overshadowed by goodwill.


Root each other on, rather than being overly competitive. If we can view our friend's successes as our own successes, we'll have a more positive outlook and healthier friendships.
Talk positive about everyone and give people compliments regularly.
Regardless of what is happening, remind all of your friends of the good times they've had with each other and of everyone's positive qualities., Keeping everyone occupied by engaging in enjoyable activities will help reduce drama. This will help everyone refocus their attention on enjoying each other's company rather than recent drama. It's very possible some of your friends who have been having a rough patch might forget about their drama if they're having a really good time with each other.


Organize a group get together. Have everyone bring food and drinks. Use the opportunity to make peace.
Propose everyone goes out to a movie together.
If the county fair is in town, try to organize an outing to the fair.
Propose going to a party or another gathering where you all can relax and hangout., Chances are there are others in your social circle who also want to reduce drama. Your odds of reducing drama and repairing friendships will certainly be higher if others are cooperating in your effort.


Work with your friends to preserve friendships and reduce drama in the group.
Talk to your friends about how you can bring peace to the group.
Remember, try not to create a schism or clique in your group if it is a social group you want to maintain. But rather, use your non drama-prone friends as an anchor in a sea of drama. , Ultimately, people who love drama thrive off of conflict and attention. Engaging in an argument or even a debate with someone like this will undoubtedly cause you even more of a headache. If you’ve got skin in the game on something that the drama-prone person is bothered about, try your best to avoid conflict.


Remember that even if you “win” a conversation or debate, you’ll lose because the person is likely to blow things out of proportion and cause you a major headache.
If you notice the person trying to create conflict with you, politely excuse yourself from the situation. If you can’t because you’re in a classroom setting or at a party and you don’t want to be rude, try to change the subject or talk to someone else.
Back down, unless you want a fight. Backing down if the drama-prone person has targeted you is the best way to avoid drama and to settle the conflict. It doesn’t even really matter if you’re wrong or right. Just try to end the conflict. If the nature of your relationship is turning you into someone who is a pushover with the drama-prone person, consider ending the friendship., When you identify unhealthy drama and clearly see someone being destructive to themselves and the others around then, stay away. Avoiding drama when it is in action is the way to maintain your sanity. After all, oftentimes drama-prone people feed off of the interests and sympathy of other people. If a drama-prone person has no audience, the drama will die like a fire without fuel., One of the most important things in managing drama is making sure you don’t feed it or provoke more. Perhaps the best way to provoke more drama is to engage your friend in a conversation about it. This will give your friend both attention and opportunity. If they feed off of drama, you’ll only make it worse.


If your drama-prone friend always gets riled up over relationship issues, don’t inquire.
If your drama-prone person tends to over-react about situations they’ve had with strangers, don’t encourage it by mentioning anything.
If your drama-prone person likes to target other friends in your social circle, don’t bring up those people., Establish firm lines about how much time and energy you’ll devote to drama within your friend circle. If you don’t, drama will wind up dominating your social life and will certainly cause you a lot of unhappiness and grief. Consider:

Ending conversations after 5-10 minutes once they’ve devolved into drama. Do so politely, Tell your friends that you’ve got to do something else.
Avoid phone calls or other situations that you know will devolve into drama. If your friend is calling you, and you know it’s going to be about something negative, let the phone go to voicemail.
Agree to socialize in places and at events where you know you can escape if the drama is too much., For a lot of people, a little drama might not be a bad thing. However, if you’ve got someone you like who is drama-prone, you might just want to enjoy them in small doses. This will preserve your friendship but help you keep your sanity.


Plan outings with them that you know you can escape, like a festival where you’re meeting up and you know you can leave.
Socialize with them only occasionally, like once or twice a month.
Surround yourself with others so you don’t have to bear the brunt of the drama. Socializing with dramatic people at a party or somewhere else might be okay if you can excuse yourself to get a drink when the drama gets too intense., Eliminating people from your life is one of the last things you’ll want to do if drama comes to dominate your social life. However, cutting people out entirely might be necessary if all they do is bring drama and negativity to your social life.


Make sure you put a lot of thought into this before you do so.
Think about making the choice to tell the person why you’re ending your relationship. However, this might result in more drama, so tread lightly.
Slowly phase out of a friendship or relationship. If you’re going to cut someone out and want to avoid the drama of just disappearing, slowly phase out. Decline invitations here and there so it’s not a sudden or traumatic thing for your friend., At first glance, you might think that your social circle is completely dysfunctional and that perhaps you shouldn’t be friends with the people around you. Before you start ending friendships and burning bridges, try to identify the true cause of the problem. Consider:


Thinking coldly and rationally about the role of everyone in your social circle. Try to set yourself apart and view your social circle objectively. You might favor certain people, but they might be the problem.
Is there one person who consistently cause problems?
Are there a couple people who just don’t get along?, There are a number of things that drama-prone people do that others don’t. If you’ve got a substantial amount of drama in your social circle, create a little check list to help confirm the source of the drama. It might be one person, it might be a couple people, or it might the result of certain people socializing. Consider:


Does someone take it upon themselves to become involved in conflict when they have no reason to be?
Does someone see conflict where there probably isn’t any conflict?
Does conflict seem to be normalcy for a particular individual?
Does conflict arise when two or more individuals socialize?, Try to put some time into figuring out what motivates your drama-prone friend. Motivations for drama are often psychological in nature. Figuring out the cause of the drama might help you minimize it or at least shelter yourself from the fallout.


Your drama prone friend might just be insecure.
Perhaps your drama prone friend is the victim of abuse.
There could be romantic rivalry or something similar among people in your social circle. , While drama is often an over-reaction to normal problems, there are real issues that could cause someone to be upset. You should be able to differentiate between drama and real problems. If you can distinguish between the two, you’ll be able to avoid unhealthy drama and offer support to a friend who is in need.


Real problems can include family issues, relationship problems, and interpersonal problems and are easily confused with drama if you don’t understand the person and the issue.
If your friend reaches out for help about a new issue, wants to talk about it, or wants to merely vent, allow them the opportunity.
Drama can often be distinguished from real problems because it is a reoccurring issue that your friend won’t give up, won’t resolve, and won’t take any positive steps to deal with.
Real problems are those that your friend will, after some thought, try to resolve positively and through communication."

Refuse to participate in the drama.,
Steer the conversation away from the drama.,
Put some distance between you and the dramatic person or people.,
Redirect the person's focus away from how he feels.,
Remember that you aren’t obligated to carry her emotional burdens.,
Limit your time with him.,
Let her know you don’t want to be involved.,
Understand that this person may have genuine mental health issues.,
Remember that the drama might stem from childhood issues.,
Keep in mind that the person likely just wants attention.",How to Deal With Drama Queens or Kings," The dramatic person wants attention, and by participating in whatever crisis she's attempting to drag you into, you’re feeding that need. If you resist this, and refuse to engage with her, you can short-circuit the whole situation and possibly diffuse the drama.If the dramatic person starts up, simply tell her outright that you won’t be putting up with it. You can do so firmly without also being rude or harsh. Say something like, “Listen, I know you’re upset, but I really can’t get involved.”
Instead, give the person the attention and validation she is seeking only when she is engaging in more positive behavior (i.e. talking about positive topics, asking about others, etc.). Do not provide any attention, reaction, validation, or interest in drama-related topics (i.e. complaining, gossip, negative self-talk, etc.).;
, If this is a classmate or a co-worker that you can’t get away from, the next best thing you can do is try to divert his attention. If he is upset and being dramatic, try to shift his attention and energy to something else. Suggest something else you can talk about or focus on. You can try to turn the problem he is having back on him, rather than allowing him to blame you or put the burden on you.Even if the dramatic person is having a fit, you can still avoid engaging with him by simply changing the subject. Say something like, “I’m sorry you’re upset. Did you want to go get some lunch?” That way, you’ve acknowledged him, but not allowed the issue to go any further.

, Physically remove yourself from the situation, if you can. Leave, walk away, or go to another room. If you can’t leave or walk away, put some emotional distance between you and the dramatic person instead. Disconnect yourself from the problems she is causing, and focus on something else.


Excusing yourself politely is one way to leave her to her own issues. Say something like, “I really wish I could help, but I have an appointment.” Or, you could be direct with her and say, “I wish I could help, but I need a little space right now.”, If the person is throwing a fit about something, get him to talk about the actual thing that’s upsetting him, rather than just about how it’s making him feel. This will help him keep from spiraling into an emotional rampage. Ask him to tell you exactly what happened, and focus on that.Use simple questions to keep him on track. Ask something like, “What do you think you could do about this to make it better?”
Redirecting his focus away from his emotions is a good way to keep from engaging with his dramatics. Instead, you’re urging him to approach things from a more level-headed and less dramatic perspective.

, You might feel the need to “fix” or help her, but it’s not your problem or responsibility. These people thrive on attention and others feeling pity for them. You won’t be able to change the person, so don’t make it your problem to do so.It’s important to remember to let these kinds of people figures themselves out on their own. They will have to come to their own understanding of their problems and how to solve them, and you can’t be held responsible for the outcome.

, Dealing with a dramatic person can be extremely exhausting, especially if you give him a lot of time, focus, and energy. Even if the person is a friend, don’t be afraid to limit the time you’re willing to spend dealing with his problems. Setting this kind of boundary is important for you and your own sanity, but also for the other person to become more self-reliant.If the dramatic person begins to have a meltdown or outburst, say something like, “I only have a few minutes, so try and tell me the facts.” This will hopefully redirect his emotion and also limit the amount of time you’ll be engaged with the issue.

, Sometimes, the best way to handle a dramatic person is to tell her outright that you aren’t interested in dealing with drama. It might seem harsh, but it’s a quick and painless way to get right to the point and avoid the issue altogether.You have to think of your own best interests, and dealing with dramatic people can be emotionally draining and stressful. It’s not a bad thing to need to step away from a person who stresses you out, and it’s okay to tell her exactly why you’re walking away.

, Some people who are chronically dramatic, even over the smallest things, may actually suffer from a personality or mood disorder. This is usually a more extreme case, and is more likely when the severely dramatic behavior shows up in all aspects of his life.Some dramatic people may have personality disorders or mood disorders in which they tend to over exaggerate problems and are prone to attention-seeking behaviors.Even if the dramatic person you’re dealing with does suffer from a mental health problem, remember that it’s still not your job or responsibility to fix or cure him. If the drama seems to be a real, critical problem, you might suggest that he seek therapy or counseling.

, Some people who grow up to become drama queens and kings suffered from some kind of neglect as a child. These people may have had parents who ignored them, or brushed off their problems. In turn, they resorted to acting out or behaving dramatically just to get the attention they craved.There is even a link to other types of childhood trauma, including things like surviving a natural disaster or dealing with abuse. These things could also ultimately lead to a young person or adult who seeks attention through acting out or behaving dramatically.

, The primary goal of drama queens and kings is to get attention. By blowing small problems out of proportion and over exaggerating their feelings and emotions, the person is hoping to pull other people in and receive attention, sympathy, or pity. It’s your choice, in the end, if you choose to give in and give her attention, or to walk away and not let her affect you.You might even notice that these drama kings and queens don’t seem to care about your input, unless you’re validating them or encouraging their behavior. Giving the person genuine advice, urging her to calm down, or insisting the problem isn’t that big might just result in her getting more upset.

Share your feelings with your sibling.,
Be a good listener.,
Offer guidance and advice.",How to Be a Supportive Sibling2," A big part of being supportive of your sibling is making sure you are honest and share your feelings with them. Don’t be shy about sharing how you are feeling. Tell your sibling when you are feeling emotional and be honest with them. Use “I” statements when you express your feelings.For example, you may tell your sibling, “I am feeling down today” or “I want to support you right now, even though I’ve had a long day.”

, Support your sibling by being a good listener, so they feel they can confide in you. Maintain eye contact with your sibling and nod as they speak to show them you are listening. Avoid interrupting them and wait until they are done speaking to ask them thoughtful questions.Try to practice active listening, where you listen to your sibling speak without interruption. Then, once they are done, respond by repeating back what they said to you. You may say, “What I’m hearing you say is…” or “What I think you meant is…”. Once they have confirmed you heard them correctly, you can respond to them.
Doing active listening will ensure you are both communicating effectively with one another and listening to each other closely.

, If your sibling confides a problem or issue to you, try to offer guidance and advice. Listen to what they have to say first and then ask them thoughtful questions. Wait for your sibling to ask for your opinion or for advice before you give it.


Make suggestions, offer advice, but do not pressure your sibling to take your advice. Ultimately, they are their own person and should make their decisions on their own.
For example, you may offer advice to your sibling by saying, “In my opinion…” or “My advice is to…”.

Step away from the conversation and take a five minute time out where you go off on your own to calm down and think. Then, return and start the conversation again with your sibling in a more relaxed manner.

, Sometimes siblings can be divided when one sibling sides with one parent or with other relatives. Try to support your sibling when they are in a conflict with a family member, even if you may not agree with their choice. Listen to their concerns and remind them that you love and care for them, despite the conflicts in the family.


For example, you may say to your sibling, ""I don't agree with you siding with mom on this issue. But I want you to know that I love and care for you. I will support you.""

, Support your sibling by doing a new hobby or activity together. This way you can both bond and feel acknowledged. Having a hobby or activity in common can help you and your sibling bond. It will also allow you to both support each other and recognize each other’s accomplishments.Take a fitness class, a craft class, or a cooking class together. Try a new hobby like knitting, painting, or tackle a new video game.

, Make sure you devote a portion of your schedule to spending quality time with your sibling. Have a meaningful conversation over lunch. Spend time doing a fun activity together, like preparing a meal, listening to music, or going for a walk.Having regular quality time with your sibling will take time and effort, but this will help to maintain your relationship.


If you and your sibling both have your own families, then plan family outings together and make time for family get-togethers.
Stay in contact with your nieces and nephews. If you have nieces and nephews, then be a good uncle/aunt by keeping regular contact with them.
You can also involve your other family members and spend time together as a family. Doing this can make you all feel supported and loved. Your sibling may also feel they can lean on their other family members, as well as you.
Plan a trip to visit your sibling once per year if they live far away.

Avoid asking a drama queen how they're feeling.,
Recognize hyperbolic language.,
Tell them to only share the facts.,
Do not reward negative behavior.,
Figure out your limits.,
State your boundaries directly.,
Assert yourself when necessary.,
Seek support from others if necessary.,
Confront your investment in drama.,
Take time to replenish yourself.,
Spend time with supportive people.,
Distance yourself if necessary.",How to Deal With a Drama Queen," Drama queens are dramatic by nature and need an audience for this. Asking someone you know is a drama queen how they're doing usually leads to trouble. This can invite a drama queen to vent or complain, so try to minimize interactions that encourage sharing.Try to be polite to a drama queen, especially if you work with them. However, do not invite small talk. You can say ""Good morning"" to a drama queen, but do not follow up with, ""How is your day going?""
In some situations, it may feel rude not to ask a drama queen how they're feeling. For example, if they ask you first you may feel obligated to ask in return. In this case, try to minimize your interactions. Do not let a drama queen talk too much before excusing yourself, saying something like, ""I'm sorry, but I'm late to a meeting."";
, Sometimes, you need to know how to decode what a drama queen is saying. If someone is prone to exaggeration, check in with reality when talking to them. This way, you won't get unnecessarily stressed due to someone else's tendency for drama.Drama queens tend to use hyperbolic language, blowing small matters out of proportion. A drama queen may, for example, say things like, ""My boss hates me, so I'm getting fired."" They may also lash out at you when feeling dramatic, saying things like, ""You never listen to me anyway.""
These things are usually a drama queen's way of blaming problems on outside drama rather than their own choices. For example, saying their boss hates them is probably an exaggeration. They probably made a poor choice at work and, while they were reprimanded, they will not be fired. Accusing you of not caring or listening is a way to distract themselves from a negative situation by starting fights with friends, family members, and co-workers.
Always try to decipher what a drama queen is really saying, and keep in mind the situation is not as dire as they make it seem.

, Drama queens tend to editorialize. You may ask them for a run down of events and they may launch into a dramatic story, in which they are often the victim of circumstances beyond their control. If a drama queen is embellishing and exaggerating, remind them you really need the objective facts.For example, you ask a drama queen why a co-worker was late for work and the drama queen launches into a story about how stressful the co-worker's absence was for them. They may also make accusations about the co-worker's behavior, and say things like, ""I would never be allowed to show up that late.""
Stop this kind of talk in it's tracks. Say something like, ""Can you just stick to the facts? I really just need to know why Sophie was late, please.""

, Drama queens often act out for attention. A drama queen may exaggerate their emotions, acting more upset or invested in a situation than they actually are. Engaging with this behavior only rewards it. Even negative reactions are feeding into a drama queen's need for attention. Disengage when a drama queen acts out. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself you don't have to react to bad behavior.For example, a co-worker comes into work clearly in a bad mood. You know this person is a drama queen. They're deliberately trying to get people to ask them what's wrong, sighing loudly and commenting about their bad day.
The drama queen is seeking attention, and will likely drag anyone who bites into a spiral of drama. Instead of responding, focus on your own work. If necessary, say something like, ""Sorry you're feeling bad, but I've got work to do.""

, Everyone has personal limits regarding their time and emotional energy. Think about how much a drama queen's behavior stresses you out, and which behaviors cause you the most stress. These are the behaviors you do not have to tolerate. You are your own person with your own stress and you are not obligated to endlessly help another person.It can be helpful to write down a list of behaviors that bother you. What does this person do that causes you stress? Maybe they text you constantly when they're stressed about something. Maybe they exaggerate money problems when they're upset, even though they know you're genuinely struggling.
Rank how much these behaviors bother you on a scale of one to 10 stress wise, one being the lowest and 10 being the highest. The behaviors on the higher end of the scale are behaviors you should no longer tolerate.

, Sit down with the person and let them know, directly, your feelings. Tell them there are certain behaviors you will no longer tolerate from them. Be specific about this, and get to the point right away.Do not beat around the bush. Simply tell the person how you're feeling and what limits you're setting. For example, say, ""Can I talk to you about how you communicate with me when you're stressed?""
From there, clearly state what your boundary is. Say something like, ""You cannot complain to me about money anymore. Your stories about your financial situation and inconsistent, and as a result I end up getting stressed about something that isn't really a problem. You know I'm paying off medical bills right now, and so money is a touchy subject.""

, Drama queens often try to push boundaries. It is exciting for them to push people's buttons and cause drama. If the drama queen violates your boundaries, assertively restate them. This not mean being aggressive, as this is what the drama queen wants. Instead, calmly state what is bothering you as a reminder.For example, say something like, ""Hey, sorry, but we talked about this. I can't help you with money problems right now.""

, A drama queen may continue to violate your boundaries, even after you've clearly stated them. You may have to seek support from other people close to the drama queen. Let them know what's been going on and ask them politely to back you up. This is particularly important if this is a work situation. You may have to enlist the help of your boss.Say something like, ""I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm having an issue with a co-worker. I just need your help enforcing some boundaries."" From there, calmly explain the issue and let your boss or manager know what they can do. For example, you may want to work different shifts from this person in the future.

, Are there a lot of drama queens in your life? If so, you may be attracting drama in some way. Reflect on your past and present relationships with dramatic people and honestly assess whether you tend to draw the drama in, intentionally or not.Think about what you get out of a relationship with a dramatic person. Do you feel better about yourself when compared to a drama queen? Do you get bored easily and crave the thrill of drama?
Think about other ways you could fill the needs a drama queen fills. For example, if you feel bored with life, try taking up a new hobby or joining a club.

, If interacting with a drama queen is unavoidable, give yourself a break afterwards. Find something to do to recharge after interacting with a drama queen. For example, listen to your favorite song on your headphones on your commute home if you had to deal with a dramatic co-worker., If you work with a drama queen, you will need to spend time with supportive people. Seek out friends, family members, and co-workers who tend to be more supportive and loving. Make a point of interacting with these people more, especially after spending time with a drama queen.For example, if you work with a drama queen, try to have lunch with a pleasant co-worker to compensate.

, If someone keeps violating your boundaries, distance yourself. Stop returning texts and phone calls. Lessen social interactions. If someone is genuinely depleting you with their drama, it's okay to walk away."

Love them in spite of the things they do and the ways they are that don't necessarily agree with your viewpoints or expectations in life. Your siblings are unique individuals, just as you are too.;
, One of the main ways to show someone you respect them is to listen to their point of view. Whether you agree with them or not, your siblings should be able to have their own views.Behave civilly toward them and speak nicely to your brother or sister. Be polite and considerate of your siblings.

, If you have a conflict with your sister or brother, work it out in a calm and respectful manner, remembering that both of you need to get along at the end of the day. Seek compromises on the things you don't see eye to eye about. If a conflict arises between you and your sibling, stay calm. Manage your stress in the situation as fast as you can. Control your emotions in conflicts and pay attention to the feelings of your sibling.If your sister steals your favorite dress then loses it, instead of screaming at her, try calmly saying, “I would appreciate it if you would please ask me first before you borrow my clothes. Can you please repay me for the dress? It was my favorite.”

, Be proud of your siblings and notice their accomplishments, their strengths and all of their virtues. Let your sister know how great she's doing being a sister, mother, daughter, and friend. Remind your brother how wonderful a brother, father, son, and friend he is, too.


When your brother gets into his first choice college express how it makes you feel, “I am so proud of you for getting into such a competitive college. You have worked so hard and are going to do great there.”

, Forgive yourself for what you have done to your sister or brother in the past and forgive them for what they have done. There is no point in holding a grudge over something that has already happened and there is no point beating yourself up about something you did a long time ago. Start things over with a clean slate., Although you have to see your sibling at certain events and family dinners, don’t just make that the minimum. Show up to your sister’s soccer game or your brother's spelling bee. Show you care about your siblings by making an effort to support them at their events., Have your sister’s back, be loyal to her and support her in the face of her adversities. Stick up for your brother and let him know if there are people he cannot trust or rely on. Let your siblings know that they can rely on you, no matter what.


Let your siblings know you're just a phone call away and that you're always there to listen: ""If you ever need to talk you can just call me. I am always here for you, no matter what you need.""

, If your brother experiences difficulties, give him a helping hand. If he has trouble with his studies or work assignments, see whether you can help out, even if it's just a listening ear. If your sister is having problems with her intimate relationship, be a non-judgmental listener and give her all of your support.


Even if they don’t ask for help, reach out, “It looks like you are struggling with your math homework, can I help you?”

, If your sibling could benefit from something you have that they don’t have, offer to share it with them. Unless they have given you good reason to not trust them with your things, you should feel good about sharing with them.

, Although it might be tempting to tell your parents all the dirt you have on your brother or sister, keep it to yourself. Unless the secret is serious and your sibling is in danger, don’t be a tattle-tale. Being a caring sister means thinking of your sibling first and if getting them in trouble is not necessary then don’t tell., The best memories are those made in the moments enjoyed together, the fun experiences you have that make you both laugh and smile. Go out and do something fun together.


Don’t spend too much time discussing serious things, especially if you disagree on the topics — such as politics or religion. Have fun conversations and let your humor shine through when you talk to your siblings., As much as you might want to complain to your mom about the big fight you got in with your sister at the mall or how you can’t stand your brother’s new girlfriend, keep it to yourself. Don’t gossip about your brother or sister to your friends or family. This will prevent harsh feelings and misunderstandings., Show you are a caring sister by making the relationships with your siblings a priority. Some siblings never speak and some hang out every day, it is up to you to determine what your relationship with your siblings is going to be like. Put effort into spending time with and talking with your brother or sister to be a caring sister., You can only control your own actions, and it is possible that, no matter what you do, there will be times when your sibling won't be helpful, or honest, or behave toward you the way you behave toward them. Being a good sister should not be conditional — you should still put effort into being a caring sister, even if your sibling doesn't return the kindness.

Keep in mind that younger siblings may need more time to grow into these types of mature behaviors.

, You'll have been through much together in life, and you both understand each other better than many people do. Stay in touch as often as possible throughout life and make plans to spend time together when you're no longer living under the same roof.


No matter where you are, no matter how many miles apart, you're always connected by the heart.

, Although deep talks with your sister are great, casually texting her regularly is a great way to be a caring sister. If something hilarious happens to you in the middle of the day, text your brother about it so he knows you were thinking about him. Snapchat your siblings the funny videos you send to your friends. Include your siblings in your day-to-day life by using technology to show you care about them."

Never talk badly about other people behind their backs, no matter what.,
Be nice to everyone!,
Occasionally when it's needed, try putting others before yourself.,
Don't tell someone else's secrets!,
Stay out of other people's drama!,
Note: If you fight fire with fire, you'll end up getting burned.

,
Do not deny something when someone asks you ""did you do this?",How to Avoid Drama with Friends," It may be a fun thing to do at the time, because there's a whole other group of people doing it, but most of the time it comes back to haunt you. The person will find out and if it's a friend of yours, it can cause a fight.;
, There's no reason to be mean to others, even if they start something with you first. It'll keep everything more peaceful and calm that way.

, For example, if your friend is having troubles at home, and they need to get out of the house and just talk, maybe you can stop what you're doing (if you're doing something that isn't too important) and go help your friend. People will think of you as a better person, and won't really have a reason to be mad at you.

, Of course your friend is going to find out, from another so called friend, and they are going to confront you about this, this can lead to a lot of things, like people turning against you, and your secrets being told.

, There's no reason for you to get into the middle of someone else's fight. Let them work it out on their own. Because whenever people do this, even if it's just to help a friend, you usually get dragged into it and end up having people turned against you in one way or another (this doesn't apply to putting others before yourself, in some situations you really can't).

Identify the source early on.,
Think before you act.,
Rein in your emotions.,
Act constructively.",How to Avoid Drama1," When you find yourself time and time again in situations that always seem to escalate into drama, take a step back. Consider each situation on its own. Then compare it with the others. Identify what is similar or constant from one situation to the next so you know exactly when and where to improve your attitude when new situations arise. Ask yourself:


“Do these situations always occur between me and specific people?”
“Do they tend to happen at the same time (such as stressful periods like finals at school, unemployment, or the holidays)?”
“Am I the only common factor in all these instances?”;
, In the heat of the moment, avoid making a scene over nothing (or losing credibility by overreacting to something that does indeed need to be dealt with). When someone upsets you, take a breath or two before you respond to them. Think of yourself in the third person, as though you are watching yourself from the outside. Examine the reasons why this incident has upset you so you can deal with it in a thoughtful manner instead of acting impulsively.Ask yourself:


“Would I be as upset over this if other parts of my life (school, work, family, etc.) weren’t so stressful at the moment?”
“Am I really this upset over this one incident, or am I already angry with this person over something else entirely?”
“Would this person do the same thing to me if they knew how much it would upset me, or would they refrain in the future if I simply explained why I don’t appreciate this?”

, You’re not a robot, so allow yourself a moment to feel upset and angry. Give that feeling a chance to wash over you and then recede a little before you react. Resist the urge to attack the other person (emotionally, physically, or both), which will only make the situation much more stressful. Avoid the following traps:.


Engaging in a tit-for-tat exchange in an attempt to hurt the other person as much as they hurt you.
Insisting that you get the last word in.
Plotting intricate revenge (or even just plain old revenge) in order to get back at them.

, Ride your initial emotions out a little. Identify the reason why you felt upset to begin with. Then think of what steps you can take to actually improve the situation, rather than simply extend it.Choose actions that will solve the matter here and now and reduce the chance of it happening again in the future. Consider whether or not:

Sharing your thoughts and feelings in a calm, straightforward manner will make the other person reconsider their own actions.Assuring them that they are safe to communicate honestly with you, too, will reduce the risk of future incidents.
Walking away from the situation entirely is the only real way to deescalate it."

Do not tell anyone whether or not you ""like"" someone.,
You may tell one trusted friend as a best friend which may help a little however don't make it a huge rumor as it will spread to your crush in an instant and cause huge drama within your school, easily breaking friendships and making it hard to focus on what's really important.,
Avoid wearing too much makeup, or wear sleazy clothing (heels, super tight jeans, low cut tops, short skirts, spaghetti straps or tees with rude or sleazy sayings on them, etc.).,
You will notice that at new schools, other girls will give you ""the look"".,
If anyone ever says to you, ""Hey, Jane, can I talk to you in private?"",
Be nice to everyone!,
Do not lie to anyone about anything, because if you get called out on more than 2 or 3 lies, people will start to see you as a liar and no one will trust you.,
Do not talk about anyone behind their back, it will catch up to you.,
Always go to the person who is saying something about you or someone you care about before you get mad and start things that don't need to be started.

,
If anyone starts to argue, and you're not the type of person to choose sides, just stand and listen!,
Don't get involved in other people's dramas.,
If your friends fight, be diplomatic.,
If you fall out with a friend, don't run around telling everyone.,
Popularity isn't everything.,
If someone has offended you, ignore it.,
You may find that you have a friend who cannot help getting into arguments.",How to Avoid Drama in School," It will come back to haunt you! The person whom you said you ""liked"" will hear it faster than most people and they will most likely spread the word and confront you about it!;
, Because when you look back at your school life it will just include drama and you would probably regret it. Crushes are fine, but wait at least a year or two after coming to a new school before you get involved with boys. Also don't tell anyone if you have a crush on a boy.

, This is usually the school dress code. Also, people will not want to be friends with you because they will think you're a really sleazy person.

, It's a dirty look that mixes the messages of ""don't mess with me"" and ""you'd better not be looking at my boyfriend"". Whatever you do, do not return the look or try to counteract the look with the ""stink eye"". Don't say anything, simply do a very casual closed-mouth smile. Also make sure your smile looks friendly, not ""cocky.

, and you are in a group of your friends, reply with something like, ""That's alright, you can say what you have to say, we're all friends here right?

, You don't necessarily have to be over-friendly to people that you dislike, but always be polite. This way you know that you are not giving anyone any reason to hate you, and if they do start hating on you, it's not your problem but theirs.

, That is the same if you tell peoples' secrets, they will not believe you!

, If someone around you begins to gossip about someone or says mean things, do not join if they ask you what you think, say ""They're fine"" or ""I like them"". An example of a conversation with gossip would be something like this; "" OH my gosh look at Jasmine's sleazy make-up! It looks so stupid! "" "" I think it looks decent. "". After you say anything of the sort the girl/boy you're talking to might give you a look, and leave the conversation, but ignore it.

,, It shows that you care, but you don't want to be involved in it any further.

, Chances are you will only make the situation worse when the whole thing could have been resolved quietly, and you'll be thought of as an interference.

, Hear both sides of the story, but don't take sides yourself. Doing so could seriously damage your friendships. Offer them both some advice, but allow them to fix the situation themselves. Never attempt to 'sort out' an argument between your friends - this never works. try to enlighten the mood as in make a joke and try not to be so serious as it could end up getting you involved, forget negative things and just don't care about it because it will help you to be happy and focus on your life ahead of you!

, Real friends don't let an argument get between them, and you will be likely to make up again later. If you go around telling everyone that you had an argument, everyone will start taking sides and spreading rumours until the whole thing is completely out of control. Even worse, every time someone tells somebody else about the argument, they may twist what was said until the only people who know what really happened will be you and the friend you fell out with. Therefore when you fall out with a friend, keep it between you and don't say mean things behind their back. If someone else hears of the argument and says mean things, ignore them. Doing otherwise will only get you in trouble.

, You may be popular but also very miserable. Lots of people tend to gravitate towards popular people and you may find yourself surrounded by people that you barely know or like. Big, popular groups also struggle a lot with dramas and confrontations. Clichéd as it sounds, it's better to have a small group of real friends who you know well and trust and who will stick by you.

, If you really must, talk to them calmly in a private place. Never walk straight up to them and start shouting.

, If this is the case, quickly lead them away and explain to them that it's not worth the drama, however angry they may feel. Try not to care about little negative things and stay happy and positive!

Make realistic commitments.,
Balance the people in your life.,
Refrain from making assumptions.,
Be wary of gossip.,
Know when to keep mum.",How to Avoid Drama2," Whether you are dealing with friends, family, significant others, or coworkers, resist the compulsion to please everyone all the time. Only promise time and devotion to people if and when you know you can deliver. Since drama may build up when people think you are “failing” them, clearly define your availability on a case-by-case basis right from the start. Let each person know exactly how much they can expect of you and when, and no more., The more people you include in your life, the more conflict you will have when it comes to scheduling your time. As you make new commitments to new people, incorporate them into your schedule so that no one else feels slighted by any perceived lack of attention. This may mean that you are less available overall for any given person, so be sure that you still make time for them regularly, if not as frequently as you have in the past.


Also know when to make exceptions to your usual schedule for special events like birthdays, weddings, graduations, etc., A lot of drama results from miscommunication or no communication at all. Of course, it is impossible to know everything all the time, so when someone upsets you, feel free to ponder the reasons why they acted as they did. Just be sure to clearly divide what you know for sure versus what you merely speculate. Only act on what you definitely know to be fact. If you’re going to assume anything, always assume that your assumptions may turn out to be flat-out wrong in the end., Don’t put too much stock in what other people tell you about events that you haven’t witnessed for yourself. People aren’t necessarily going to lie to you, but recognize that the “truth” may mutate from one person’s telling to the next’s. Accept other people’s versions as their own interpretations of what really happened, but resist passing your own judgment based on other people’s accounts., Although drama is so often the result of poor communication, oversharing the truth can be just as bad. Be honest and forthcoming when you speak with people, but know when to hold the truth back. If you anticipate that someone would be hurt by what you have to say, ask yourself if hearing it would be beneficial to them in the long run. If not, keep it to yourself."
"
Give people the benefit of the doubt at first.,
Track how one person’s dramas effect you.,
Know when enough is enough.,
Draw a line in the sand.",How to Avoid Drama3," When someone in your life comes to you to unload, lend them an ear. Resist the temptation to immediately write off their need to share everything that is bothering them as simple “drama” (which, obviously, we tend to regard as a “bad” thing).Even if the other person has a history of being melodramatic, appreciate the fact that this does not prevent them from experiencing genuinely crappy moments in life or needing real help from time to time..

, When the same person comes to you again and again with one drama after another, ask yourself if this is acceptable to you. Share your own troubles with them to see if this is a two-way street or if they really only expect you to be an audience for their own woes. Take a step back and assess whether their negative attitude is infecting your own outlook. Count the number of times when their various dramas have led you into situations that you would have rather avoided., If you feel like someone else’s drama is impacting your own life negatively, consider your history with that person. Consider whether your involvement in their past dramas did anything to improve matters for them. If it has, weigh how committed you really feel toward this person, and whether or not you feel obligated to continue being a source of support for them. But if your participation in their drama doesn’t do them any good anyway, be assured that you can quit taking part in it without making things worse for them., Refuse to participate in their dramas.If you wish to maintain your relationship, politely but honestly explain how all these dramas are really just polluting that relationship. Assure them that you wish to keep them in your life, but to do so, they need to keep their drama to themselves. Or, if you feel they can’t handle such upfront honesty, just refuse to engage in their dramas at all until they finally get the message and deal with them on their own.


If the other person doesn’t matter that much to you to begin with, the solution is much easier. Simply nix them from your life altogether to avoid being sucked into yet another drama (or at the most see them very sparingly)."

Keep gossip light.,
Encourage positivity.,
Don't yuck a yum.,
Have a group, not a clique.,
Keep your good friends.,
Argue gently.,
Look for the best in everyone.,
Create a long-view perspective.,
Get involved in projects.,
Avoid lying.,
Keep safe secrets.,
Confide in adults.",How to Be Drama Free (Tween Girls)," When you gossip, you're using information about others as entertainment. This is a natural human practice, but it can easily get out of hand. Two good rules for gossiping: don't gossip about your friends, and don't say anything you wouldn't want traced back to you.;
, Everyone in your group contributes to the mood of everyone else. If your friends are upbeat and positive, you will be happier, and vice versa. You can also get depressed and unhappy as a group.Together, try to focus on the positive. If you've all been complaining for a while, change the subject to something lovely.


You don't have to shut down all negative conversations. If anyone in your group is sad or upset, let her express how she feels.
However, sadness and negativity are different. Encourage your friends who are putting themselves and others down to be more positive.

, A great way to keep your friend group low-drama is to respect everyone's differences. Instead of pressuring everyone to like the same things, acknowledge the very different ways you all find joy. If a friend is happy about something, celebrate with her! Even if you don't care about the same thing, you can still recognize her happiness and encourage it.


Say your friend is excited about being picked to compete in a science fair, and you know nothing about science. Let her know you support her by asking questions and congratulating her. Even if you find science boring, you can get interested in the ways it interests your friend.
An easy way to practice is to not say ""gross"" or ""ew"" if your friend is eating something you hate. Her ""yum"" will be yummier without your ""yuck.""

, You can be friends with many people, have just one best friend, or have a group of friends you spend a lot of time with. If you do have a group of friends, avoid forming a clique. A clique is a group with intense power dynamics. It has leaders who decide who is ""in"" and who is ""out.""Cliques are drama-factories, because everyone is anxious about losing their place.


Ask your group: do we exclude other people when they want to be included? Are we always together? Is it safe to have other friends, or do we feel like we can only be friends with each other? If any of these things are true, you might have a clique.
Ask yourself: can I be who I am? Am I teased for doing things differently than my other friends? If so, you may be in a clique.
To deal with a clique, break the rules. Cliques can change quickly when members aren't afraid.
Make other friends, and let your other friends know that you still want to be their friend. However, say you want to be free to hang out with anyone, that you don't want to be bossed around, and that you don't want to be mean to anyone.
Do what you like. Don't be pressured into activities you don't actually enjoy. There is space for you to live the way you want to live.

, Be suspicious of anyone who tells you you have to abandon anyone you care about. When two of your friends are fighting, don't take a side if they ask you to. Let them work it out, and only contribute your opinion if you think it will help resolve the conflict.


There are cases when one friend might have seriously hurt someone else. You might have to make difficult decisions when you want to support someone who is hurting.
However, choose carefully, and don't let others pressure you before you have had time to think things through by yourself.
A good way to measure is to ask ""was my friend forced to do something she or he didn't want to do? Was anyone physically harmed? Was anyone lied to or manipulated?""

, Don't get teased or pushed into a fight or a fit. If a friend is mad at you, ask your friend to speak in a calm voice. You don't have to let anyone yell at you—walk away if you feel uncomfortable. If you are mad at a friend, wait until you are calm and then tell them calmly.


When you feel upset, or are in an argument, avoid starting any sentence with ""you."" Instead, use ""I"" statements: ""I felt hurt when you said I was copying my sister. I love my sister, but I don't want to be just like her.""

, You are going to meet people who try to start drama. Sometimes close friends of yours will do bizarre things, and sometimes total strangers will be mean out of nowhere. Know that everyone has complicated reasons for doing what they do. If someone is being negative, that usually means something negative has happened to them.Stand up for yourself. Report any bullying to an adult, and take distance from anyone who is cruel. Keep yourself calm by reminding yourself that you don't know what that person might be going through.

, When you feel overwhelmed with drama at school, step back and look at the big picture. You might be on this planet for 100 years. What will matter the most to you in 100 years? What will matter the most in 20 years? In 5 years?


People their deathbeds regret not being true to themselves.Have a sense of humor. The things that seem really dire to you as a tween may feel totally silly when you are older.
It's fine to have strong emotions and to want things badly. However, it is important to understand that your feelings will change.

, It's hard to get caught up in drama if you have a life of your own. Join clubs at school, join a team, get a part-time job babysitting, walking dogs, or mowing lawns. Read books that aren't homework. Make art. Sign up for extracurricular classes outside of school, and make friends who don't know your friends., You can get caught up in drama really quickly by telling lies. Lies are hard to maintain, even really simple ones. When you are caught in a lie, your friends might start thinking of you as a liar. Telling lies can also damage your ability to solve your problems.


Lies are shortcuts, and when you tell one, you are often getting around a problem without solving it.
For instance, if you lie and say you are doing your homework so that your parents will stop nagging you, you will eventually get in worse trouble for failing your classes.

, If someone tells you a secret, don't share it. Don't even tell one person. As long as your friend is not in danger, they have the right to privacy. However, if a friend tells you a secret that could mean they are in danger of being hurt or getting in trouble, tell an adult. Your teacher or your parents or guardians are good options.


Safe secrets you shouldn't tell: your friend has a crush, your friend feels dumb in class, your friend is annoyed with another friend but is trying to get over it, your friend has her period, your friend is seeing a therapist.
Dangerous secrets you should bring to an adult: your friend is throwing up her food or hardly eating at all, your friend is dating an older guy, your friend is cutting, your friend is taking drugs, your friend is being bullied or abused at school or at home.

, Find adults you can talk to who will listen to your concerns. If your parents are good listeners, talk to them. If you have a teacher you trust, talk to that teacher. Adults can help you keep small dramas in perspective, and they can help identify things that are truly worrying. For instance, you might be bothered by a friend suddenly being rude all the time, but an adult might be able to see that the friend is exhausted from trouble at home.


If you don’t have any adults you can count on, consider signing up for a mentoring program.A program such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters or Across Ages, will match you up with an adult who can talk with you and take you on adventures.Look online for mentoring programs in your area, or ask for recommendations from a counselor at your school.

Tell your twin how you feel about the current status of your relationship together.,
Decide among yourselves how that better relationship could be achieved.,
Make sure that you actually do those things you've added to the list.,
Don't tattletale on your twin.,
Be open.,
Give your twin great, personalized gifts on their birthday or at Christmas.,
Buy your twin lunch or treat them to dinner when you have the chance.,
Help your twin with their homework, assignments, work problems, etc.,
If you're a minor, talk to your parents about your unhappiness about not getting along with your twin if all else fails.,
If you are adults, consider seeking therapy together.",How to Have a Better Relationship with Your Twin," Elaborate on how you would like a good relationship and where you feel things aren't as great as they could be between the two of you. Be sure to point out all of the good reasons for having a healthy and friendly relationship together, to help get your message across and to provide solid reasons for your twin to decide also that a better relationship would be a good idea.


Focus on using ""I"" statements. Don't blame your twin for anything, especially not for how the relationship is. It takes two people to form a relationship and it is better to focus on what you want to achieve in the relationship than to complain about things that have or have not been done.;
, For example, you might make a list of the fun things you could do together. Or, you could make a list of things you want to learn how to do together, such as becoming amateur astronomers, learning a new language or cooking Vietnamese cuisine. Choose your shared activities wisely so that not only you like them, but your twin does also. While twins usually like the same things, this cannot be assumed, so ensure to ask your twin for advice and agreement.

, There is no point in planning anything if you aren't going to go ahead with the plans! Set dates together to go and do the things you've said you will.


When doing the activities together, talk. Let the conversation flow freely and without interruption. Be a good listener. It is likely that your twin will tell you many things and you'll learn a lot more about his or her feelings, wants, hopes and dreams by asking questions and listening more.

, Always stick up for your twin; even if they are wrong in the first place, you can highlight their good character traits to help their cause.


If you feel you have to say something about an action your twin has done, such as telling a parent or someone else, be factual and don't try to make this into a situation in which you come out smelling like roses. Be fair and thoughtful about how you explain the situation.
If you do tell on your twin, it is possible that he or she will lose some trust in you. It all depends on the context, the manner in which you told on them and what the consequences are.

, Tell your twin all the negative and positive things that are going on in your life- even your secrets! Even if your twin does blurt a few of them out, it isn't the end of the world. Once they know you trust them, they will try to keep that trust. Also, talk to your twin about things you have in common for a more prolonged, interesting conversation.

, Hand make the cards for your twin for that extra-special touch. If you struggle for ideas, decide on the theme of your card being something you would like because sometimes without realizing, twins' personalities are very similar and they appreciate the same things as each other.

, After a nice day out with your twin, this is the perfect cherry on top of the cake! This provides another opportunity for conversation and time to get to know each other.

, If you have an expertise in a subject, area or topic that they aren't too hot on, they will take up your offer to help in a heartbeat. This shows your twin you are caring and will look out for them, which can come as a great feeling on both sides of a twin relationship.

, Parents can give good advice but sometimes it is best to talk alone with your sibling in this sort of matter. However, they can be supportive as all parents want their children to get along.

, If your twin agrees to this, it might be a healthy way to get a third party intermediary to help the two of you get your grievances out into the open in a constructive and caring way, mediated by the counselor or therapist. Of course, both of you must agree to this.

Tell your sibling that you want to help them.,
Help them get the supplies that they'll need.,
Give them instructions about the school.,
Don't make fun of your sibling, or your sibling's friends.,
Give them real-life advice.,
Let your sibling experiment.,
Invite your sibling over for lunch.,
Just talk to your sibling.,
Help with homework.,
Be proud of your sibling.",How to Help Your Sibling Adapt to Their New School," Of course, you want to make sure that your sibling knows what you're doing, or else they might think you have nothing to do and are intruding with their personal life. If they don't want much help, that's okay. You can still help by telling them a few tips and tricks, or helping with homework.
, Remember when it was your first year of middle school or high school, and you were panicking to get every- and anything? And then how it turned out you didn't need 1 million notebooks? You probably have some extra supplies that you can give to your sibling. After all, you wouldn't want to be stuck carrying around unnecessary things. There's no reason why you can't help your sibling, at least with something like this!, It's a horrible feeling to be late to class on the first day of school, so imagine how your sibling feels thinking that might happen! You've been to the school for at least a year, you know the layout. Even if you don't have your sibling's schedule, make them a map showing the different classrooms, even the ones they don't need to know. If there are any ""landmarks"" in the school, include them. People typically find it useful when there are landmarks, not just in schools., While it might seem fun to poke fun at people who are younger and less experienced than you, don't do it. Nobody wants to be friends with the person who makes fun of random people! Besides, making fun of your sibling at school can be a great way to get in trouble, and unless there's something you need an excuse to miss, you don't want that., Maybe your sibling came from a smaller school, where almost everyone knew everyone. Imagine how it feels when you go to a new school that's at least twice as big! Teach your sibling that it's okay to not be popular, and it's almost impossible to know everybody. If you have to, you can also give friendship and relationship advice., You may want to help your sibling, but some things you just have to let them experience for themselves. You don't want to seem like a parent who is too over-controlling, do you? You don't even want to seem like a parent! You're not there to set the rules, you're there to help your sibling., If your sibling's friends went to another school or moved away, they may feel lonely, and it can be scary to make new friends right away. If you see your sibling is sitting by themselves, it's fine to invite them over. So yes, the popular kids might look at you funny for sitting with one of the ""new kids"", but later your sibling will thank you. It feels nice to so a good deed., How did you feel when you first came to the school? Nervous? Excited? Chances are, your sibling is feeling that way too. Sometimes all somebody needs is someone to talk to. If they feel to embarrassed to talk to your parents, you can also listen. Remember to not brag or show off how much you are of an expert, just listen. However, don't be afraid to report something of your sibling is acting overly anxious. Look out for your sibling's mental health too., A new concept in school can be confusing, and your parents may not be able to help if it's not in their area of expertise or they forgot. If your sibling gets frustrated, try to calm them down and explain it as simply as possible. If they start fighting you, though, leave the room/situation and tell your parents. You're not a tattle-tale for protecting yourself from getting injured., Unless you're starting a new school as well, it's your sibling's moment to shine. They've made it this far from working hard. And don't worry. Soon enough, you'll be graduating, or going to another school. It's okay to share the spotlight."

Get a lock for your room door.,
If you parents won't let you get a lock, try to get your brother banned from coming into your room.,
If you can't get a ban, try to make your brother fear coming into your room.,

If you are desperate, make your room so disgusting no-one will ever want to come in.,

,


If you're able to set the rules, simply tell your brother he is banned from entry. Place a sign on the door making this clear.
If you parents need to make the rule, explain the facts without whining. Tell them that he messes up the room, disturbs you when doing homework and breaks things, etc.
If you have to tell your parents a lie, try to make it realistic. It's unlikely they'll believe a five year old would throw a grenade at you.

, If he is quite young, tell him there is a ghost in your room. If your brother is older, put up creepy pictures around your room (but not so scary you can't get to sleep yourself). Or tell him that you'll do ""girl"" things if he comes in.

, For example, if he's older, put up pictures of his ex or a lost favorite pet of his.

, Leave uneaten food around, piles of mess and stinky things. Of course, you won't exactly be a chick magnet but you will probably stop him from wanting to come in.

, Give him toys, candies or money to stay out of your room. Tell him he won't get any more if he comes in again.

, See how he feels if you go into his room, completely ignore him but mess up his things, sit on his stuff and act as if it's your space.

, Fake illness, sneeze and cough a lot, and get into bed. He will be unlikely to want to catch whatever you have got.

Ignore them.,
Leave the situation.,
Find a distraction.,
Assert yourself.,
Use humor to deflect the situation.,
Listen as long as you can.",How to Get Your Siblings to Shut Up1," Sometimes, if someone is teasing or annoying you they're seeking out attention. Simply ignoring sends a powerful message. You are above the teasing and do not wish to engage in negativity.


Remember, you are a worthy person. If your sibling is putting you down or trying to make you feel bad, this is there problem and not yours.
Stooping to your sibling's level, while tempting, is not going to help the problem. Do not return insults with insults. Simply ignore the aggressor.
Try your best not to let your sibling know you're feelings are hurt. While it's perfectly appropriate to be hurt if someone is being mean to you, if your sibling is trying to hurt you her or she will thrive on you getting upset. Simply ignoring your sibling is the better option.;
, Go to your own room. If you sibling follows, ask them to leave your room. If your room is your space, your parents are likely to side with you if you need their support in getting your sibling to leave your room. Sometimes, simply avoiding the situation is the best way to deal. You could also look into hanging around places in the house where your sibling is unlikely to go.

, Go run an errand to get away from your sibling. If your parents don't trust you to go out on your own, take a friend with you. Put on a pair of headphones to drown them out. This might help you disengaged. As discussed, the less your respond to your sibling the less likely he or she is to keep bothering you. Finding a distraction that helps you ignore the situation can help get your sibling to shut up.

, If ignoring or avoiding doesn't work, you might have to assert yourself. Being assertive when being teased or bullied may help get your sibling to shut up.


Remember, you have a right to be respected in your home. Your sibling's teasing is violating that right. It is appropriate to be assertive and stand up for yourself.As stated, you do not want to stoop to your sibling's level and return insults with insults. However, it is appropriate to respond to defend yourself against insults. If your sibling is relentless, tell them firmly why what they're saying is not okay. For example, if your sibling is teasing you about a shirt you're wearing say something like, ""It's my shirt and I like it. That's all that should matter. You making fun of me isn't going to change how I dress."", You can also use humor to combat teasing. Humor conveys a sense of comfort with oneself. Your sibling will find this self-assurance threatening.


Acknowledge your sibling's message in a humorous way. This shows you can accept your own faults. Your sibling may be teasing you because of his or her own insecurity and he or she will be shocked at your comfort with yourself.Let's go back to the shirt example. If your sibling keeps telling you the shirt is ugly, say something like, ""I guess I just like ugly clothes. Oh, well. Bad taste isn't the worst thing in the world!"", You might not always want your sibling to shut up because he or she is getting on your nerves. Your sibling might talk too much. If this is the case, try to listen as long as you can. As you listen, try to understand what your sibling is trying to communicate and why. Is she being mean to you, making fun of you? Why might she feel the need to do that? Is she trying to get something out of her head but having trouble expressing it? Is there anything you can do to make it easier for her to express herself?"

It's no good going into battle with so many options not knowing which weapon to use.,
Ignore her the best you can.,
She will eventually want to play with you and she will feel punished by you if you will not play with her.,
Talk to her in a calm manner.,
If things get worse and these steps won't work out, discipline her.",How to Deal With Little Sisters," And you're more likely to come up with a better plan of action before she's gotten on your nerves and got you seeing red. Yes, she will mess up your plan. Just do your best to stick to it and things will turn out better.;
, She probably wants attention and negative attention is the most fun for her. Do not show her that what she is doing is bugging you.

, When she asks to play with you just say ""No, I don't want to be annoyed by you"". She will soon get the picture that she is being avoided because she is annoying. She will probably stop being annoying so that she can play with you. She will hopefully have learned what happens when she behaves that way and never annoy you again. Don't make your controlling her obvious -- and don't admit you are avoiding her -- or she will act even more annoying.

, Staying calm with her can be difficult but will work, because she looks up to you though she will never say so. Plus your parents will think you're showing maturity when you stay calm.

, Start putting limits. Hitting won't work by your parents, I'm sure of that. Don't act feisty, but be firm with how things should be around her. You need to put a point and say, Look, you're going to start doing the right things, in a strict way. Good Luck!

Present the problem.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
End the conversation if necessary.",How to Get Your Siblings to Shut Up2," If you continually get into conflicts with your sibling, you might want to address the problem. Start by stating the obvious. That is, what's bothering you about the situation and why. It's important to address your views and then give your sibling a chance to respond. After your sibling has been talking for awhile, interrupt with something like, ""I don't like the way you're talking to me right now"" or ""I feel like you're dominating this conversation."" Try to remain as calm as possible. Getting hostile and trying to yell over someone will only escalate the situation. , When communicating a problem, it's important to use ""I"" statements. These are statements that strive to express things in terms of feelings rather than facts. This can be helpful when confronting your sibling as she will feel you're expressing yourself and your emotions rather than trying to place external judgment on the situation.


I statements begin with ""I feel."" After stating ""I feel"" you will describe your emotion and then explain the behavior that leads you to feel this way. Using ""I"" statements can help with conflict as they can feel less judgmental. You're not making a sweeping judgment about the situation or placing blame on one person. Instead, you're just stating how the situation makes you feel.
For example, don't say, ""You're inconsiderate when you talk over me and put me down about not finishing my homework."" Rephrase this using an ""I"" statement. Say something like, ""I feel upset when you lecture me about my homework because it adds to my stress level.""

, Sometimes, even if you talk as respectfully as possible your sibling will just not stop talking. She may even become hostile, despite your best efforts to resolve the situation. If your sibling keeps talking over you and disrespecting you, it's best to simply end the conversation. Say something like, ""I don't think we're getting anywhere and I don't feel comfortable right now."" Then, leave the conversation."

Write down your sentiments.,
Try to understand your sibling's perspective.,
Confront your siblings.,
Take turns talking.,
Compromise.,
End situations that get uncomfortable.",How to Get Your Siblings to Shut Up3," There may be a larger problem at play if your siblings frequently talks over and interrupts you. A good way to cope this kind of problem is to sit down and talk things over with your sibling. Before you do so, take a moment to write down your feelings so you can express them adequately in conversation.


List past times where you both have argued and/or when your siblings will not stop talking. Create a long list, then cross off any minor incidents.
Focus on the major incidents, such as when your siblings drove you to have a headache, or interrupted a major engagement by talking.
Also, think of what you want to accomplish by talking to your siblings. Where do you hope to go after the conversation? What do you want your sibling to take away from this discussion? What do you want your sibling to take away from the conversation?, In addition to writing down your perspective, make an effort to consider your sibling's point of view prior to your talk. Why might your sibling feel aggressive towards you? What events have shaped her experience? Have you been unfair in the situation at all? In conflict, it is very rarely only one person's shortcomings creating a problem. Try to understand why you may sometimes rub your sibling the wrong way and what you can do to change the situation.

, Sit your siblings in a comfortable setting. You want to make sure your siblings know what they are about to hear is serious.


Turn off the television, and make sure you are not using your phones or computers. Technology can create distractions and take away from what you have to say.
Use a comfortable place like a bedroom, or a living room. These can help because they have comfy seats, and can make the confrontation more relaxed.
Make sure you pick a time to talk that works for both of you. Do not schedule a talk if your sibling only has an hour before work. Choose a time that's open ended, like shortly after dinner on a weeknight.

, It's important to be respectful during the confrontation. Take turns expressing your feelings. Try not to interrupt when your sibling talks. If she interrupts you, politely interject with something like, ""Excuse me, but I wasn't finished talking yet.""


Do not interrupt when your sibling is talking. Even if she says something that you disagree with or that hurts your feelings, be respectful and allow her to express herself freely.Remember, no put downs or insults. You want to remain as respectful as possible to resolve the situation. Name calling can derail productive dialogue., The goal of this confrontation is to resolve the issues between you and your sibling. You have to be willing to compromise and see things from her point of view. Once you've both expressed yourselves, work on resolving the problem together. Look for places where you can both change a bit. For example, say you fight frequently because your sister dislikes you spending time in your room. You can agree to give her space after school and before bed. She can agree to be more willing to spend time with you on the weekends or before dinner and allow you to come hang out in her bedroom.


Celebrate your differences. As conflicts sometimes come up due to individual differences, learn to value your sibling's input. Agree to disagree on certain topics. You can also take your differences in opinion as an opportunity to learn about another's point of view. Take a genuine interest in where your sibling is coming from and why.

, Despite your best efforts, there may be uncomfortable situations in the future. It's not uncommon for siblings to fight, especially when growing up and testing the boundaries of family relationships. Sometimes, it may be easier to simply end conversations before they start. If you feel you or your sibling getting hostile, simply get up and leave the room.

Write out your feelings.,
Put yourself in yourself in your brother's shoes.",How to Deal With Your Annoying Little Brother1," Take a second to breathe so that you can think about the problem with your brain rather than your emotions.


One great breathing exercise to help you calm down is called the ""Four Square"" method. Inhale in for four counts, hold it for four counts, exhale for four counts, rest for four counts, then take two normal breaths. . Repeat this as many times as you need to until you feel calm.
If your emotions are running high, chances are you will only add to the conflict.;
, If you need to, find some privacy and distance from your brother. Go to another room to think about the problem. .


Get some fresh air. Being outside and around nature is a great way to cool off.. Check in with your parents and go for a walk outside or in your backyard.

, Take twenty minutes to do something you love. Listen to a song you loveor read a chapter in a book. If you get your mind off the problem for a bit you'll be able to see things more clearly when you come back.

, Grab a notebook and write about the problem for just twenty minutes. Put all your stresses and frustrations on the page. This will help you move toward clarity and positivity more quickly .

, Younger children usually start fights with their siblings out of fear or jealousy. . Often they are just seeking attention.. Try to be sympathetic with your brother and think about what might be causing him to act the way he is.


Understanding the root of the problem can help you see it more clearly. Your brother is not trying to annoy or hurt you. Children do not know how to deal with their feelings so they often lash out.

Know when to apologize.,
Listen to your brother.",How to Deal With Your Annoying Little Brother2," The best way to resolve any fight is through open communication.


Find somewhere quiet and invite your brother to talk about the situation with you.
Enter the conversation with a positive attitude. If you are defensive or upset he will sense it in you.

, If you are feeling frustrated by his behavior, tell him. Your brother may not understand the consequences of his actions. Be honest about your emotions


One good way to share your feelings is through the ""I-Message"" method. . Create a sentence using: ""I feel_____________when you___________because___________."" This will prevent your little brother from feeling attacked.

, It may feel from your perspective that you have done nothing wrong. But younger children are often sensitive and feel powerless. Let your brother know that you are on his side and are trying to fix the problem by apologizing.


Sometimes it is necessary to let go of your pride in order to solve a conflict, especially with someone younger than you.

, Young children often feel their feelings are unheard in a family. Show him that you care about him and understand him by being a good listener.

Show your love.,
Compliment your brother on his achievements.,
Plan activities with your brother.,
Lead by example.",How to Deal With Your Annoying Little Brother3," Even if you fight with your brother, at the end of the day he is still family. If he feels loved and cared about, he will be less likely to start conflicts with you. Tell him you love him with your words or actions.

, When your brother does well in school, or helps you in some way, give him a compliment. This will help create a relationship of support between the two of you. , Spending time together can strengthen your relationship and make him feel like he is getting proper attention from you.


Schedule a regular ""hang out"" time with your brother. This is a good way to show him he is loved and supported. He will also be more likely to give you privacy when you need it if you have a specific time set aside to play.
Offer your help with homework or other projects. Your little brother probably looks up to you and helping him is a good way to show you are there for him.

, You are an important role model for your brother. He makes choices about how to behave based on what he sees you do.


If you are angry and combative with your brother, he will treat you the same way. If you are patient and kind with him, he will learn to be patient and kind with you.

Ask your brother for space.,
Ask your parents for space from your brother.,
Find ways to get out of the house.",How to Deal With Your Annoying Little Brother4," While it is important to have a good relationship with your younger brother, you need time for yourself as well. Tell him kindly that you need time for yourself every day.


When asking for space, do so very gently. It may be difficult for your little brother to understand that you can love him and still want some space from him.

, Your parents might not understand that you are older now, and need some more privacy. Talk to them about your needs. Together you can create ways to find distance and avoid conflict with your younger brother.

, Physical distance will help you feel more independent and more appreciative of your brother's presence when you are home.


Look for after-school activities. Your school or local community center probably has after school art classes, sports teams, or drama productions. Ask your teachers and parents about ways to spend time outside of the house.
If you share a room with your younger brother, create a space somewhere else in the house that is yours. Start doing your homework in the kitchen or on the couch. You might not have your own room, but creating a regular space to work or read can help you feel more independent in your home.
The local library is a great, safe space to spend time outside of your family. Talk to your parents about spending time there after school or on the weekends.

Assess the situation.,
Observe the sibling's reaction to perceived bullying.,
Discuss the situation with your children.,
Talk with your child about their actions.,
Bring the siblings together.,
Give your child consequences.",How to Discipline a Child That Bullied a Sibling," Avoid losing your temper. You may feel angry at the child for exhibiting this behavior to the sibling, but it is still very essential to stay calm. Lashing out will only make things worse, not better. It is also important to listen actively and stay calm. If you are so furious that you are about to overreact, take a deep breath, or even take a break from the situation as needed and then revisit it later.

If you need to take a break from the situation, separate the siblings immediately. Send them into different rooms while you take some time to calm down, so that they don't end up getting into another conflict. It's likely that emotions will still be running high.;
, The word bullying has differing meanings, so the best way to go is to refrain from using that term until you've found out more about the situation from both parties; your bullying child and the sibling. Analyze the severity of the situation and think over whether it is bullying in the first place. For example, insulting one another playfully is not bullying, but hitting someone in the face is always a form of bullying and should be quickly dealt with.

Take note if the child intentionally made fun of something that the sibling was sensitive about. If your son is worried about not doing well in school and your daughter starts loudly talking about a low grade that he recently got on a test, this would be a form of bullying.
Be sure to recognize bullying that is specific towards something the child cannot help. For example, if your younger daughter is autistic and is sensitive to noise, your older daughter continuously making loud sounds while her younger sister is in earshot would be a form of bullying.

, Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell whether the child was intending to hurt the sibling, or was simply giving them a friendly tease. If your son calls his twin sister an ""idiot"", for example, see if your daughter reacts by laughing or by getting upset - some siblings tease each other by calling each other names. If you did not witness the sibling's reaction, ask them how they felt about what their sibling said to them., There are two sides to every story, so it's important to listen to both your child and their sibling. It's best to discuss the situation with your children separately, as having them both share their stories in the same vicinity may cause another fight, especially if one child accuses another of lying. Send the children to their rooms, or to different rooms if they share a bedroom, and talk to them one-on-one about what occurred. There may have been a preceding incident that caused the bullying - maybe the sibling called your bullying child a name for knocking glue onto their art project.

Listen to your children thoroughly, and be sure to stay calm as the bullying child explains their side of the story. Avoid swearing or yelling, and interrupt only if it's absolutely necessary - for example, if the child starts going on an unrelated tangent to try and change the subject.

, If your child is fairly young, they may not understand the fact that they did something that isn't okay, and you may have to explain to them that calling someone a name is wrong. If they are old enough to know that bullying is wrong, avoid scolding them about ""acting your age"" or ""knowing better"". Instead, make sure to calmly explain to them that their behavior is childish and that they need to treat people better than that, especially their siblings.

Avoid saying something like, ""You don't know how much time you have with your sibling!"" These statements tend to be largely ineffective and will just upset your child.

, After you've had a discussion with both children about what happened, bring the children together and have them discuss what happened. Mediate the conversation so it doesn't delve into another fight, and make sure that the bullying child apologizes for what happened. If the sibling did something wrong, such as taking things from the child without asking for permission, be sure that the sibling apologizes, too., Regardless of whether or not this is the first time your child has bullied their sibling, they will need to understand there are consequences to their actions and that what they did isn't okay. The consequences should depend on the age of the child - a younger child might just need to sit in time-out for a while, while it may be better to take away an older child's phone and computer for a few days. Make sure the punishment for their actions isn't too severe, however; grounding your child for over two weeks is overdoing it, and after a certain amount of time, the meaning of the punishment will be lost."

Try to divide your rooms.,
Don't touch each other's stuff.,
Respect your sibling.,
Talk to them.,

, Don't use duct tape in the middle of the room. Just have your bed side and have her/his bedside.

, Just because you're in their room and you've been wanting to use that new video game, just ask. Don't just take, it's still their personal space. And that goes for the sibling, too.

, Your sibling is still a person and deserves kindness, no matter how much you despise the person. Speak nicely and calmly, and stay positive around the person. Don't ignore or bully your roommate - it will only make things tougher!, About the division, personal stuff, when to talk to each other, and et cetera.

, Every person does have his or her own space and privacy, and you need to respect that, but you also need to be accommodating. Siblings are part of your family, so be supportive when you need to be.

If you need help with something, ask your sibling. Not only will it bring you two closer to each other, but also will aid you in your work.

, You may not be able to control how big a mess your sibling is, but you can control how messy you are. Keep your area of the room fairly organized; using drawers, boxes, or other storage containers can help. This can prevent misplacement of belongings., You have to realize that sometimes you need a friend, a helping hand, someone whom you can trust completely. Only family comes closer to it.

, If they are like ""Oh, I`ll help you look!"", and 2 seconds later they say ""Oh, look! Here it is!"", and sulk afterwards then chances are they stole it. If they find it on the floor, it probably just rolled over there. If they find it in a boot or something,there is a 75% chance that they stole it.

Find the reason for your sibling’s behavior.,
Explain your feelings.,
Negotiate a win-win solution.,
Know when to walk away.",How to Deal With Annoying Siblings1," One of the best ways to understand your sibling’s actions is to ask him/her directly.While having a reason for annoying you doesn’t excuse your sibling’s actions, it may help you find a way to resolve the issue. Use a calm voice to politely ask why your sibling is acting the way he is.


In some cases, your sibling may be annoying you to get your attention. Try to determine if you’ve been excluding him from activities without realizing it.
Your sibling may resort to annoying behavior if he’s feeling nervous or scared about something. Talking about the problem may help him feel better, and put an end to his problematic behavior.;
, Sometimes, your sibling may not realize how annoying his behavior actually is. He may think that he’s just having some fun and not understand how hurtful his actions have been. Calmly express how you feel, so your sibling has a chance to reevaluate his behavior.If your sibling is very young, use simple, clear language in order to help him understand the situation more easily. For example, you might say, ""It makes me angry when you interrupt my homework,"" or ""I get sad when you call me names.""
If you’re having trouble explaining how you feel, try asking your sibling how he would feel if you treated him in the way that he’s treating you.
When a sibling keeps interrupting you while you’re in the middle of an important task, explain the circumstances surrounding your activity so he can understand just how important it is. You might say, ""If you don't let me study for this test, I might fail my math class.""

, Once you both know how each other feels, it may be easier to resolve the issue in a way that satisfies you both. This often means compromising with your sibling.If your sibling is acting out because he wants your attention, consider making plans to spend time with him later as long as he leaves you alone now.
When a sibling keeps borrowing your belongings without permission, you might identify some items that he is allowed to borrow if he asks first.

, If you decide to confront your sibling directly, it’s important not to allow the situation to escalate. At the first sign of physical or violent behavior, such as poking, shoving, or hitting, avoid the temptation to retaliate and immediately tell a parent. If you feel yourself losing your temper, leave the room to spend some quiet time alone."
"
Set clear boundaries.,
Avoid negative situations.,
Calm down.",How to Deal With Annoying Siblings2," Your sibling may unintentionally annoy you because he doesn’t understand what behaviors or actions upset you. Sitting down with him and establishing the type of actions that you consider acceptable can help you avoid problems. If your sibling crosses a boundary, have a parent intercede.Your boundaries may involve physical space, such as your right to privacy in your room or the safety of your belongings, but they can also refer to emotional space, such as your right to spend time alone or not continue a conversation that upsets you.
If your sibling has a habit of calling you names, identify words that especially hurt you so he can avoid using them.
You may want to have your parents present when you discuss boundaries with your sibling. That can help show your sibling how serious you are about the limits you’re setting.

, Stopping annoying behavior before it starts is usually the easiest way to handle it. If there are certain situations that trigger your sibling to act out, do what you can to keep yourself out of them. Identify warning signs that indicate your sibling is in a bad mood, such as raising his voice, so you know when it’s best to walk away from him.If your sibling is extremely competitive, don’t play games or engage in other activities where you face off against one another.
If your sibling gets cranky when he’s under stress, try to avoid him when he’s in high-pressure situations, such as studying for a test or preparing for a big game.

, It may seem easier said than done, but keeping your cool when your sibling irritates you can be an effective way to defuse the situation. Try to remain patient, and reign yourself in with some anger management techniques if you feel yourself getting upset.Sometimes, giving yourself a quick time-out from the situation can help. Try counting to 10 in your head, so you take a minute to relax before reacting to your sibling.You feel more relaxed if you’re sitting or lying down, so if you know you’re getting upset, take a seat to help your brain realize that it’s time to calm down."

Inform your parents of the problem.,
Request a clear declaration of consequences.,
Ask for space.,
Suggest family meetings.",How to Deal With Annoying Siblings3," By treating them with respect, taking care of your responsibilities, and displaying obedience, they’ll know that they can trust you. That means when you come to them with a problem with your sibling, your parents will be more likely to take you seriously and believe your side of the story., It’s important to stay calm when you’re describing the situation to your parents, so stick to the facts without getting overly emotional. If you’ve attempted to resolve the problem on your own, explain the steps that you’ve taken and your sibling’s reaction.


Be specific. Instead of offering a vague complaint like ""John is being a jerk,"" say ""John keeps interrupting me when I'm trying to study, and this test counts for 20 percent of my grade.""
Talk to your parents when they’re not busy or distracted. If they’re in a good mood and more willing to listen to you, they can appropriately deal with the situation.

, If your sibling understands that he will be punished if he continues to behave in a problematic way, it may discourage him from bothering you. Have your parents explain the specific types of punishment your sibling can expect if he continues to annoy you (or you annoy him). Once everyone understands the consequences in your home, it may be easier to avoid conflict., Sometimes, your sibling may annoy you because you are forced to spend too much time together. It may not be practical to ask your parents for your own room, but you can still request some space and time alone when you need it.If you share a room with your sibling, have your parents set up a schedule so you each get some time alone in the room each week. Do the same with common spaces, such as the family room, den, or game room.

, You may be able to avoid conflicts with your sibling if you clear the air regularly. Ask your parents to hold weekly or monthly meetings so you can air grievances and share concerns.If you want to make the meetings more fun, ask your parents to plan them around activities, such as baking cookies or sharing a meal. That can help everyone feel relaxed, so you’re all more comfortable.

Engage in meaningful activities.,
Offer support.,
Open up about your life.",How to Deal With Annoying Siblings4," If you and your sibling participate in activities that require you to work together or create special memories, it can help establish a powerful bond that discourages your sibling from annoying you. Commit to spending time together regularly too, so it becomes a habit.Look for activities that call for teamwork, such as doing a puzzle, building a model, or cooking dinner for your parents. By working together, you’ll learn to cooperate with one another and channel your energy into something positive.""
If you and your sibling both enjoy a similar hobby or activity, try to find a way to make it special. For example, if you both like to bike, take him for a ride on your favorite trail. If you like the same types of movies, plan a marathon of your favorites for just the two of you.

, If he’s bothering you because he wants attention, playing a more active role in his life may help put an end to his problematic behavior. Take an interest in his school activities, hobbies, and friends, so he feels like he’s important to you. Make sure your sibling knows that he can talk to you if something is bothering him too., Relationships are a two-way street. Share as many details about your friends and the activities that you’re engaged in as you’re comfortable with, and let your sibling know that he can ask questions if he wants."

Think about how you treat your brother throughout the day.,
Think about how he must be feeling.,

Start noticing how you treat him throughout the day.

Learn the signs of sexual abuse.,
Talk with your parents or guardians.,
Enlist help from others.,
Alert the authorities.,
Seek counseling.,
Address underlying issues.,
Walk away.,
Confront your sibling.,
Cut your ties.",How to Deal With an Abusive Sibling," Abuse comes in many forms, but it's important to understand the concepts underlying most types of abuse. Sibling rivalry is common, but if one sibling is always the aggressor and the other always the victim, it is an abusive situation.Sibling abuse may be physical, emotional, or sexual, and is most often perpetrated by one sibling against the other.
Abuse is often an act of power and control. If a sibling tries to make you feel powerless, neglected, or devalued, it is likely an abusive situation.When in doubt, try to seek help through professional opinion and evaluation of the situation.;
, Emotional abuse can stand alone, or it may underpin physical or sexual abuse. Emotional abuse from a sibling is their attempt to control you through manipulation of your thoughts and emotions, making you feel constant fear, shame, or humiliation.Emotional abuse often makes you feel as though you are walking on eggshells, like anything you do could send your sibling into a rampage or spiral of criticism.Emotional abuse often leaves victims feeling unheard or unseen, unlovable, and like they don’t matter.
Emotional abuse may take many forms, but it can include your sibling constantly criticizing your looks, work, or academic performance. It may also include your sibling trying to convince you that you are not respected or wanted by the rest of your family.

, Physical abuse is using excessive force or doing anything with the intent of causing physical harm to someone else. Physical abuse is generally a controlling act carried out with physical force against another.Common forms of physical abuse may include hitting, kicking, biting, throwing objects at another, or any other form of physical exertion from an antagonist meant to overpower a victim.
Some signs of physical abuse may include bruising, broken bones, burns, bite marks, cuts, abrasions, scarring, and others.

, Sexual abuse is any unwanted touching, exposure, or forced intimate actions between siblings. It is often the least disclosed and treated form of sibling abuse.Sibling sexual abuse does not have to include forced sexual acts to be abuse. It may also come in the forms of unwanted exposure or unwanted touching.
If you believe there is a problem with sibling sexual abuse in your home, it is advisable to contact law enforcement or a social worker as soon as possible.

, Approach your parents or guardians and tell them what is going on, especially if both you and your sibling still live at home. Let them know that what they see is more than just sibling rivalry, and that you want help dealing with your sibling’s aggression.Explain to your parents or guardians that what they perceive as rivalry is actually a progression of situations where your sibling makes you the victim of their aggression. Try saying, ""You may see the roughhousing between the two of us as just a part of being siblings, but I am always made the victim of my sibling's violence, and it has had a serious impact on me.""
Let your parents or guardians know that you are looking for solutions to stop the cycle of abuse, and that you need their help and emotional support. Tell them, ""I want our family to have a happy, healthy, relationship and I need your help to end these unhealthy practices by my sibling.""

, If you are not getting the support you need from your parents or the change you need from your sibling, bring in other family members or close friends of the family. Let them know how your sibling is abusing you, and that you are seeking help.


Ask them, “Is it alright for me to stay with you sometimes when my sibling becomes too aggressive to handle?”
If you want help speaking with professionals such as a therapist or law enforcement, let this person know and ask them, “Would you mind helping me file reports or make appointments?”
Have this person appeal to your parents or sibling as a third party. Allow them to explain the abuses they have seen, and discuss why they are problematic. Let them be your advocate.

, Law enforcement takes physical and sexual abuse seriously in most cases. If your sibling’s abuse is too much for you to handle within your family, or if they have put you in serious danger due to their actions, call your local police department immediately.For immediate help, alert the National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child.
If you are a minor, you may also want to alert Child Protective Services, especially if you feel endangered in your own home.Do understand that those found guilty of assault or abuse could face extended jail time. Do not let this deter you from reporting a true abuser, but do not lightly make claims due to small disagreements.

, Counseling with a trained therapist or clinical social worker may help minimize the longer term impact of sibling abuse. Talk with a counselor openly and honestly about your experiences, and use their advice to help start your recovery.Keep in mind that the counselor may be required to report the abuse to protect you. This should not deter you from speaking with someone though.


If you are still in a home with your sibling and parents or guardians, ask for the family to attend family counseling. Use this as an opportunity for professional mediation and as a chance to address issues as a group.
If you are dealing with the aftermath of sibling abuse, therapy may provide a long-term way to begin the healing process. Find a therapist that specializes in abuse, and let them know about your situation during your first appointment.
Find affordable therapy options by getting a referral from your general practitioner. Alternatively, try looking at local clinics staffed by college PhD and MSW candidates, as these often offer sliding scale payment and sometimes they offer free counseling as well., Work with your sibling to figure out what is underpinning their aggression toward you. Perhaps they have frustrations about school, work, their romantic relationships, or other aspects of their life. Offer to talk with them in order to help them understand what causes their anger.


Let your sibling know, ""I can help you look into options such as therapy or support groups if that is what you want.""
Listen to and be understanding of what your sibling is saying, but do not allow them to continue acting out their personal traumas on you.

, If you know certain situations trigger your sibling’s abusive tendencies, walk away before matters escalate. If, for example, they become verbally abusive during competitive activities, decline to compete and remove yourself from the situation.View this as a short term fix while you seek longer term solutions. Your sibling’s abuse shouldn’t keep you from things you enjoy or drive you away from the rest of your family. Don’t treat distancing yourself as a long term solution.
Let others know that you are not leaving because of their presence or behavior, but because you are trying to avoid a potentially harmful situation. Offer to schedule time with others when your sibling won’t be involved.

, Let your sibling know that you recognize their behavior as abuse. Talk to them about the ways in which their aggression has impacted you, and let them know you are actively seeking ways to make it stop.


If possible, try to have an open and honest conversation with your sibling. Try to resolve any tension by telling them, “Your actions toward me have been abusive and have hurt me in a number of ways.”
If honest conversation does not seem like it will have any impact on your sibling’s actions, set boundaries with them such as letting them know you will not acknowledge their calls, texts, or attempts to have a conversation with you.
Remind them that you are looking into ways to cope with the abuse, which may include getting other family members or authority figures involved.

, If you have the ability, cut off your ties with your sibling. Stop all forms of communication, and let your sibling know that if the abuse cannot stop, they have no role in your life moving forward.Tell your sibling, “Your actions are not healthy and I can no longer deal with them.”
If necessary, block your sibling on your normal channels of communication such as on the phone and through social media.

Make sure that you don't make him cry. Try not to talk down to him in a bossy way, or tell him what to do. Let him participate in the conversation and tell you how he's feeling as well.
Try using ""I-statements"" to explain how you feel. Instead of blaming him by saying things like ""You are always so nosy and rude!"" you might say, ""I feel frustrated when you come in my room without knocking. It makes me think you don't respect my privacy."", You have probably picked on your brother or yelled at him when he was annoying you. Tell him you are sorry for those times and that you want to have a better friendship with him.


Try saying, ""I'm sorry that I've been mean to you and yelled at you. I don't know why I do that sometimes, but I want to try to be nicer to you.""

, You both are probably guilty of annoying and being mean to each other. Write down what you wish your brother wouldn't do, and ask him which things he doesn't want you to do.


Keep the list short and focused on the most important things-- try for two or three things each. You might ask him to not interrupt when you have friends over, knock before coming into your room, and not borrow your toys without asking.
Agree with him that you will both work on not doing the things that annoy each other.

, It can be hard to have a serious conversation with a little brother. If he is making rude noises or making faces while you talk, simply stand up and say quietly, 'I tried to talk but...', and walk away.


If he calls you back look at him (without saying anything) and wait until he speaks. When he does, sit down beside him and finish your conversation.

, When he is done talking, hug him and remind him that you love him, even if you two fight sometimes.

, Even if you sit down with your brother and agree to get along better, you will still have some fights in the future. If you think you will start yelling at him say: ""I'm not going to fight with you.""


If you do start arguing, let him win sometimes. That can surprise him and cut the fight short. Say, ""You're right, I'm sorry. I'm going to go in my room and read for a while.""
If you're really mad at him just walk away and tell him that you don't want to be mean so you want to get away from him. Tell him you don't want it to end with you two fighting.

, If you have multiple younger siblings, set them up to play a game with each other. That way, they will be preoccupied with each other instead of you. If they start arguing, politely step in and remind them that they are siblings, not enemies. Play with them for a few minutes until they seem like they are friends again, then go do whatever you were going to do.


You might set up a game of veterinarian with the stuffed animals, or set up a simple board game like Hi Ho Cherry-O or Shoots and Ladders.

, If you are trying to do something and he won't stop bothering you, ask him to draw you a picture or color a page for you in a coloring book. Make a big deal out of how much you want him to make you something, and he'll feel special while he makes it.


Be sure to thank him and hang the picture up on the wall in your room, so he knows you really do appreciate it.

, Make sure you tell him you love him regularly. It might seem cheesy, but he needs to know that you are there for him and care about him.


Try saying ""Love you!"" in the morning when your brother leaves for school or at night when you go into your rooms to sleep.

Start behaving.,
Pick your battles.,
Be a noncombatant.,
Act infuriatingly nice.,
Stand up for yourself clearly and non-aggressively if your sibling continues.,
Leave if you have to.,
Be assertive if your siblings lie about your actions.,
Be straight with your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents That Your Younger Siblings Are Not Always Well Behaved," If you have a history of lying or hitting your siblings right back, your parents are likely to treat your words with a little suspicion. Work on being more respectful and mature, and your parents will begin trusting you more.;
, If your parents see you constantly pointing out things that your siblings can get away with, they will think that you are simply jealous.

, Avoid engaging in conflict. If your siblings start picking fights, ignore them or give short responses (e.g. ""No thanks"" or ""Not now""). It will be difficult for your parents to blame you when you clearly aren't contributing anything to the conflict.


It may be tempting to call them names or slap them right back, but you'll probably get in trouble because you're bigger than them. Avoid giving in; remain calm and respectful.

, If your brother says your face is ugly, reply with ""Thank you! I like your shirt."" This will either make your sister or brother give up in frustration after a few unsuccessful tries, or it'll show your parents that you are making an effort not to bicker.

, A firm ""Please stop"" or ""That hurts"" makes your point clear. There's no way for your sibling to continue bugging you without acting like a total jerk. When your parents hear the story, they'll side with you.

, If you start getting really mad, leave before you end up doing something that gets you in trouble. Make an excuse. Take some time to relax and go to a quiet place where you can calm down. You have the right to be alone when you need it most, and if your sibling doesn't respect that, find a parent and explain what's happening. Try one of these phrases:


""I'm stressed and I need to be alone.""
""Please let me be.""
""I need quiet time.""

, Take a deep breath, and say ""That's not what happened."" State the truth as plainly as you can. There's no need to complain about how horribly your sibling behaved; the facts will speak for themselves. Here are examples of phrases you could use to assert yourself:


""I don't know why he's crying. I didn't hit him.""
""Actually, I was dancing to music in my room. I don't know what happened to the cookie jar.""
""No, I didn't attack her. Jessi jumped at me and I pushed her away. I'm very sorry that she's hurt, but I didn't do it on purpose.""

, Find a quiet time, when your parent is ready to listen. Use ""I"" language to describe what your sibling does, and focus on how it makes you feel. Ask your parents for advice in dealing with this situation. This will let your parents know that your siblings actions are upsetting you (so they may keep a closer eye out), and you can take their advice for handling the problem better.


""Sometimes Ryan hides the remote right before my favorite show comes on. It makes me feel really frustrated and disappointed because I can't watch my favorite show if I don't know where the remote is. What should I do when this happens?""
""Mom, I need to talk to you about a problem. Sometimes, when you're not there, Aiyana calls me stupid because of my learning disability, and asking me to count her fingers in a very sarcastic tone of voice. It hurts my feelings a lot. Do you have any advice about how I can handle it?""
""I need to raise an issue with you about my brother. He always states that I'm never interested in doing activities with him, and he always says that I expect him to choose, even though I have suggested activities to him several times but he doesn't like any of my ideas. I don't like it when he turns down all my ideas then goes lying to you guys about it, and it makes me feel as if I'm no fun. He also can make very sarcastic comments whenever I try to make a point, and I don't appreciate that. Do you have any advice on how I should handle this situation?""

Peers sometimes try to force you into making a split second choice, taking time to talk it out or even think on your own may slow things down enough to avoid just jumping into a bad situation just because you didn’t know what else to do.Asking questions can also buy you time in this case. A good question to start with is “Why?” Ask for more information or an explanation and you may find an opening to get yourself out of a high-pressure situation.;
, Everyone your age can understand rules or obligations set forth by a parent. Don’t be afraid to blame your need to leave on a curfew or mom being over-protective. No one needs to know this may not be the truth.Examples of viable excuses to get out of a pressured circumstance may include telling those pressuring you that you have to leave to do homework, you aren’t feeling well or even acting like you are already too busy to do whatever they are pressuring you to do.
Finding a friend who shares your same values that can support you in saying no can also help with the exit plan. There is often safety in numbers.

, If your friends are pressuring you to do something you don’t want to, offer up something else that could be done instead. You may not be able to control how your friends act, but you always have the right to either offer up another idea or simply to tell them you will leave them to do whatever without you.For instance, an alternate plan may involve you volunteering to be a designated driver if you find yourself at a party with alcohol and don’t want to drink. You could also come prepared to the party with your own non-alcoholic drink so there is no need to offer you a drink there. You won’t feel out of place if you already have something in your hand and if you are asked you could say “I already have one.”

, Make your message easy to hear and clear. Practice it when you don’t need to so that you feel comfortable saying it in a pinch.Finding a friend who will likely also say no can establish a ready-made support system when you need them. Support this same friend when he or she needs it, too. Practice with your friend saying no, and even make up a code word to alert the other person to a situation you may need them for.

, Follow your gut and know when it’s not OK to just do as they are telling you to do. There may be times when peer pressure demands that you act quickly to follow the crowd. Be prepared ahead of time to know how you should react so you don’t do something you may regret.An example of a high-pressure situation that moves quickly would be being pressured in the moment to shoplift. There may be a small window of opportunity to make the right choice to walk away. Being prepared with a refusal or exit plan can help in such a case.

, You do not have to stay friends with everyone simply because they have always been your friends. You may even find that friends from younger years grow apart. It is more than OK to not hang out with people who make you feel bad.If you generally have a good relationship with these friends but every once in a while you find yourself at a party you don’t feel good at, there may be ways to still be friends and just avoid that situation.
From time to time you may find friends change and you just stop seeing what was good about the friendship. This is the time to move on from the relationship.

, Evaluate your friendship to see if they are positive contributors in your life or just bad influences. If there is more negative than positive it may be time to consider new friends. Do you often get in trouble with them? Are your grades falling because of the time you spend hanging out? Do your parents and other adults you’re your about them consistently?, If you become perceptive about where bad decisions are more likely to be made, you can learn to avoid these situations altogether. Not being present at certain places or during certain circumstances can save you from the negative result of being at the “wrong place at the wrong time.”For example if one friend often tries to get you to shoplift, this is not the shopping buddy you want. You may be able to study with them but avoid the mall.
As your friends start to drive, it is even more important to avoid situations where you are at risk of driving drunk or being in the car with someone who is drunk. If you know your friend may end up in a place you are not safe in, avoid this by driving yourself—or offering to drive everyone—if you are able.
A great strategy is to visualize what peer pressure looks like with your friends so you understand which situations to avoid. You can do this by closing your eyes and thinking back on all the bad situations you find yourself in. Consider what details are present, what people are present, and where these bad things usually happen., Getting involved in school or community-based organizations will help you identify peers who are more positive influences and more like you. Extracurricular activities also tend to have pretty rigid schedules sand guidelines that don’t give you much time to get into trouble.If you are pressured to do something you do not want to do, telling friends you have to practice, attend an event or do something for church is a built-in exit plan.
Activities like sports can also be a great way to excuse yourself from things like drinking and drug use because you need to stay in shape and may be drug tested.

, Complete a values assessment. You can do this by either asking yourself and others what traits/characteristics may be used to describe you or by filling out an online questionnaire.

Your values are like a road map for your whole life. Use the information you get to guide your life decisions and help you to resist peer pressure.

For example, if you find that honesty is very important to you, but you hang with peers who are often lying, cheating, or stealing this goes against your personal values. You will need to modify your peer group so that you are spending time with people who share the same values as you., Make your friends aware of these goals, too. If they know you really want to be in the best shape for college sports, for instance, they are more than likely to refrain from asking you to do things that may hurt that desire.

, Know what things you need to say no to and why in order to reach your future goals. Recognizing which behaviors or choices fall into the “yes” or “no” categories provides a basis for you setting healthy, personal boundaries.Peer pressure can suddenly seem really easy to ignore if your friends are asking you to do things that do not align with your hopes and dreams. Work towards something and ask your friends to support you in this.
Refer back to your list of goals on a regular basis. Doing this can help you to assess whether the actions you are currently taking are on the right path to getting you where you want to be.

, Speak out and find your voice. Don’t worry about getting a reputation for being too straight laced or not following the crowd. You will find as you get more secure in who you are that you will find friends who share the same views and interests."

Identify direct and indirect pressure.,
Be prepared.,
Avoid situations that can lead to negative peer pressure.,
Act like a leader.,
Be selective in choosing your friends.",How to Say No to Negative Peer Pressure1," Peer pressure can be both direct, when someone tells you to do something or offers you something, or indirect, if you feel pressured to do something by a certain environment or situation. If you’re at a party where everyone drinks, you might feel you have to do it too in order to fit in, even if no one asks you to. In the first case, you’ll have to learn how to say no politely but firmly.


In the case of indirect peer pressure, you might not find yourself in a situation where you have to say no. However, you’ll still have to develop a strategy of self-control to stick to your principles and habits and do only what you’re comfortable with.;
, Learn to identify those situations where unwanted offers or behaviors are most likely to happen. Plan ahead what you’d say or how you’d act to turn down an offer.Being prepared will allow you to face these situations more open-mindedly. It’s okay to hang out with people who have different habits from yours. Knowing what to expect will help you respect their decisions as well as stand by yours.

, You’re probably the best one to know which environments or places are likely to lead to an unwanted situation. If you’re not confident you can say, the best option is probably to avoid these places outright.Depending on what you’re trying to avoid, these might include:


Environments where you’ll feel uncomfortable or out of place
Parties or clubs where most people will be drinking and smoking
Private meetings with someone you don’t want to have sex with

, It’s much easier to say yes to anything, even if it’s something we don’t want to do. However, showing that you’re in control of your life will get you much more respect from your peers in the long run. It’s not the easiest course of action, but it ultimately pays off and helps you be surrounded only by those who truly care about you. For example, show your friends you feel confident about your lifestyle and personal tastes. Don’t mimic what they do, but stick to what you like and pursue it.
Be proactive in suggesting activities and taking care of their organization. If you come up with fun ideas, others will look for you when they want to have a good time and follow your lead, rather than the opposite.
Keep in mind that being a leader is not the same as being patronizing toward your friends: to lead means to guide, not to act bossy or aloof.

, Since peer pressure comes from people, avoiding to hang out with those who are most likely to pressure you into unwanted behavior is the safest choice. Surrounding yourself with friends who share your views and lifestyle will decrease the chances of having to deal with uncomfortable situations. Remember that real friends won’t ask you to do anything you don’t want to do as a way to prove your courage or friendship. If someone expects this from you or makes fun of your choices, it’s probably not worth hanging out with.

Just say no.,
Say no and state why.,
Say no and make a joke.,
Say no and quickly change the subject.,
Say no and suggest an alternative idea.",How to Say No to Negative Peer Pressure2," In most cases, “No, thanks” is enough as an answer. Don’t feel like you have to provide an explanation if you’re not asked to. This will make you sound defensive, while your goal is to show you don’t have to justify yourself. In most cases, the explanation is implicit.


This is the best course of action when you’re offered something you don’t want to, like a drink, a cigarette or even drugs. Try not to sound rude. If your friend is simply suggesting you do something you don’t want to, as bad as it may seem, being polite will make it easier to move on and change the subject. Just add a “thanks” after your “no” and smile.

, Make your explanation short without making a big deal about it. If someone offers you a cigarette, you can simply say “No, thanks, I don’t smoke”: that is a good enough explanation. This strategy works very well when you’re asked to do something you don’t want to, or when you want to avoid a specific situation. For example, if someone asks you to go to a party where drugs are involved, you can say “I’m not going, sorry, I know there’ll be drugs and I don’t want to find myself in that situation,"" or “I’m not going, sorry, I don’t like the people who’ll be there.""
You can also make up an excuse if providing the real explanation can make things awkward: “I’m not going, sorry, I already have plans for tonight.""
Do your best to make your statement as positive as possible. Try not to sound condescending or judgmental. You might not agree with someone’s actions or habits but respecting their decisions will make them respect yours. , Humor is often best way to get out of an awkward situation and helps release the tension. A good way to do this is by exaggerating the consequences of the action. If you’re offered a drug, possible jokes can be “No thanks, you don’t want to see me naked jumping around the room!”
Another option is to give a sarcastic explanation. If you’re offered a cigarette, you can say “No thanks, I’ve had five cigars already,"" or “No thanks, I’d rather smoke my pipe.""

, Again, this works better when you want to turn something down. Changing the subject will not only give little importance to your rejection, but also to the action itself.


For example, if someone offers you a cigarette, you can say “No, thanks. Did I tell what happened today?” or “No thanks, what are you doing tonight?” By starting a brand new conversation that doesn’t involve cigarettes, both your friend’s smoking and your choice not to smoke won’t look like a big deal.

, This works best when what you’re being asked to do is an action that takes longer time, like smoking pot, getting drunk at home or having sex when you don’t want to. In this case, you can simply suggest an alternative activity; your “no” will be implicit.


Possible suggestions could be “Why don’t we go to the movies instead?"" “I’d rather go shopping,"" or “I think we’d better focus on our finals.""
Whatever you suggest, make sure to be specific. Avoid generic statements like “Let’s do something different”; suggesting an alternative that your friend might actually like better will make it easier and faster to get past the situation.

"
"
Repeat yourself.,
Say friends shouldn’t pressure you to do something.,
Seek support from another friend who’s there.,
Say no and turn the pressure around.,
Say no and leave.",How to Say No to Negative Peer Pressure3," Sometimes the situation might become more critical than you expected. Your friend might be pushing you even if you’ve already said “No, thanks."" If the offer becomes insistent, you’ll have to make it clear that that is not what you want to do. Saying no again and more firmly is the best thing you can do at this stage. For example: “No thanks, I told you I don’t drink.""
Even in this case, rudeness is not the best way to go. However, make the tone of your voice firm and look at your friend straight in the eye to make your message clearer.

, Try this course of action only if repeating your intentions has not stopped them from pressuring you. This will help you change the subject from the unwanted action to peer pressure itself.


For example, “I already told you I don’t want to smoke. I don’t like to be pushed to do something I don’t want to.""
Once you’ve done it, you can try discussing peer pressure at large if you’re close enough with your interlocutor. It’s always a good idea to discuss with your friends what your friendship is based on, especially in critical situations when the friendship itself could be in danger.

, If someone else is around who shares your ideas, try to get them to back you up by bringing them into the conversation. Do this only if you know the third person will support you. If you’re not sure what their opinion on the subject is, wait to see if they speak first and step up to help you.


For example, you can speak in the plural if you’re sure your friend will back you up: “No thanks, we don’t smoke.""
You can also address your back-up directly to change the subject, after saying “No, thanks” to the pressurer: “No, thanks, Mike, I don’t want to smoke pot. Why don’t we go to the movies instead? What do you think, Steve?”

, This might sound condescending and it’s best to avoid pressuring your friends; however, it can bring the subject to an end if other courses of action didn’t work out.


For example, if your sporty friend offers you a cigarette, you can answer ”I don’t smoke, and you shouldn’t either. It’s really bad for your stamina."" If a friend mocks you for not having had sex yet, you can say “You can do anything you want with your life. Are you taking any birth control or STD precautions, though?”

, This is really the last resort: if nothing else worked out and you feel like you’re being harassed, the best solution is simply to make an exit. You can come up with an excuse to make it sound less awkward or simply walk away, depending on how critical the situation has become.


It’s always a good idea to still provide a little explanation before you walk away. Don't be confrontational, but make it clear that you’re leaving to avoid being pressured: “I think I should go now, I don’t like to be pressured.”
It could be good to point out that leaving is not so much your decision as the only alternative you have left: “That’s enough, I’m leaving. I’m sorry but you’re leaving me no other option.” This way, you’ll make the one who is putting pressure on you aware that your walking away is a result of their rudeness, not yours.

This works best for situations where you're offered something you don't want, like drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol. It doesn't work very well for situations where someone wants you to do something for them.;
, The most basic way to respond to peer pressure, and often the scariest, is to just say ""NO!"" It may not sound very fun or easy but this is the best way to respond. Say ""NO!"" and stay firm. This will save you the trouble of getting pressured again in the future, because it sends a clear message that you're not interested. You can say:


Sorry, I don't do the dirty stuff.""

, You can also shut down a request from a peer by turning the request into a joke. This shows the person that you think the request is laughable, which will quickly tell them that you won't listen to them. This can be tricky to do if you're not the sort of person that makes jokes easily but with a little preparation, you can be ready for any situation.


""You want me to smoke cigarettes? Forget it! I don't want bad breath, numb taste buds, yellow teeth, and stained fingers - not to mention smelly clothes and hair!""
""'I""m not ready to do ""adult"" things yet. I still have a lot of growing up to do.""

, When someone asks or tells you to do something that you don't want to do, there are lots of ways that you can respond. One way to respond that can help you avoid the issue is to just change the subject. By changing the subject, you can put off the question until you feel you're ready to respond in a different way. Avoid the situation enough might even send the message that you're just not going to listen, which can also save you some trouble. There are lots of ways that you can change the subject. You can:


Remember something you wanted to tell them about: ""Did you try that new Italian restaurant that opened last week?""
Ask them a question: ""Do you want to watch this movie with me? I've really been wanting to see it, but it's no fun watching it alone.""

, Another option is to get out of the situation by leaving. Make an excuse for why you need to leave quickly. Apologize and get away, so that you can avoid them and maybe even think of a different way to handle the problem:There are lots of great excuses you can use to leave:


Talk to your parents on the phone.
Remember a date you have with your friends.
Realize how late it is and say that you're extremely tired.

, Another route which takes bravery but can help not only you but also the other person is to turn the peer pressure in the other direction. Use the opportunity to change their behavior instead of letting them change yours. This can be scary but it will go the furthest to saving you from peer pressure and maybe even helping someone you care about:You're having sex already? I hope you're using birth control and condoms to avoid an unwanted pregnancy or an STD.""

, The best way to avoid bad peer pressure is to avoid people who get into situations like that.Sometimes, we become friends with people because they're cool and we want to be cool, too, but a lot of the time those people don't really care about us. Your real friends will understand when things make you uncomfortable and they won't pressure you into doing things you don't want to do.


Real friends won't pressure you, ask you to do things that are dangerous or make you uncomfortable. They will like you no matter what, even if you don't enjoy the same things that they enjoy. These are the kind of people that you should be friends with. People who judge you or pressure you just want someone that they can boss around, and you deserve better.
Now, this approach might mean having to make new friends. This might seem sad or scary but you can do it. By finding people who are more like you, you'll be much happier and you won't have to worry about peer pressure anymore.
Try meeting people that are more like you by paying attention to who is doing the same activities as you. For example, if you see someone else reading a book that you like, strike up a conversation with them about the book. Maybe recommend some other books that they might like. You'll be friends before you know it.
Even if you make new friends, that doesn't mean that you have to stop spending time with your old friends. Just spending less time with them or hanging out in situations where you're unlikely to encounter trouble will make your life a lot easier.

, Some of them may seem fun but it's much better to keep yourself safe. You never know when someone will decide that you don't know what's best for you and give you no choice in listening. Some common situations to avoid peer pressure include:


Parties with no adult supervision
A secluded date with your girlfriend or boyfriend, which includes too many opportunities to do something you might regret.

, Another way to avoid peer pressure is to spend leisure time doing activities that you really enjoy, instead of with people who will pressure you. Find another activity that you want to do but that will keep you busy.


For example, you can take a class in a subject that interests you from the local community center. If you don't have the money, you can usually get scholarships or a reduced rate if you ask.
Another option would be to get a job. This keeps you busy but it also lets you build your resume and make money. Not only will you stay away from peer pressure but really soon you'll have money for a car and a new PlayStation.

, Wanting to impress your friends is one of the most common reasons for giving in to peer pressure. However, if you find better ways to impress them, you won't feel like you need to submit to peer pressure like that.


For example, you can start learning a cool skill like mixing music or playing the guitar.

, The thing about peer pressure is that just about everyone - even adults - experience it.. Lots of people have found ways to deal with it and by asking for advice, you might find some really helpful techniques. Someone that knows you better might also be able to give you advice that's more specific to your situation. Just be sure that you're asking someone you really trust.


Talk to a trusted friend. Say something like: ""Ava is really pressuring me to go to a party without adult supervision. Do I just say: '""My parents don't allow me to go to parties without adult supervision?""'
Talk to a trusted adult. You can say: ""Some of the kids at school told me I'm not grown up if I don't smoke and I won't be invited to parties if I don't drink. What should I do?""

, Think about why you don’t want to do the sort of things that your peers are asking you to do. Do the activities conflict with your personal beliefs? Your religious beliefs? Do you think that what they’re asking involves too much risk? Recognize why you don’t want to do these things and then keep those convictions in mind when people ask you to do things. You can make your resolve even stronger by reading material that supports your convictions and talking to people who share them.


For example, if you don't want to smoke marijuana because you think its dangerous, go online and educate yourself on the risks associated with the drug. This way, you’ll have a very clear picture of the dangers and you can better educate people.

, Many times, people submit to peer pressure because they want to impress people or because they want to experience something exciting.. However, there are always better ways to add that kind of feeling to your life. Think about something else exciting that you've always wanted to try to get out there and do that instead. The right kinds of people will be impressed.


For example, maybe you really love video games. You can enter a video game tournament or start your own video game show using a service like YouTube or TwitchTV. This will make you feel cool without having to submit to peer pressure.

, When you're confident, you'll feel more comfortable telling people ""NO!"" and a good way to gain confidence is to do lots of things that make you proud of yourself. When you do that, no one will be able to take those experiences away from you. When they say mean things, you won't care about their opinions.For example, you can volunteer with a local homeless shelter.
Another way to be proud of yourself is to work on developing a skill that you really want to have. Try taking up something like drawing or music.

, A good way to boost your confidence and make you more comfortable telling your peers ""NO!"" is to work on making more decisions for yourself in your everyday life. No one gains true skills without practicing and standing up for what they want. Taking control in situations is an absolute skill. You'll have to practice. Find little ways to take more control in your life and before you know it you'll be comfortable taking control in more and more serious situations., Don't spend time caring what other people think of you. It's not their life, it's yours! Instead, worry about what you think of you. Do things that make you feel good. Be the person that you want to be. In a few years, you'll be happy and successful, while they're working at the local 7 Eleven.

, The Bible says we must, ""Cry unto the Lord with all our might."" If you don't want it that badly, stay on your knees until you do or meditate on it and think of whether you even truly want it.
James 1:5 says, ""If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him."" Use your name---""If I(your name) lack wisdom let me(your name) ask of God who gives to all men liberally, and does not reprove those who ask , and it will be given to me."" It's called claiming scripture in prayer, and when you say to God ""You promised this, and I've done what You said I needed to to get it..."" He gives-God never, ever, goes back on His promises. He said, ""Ask and ye shall receive, knock and he will answer, seek him and you will find him.""

, This means to pray inside your head to God. This will be a very hard thing to do at the beginning, but when you get going it will be a HUGE blessing in your life. You will gain a MUCH closer relationship with God and will feel his love much more.

, God gave his only begotten son to die for us! When you do what's right, God will know because he knows the intent of your heart.

, If you are surrounded by others trying to do the right thing it will become much easier. There is strength in numbers. ""Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there shall I be."" (Matthew 18:20) Luckily, the majority of the Western world is Christian, of various denominations.

, It is very difficult to resist the constant temptations of people who constantly sin if you're always hanging out with them. That being said, if these people are real friends and you ask them to tone it down slightly because they're making you uncomfortable, then it is possible that they might. On the other hand, if these people laugh to the idea of doing that, then maybe it's time to find some new friends.

, For example, if someone asks you to smoke/drink think about what it will do to your body and think about whether God would approve of this. Repeat to yourself that your body is the temple of God. Say NO. Ask the Lord to continue to bless you with strength to resist temptations.

, You don't have to be spineless to be cool. Be confident in what you know to be true and remember what you want to avoid.

Communicate with your sibling often.,
Spend time together doing fun activities.,
Find out what is important to them.,
Remember birthdays and special occasions.",How to Be a Good Sister1," Whether you live in the same house or across the country from one another, regular communication is important in enforcing sibling bonds. Stay in touch with your sibling any way that you can.Call or Skype your sibling once a week if they far live away.
Eat meals together if you live nearby.
Text them to let them know that you are thinking about them.
Post interesting articles on their social media page.

See a movie together.
Take a walk after dinner.
Hang out at the beach.
Bake cookies at home.
Have an arts and crafts night.

, You and your sibling may have different tastes, hobbies, and habits, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t still have fun with them. Find out what they enjoy or find important. Ask if you can join them next time they do it.For example, if your sibling plays soccer, ask them when their next game is so that you can cheer them on.
If your sibling loves to play video games, ask them to teach you how to play their favorite game.
If your sibling is into a certain band, see if they want to see a concert together.

Help your sibling when they need it.,
Compliment them on their best qualities.,
Appreciate your sibling for what they do for you.,
Listen if your sibling needs to talk.,
Stand up for your sibling.",How to Be a Good Sister2," Whether your sibling is struggling with school, work, or personal issues, they can benefit from their sister's love and assistance. If they ask you for help, assist them in any way that you can.Don't wait for your sibling to ask you for help. If they seem like they're struggling, reach out to them. You can say, ""Hey, is everything ok? Is there anything I can do to help?""
Sometimes your sibling may not want you to interfere. Respect their decision, but state that you will be there if they change their mind. You can say, “I understand. Just let me know if you ever do want my help.”

, Don't hold back on noticing your sibling's skills and accomplishments. Let them know when they have made you proud or what you admire about them.If you know your sibling is insecure about something, lift their spirits by admiring them. For example, if your brother is worried about getting into college, you can say, “You’ve been working so hard! No matter what ends up happening, I know you’ll do well.”
Congratulate them on them on their accomplishments. For example, if a sibling wins an award, let them know how proud you are.

, When your sibling does a favor for you or if they support you, express gratitude to them. Let them know that you appreciate their presence in your life.For example, you can say, “Thank you so much for always listening when I need to talk. It makes me so happy to know I have a sibling like you.”

, When things happen in life, talking to a sibling can be a big help. You can get your siblings to open up to you by opening up them first. Be willing to share things and to listen to what they want to share.Sometimes, a person just needs someone to listen, not to give advice. Before sharing your wisdom, ask, “do you want my advice?” If they say no, just listen.
Let your sibling know that you are listening by occasionally repeating things that they say. For example, you can say, “I see. So your boss overlooked you for the promotion?”
Always keep your sibling's secrets. The only exception is where someone is likely to be endangered by keeping a secret.

, If your sibling is having a hard time with someone, ask them what you can do to help. They may ask you to talk to the other person or to help them file a complaint. If your sibling asks you to not interfere, you can still provide emotional support by letting them come talk to you.


If two siblings are fighting with each other, try to avoid taking sides. Instead, say politely, “I think this is something you both need to work out together.”

Establish your boundaries before problems arise.,
Handle conflict in a calm manner.,
Avoid teasing siblings on sensitive subjects.,
Learn to compromise.,
Give your sibling space.,
Avoid judging your sibling.",How to Be a Good Sister3," Don’t expect your siblings to read your mind. Let them know ahead of time how they can respect your space and your belongings. Tell them in person, or post a sign.For example, if you buy special coffee, you may decide that you don’t want other people drinking it. Ask your siblings to get your permission before using your special coffee.
You can also ask them to respect your personal space and free time. You might say, ""When I come home from school, I need 30 minutes to relax on my own. Please don't bother me during this time.""

, If a fight does erupt, try to remain calm. Yelling or whining won't help you and your siblings solve the problem. Speak in a level voice, and avoid accusing or blaming others.Speak calmly and stick to the facts. If you feel yourself getting heated, ask for time out and go to another room to calm down.
If the issue is minor, try to laugh it off, and walk away.Do not bring up past conflicts in a current fight. This will only drag out grudges. Instead, focus on the issue at hand.

, Teasing is natural in a family relationship, but you should make sure that you never call out or make fun of an issue that your sibling is sensitive about. For example, if your sister is defensive about the way that she dresses, avoid making fun of her style.

, Sometimes, you may need to compromise to prevent an argument. If you and your sibling's needs or wants conflict with each other, see if you can work out a solution. Remember that compromise is a two-way street. Both of you should give a little.For example, if you both like to have 20 minutes in the bathroom but your sibling needs to use it at the same time as you, cut the time in half for each of you rather than giving up your time.

, Time spent together is great but so is time spent apart. If you crowd your sibling, they may feel suffocated. Instead, respect when your sibling needs time alone and time with friends.Don't touch or use your sibling's stuff without their permission. You may also want to avoid entering their room without their knowledge.

, Your sibling may have a certain lifestyle that you disapprove of, but you should not judge or criticize them for living their own life. No matter how much you may disagree with them, try to respect your sibling’s ability to make their own choices.


If you know that a subject, such as politics or religion, is going to start a fight, avoid talking about it.
If your sibling has a problem that could cause harm to them, such as substance abuse or suicidal thoughts, encourage them to get help.

Let your siblings figure out some things for themselves. Making mistakes that are not life-threatening is part of learning and growing up.

Avoid compromising situations.",How to Stand Up to Peer Pressure," You will know when something doesn't feel right. Even if your friend might feel okay about the situation, it might not be okay for you. Be strong and do what is right for you.Your friends will respect your choices, and those that don't respect your decisions are people you don't want to have in your life to begin with.


Remember that your opinion and feelings matter, even if they go against the group. You should never be ashamed of not wanting to drink or do drugs. Just because your friends may be ready to have sex doesn't mean you are ready - and there is nothing wrong with that. You are an individual, and you matter. Never let anyone make you feel less than that or question what you believe is right.;
, Every person is an individual who enjoys different things. You don't have to do the things your friends or peers do. Maybe you like comic books while they like basketball, or maybe you like swimming while they like video games. Be confident in the things that you like and do things that make you happy. Spend your time engaging in healthy activities that you are passionate about.Doing activities that you like can help you avoid peer pressure. If you are giving in to peer pressure, you are consenting to participate in activities that you are uncomfortable doing. These activities are probably not healthy for you, otherwise you wouldn't feel bad about doing them. Have the confidence to know what you like and what you don't. Keep your focus on the activities you like.
Don't confuse this with not trying new things. Just because you don't like sports doesn't mean you shouldn't go to the park and kick around a soccer ball with your friends. Focusing on what you enjoy and your interests can help you be more self-assured, which will make resisting peer pressure easier.

, Maybe it's playing an instrument or a new sport. Maybe it's spending time outside, or starting a collection. The reason peer pressure works is because sometimes you feel like being accepted by your friends is the most important thing in the world. If you have other things going on in your life that make you feel awesome, you won't depend so much on what your friends think of you. By joining new clubs, trying new activities, and learning new skills, you will meet people and make friends who have similar interests. These friends will accept you and encourage you through your new activities.

, Decide what you believe and stand by your principles. Your opinions matter; what you think is important. You want to make it clear that there are some things you believe strongly about, and that you won't do these things before those situations come up.


For example, if you know you don't want to smoke, don't wait until someone offers you a cigarette. Find ways to mention to people that you never want to smoke in everyday life. Tell people that you don't understand wasting money on cigarettes. Mention how you hate the smell of smoke if you pass someone smoking. Post articles on Facebook or Twitter that show the effects of smoking on the lungs. If someone in your life has or had lung cancer, talk about how that made you resolve never to smoke. By taking this approach, the likelihood of someone trying to pressure you to do something you don't want to do will be much lower, because people will already know you're not into it.
Don't just form opinions about things you might be pressured into. Standing by your principles takes practice. Discuss your opinions with family members and friends so that you get comfortable expressing your opinion.Remember to share your opinion in respectful ways. Everyone is not going to agree with you. Calmly and respectfully explain your viewpoint, and listen attentively to the other person's point of view. , Take a look at your life, an honest look. Think about the things that trigger you to feel bad about yourself or to give in to peer pressure. Ask yourself these questions:


Who tries to pressure me into things I don't want to do?
When do I usually get pressured?
Where am I when these situations occur?
Why am I giving in?
Why is the approval of this particular person and/or group so important to me?
What will I lose if I don't gain the approval of this group?
Is giving in worth feeling bad about myself and disappointing my family and other friends?
After you answer the questions, look at your answers. Will everyone really hate you if you don't have that cigarette? If the boy won't like you if you don't have sex with him, is that really the kind of boy you want to be dating? Is your popularity really connected to you drinking that beer? Challenge these negative thoughts.Everybody at school won't hate you if you refuse a cigarette, joint, or beer. If popularity is connected to those things in a certain group, perhaps that's not the group for you. There are other groups of friends who won't make you do things that make you feel uncomfortable or bad about yourself.

, Peer pressure thrives on making you feel bad about yourself, therefore making you feel that you have to do whatever your friends are doing in order to feel good about yourself. Make a resolution that no one is allowed to do this to you anymore. Remember what Eleanor Roosevelt said: ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent""., You don't want to avoid what could possibly be fun situations just because of the threat of peer pressure. Instead, prepare yourself mentally for instances of peer pressure so you will be ready to respond positively. Think of scenarios where you might feel pressured. Visualize all the details; what people would do and say, where you are. Rehearse your response.


If you want to go to a party, go to the party. If you are afraid you might be pressured into drinking, doing drugs, or having sex, prepare responses for those situations. Hold a can of soda or bottle of water so people might be deterred from offering you alcohol., If you know you are going to a party or into another situation where peer pressure might be strongest, don't go alone. Go in a group of like-minded friends. If two or three of you go to a party and don't want to drink or do drugs, support each other. Sometimes, it is much easier to stand up to peer pressure when you're not alone and when you have to be held accountable to another person., If you know that you might be faced with alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, or sex, have a some responses ready. Keep the phrases casual and light. ""Nah, I'm good"" or ""No, that's just not my thing"" is a great way to turn down an offer.


If that still doesn't work, blame it on your parents: ""My mom will totally smell smoke on my clothes/alcohol on my breath."" Say you can't afford to be grounded again, or if you lose your driving privileges you won't have a ride to work. Say ""No, my mom will kill me.""If you're in sports, say that smoking, drugs, or alcohol will interfere with your training.
If you're being pressured into having sex, say you don't have a condom. If the other person has a condom, say the thought of having sex around people doesn't appeal to you, that you don't feel well physically, or that you would rather talk to your friends/dance/play a game. If you're a girl, claim it is your time of the month.

, Try suggesting that the group does something else. Saying ""Hey, let's do ___________ instead"" is a way to divert the attention and conversation, and hopefully help you out of the situation.


Offer to go get food for people: ""No thanks! I'm pretty hungry actually -does anyone else want pizza right now?"" Talk about the music playing or a movie someone is watching, or suggest going to find some other friends.

, You always have the right to say no. No one should ever make you feel bad for not wanting to do something before you're ready, like sex, or for not wanting to do something you don't want to do, like drugs. Real friends won't try to pressure you into doing things you don't want to, but sometimes we find ourselves in situations with people who may not respect our wishes.



Say ""no thanks!"" in a casual way. Don't be rude, mean, or put others down. Be assertive and confident when you say no.
Maintain eye contact. Speak up; don't mumble.Always speak with confidence. Body language speaks volumes. If you show any signs of weakness, the person pressuring will continue until they have won the battle.

, Sometimes, people will continue trying to pressure you. Keep strong to your principles, be confident, and say no. Try to stay nice to the person; you want to avoid provoking them into an argument if at all possible.


Ask the person still pressuring you why they can't respect your choices. Say to them, ""I said no, why aren't you listening to me?"" or ""Please respect my choices like I'm respecting yours."", If all else fails, walk away if possible. Don't remain in a situation that might get you in trouble or where you feel uncomfortable. If you are at a party, leave the room and find other people to talk to. Call someone to pick you up if you are in a place you cannot easily leave.


Never allow someone to keep you in a place you do not feel comfortable. If someone is physically barring you from leaving, call for help.

, If things turn for the worse, like if you go with a friend to a party and it turns out everyone is getting drunk (including your friend, who drove you) have a plan for what you would do in that situation. Is there someone in your life who you could call who could come and pick you up?


Work out a code word with your parents. If you text them that code word, they can call you immediately. You can then say, ""Man, that was my mom/dad! I am in such trouble. I've got to go!""This can help you stay responsible and help you get out of a sticky situation, but also help you save face with your peers.
Call your parents and say you're feeling ill. Ask them to come pick you up.
Always have a phone on you with numbers of people you can call, like older siblings, other friends, relatives, friends' parents. If you don't have a cell phone, carry a list of numbers for people you can call.

, If you feel uncomfortable in a situation and don't feel like you can just say no straight out, try a humorous approach. A witty one-liner or well placed joke can dispel a situation and help deflect the attention., This is a last resort, because you can't lie every time you're put into a difficult situation. People will catch on and the pressure will be worse. But if you're in a bad spot, pretend to feel sick or like you're about to throw up. Say you're allergic to cigarette smoke or alcohol makes you sick to your stomach. Do whatever it takes to avoid doing something you know you don't want to do.

, Surround yourself with friends who have similar interests, principles, and standards as you. These friends are less likely to put you into compromising situations and will stand beside you if you both end up being pressured by peers.Having friends you can count on allows you to do other fun things if you have to walk away from peer pressure situations.


Support your friends. Be the person who helps stand up when a friend is in a situation they might find difficult.

, Are your friends starting to do more and more stuff that you don't want to do? Have they changed since you first became friends? Ask yourself why you are friends with them in the first place.


Maybe you can talk to them about their new habits. Sometimes people just want to explore new things; other times they do those things because they feel stressed out by something else. Try to talk to a friend with this approach: ""Hey, I noticed you've been doing a lot more smoking/drinking lately...that's fine and totally your choice, but what's up? You never used to do that stuff. Is everything ok?""

, Sometimes, you might have to break up with your friends. This can be really hard to do, but if your friends are constantly pressuring you to do stuff you don't want to do, maybe it's better to move on. If they don't respect your opinions and choices, they're not really you're friends in the first place.

, If you find yourself surrounded by people who participate in activities you feel uncomfortable doing, make new friends. If you started pursuing new interests, try to find new friends who have those same interests. Look for people at parties who are not drinking, doing drugs, smoking, or having sex. Talk to people in your classes who may have similar interests. There are other people who are avoiding the same things you are.

, Don't allow yourself to get into situations where you might be pressured. Be confident enough to not go to a party you know will have tons of alcohol and drugs, or go back to an empty house with a guy or girl you're not ready to get intimate with. Evaluate situations you put yourself into, and make smart decisions."

Find a quiet, private setting.,
Acknowledge your sister’s feelings.Begin your apology by noting that you hurt your sister and that you want to address her hurt feelings.,
Take responsibility for your actions.,
Use “I” statements in your apology.,
Give your sister time to accept your apology.",How to Apologize to Your Older Sister1," Start by finding a quiet area in your house where you can address your sister in private. This may be in a room you share together or in your sister’s room. Making the apology in a private, quiet space will show your sister that you are serious about your apology and want to discuss the matter away from others.Try to make your heartfelt apology in person, face to face. Texting or emailing an apology can seem disingenuous and may not hold as much of an emotional impact as an in person apology.
You should also choose a time that is most convenient for your older sister. Do not try to apologize to her when she is in a rush and on her way out or when she is hanging out with friends at home. Choose a time where she is alone and can focus on your apology.;
, Do not use “if” or “but” when you speak to your sister. Be honest and acknowledge that your sister is upset.


For example, you may say, “I understand that your feelings may have been hurt when I read your diary without asking for your permission,” or you may say, “I realize that I made you upset when I said unkind things to you in front of your friends.”

, You should then be willing to admit that you acted poorly or that you were in the wrong. Taking responsibility for your actions will show your sister that you realize you behaved badly and want to make amends for your behavior towards her.Avoid mentioning your sibling’s own behavior and do not try to blame your sister or make her feel bad. You are apologizing for your actions, not putting your sister on trial for her actions. Blaming her will only make her more upset.
You may say, “I know that I acted badly when I read your diary” or “I can see now that my unkind words toward you were hurtful and unfair.” You may also say, “I was mad at you but I should not have taken my anger out on you.”

, Make sure you own up to your actions by using “I” statements in your apology. This will show your sister that you are standing by your words and willing to acknowledge that you acted poorly towards her.

You should say “sorry” once to your sister, with intention and feeling. Avoid saying “sorry” multiple times as it may sound hollow or empty after you say it once. Maintain eye contact with her when you make your apology. This will let her know you are serious and genuine.
For example, you may say, “I’m sorry for what I did to you,” or “I apologize for being hurtful and unfair toward you.”

, Do not expect your sister to forgive you right away. She may accept your apology but still be upset at you, or she may not respond at all to your apology. Your sister may need time to process her anger and will accept your apology when she is ready.Keep in mind your sister is not obligated to accept your apology right away, or at all. You should be respectful toward her and give her time to forgive you.
If your sister responds to your apology with feedback or comments about your behavior, you should listen to it without judgement. Be willing to listen to what she has to say and use this feedback to improve your behavior towards her in the future. Do not retaliate or get upset if she responds to your apology with comments or feedback.

Write her an apology letter.,
Make her an apology poem.,
Give her an apology gift.",How to Apologize to Your Older Sister2," Sometimes it’s hard to say “I’m sorry” in person, especially if you feel you have really hurt or upset your older sister. It can also be intimidating to apologize to your older sibling, as you may look up to her as a role model. If you are nervous about apologizing to your older sister in person, you may want to write her an apology letter and give it to her to read on her own time.You can start the letter with “Dear Sis”, and then lay out your apology. First, you may acknowledge your sister’s feelings and then take responsibility for your actions.
You may end the letter with a heartfelt “I’m sorry for what I did” and a note that you understand it may take your sister some time to accept your apology. You may also offer to talk in person when she is less angry and end the letter with “I love you” to let your sister know you still care for her.

, Another way you can show your sister you are apologetic for your behavior is to compose an apology poem. This may be a good option if you feel more comfortable expressing your emotions in a creative way and do not want have to use the more formal letter format.ref>http://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/apology-to-my-sister</ref>

#*You may title the poem, “An Apology for My Big Sister.” You may then use the free verse form to write a poem where you address your sister’s feelings and own up to your bad behavior.

You may end the poem with a line that says, simply, “I’m sorry for what I did to you.” You may then sign and date the poem and give it to your sister so she can read it in private.

, You can also help to soften your sister’s anger at you by giving her a special gift as an apology. You should think of a unique gift that will show her you feel bad about how you treated her and that you want to make amends for your actions.For example, if you stole your older sister’s diary, you may give her the gift of a new diary with a better lock and key system. Or, if you broke your sister’s favorite item, you may try to find the same item and replace it as a gift.
You may also want to tie an apology gift to your heartfelt apology. Telling your sister how sorry you are and then presenting her with an apology gift could end up winning her over. She may be more likely to forgive you if you offer up a gift with your apology.

Focus on your sister’s positives qualities.,
Consider your sister’s point of view.,
Make an effort to do kind things for your sister.",How to Apologize to Your Older Sister3," If you start to get angry about something, then it is a good idea to calm yourself down before you talk to your sister. The next time you have a problem with your sister, try taking a 15 minute break to calm down before you talk to her. Some good techniques to try include:Deep breathing.

Meditation.

Progressive muscle relaxation.

, Siblings tend to fight often over petty and serious issues. You may find yourself in conflict with your older sister often, even as you both get older. You can avoid conflicts with her by taking the time to focus on her positive qualities. Often, it can be easy to ignore her positive traits and qualities, and instead only focus on the negative.For example, maybe your sister tends to complain and nag you often about your life choices. You may try to focus on the positive aspects of her behavior, as she is likely nagging you because she is concerned about you and cares about your well-being.
You may also try to keep in mind that though your sister nags you, she is also there to support you when you fail or when you are having a hard time. Her positive qualities may outweigh her negative qualities, especially when it comes to her treatment of you.

, You should always try to view a situation through your sister’s eyes and avoid getting defensive. Maybe your perspective on a situation was different than hers and this lead to a conflict. Or maybe your approach to a certain issue seemed faulty from her perspective. Be willing to consider and respect her point of view, even if you may not completely agree with it.For example, you may feel like your sibling was always the golden child when you were younger or that she gets preferential treatment from your parents now. You could then consider your childhood through her eyes and realize how much pressure and expectation was placed on her growing up. You may be more empathetic toward her if you view the situation from her point of view.

, Try to do at least one nice thing for your sister. This could be something small, like putting toothpaste on her toothbrush in the morning or asking how her day went at school. Doing kind things for her can help to foster a more caring and giving relationship with her. You are both then less likely to get into a conflict or a fight if you are treating each other with respect and consideration.Be willing to tell your sister the things you admire or appreciate about her. You may say, “I like that you have a good sense of humor, even when you are having a bad day,” or you may say, “I appreciate when you stick up for me in front of the bullies at school.” Complimenting her on her behavior will help to create a relationship with her that is respectful and honest.

Have older siblings help with baby tasks.",How to Help Young Siblings Bond1," Playing together can help your children bond at any age. There are many ways you can get them to play. Try getting them to play a game, like tag, hide and seek, or even cards or a board game. For younger children, let them play with toys that are age appropriate for the youngest child.Very young siblings can play age-specific games, like peek-a-boo or patty cake.
If siblings are reluctant to include one another, try scheduling ""sibling time"" and ""me time"" into their playtime.
If your children have a battery-powered or pedal-powered car, let the younger sibling ride in the passenger side while the older sibling drives them around.
Simple games can help children bond if they have different interests or abilities that may impede their bonding.;
, Having children explore their imaginations and pretend together may help them bond. Think about what your children like to do and find a way to get all siblings involved. Pretend scenarios can help them explore their creative sides and find fun ways to play.


For example, they can pretend to be kings and queens in a castle or animals in the jungle.
Toddlers can also join in the pretend fun. An older sibling might pretend to be the doctor while the younger siblings are the patients. Older siblings may be the cooks and servers in a restaurant and the younger siblings can be the customers.

, Another way your children can spend time together and bond is by doing crafts together. You can adjust the crafts for each child based on their level of development, but they can use the same materials and complete the projects together. Craft projects are a great way for siblings to spend time together no matter their age, developmental stage, or ability.


For example, they can color together out of the same coloring book, or draw pictures together.
You can let them paint flowerpots in the spring or Christmas ornaments in the winter. If one or two siblings are too young to do it alone, let the older siblings help them.
Toddlers can also do craft projects with older siblings. Let them work on motor skills by drawing and coloring with crayons.

, Try to challenge your children in ways that require teamwork. Working together toward a common goal can help them bond while avoiding trying to compete for your affection. You can find ways for them to do chores or play together as a team, with a great reward at the end.For example, make it a team game where all the siblings put up their toys before a timer goes off. Make sure they all get involved and help each other, and encourage them as they complete the task.
Try setting up a treasure hunt around the house and yard, using hints and clues your children will have to work together to solve., Your children can bond by turning to each other to complete tasks instead of you or other adults. This helps older siblings feel important and protective while the younger siblings learn to trust older siblings. Because they are relying on each other, their bond will strengthen.For example, if your younger children need help picking out clothes, let the older siblings help. You can say, “Ask your siblings. They’re really good at picking out shirts!” If your older children can manage it, you can then let them help the younger ones get dressed.
Your older children can read stories to their younger siblings, or kiss them and help calm them down if they’re having a crying fit.

, It may be more difficult for children who have three or more siblings to bond because there are so many. However, you can help your children bond by providing them with activities they can do together. Choose activities that all children, despite ability or age, can do.For example, have everyone bake cookies together, make crafts, build forts, ride bikes, or play at the park. Encourage them to play board or card games that everyone can play, like Go Fish.
This is important if you have groups of children who are closer. The children who are closer may play together when unsupervised. Supervising activities where your children all spend time together can help strengthen the bonds between those who are not as close.

, Teaching your children the importance of family, love, and kindness will help their bonds. One of the best ways to do this is through example. You and your partner should treat each other and each child with love and kindness. This teaches your young children how families treat each other.For example, instead of yelling at your children or partner, talk about things calmly and find alternate ways of conflict resolution.
Show kindness and thoughtfulness to everyone in your family. Encourage them to do things for each other, like bringing their sibling a sweater or blanket if they said they were cold or remembering their favorite food at the grocery store.

, When you have infants or toddlers, try to help the siblings create a bond by letting the older sibling hold the younger one. Teach the older sibling the proper way to hold and interact with their younger sibling.By letting the older sibling hold the younger one, the older sibling starts to feel a connection to their new younger sibling, and the younger sibling emotionally attaches to the older sibling.

, Another way to have your older child bond with an infant or toddler sibling is by having them help take care of them. You can have the older sibling feed the baby, change the diaper, change their clothes, or help during bath time.If the older sibling is too young to do any of this on their own, have them help you as you take care of the baby.
Make sure to teach the older sibling how to properly take care of the baby so the younger sibling won't get hurt.

Teach conflict resolution.,
Try letting the siblings work out conflict.,
Intervene when necessary.,
Avoid taking sides.,
Allow the children to spend time apart.",How to Help Young Siblings Bond2," Your children will fight, and teaching them how to resolve conflict themselves can help them have a better relationship. Start by setting limits, and then teach alternate ways of responding instead of physical violence.For example, if one child hits another, you may say, “I understand you hit your sibling because they took your toy. Do not hit. Hitting hurts. Instead, use your words. Tell them to give your toy back and to ask if they want to play with it.”

, Though you may want to step in every time they are arguing, you should try to let your children work out conflict on their own. Watch over them to make sure one sibling is not being mean to the others or they are not hurting each other, but try not to interfere.Infants and toddlers should be allowed to work things out with their siblings. This helps teach them how to handle conflict in the future and learn how to approach conflict with others.
Encourage the kids to come up with solutions. You may say, “Though you are arguing, I know you can come with a positive solution that works for all of you.”
When you get involved, try not to pick sides. This can cause resentment. Instead, treat all your children fairly.

, Children can sometimes become violent or upset when they have a conflict with a sibling. They may bite, hit, kick, yell, or scream. When your children do these things, you should intervene. Let all the siblings know that violent and negative behavior will not be tolerated.For example, you may step between your toddler and five year old who are hitting each other. You may have to take their hands and say, ""You do not hit your sibling.""

, When you mediate between your children, make sure not to take sides. This does not emphasize the bond between them, but can instead hurt the bond. Taking on child's side can cause resentment to build between them. Instead, stay neutral.When you are mediating, make sure to acknowledge all of your children and their sides or points.

, No siblings should be around each other all the time. Let them spend time with other children or adults, or let them play alone. This helps give them space so they’re not getting tired of each other and on each other’s nerves.Spend time with each child alone. Do something each child would like to do when it’s just the two of you. This can help your children not feel jealous of the other siblings.
Plan group play activities with other children so that your kids can socialize with kids other than their siblings.

"
"
Schedule family activities.,
Play kids versus parents games.,
Avoid comparing your children.",How to Help Young Siblings Bond3," Another way for your children to bond is when your family bonds together. Come up with ways for your family to spend time together. This can be a weekly tradition or something fun you do once each year. This helps your children create shared memories.This may be a weekly pizza and movie night, baking cookies on weekends, or going to the park.
Plan fun outings for your kids where they can do things together. For example, let them go on rides together at an amusement park. Look for a children's museum in your area, or a children's climbing gym or obstacle course.
Try to choose something that may involve a challenge, like camping or hiking, in which your children must work together.
You can do this even if you have an infant or toddler. Take all the kids to the pool or beach and encourage your older child to play with water toys while the infant floats safely near them.

, Instead of letting your children compete against each other, let them compete against you and your partner. Having the children team up together to defeat the parents can help them work together and bond.For example, you can play hide and seek, a board game, tag, or even a water fight.

, One of the fastest ways to foster resentment is by comparing your children. Remember that your children are different people who do things differently and have different likes. Try not to take sides and don’t pick a favorite.Try not to say things like, “Your brother never…” or “Your sister always…” You should also avoid saying, “Why can’t you be more like your sibling?”

"
"
Keep age-appropriate boundaries.,
Allow the children to have their own possessions.,
Teach appropriate behavior.",How to Help Young Siblings Bond4," Though spending time together is important for siblings, the age difference means there are some things the older siblings can do that the younger ones can’t. Avoid letting your younger children do everything the older ones do if it is not age-appropriate.For example, don’t let younger siblings play with dangerous toys or ride on bikes that are too large for them. They should also not be allowed to stay up late with their siblings, or allowed to watch everything their older sibling might be able to.
Remember, too, that your older child is still a child, not a babysitter or caretaker. If they are constantly forced to play with or watch their younger siblings, they may develop resentment. Make sure you are giving your older child time to be a kid and play with children their own age.

, While sharing is important, you may want to let the children have certain toys or items that are only for them. This means they are off-limits to their siblings. This can help them have independence and feel like they have their own space and things. Making sure all siblings respect this can help reduce resentment.For example, your children may have a favorite stuffed animal, doll, car, action figure, blanket, or pillow that they do not want to share. That is okay. Make sure the siblings know which items are off limits.
You may want to give each child a box with their name on it where they can put their special toys.

, Rivalry often occurs in siblings when a younger child’s inappropriate behavior is overlooked. This can cause bad feelings, especially if the older children get in trouble. To avoid this, teach all your children appropriate behavior. Help your younger children know when they are inappropriate and show them the proper behavior.For example, you can help the younger child not grab their sibling’s toys. When you see them snatch a doll or block, mildly correct your child.
You may say, “We must take turns with toys. Your sibling is playing with that doll right now, and you can’t grab it when they play with it. Instead, if you’re patient, polite, and wait your turn, you can play with it when they’re done.”

Let go of blame.,
Think about writing a letter.,
Strive to be sincere.,
Figure out concrete ways to make up for your mistake.,
Begin with a sincere expression of remorse.,
Express regret.,
Acknowledge your mother's feelings.,
Do not assign blame.,
Ask for forgiveness.,
Give your mom time and space, if necessary.,
Do not use non-apology language.,
Give your mom space before apologizing, if necessary.,
Back up your apology with actions.",How to Say Sorry to Your Mother After a Great Mistake," Oftentimes, you may go into an apology feeling hesitant or resentful. If you feel something wasn't your fault, you may think an apology is unnecessary. However, if you made a mistake that hurt your mom, an apology is important. You need to acknowledge your part in hurting another person. Do not blame others for your actions.You may feel the mistake was not 100% your doing. This is probably true. There are few situations in life where the blame completely falls on a single individual. External factors can easily influence a decision and can contribute to a mistake.
An apology, however, is not about who or what is to blame. An apology is about taking your responsibility, however small, for your actions. Even if your mistake was mostly caused by other people or a situation, it hurt your mother.
For example, you were talked into blowing off your mom's birthday party by your brother. While it was your brother's idea, you still blew off the party. You need to take responsibility for that.;
, You do not have to give an apology in person. A thoughtful letter can be just as effective. In certain situations, it may be more effective to write a letter.If you're very nervous or embarrassed, a letter may make more sense. For an apology to be effective, it should be thorough and sincere. If you worry about expressing your feelings fully in person, writing a letter is probably a good option.
This also may be a good option if your mom tends to be somewhat difficult to talk to. If you're worried your mom will get angry, and prevent you from talking, send her a thoughtfully written letter. For example, if your mom is still very mad about you blowing off her party, a face-to-face apology could easily turn into an argument. A letter is probably a better route. You want to make sure your words are understood.

, A sincere apology is more likely to be accepted. Before going in to apologize, spend some time reflecting on your actions. This will help you form a sincere understanding of why what you did was wrong, allowing you to more effectively offer an apology.Think about why what you did was wrong. Consider your role in the mistake, and how it hurt others. Make sure you're ready to admit his. Rehearse what you want to say, watching to make sure you accept your part in the wrongdoing.
For example, don't say, ""I'm sorry my friend Sarah convinced me to take your car without asking."" Instead, say, ""I'm sorry for taking your car without asking."" You want to make sure your mom sees you sincerely understand you acted poorly.
Do not attempt to apologize until you know you mean your words. You may have to spend some time reflecting, and rehearse your apology several times. Try to empathize with your mother. Consider how you would feel in her position.

, An apology should be the beginning, and not the end. In addition to apologizing, you will need to show your mother you've learned and are willing to change. Think of a few ways you could show your mom you will make up for the mistake.Expressing remorse will feel empty if you don't let your mom know how you're willing to change. Think about what you did, and write down a few ways you can make sure it does not happen again in the future.
For example, you took your mom's car with your friend. Think about the circumstances that led to this. Maybe this friend tends to get you into trouble a lot. Maybe you were consuming alcohol at the time, lowering your inhibitions. You could say something like, ""I will try to spend less time with Sarah, especially when I'm drinking. I don't like the person I am when I drink, and I know I shouldn't let her drag me into these things.""

, The best way to begin an apology is to start at the beginning. The point of apologizing is to express remorse, so do that right away without hesitance. Your apology should begin with something like, ""I'm incredibly sorry for what I did and how it hurt you.""Remember to strive for sincerity. If you don't genuinely feel sorry, your mom can pick up on this. Make sure to go into the situation with your mom's feelings in mind. Ask yourself how she would feel in the same situation.
If you're writing a letter, the same rule applies. You can open the letter with something like, ""Dear Mom, I'm sincerely sorry for the way my actions hurt you.""

, Regret should come immediately after the initial apology. Regret shows that you genuinely reflected on your mistake, and understand why your actions were wrong. Whether apologizing in person or in a letter, express regret immediately after the initial ""I'm sorry.""Always take full responsibility for your actions. While you can certainly explain the circumstances surrounding your actions, do not do so in a way that denies your wrongdoing.
For example, say something like, ""I was drinking the night we took your car, and Sarah can be very pushy with me. However, there's no excuse for what we did. Even though I was not myself that night, I should have known that behavior was unacceptable.""

, This can be the hardest part of apologizing. It can be painful to recall how your actions hurt someone. However, this is one of the most important parts of apologizing. Your mom will feel better if her feelings are acknowledged.Spend a few sentences imaging what your mom may have felt. Express remorse at your part in making her feel this way.
For example, ""You must have been incredibly worried not knowing where the car was. When you found out I had it, I imagine you felt betrayed and disappointed. I'm sure the whole night was unbelievably stressful for you. I truly regret putting you in that position. I hate that my behavior affected you in this way.""

, You should never assign blame during an apology. You may not be completely in control of your actions. However, you're not apologizing for the circumstances surrounding your behavior. You're apologizing for your role in that behavior. Keep this is mind throughout the apology.When explaining yourself, be brief and avoid any explanations that can sound like excuses.
For example, ""I'm sorry Sarah convinced me to take the car."" While your friend may have pushed you into your mistake, you still made it. A more effective apology would be something like, ""I'm sorry I did not stand up to Sarah, and took the car without asking.""

, You should always end an apology with a request for forgiveness. This leaves the door open for reconciliation. You can end your apology with something simple, like, ""I hope you can find a way to forgive me moving forward.""Understand forgiveness takes time, especially when a big mistake is involved. Try to acknowledge this when asking for forgiveness. For example, you can add something like, ""I understand it may be awhile before you can let go of this hurt. Take as much time as you need.""

, You cannot always expect an apology to be accepted right away. Time may be necessary for forgiveness if you've made a big mistake. Be willing to give your mother the time she needs to forgive you.If you're apologizing, understand the words ""I'm sorry"" will not be enough. If you made a mistake that seriously betrayed your mother's trust, the apology is only the beginning of a healing process.
In the weeks that come, avoid using your apology to deny your mother's feelings. She may still be hurt for awhile, and if she expresses as much, accept this and be patient. Avoid saying things like, ""Well, I apologized a week ago. What more do you want?""

, Language can sometimes take away the power of an apology. Watch your language while apologizing. Make sure you don't use any words or phrases that can make your apology sound more like an excuse.One of the biggest mistakes is saying something like, ""I'm sorry, but..."" If you feel inclined to add a ""but,"" refrain from doing so. Simply skip to apologizing for your actions.
Also, remember you're apologizing for your actions. You are not apologizing for the circumstances or for your mother's feelings. Do not say, ""I'm sorry what I did upset you."" Say, ""I'm sorry for what I did."" Do not say, ""I'm sorry the situation got out of control."" Instead, say, ""I'm sorry for my part in the situation.""

, You may want to apologize as soon as you can. However, remember that your apology is about your mother and not you. If your mom does not seem ready to listen to you, give it a few days before you attempt to apologize.If your mom seems very angry, you may not want to apologize right away. If your mom is hurt and upset, she will not be as willing to listen to your side.
Don't give it more than a few days, however. Waiting weeks to apologize can make you come off as cold. It may look like you did not feel an apology was necessary. Do not wait more than a few days before attempting an apology.

, An apology is a means to an end. It's not an end on its own. After laying out several concrete ways you can change, follow through on this. Show your mom you've learned from your mistakes in addition to telling her.Think about the potential causes for your actions. How can you go about preventing these actions from occurring in the future? Think of several ways you can change, and follow through on these actions.
For example, you borrowed your mom's car without asking when hanging out with a troublesome friend and drinking. You can stop drinking and limit your contact with this friend. You can also be more upfront with you mom about where you're going and who you're with. Strive to be more respectful of her rules.

Then ask him to tell you one of his favorite jokes in return.


If you don’t know any good jokes, there are lots of great joke books for kids at the library, and many websites full of funny jokes. Search for “jokes for kids” and get ready to start laughing.;
, If your dad doesn't play a lot of video games, or isn't familiar with the games you like to play, give him a lesson! Invite your dad to play Minecraft or another video game you like. Show him how the controls work and explain what the point of the game is. Then give him a little while to get into it before you start killing him or blowing up his stuff.It can get pretty silly when non-gamer parents first try to play video games. Go easy on your dad, and don't be too upset if he doesn’t enjoy your game as much as you do, OR if he turns out to be a lot better at it than you!, Board games are even better than computer games for spending quality time with another person, because you actually have to look at each other and talk! Get out your favorite game out and set it up, and ask your dad if he’d like to play. You two will be having fun in no time!, Doing chores may not sound like a lot of fun, but you might be surprised how much fun it can be to help your dad cook dinner, or do the grocery shopping, or help him with yard work. If your dad is really busy, or you have a lot of siblings, this might be your best chance for getting some one-on-one time with your dad. He will be pleased that you offered to help, and it will give you a chance to spend some quality time together. Plus, if your dad gets finished doing chores early, he might have time for a more fun activity afterwards.


Make chores more fun by turning them into a competition. For example, if you are raking leaves, challenge your dad to see who can finish his half of the yard first. Not only does this make the work more fun, you might finish early and have time to do go get ice cream afterwards.

, This will be fun for you to hear, and it will be fun for your dad to tell. It will also remind your dad of what it was like to be your age, which might help the two of you feel more connected. Better yet, ask him if he has any pictures from his childhood he can show you. You can both share a laugh about how goofy everyone’s hair was, or how much you and your dad look alike., One of the best ways to have fun with your dad every day is to not get too upset about the dad things that he does. For example, if your dad tells you to pick up your socks, don’t get mad and argue about it, just pick up your socks. If your dad seems tired and grumpy in the evening, realize that he probably had a hard day at work and give him a break. Remember that being a parent is hard work, and dads are people, too.

, Has it been a long time since he’s been fishing? Does he love bowling but never get to go? Is there a movie out that he would like to see? Even if your dad’s choice is not your favorite activity, go along with it, you’ll have a lot more fun than you think!

, Plan a day and time, and help your dad get everything ready beforehand. Remember to check the weather, and have a backup plan in mind, in case it’s too stormy or cold to go out. Here are some ideas for outdoor activities you could do with your dad:


Go on a fishing trip. Be sure to get any licenses you need first, and pay attention to your dad’s instructions about safety and being quiet.
Go for a hike.. Find a trail near your home that is good for families. Be sure to bring snacks and water.
Go to a baseball/football/soccer game.
Fly a kite. You can have even more fun if you build the kite together first.Go to the zoo! It’s probably been ages since your dad has been to the zoo. Be sure to ask him what his favorite animal is, and to tell you about any that he’s seen in real life, or his favorite trip to the zoo when he was a kid.
Try playing disc golf. Disc golf is a great sport that dads and kids can play together. It doesn’t require much equipment, anyone can play, and there are courses all over the world. See if there is one near you!, There are also lots of great activities you and your dad can do indoors when the weather is bad, or if your dad is not the outdoorsy type. Here are some ideas:


Go to the movies.
Take your dad bowling.
Go to a skating rink.
Find an arcade. See if there is a nickel arcade in your area so you can play all day.
Batting cages can be a lot of fun, even if you don’t play baseball or softball.

, You don’t have to go out or spend a lot of money to have a great time with your dad. Here are some ideas for special activities you can do at home:


Bake something. Lots of dads cook, and even the ones that don’t regularly might enjoy baking a batch of chocolate cookies with their kids.
Play a game of chess or checkers. You can make your own checkerboard (an extra activity, too!) or use one you already have.
Do a craft project. Some dads love to do arts and crafts. Ask your dad if he’d be interested in doing some painting or making some homemade modeling dough. Listen to music. Ask your dad to play you his favorite album, or take turns sharing music you like with each other.
Have a Lego-building competition. Get out all of your building blocks, dump them in the pile, and challenge your dad to see who can build the best spaceship or house.
Build a fort. Get out blankets and pillows and drape them over chairs, and build a fort with your dad.
Have a tickle fight or a wrestling match. A bit of friendly roughhousing is a great way to bond with your dad. Just make sure you don’t break any furniture, or you’ll both be in trouble with mom!

, Lots of dads love camping, and camping with your dad is a great way to bond and have tons of fun. Help your dad get everything ready for the trip and pack the car, and don’t forget the hot dogs and marshmallows!, Think of something that your dad is great at or really loves to do, and ask him to teach you. Your dad will enjoy teaching you something that he cares about, and you will have fun and get to learn something at the same time! If you’re not sure what your dad is good at, or what he likes to do with his spare time, ask him!


If your dad likes to build stuff, ask him to teach you to use tools and help you build something in the garage. A birdhouse is always a fun project for dads and kids to do together.If you are old enough to learn to drive, ask your dad to give you lessons.
If your dad is great at fixing cars, ask him to show you how to change the oil, or rebuild an engine.
If your dad is a guitar player, ask him to teach you how to play.

, Many of the ideas listed above work just as well for older teens and adults as they do for younger children. Everyone loves jokes, for example, you just might want to choose more mature examples. The same holds true for movies, sporting events, and so forth.

, At some point, you will discover that you and your dad are no longer “child” and “adult” but two adults. This can be an uncomfortable transition for both of you, but it means that you and your dad can start enjoying fun activities together as peers.


Invite your dad out for a beer (after you reach the legal drinking age where you live).
If you are having friends over to watch the game, be sure to invite your dad.
Think of other activities that you like to do with your friends, and consider including your dad in some of them, or inviting him to do similar activities, just the two of you.
Observe what your dad likes to do with his friends, and ask if he would include you sometime.
Plan an adult vacation with your dad. He took you to Disneyland when you were a kid, now you can take him to Las Vegas, or Ireland, or somewhere else that he’s always wanted to go.

, Take your dad for a trip to the places you enjoyed together when you were a kid. If it’s feasible, ask him to show you where he grew up, as well.

, Grandparents can have an extremely important and positive influence in the lives of children.Being a grandfather is also a lot of fun! Take your kids to visit with your dad as often as possible. If distance is an obstacle, help them keep in touch with Skype, email, or phone calls, and help them get together as much as you can.

Be respectful.,
Be responsible.,
Use good language.,
Avoid violence.,
Be yourself.,
Protect others.,
Do what's right.",How to Be a Good Brother1," It's important to set a example for your siblings by always being respectful. Be respectful to them, of course, but you should also be respectful to your parents, your teachers, your friends, and even perfect strangers! Being respectful will help them a lot in life and if they learn it from someone they really respect, it will become a life-long habit.


Don't talk back to your parents or teachers. Politely argue if problems come up but otherwise do what you're told and show your sibling how it's done.;
, It's also very important for your sibling to learn how to be responsible. Don't do drugs or alcohol and do keep up with your chores and help around the house. Do good in school but be humble about your grades. Get a job if your schedule allows and save your money responsibly. This helps you but it also sets a great example for them. They'll see that hard work and sacrifice pay off.

, Definitely don't teach them every bad word in the book, but using good language also means speaking well. Speak correctly and with the best grammar and vocabulary you can manage. They'll pick up on your language and learn a lot. Good speech is often a sign of a better education and many employers consider it essential, so you'll be setting them up for a lifetime of success.

, You should try not to be violent towards your siblings and set an extra good example by not being violent towards anyone else either. Kids who learn that being violent is cool from their siblings may go on to violent lifestyles that land them in prison or worse. Instead, solve your problem peaceably and by talking it out. If someone tries to goad you into a fight, be the bigger person and walk away.


Boys who witness their parents being violent are twice as likely to be violent themselves, so what do you think they'll do if they see a brother that they really look up to being violent?

, Teach your siblings to respect themselves by always being themselves. Do this by being yourself. Pursue the things that you love and don't let popular opinion sway you. Be individual and forget the trends and doing what will make you the most popular. By doing these things, your sibling will learn to be confident in their own skin.

, Show your siblings that they should always stick up for the little guy and protect people who deserve protection by doing the same yourself. You never know, that little kid getting beat up at school may not have a brother that's able to protect him. Protecting the helpless will teach your siblings how to be good people and will make them respect you even more.

, Do the right thing, especially when it's hard. This also means apologizing or admitting when you're done something wrong. You want your siblings to be able to do the same, to always do the right thing. This will make both of you better people.

Look out for your siblings.",How to Be a Good Brother2," The best way to start having a better relationship with your siblings is to spend time with them. Hang out, play, go places... it doesn't matter. Do whatever feels right for you. This will give you great memories together and also build a friendship beyond the sibling relationship.

, You want your siblings to have great self confidence, so help them boost their confidence. Compliment them when they deserve it, help them build skills and get smarter, and help them do things that they can be proud of. This will also make you happy because not only will they be proud of themselves but you'll be proud of them too.

, If you want to have a good relationship with your siblings, you should have a lot of trust between you. When they tell you something, don't go and tell your parents. Keep things just between the two of you, unless your sibling asks you to tell your parents. If you can't trust each other, you'll probably have a hard relationship for the rest of your lives.


You should also build their trust by creating a safe place for them to come and talk about their problems. You should never laugh at them or judge them for the things they say to you, so that they know they can always come to you without fear of how you'll react.

, Don't try to make them into you and don't be angry if they don't always make the decisions you wish they would. Respect that they are their own individuals and celebrate them, just the way they are. Try to do some of their unique hobbies with them or at least talk with and ask them about it from time to time.

, You will probably disagree about stuff sometimes. That's just how being siblings goes. But when you argue or when they do something you disagree with, try to see things from their point of view. Sympathize with them and understand that they're probably trying their best. This will help cut down on fights.


Seeing things from their perspective can also be done every day. Appreciating their struggles in life and respecting them for what they go through will give you both a better respect for the other.

, When they have problems, help them! Don't just do it for them but show them how to fix it themselves. This will make their life better in the long run but it will also develop the friendship between you.


However, if they refuse your help, you need to respect their wishes. If they really want to try to do things on their own, the best you can do is to be there for them if they fail or need help still.

, Encourage your siblings to go out and do what they want with their lives. Encourage them to reach for the stars. Encourage them to be better people. These things will help them achieve more in life and to be happier people. This will save you from the heartbreak of seeing them hurt and suffering.

, Your siblings might someday run into trouble, whether they're getting bullied or they're hanging out with the wrong crowd. No matter the situation, you should stick up for and protect your sibling, helping them to make better choices as necessary. You may not always win these battles, but your sibling will never have to doubt how much you love them and you'll never have to feel guilty about not doing enough to protect them.

Comfort your sibling when they're sad.,
Do nice things for your sibling.,
Make then feel good about themselves.,
Get them thoughtful gifts.,
Be generous.,
Visit and call them when you're older or far apart.",How to Be a Good Brother3," A good hug and a kind word will go a long way when your sibling is sad. Let them talk about their problems (or not talk about their problems!) and just show them that you're there for them by giving them a hug until they feel better.

, You can do nice things for them by doing what they ask you to do from time to time, or by doing randomly nice things for them, like making them breakfast or helping them clean their room.

, Give your siblings compliments when they do something cool or good. Tell them that they look nice from time to time or compliment their clothes. This can make them feel really good about themselves.

, When holidays or birthdays roll around, get them presents that are good for them, not just something really generic that anyone would get. Think about what reminds you of them or things that you've done together. Think about things they've said they liked or that they wanted. Think about the things that they'd need. This will help you get the perfect gift.

, Share what you have with your siblings. If they want to borrow your stuff, let them. If you get some candy, share it with them. Never do things like this expecting something in return. Do it because you want to be a good brother.

, If your sibling is traveling or lives somewhere else, or when you are older and have moved far apart, call them or visit them when you can to show them that you think about them. Don't let your relationship break down because of the distance but instead make it a strong connection that can cross any distance.

Explain the concept of peer pressure.,
Talk about their values.,
Teach your child about acceptance.,
Tell your child to think about the consequences.,
Build your child’s confidence.,
Help build their self-esteem.",How to Help Your Child Resist Peer Pressure1," To resist peer pressure, your child will need to be able to recognize when it is happening to them. Some children will not be able to recognize peer pressure. Explain to your child that it is okay for kids to share their toys, games, and ideas with you, but it is not okay if they tease the things you like, causing you to change your opinion.For example, explain that ""if your friend shows you their new Superman pencil case that is fine, but if they tell you that they will only be your friend if you get a Superman pencil case too, that is peer pressure."";
, If you want your child to be able to resist negative peer pressure, then they need to have a clear set of values and be able to identify what is right and wrong. Explain your values to your child and teach them why you hold these values. If they can understand your values they will be more willing to follow them.For instance, if honesty is a value you would like your child to hold, you should model honest behaviour and never allow your child to see you use deception.
Avoid saying things like ""Don't tell your mom we had McDonalds for dinner twice this week."" This teaches dishonesty.

, Being accepting of other people’s differences is an important trait for your child to possess because it may make your child less likely to engage in or condone peer pressure. Peer pressure works by making one person feel wrong, weird, or like an outsider for doing or not doing something. If your child is accepting other people and himself, then your child might also find it easier to recognize when they are not being accepted.

You can teach acceptance using teachable moments and by having conversations about them. For example, if your child visits a friend’s house and then remarks that the food was weird, then you might say something like, ""I know this is not the type of food we cook at home, but that doesn't make it weird or wrong - it's just different.""
Or, if your child is confused after seeing someone with lots of tattoos and piercings, then you might say, ""Some people choose to do that and that's ok for them. We don't all have to be the same or do the same things.""

, Brainstorm potential peer pressure scenarios and have your child explore what might happen if they respond a certain way. They should consider whether or not they are breaking the law, or placing themselves or others in danger. Explain to them that if they have a bad feeling about something or they think they might regret it, it is probably not a good idea.For example, a popular kid may ask your child to join in and bully another classmate. Although this may make your child feel popular and accepted in the moment, they will feel bad about it later because they have hurt another child in their class.
Alternatively, your child may be pressured to break the law by using alcohol or drugs. They should be aware of the legal consequences of their actions. For example, possessing drugs can result in severe punishments including incarceration.

, If your child is confident it is more likely that they will be able to resist peer pressure. They will have an easier time saying “no” to their peers if they are confident with their choices. Allow your child to freely talk about their likes and dislikes at home and don’t pass any judgement. This will enable your child to be able to communicate their interests to their friends without being swayed by peer pressure.Teach your child, from a young age, to make their own decisions. This will help them build confidence in their own judgement.For example, you could give your child three options for lunch and they can decide what to have. This will allow you to maintain control, but gives your child an opportunity to learn how to make choices.
Older kids and teenagers should also have the freedom to make their own decisions surrounding certain issues. For example, they should be able to choose what clothing they want to wear. This can allow them to communicate their individuality and help to build confidence.

, Self-esteem will help to build a child's confidence, and contrary to popular belief it is not developed by praising everything your child does. Instead, your child will develop self-esteem by feeling capable, effective, and accepted. For instance, when kids learn to do things for themselves they will feel capable and when they are able to reach a goal or see progress they will feel effective. To make them feel accepted, allow them to be an individual and accept them for who they are.If a parent accepts their child, then the child will likely accept themselves.
High self-esteem will help your child resist negative peer pressure because they will not be afraid to be themselves.

Practice peer pressure scenarios.,
Teach them to say “no.” Any parent knows that kids are great at saying “no” when it’s time to do homework or help with the dishes.,
Teach additional resistance strategies.,
Offer teens a ""lifeline"" before poor decisions are taken too far.",How to Help Teenagers Deal with Peer Pressure1," It can feel a bit silly as a parent or other adult to role-play a “c’mon, just take one of these pills” scenario, or downright uncomfortable to run through a “c’mon, there’s no way you’ll get pregnant” one. However awkward it may be, though, practicing how to respond to peer pressure scenarios offers teens valuable experience and guidance.Start by asking questions (“Have you ever been offered a cigarette?” “Has a friend ever pressured you to do something you didn’t want to do?”). This can help establish a dialogue and comfort level that can make the role playing less awkward for both parties.;
, However, saying “no” to peer pressure can prove far more complicated for teens. Sometimes that one little word is enough, but usually it is more effective to combine the “no” with a strategy suited to the situation.This wikiHow article provides a good list of what might be called “no plus” strategies that you can help teens recognize and employ. These include saying “no” plus adding an explanation (“Smoking will hurt my performance on the track team.”), using humor (“I’d fall before we even got up on the roof.”), changing the subject (“But hey, how about that game last night?”), or offering an alternate idea (“Let’s go see that new movie instead.”).
Be clear that they understand that “no means no” and is always an acceptable technique. If necessary, they can just say “no” and walk away.

, When facing negative peer pressure, asking leading questions or making targeted comments can sometimes shift the focus or prompt a reconsideration. Other times, creating a scapegoat may be helpful, so offer yourself up as their excuse for not going along with the plan or succumbing to pressure.For instance, talk about asking questions like “Is this a good idea?”; identifying the negative aspects (“Won’t this cause trouble for our friends?”); or evaluating the consequences (“This will get all of us suspended from school”).
As a parent, your teen is going to blame you for practically everything anyway, so make it clear that it’s OK for him or her to use you as the main reason for rebuffing peer pressure — “I can’t do that, my parents would find out and ground me forever. They’re so nosy and strict. It’s really annoying.”

, No matter how prepared they are, teens are going to succumb to peer pressure and make some bad decisions. Especially if it is a dangerous situation, such as drinking with friends and getting ready to drive home, let them know that they can trust you to be understanding and helpful. If punishment needs to happen, delay that discussion until after the teen is removed from the bad situation.


Some parents choose to invoke a “no questions asked” retrieval policy, which means that if a teen gets into a bad situation due to poor choices, he or she can call home and be picked up no questions asked. Only you as a parent can decide whether this or other techniques will be useful or abused in the case of your specific teen.The more open and honest you are in your discussions about peer pressure (and other topics), the more trust will be built between you. Make sure they trust you enough that they'll make that call when they need your help getting out of a bad spot.

Make your mom breakfast in bed.,
Go out for brunch.,
Get dinner together.",How to Spend Time With Your Mom1," Breakfast in bed is a Mother's Day tradition, as it lets your mom (who might normally make breakfast for the family) get treated for a change.Pancakes are a staple of breakfast in bed. They make for a hearty, healthy meal that's just sweet enough to taste like a treat.
Be sure to bring coffee or tea so your mom can wake up for the big day you've planned together.;
, Brunch is often considered a long, leisurely treat, a time for people to catch up while casually eating.Brunch is casual enough to allow for choices, like having a mimosa while you eat, but structured enough to facilitate conversation and quality time with someone.

, Sharing a hearty meal is a wonderful bonding experience.Eating with someone allows for meaningful conversation while spending quality time together. Family dinners have always been important because it allows family members time to talk and feel united by the meal being shared.Try taking your mom out to a fancy restaurant of her choosing, and of course, offer to pick up the bill.

Teach your child to say no.,
Have them suggest alternatives.,
Tell them to walk away.,
Have them avoid certain scenarios.,
Encourage them to inform a teacher or adult.",How to Help Your Child Resist Peer Pressure2," It can be extremely hard for your child to say no to their friends because it may cause them to be ostracized from their peer group. As a result, it is important to teach them how to politely but firmly say no. You should also explain that true friends will respect their decision and will not pressure them to do something they don’t want to. For example, if your child is asked to smoke a cigarette they could say “no thanks. I am not interested in smoking.”Along with teaching your child how to say ""no,"" you should also teach them to respect when others say ""no.""
For example, it is also important to teach teenagers about consent. In many instances teenagers will feel pressured into engaging in sexual activities.

, Sometimes saying “no” to peers can be difficult. Instead, teach your child that they can handle peer pressure by providing an alternative suggestion. In some cases other kids in the group are just going along with the plan because they are not able to stick up to peer pressure. If your child can suggest an alternative action, others may jump on board.For example, if a peer challenges your child to skateboard off a high ledge, they may view this as dangerous. Instead of saying no, your child could suggest a different activity.
They could say “why don’t we try skateboarding at the park instead?” This will provide your child with an alternative option without having to reject their peers outright.
Alternatively, if your teenager is feeling pressured to drink alcohol they could say ""I am not going to drink tonight, but if you want I can be the designated driver and make sure everyone gets home safely."" This will allow your child to avoid taking part in an illegal activity without rejecting their friends.

, If your child’s peers are insistent upon doing something wrong, your child may need to walk away from the situation. Teach them how to walk away from a bad situation effectively. For instance, they should not leave by shouting an insult because this could cause a fight. Instead, tell your child to walk away from the situation, and leave room for reconciliation.Instead of shoplifting they could say “I am going to ask my mom for my allowance in advance and then go shopping. Do you want to come?”
Alternatively, if your child wants to avoid a potentially dangerous situation they could say “I am going to the movies tonight, instead of the party. If you change your mind come and join me.”

, Another way for your child to resist peer pressure, is by avoiding certain situations. For example, if they are invited to an event that may put them in an awkward situation have them decline the invitation. You could also tell them to think about which friends are more likely to pressure them into something they don't feel comfortable doing. Once they have thought about this, tell them to avoid certain situations with that group of friends.For example, your child may be invited to a friend’s house with no parental supervision before a school dance. Your child can avoid this scenario by saying that they have other plans before the dance and will meet them at the school.
This will allow your child to avoid a situation that may result in peer pressure, without offending their friends.

, If your child encounters severe peer pressure that may place themselves or others in danger they may want to inform an adult about the situation. In some cases the situation may escalate and the children will not be able to handle it on their own. In these cases it is always a good idea to get a teacher or another adult involved.

"
"
Get to know their friends.,
Provide them with multiple peer groups.,
Tell them to support their friends.",How to Help Your Child Resist Peer Pressure3," It is always a good idea to know your child’s friends. Invite their friends over for a play date, sleepover, or dinner. You can also offer to drive your teenage children to movies or other events with their children. This way you will get to know their peer group. You will also have the opportunity to see how they interact, and you can determine the type of peer pressure your child may encounter through this friendship.If your child’s behaviour begins to change as a result of a new friendship it is important that you do not overly criticize the friendship.
Your child obviously feels a common bond with this person or group and being overly critical may cause your child to pull away from you.
Instead, you can set parameters around the friendship. For example, you could say “you are only allowed to hang out with your friend two days a week after school.”
You could also say “You are not allowed to spend time at your friend’s house until your behaviour changes, but they are more than welcome to come over to our house.”

, Most children will feel excluded by their peers at some point. They may not get invited to a classmate's birthday or they will feel excluded from a clique or group of friends. One way to combat social exclusion is to provide your child with multiple peer groups. For example, find an extracurricular activity that your child can take part in. This way they will have friends from school and their other activities. It is important to foster these friendships throughout your child's life, both when they are young right through the teen years.Extracurriculars also take up a lot of time and will allow your child to avoid taking part in negative pursuits. For example, they will have less unsupervised time with peers, which is often when negative peer pressure takes place., You can also talk to your child about what they should do if they see another child being pressured to do something. If your child can support a friend and stick up to peer pressure with them, it will be a lot easier to resist. By having a few friends with common values who are willing to stick up for each other, your child can take some of the power away from peer pressure.For example, if your child sees a friend getting pressured to skip an important test or exam, they could walk up to the group and say to their friend “I’m with you, let’s go to class together.” This will make it easier for the friend to walk away from the situation.

Encourage self-confidence in teens.,
Support their positive friendships.,
Build up their social skills.,
Help them to accept and embrace their individuality.",How to Help Teenagers Deal with Peer Pressure2," Teens who doubt their own abilities, judgment, or self-worth are more apt to succumb to negative peer pressure. Continue to help your teen refine his or her ability to determine right from wrong, and build his or her confidence to trust in this ability.Proper training in good decision making and preparation for handling peer pressure will give a teen more confidence in his or her ability to trust his or her conscience and make the right decision. Regular encouragement and praise for good choices will also help build self-confidence.

, It’s hard to completely eliminate a “bad” friend from your teen’s life, but you can instead try to promote and support “good” friends who provide a better example and accept your teen for himself or herself. Let your teen know that a real friend doesn’t want you to be something you’re not or do something you aren’t comfortable with.Advise teens to use reliable friends as support in the face of negative peer pressure. Having a friend by your side (especially when literally standing beside you), backing up your refusal to submit to peer pressure, helps to balance the odds.

, Teens who are awkward, shy, have trouble making friends, or are uncomfortable navigating social situations may be more susceptible to negative peer pressure in an attempt to “fit in.” Building up self-confidence by helping them develop their social skills may work to reduce this susceptibility. Not all kids are wired to be the “life of the party” or “Mr./Ms. Popularity,” but any teen can become at least somewhat more comfortable and confident in social situations.As with dealing with peer pressure scenarios, role playing can be helpful in building up self-confidence and interpersonal skills in social situations. Practice simple but critical skills like initiating a conversation, utilizing and reading eye contact and body language, and expressing oneself clearly.

, Peer pressure works as often as it does because we all at some level want to be more like other people. It's common for teenagers to feel uncomfortable in their own skin. The more comfortable they can become, however, the less enticing it will be for them to succumb to peer pressure in order to fit in.As a parent or other concerned adult, often the best thing you can do is offer constant encouragement and support. Let your teen know that he or she is just fine as is.
Help teens focus on their strengths and on the qualities in themselves that they can control. Encourage them to be the best versions of the unique individuals they are.

Start the conversation early.,
Watch for risk factors for peer pressure susceptibility.,
Help teens identify types and sources of peer pressure.,
Establish clear expectations and consequences.,
Give teens space but don’t be passive.,
Get to know their friends.",How to Help Teenagers Deal with Peer Pressure3," People of all ages experience episodes of peer pressure, but the teen years seem to be particularly ripe for it. The desire to “fit in” or impress others is at a high point, which can lead to both positive and negative choices. It is safest to assume that every teen will experience negative peer pressure and to talk about it well in advance.For instance, the ongoing discussion about resisting pressures and making smart choices regarding things like drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sex should begin before most teens are even teens. It is not uncommon for ten to twelve year olds to face peer pressure regarding such issues normally associated with the teen years.
Such conversations are going to be a bit awkward no matter how long you wait to initiate them, so you might as well get the process started instead of hoping in vain that “things will be OK” without your active involvement.

, Any teen can get caught up in a bad situation due to peer pressure, including those who seem most popular, successful, or well-adjusted. Certain factors, both inherent and environmental, can make some teens more prone to succumb to peer pressure, however. Be extra vigilant in the cases of those teens at higher risk.


Risk factors for increased susceptibility to negative peer pressure include poor academic performance, depression and/or eating disorders, unstable home life, isolation, lack of direction, lack of confidence, and low self-esteem.
Generally speaking, teens who feel they are different in a “bad” way are more likely to succumb to negative peer pressure.

, Talk to teens about the reality that peer pressure can be either negative (spurring underage drinking or bullying others) or positive (causing better grades or a desire to volunteer more). Therefore, peer pressure is unavoidable and not always a bad thing. It can also occur directly (being dared to vandalize the school at night) or indirectly (starving oneself to match the look of the “cool kids”).


Discuss also the fact that the strongest peer pressure is likely to come from friends — real friends, false friends, and new friends. You can’t choose teens’ friends for them, but you can encourage them to choose wisely and regularly evaluate the overall value of each friendship.

, Make it clear that although negative peer pressure is impossible to avoid and difficult to overcome, each teen must be held accountable for his or her poor decisions. In other words, make it clear that excuses like “but so-and-so made me do it” or “but I just wanted to be like them” will not absolve them from blame.Whenever you’re dealing with teens, and especially as a parent, you have to balance compassion with conviction. Teens have to know that choices like drinking alcohol or making fun of other kids will result in negative consequences regardless of the circumstances, but they also need to feel as though they can come to you in a spirit of mutual honesty and understanding.

, As much as you want to protect the teens you care about and ensure their happiness, you can’t lock them up in their rooms forever or shield them from all negative peer pressure. Learning by making mistakes is part of growing up. So give them a little space to “live and learn,” but stay actively engaged so that you can help prevent major lapses in judgment with lasting consequences.Ask lots of questions — “Where are you going?” “Who else will be there?” — even if it causes friction with your independent-minded teen. Also, reiterate your clear expectations for behavior and consequences if they are violated. Remember, parenting isn’t a popularity contest., Talk to them about the importance of choosing friends wisely. Realize that forbidding a teen to hang out with a “bad seed” might cause the opposite effect, but set restrictions on how much, when, or where they can associate (such as only at your house). But, make sure you have better reasons than “I just don’t like that kid.”Talk to teachers, parents, and other adults to get the “scoop” on what’s going on with your teen and his or her circle of friends. You’ll have to decide for yourself what constitutes “spying” on your teen and what constitutes “good parenting.” The more reason you have to suspect that bad influences are affecting your teen, the more you should act.When you have figured out what it is that bothers you about one of your teen's friends, try talking with your teen about it. For example, you could say something like, ""I don't like the way your friend treats you. She doesn't seem to respect your point of view.""

Set aside time.,
Find common interests.,
Try something new together.",How to Spend Time With Your Mom2," There are plenty of ways you can squeeze face time into your busy schedule, but your mom will probably appreciate if you set aside a whole day to spend together every once in a while. Find a day that works for both you and your mom, and take the day off from work or any other day-to-day obligations you might otherwise be doing.While it's important to spend time with your mom, it's also important to know how much time together is too much. Even the best relationships can become a little strained if too much time is spent together., Think about the things your mom enjoys doing in her downtime, and find ways you can enjoy those activities together. This will let you get to be a part of your mom's favorite activities, and you might even see a side of your mother that you don't normally get to see.If you don't know what your mom likes to do in her downtime, try asking her. Maybe there's a class or workshop she's been thinking about joining but hasn't had the time. Consider this as your chance to take that class or workshop together.
If your mom likes history or art, take her to a museum. If she's more of an outdoor person, plan a hike or a long bike ride together. If she likes music, take her to see her favorite musician perform. The activity you pick doesn't have to be perfect. The goal is to spend time with your mom doing something she enjoys.

, Whether you and your mother don't have many common interests, or whether you just want to find a new hobby together, learning a new skill or visiting a new place together can be an exciting adventure and a great bonding experience.Try doing something adventurous you wouldn't normally attempt on your own, like hiking or kayaking. Even if you end up hating the hobby, you'll always remember the exciting day you spent doing it together. Just be sure to take all the necessary safety precautions, and consider going with a group if you're inexperienced at the activity you choose.

Pamper your mom.,
Take your mom to see a movie.,
Take a walk together.,
Play cards or board games together.",How to Spend Time With Your Mom3," Treat your mom to a spa day, or recreate the experience at home. Whether it's a massage, a facial treatment, or a manicure/pedicure, your mom will love getting pampered with you.Make a home-made foot soak. If going to a spa is out of your budget, consider giving your mom a spa treatment at home. Mix one cup of Epsom salt, along with one peppermint tea bag and one chamomile tea bag, into a basin of warm water. Soak your feet for 30 minutes, and spend that time chatting and catching up with one another.Make home-made face masks. Another great way to bring the spa treatment to your home is to make a relaxing face mask for you and your mom. Papaya makes a great face mask, as the enzymes in papaya have a similar effect as alpha hydroxy acids.Use a blender to combine three tablespoons of papaya pulp, 1/3 cup of oatmeal, and one tablespoon of honey. Lather the papaya mixture in your hands and apply to the face, keeping the mixture out of your eyes and nostrils. Leave the face mask on for about five to ten minutes. Then rinse the mask off with warm water., Seeing a movie with someone is a great way to bond, as experiencing the film together helps people feel connected by their emotional responses to the film.Most people have a tendency to feel empathy and sympathy for characters whose situations mirror our own.Watch a movie together about a mother/daughter or mother/son relationship, especially a light-hearted comedy.

, Walking with someone is a wonderful bonding experience.Not only do you both share a workout, you get to explore a park or neighborhood together, all while talking and sharing your thoughts and feelings with one another.


If you and your mother are both physically able to walk, try going for a long stroll together in a quiet, scenic area. Use the experience as an opportunity to catch up on what's been going in both of your lives while you walk together.

, Playing games is an important habit, as it allows for unstructured fun time with others.Games have the added bonus of bringing back memories of years past: board games are often the focus of family fun nights, and are commonly played on family vacations when the weather turns sour.


Play board games or card games with your mother to bring back fond memories of years past and create new memories together.

Be home savvy.",How to Have Family Fun Cheap," Is it:


your home?






your family?
your food?;
, All of these are important of course, but what do you enjoy the most? If it is all of them, you'll need to consider how you can juggle between them, to stretch your dollar as far as possible.

, It may be learning; outdoors activities; eating out; movies or other ideas. Once you have thought about these things, the next step is to consider the ways that you can do these things without it costing too much, or perhaps even for free.

, See which ones appeal to you and come up with more of your own alternatives as well:


Learning activities: Visit the library. Libraries offer several resources that can be of great benefit for free or for a very low joining fee. You can borrow books (fiction, non-fiction, craft, art, hobbies, language, math, science etc.), music and reading CDs, DVDs and videos and even games and toys at some libraries. Save by not buying these things but borrowing them for the whole family; take the whole family to the library for regular visits, so that everyone can make their own choices. Libraries also offer a lot of activities such as ""meet-the-author"" sessions, book reading evenings and children's clubs. All of these are a great way to meet others and to have an enjoyable time.






Rent movies and stop cable TV subscriptions: Get rid of cable TV costs through regular movie borrowing or cheap rental from DVD stores. Initially there will be withdrawal symptoms but soon you'll discover that between the movies you can borrow for free or rent for low prices and the free-to-air choices, you'll have plenty to watch. All the extra time you gain to spend together as a family is an enormous bonus!
Increase your knowledge: You can learn a lot of new things from reading books (the ones you've borrowed from the library). A great way of learning is to base the learning on a famous novel. For instance, after reading a novel like Little House on the Prairie, your family could follow up the reading by borrowing books on farming during different periods of history. Learn together the different ways people have done things and how they are done today.
Take up craft or homesteading activities: Try craft books, ""free fun"" books, homesteading books (old-fashioned knowledge and tips), games books and science books (kids love the experiments). You could have a fair in your house - make up the games and have events like balloon dart-throwing.

, Cities offer a lot of free events - hit every free event imaginable with your family and enjoy them. These include parades, outdoor concerts, national day celebrations, marathons, charity runs, food promotional fairs, art displays, children's events and more. Keep an eye on the newspaper or internet for upcoming freebies to attend. Many museums and galleries have ""free days"" where you can visit for nothing at all. Don't forget to take a packed lunch or meal and plenty of water. Saves queueing as well as money!

, What other people no longer want, you might get for a song. make it a day's event to trawl around garage sales in your area. Even the haggling can be fun and you never know what you might find.

, Many cities, towns and villages have amazing buildings in their central district. Pack a great lunch (sandwiches, drinks etc) and catch the bus in to go ""sight-seeing"" as a tourist might. You can glimpse animals outside the zoo on the way, ride the elevator to the top of the biggest building to look out the windows and if you and the kids look presentable and well mannered and you ask the receptionist at the top office nicely to look out the window they'll probably say yes. Learn all that you can about the buildings from plaques on the walls, signs or a library book on the history of your area. If you become really knowledgeable, you might even end up telling tourists in the area more about what they're looking at!

, Visit the bulk buying area at the grocery store and save money on the things you need (don't buy things you don't use just because they're cheap - it's still a waste of money if you won't use it.)

, Save on restaurants or fast food places by letting the kids enjoy the fast food at home. When shopping, buy the ""junk food"" items and store them at home for special days. Another way to make junk food stretch is to only buy some of the junk food (like a burger each) and then cook the rest at home (store brand or homemade fries/soda pop, for instance).

If you do want to eat out, buy the burgers and split the fries, take your own drinks and extra food items with you and eat it all in the park instead of inside the restaurant. (Take the picnic gear and it'll feel 100% better than staying in the restaurant!)

Visit the dollar stores for bargains and also visit used (secondhand) stores and thrift stores, which have a lot of goodies that people don't want anymore but are still in terrific condition. Learn to dress up old stuff! Finding a bargain can in itself become a real addiction and as you learn more, you'll find more bargains.

This will help you to create memorable experiences that you can both share and look back on as part of your bonding experience.
You may also want to treat your mother to a new experience or take her to a location for an outing that she has never been to before. This could be the other side of the city where she lives or to a new restaurant with interesting cuisine she may enjoy. Experiencing something new together can allow you both to bond and share similar emotions and reactions.;
, This is a great option if your mother is often on the go, stressed, or overworked. Surprise her with a day off of work, commitments and responsibilities, and book a joint massage at a spa. You could even make it a full spa day, complete with full body massages, manicures and pedicures. Your mother will likely appreciate your kindness and consideration. A joint spa day will also make it easier for you both to connect and talk, especially if you are both feeling pampered and relaxed.

, Another good bonding tactic is to bring your mother to a place where you both have a fondness for or have shared happy memories of. This could be a nostalgic spot like your old childhood home or a favorite park or beach. Think about a location where you and your mother can bond over a shared memory or a shared feeling.Going to the location together can also give you and your mother topics and subjects to talk about, filling the awkward tension or silence between you.

Be an active listener.,
Do your chores and fulfill your household responsibilities.",How to Bond With Your Mom2," Try to schedule a weekly phone call or video chat with your mom, no matter how busy you are with your job, your relationship, or your schooling. Having a scheduled weekly call will ensure you both talk to each other about your week and keep in touch on a current basis.

, Seeing your mom in person on a weekly or bi-monthly basis, can help you both stay connected to each other. Though she may lives far from you, making the effort to see her face to face and spend time with her will show her that you care and are interested in maintaining a relationship with her.

, Open the lines of communication between you and your mother by making an effort to ask your mother about how she is and how her day went. This is especially important if you live with your mom, as you can easily check in with her at the end of the day. If you know she had a difficult meeting that day or a busy schedule at home, take the time to pull her aside and ask her how she is doing. This small question can show your mother that you care about her well-being and want to try to maintain an open relationship with her.It may help to get conversation going between you and your mother if you ask open ended questions about specific events, such as, “How did your meeting at work go?” or “How was your day at home?” These questions require more than a yes or no answer and can lead to longer and more in depth conversations.
You should also respond to your mother if she asks you how your day went or how you are feeling. Avoid brushing off her question or providing a one word answer. Instead, maintain eye contact with your mother and respond to her in a conversational way, providing details about the events of the day.

Instead, try to share any difficult feelings or emotions you may be dealing with, from conflicts at work to challenges in your love life.

You may seek your mother out for advice or guidance on an issue in your love life, with a friend, or at work, as a way to bond with her. If she knows your romantic partner well, for example, she may be able to offer sound advice on how to work out a problem you are having in your relationship. Or, she may be able to relate to a workplace issue you’re experiencing and give you advice based on her experiences in the workplace.
Asking your mother for advice and guidance on problems you may be having will also show her that you respect her opinion and value her advice. She will take it a sign of respect and the two of you will likely grow closer.

, Part of the bonding process with your mother is also being there for her when she needs it and being a good listener for her. This becomes more important as you get older and you and your mother are establishing an adult to adult relationship. Though your mother will always be your parent, it’s important to remember that she is also a person like any other and she also has struggles and difficulties in her life. Being an active listener for her will help you to grow closer to her and create an adult bond with her.Active listening means viewing conversations with your mother as ways to get to know her better and learn from her. You can do this by allowing your mother to talk and listen to her without interruption. Use visual cues like head nodding, eye contact, and a relaxed pose to show her you are engaged in what she is saying and focused on her.
Once your mother finishes speaking, you should repeat back what she said to you in your own words, focusing on the key points of what she said to you. You can phrase this as, “What I hear you saying is…” or “I think you meant…” If she confirms that you heard her properly, you can then offer her advice or comment on what she has told you.

, If you live with your mom, you should show her that you can be a responsible adult by doing all your assigned chores and completing any other household responsibilities. This could be cleaning your room, cleaning your bathroom, doing your laundry, and doing yard work. You may also be responsible for cooking dinner one night of the week so your mom has a night off, or taking care of your siblings while your mom goes out for the night. Follow through on your household commitments and be a responsible member of the house.


Doing your chores and fulfilling your responsibilities will put you in your mother's good books, making her more willing to bond with you and see you as someone she can talk to and respect. This can improve your relationship with her and show her that you can be trustworthy as her child and as a person.

Chronicle your bonding experiences and then give your mom a copy as a gift.",How to Bond With Your Mom3," One key element of bonding is finding common interests and common ground with another person.

, Try to get to know your mother better by asking her more about her experiences when she was your age. Chances are your mother will be willing to reminisce about her past experiences and memories when she was younger. Having a discussion with your mother about her past experiences will also give you the opportunity to relate to your mother and find common ground.As your mother shares more about her childhood and youth, you may hear some crazy family stories or moments in your mother’s life that may surprise you. Make a project out your mother’s memories and record her stories on paper or document them with a video camera. This will then give you the chance to process her stories and show her you appreciate her past experiences. It can also bring you and her closer together and allow you to get to know your mother better.
You can also use your mother’s stories as a way to find common ground, where you relate her experiences at your age with your current experiences. You may be surprised to find that you have very similar experiences as your mother and perhaps inherited her intuition and ability to deal with conflict.

, Create a physical reminder of your relationship with your mom by making a scrapbook of the memories and experiences you share. Your scrapbook could feature your latest vacation together or a milestone event you attended together, like a wedding or birthday. You could also include baby pictures and stories from childhood that involve your mom. Work on the scrapbook together as a way to find common ground and do an activity that involves positive memories and experiences that involve both of you.

, Sit down and write about you relationship with your mother, at least one hour a day. Think about all of the times where she supported you, rooted for you, and tried to protect you. Note any common interests and hobbies you both have or the way her values and morals have been passed on to you. Create a chronicle of your relationship with your mother, with an emphasis on bonding experiences or moments in your life thus far, and then give your mom a copy of this chronicle or story as a surprise gift. You could title the chronicle: ""My mom and I"" or ""Our story"".

Have a family discussion about TV usage.,
Spend some time thinking about what you're going to say and having some facts and statistics on hand to back up your concerns.,
Do your best to avoid ""demonizing"" the TV.,
Start the discussion rolling.,
Be understanding of the barriers involved but be ready to suggest alternatives.,
Suggest that the family go cold turkey for a week.,
Encourage reading times together as a family.,
Organize one family night a week.,
Aim to allot viewing times.,
Find a way of visually signaling down time from the TV.,
Have a review now and then.",How to Convince Your Family to Turn Off the Television," Set aside a time when all family members come together around the kitchen table, or some other comfortable spot, away from the TV. Let everyone know that you're wanting to talk about the TV viewing habits of all the family, without singling out anybody. If anything, being very honest about your own TV viewing habits and your own desire to minimize the amount of viewing is an excellent way to help everyone else see that you're not lecturing but aiming to pave the way to improved viewing habits. At the same time though, don't lose sight of the fact that as a parent or guardian, you are responsible for children in your household, including teenagers, and knowing what and how much they're watching is an important part of your responsibility.


Realize that some members of the family may approach the family talk with unhappiness, or they may feel threatened that they are ""under scrutiny"". Aim to keep the family talk lighthearted but serious in intent at the same time.






Have some favorite nibbles or snacks at the table to help everyone feel at ease.
It is very important that the TV is not on during the family discussion!;
, A little internet searching will bring back some astonishing figures on the amount of time families spend watching TV, as well as the types of shows, etc., being watched by different age groups. It will possibly be an eye-opener for you too. Perhaps print off some statistics to share with your family, or even make a few charts if that's something you enjoy doing, to help them understand your points of concern.


Part of your fact-gathering mission may be to convince you and/or your spouse as to the value of TV for your family. Knowledge about the impacts of TV viewing and what constitutes ""too much"" viewing is an important part of realizing whether or not your family has a problem with the amount of TV watching you're doing.






For example: Did you know that many parents aren't even aware of what the ratings guidelines mean, with only 12 percent knowing that ""FV"" in the USA (""fantasy violence"") relates to violent content, while eight percent of people think it stands for ""family viewing""?Did you know that the American Psychiatric Association considers that exposure to media portrayals of violence increases the instances of aggressiveness and anti-social behavior in children?Did you know that obesity levels in children are in part linked to the 24 hours plus weekly viewing of TV, 24 hours that could in part be put toward physical exercise activities?Too much TV viewing may also contribute to concentration deficit disorders, impoverished academic performance, lessened imagination, and reading problems., A moral tirade about the ""evils"" of TV will cause some members of the family to rebel and not listen to your concerns or preferences. It is much better to present the basic facts, to crack a few jokes that highlight the problem, and to encourage family members to think about what they're missing out on because of TV than to simply slam TV as ""no good"". After all, the idea is to minimize TV viewing, to teach good self-discipline habits in relation to it, rather than to cutting it out totally. In doing so, you also teach children and young people about self-control, delayed gratification, and making sensible choices about the tools in their lives, and treating it as a lesson in how to manage tools rather than having tools manage them is something they'll need to have a handle on for life.

, Think about sparking an open discussion with open-ended questions, such as:


How do you guys feel about your own TV viewing habits at the moment?






How many hours are you watching at the moment, do you think?
How much of this do you really enjoy? How much is ads, waiting for subsequent shows, opening sequences, and, especially with news, delay to ""force"" you to continue to watch?
What sorts of things do you think you might be doing instead of watching TV?
If we did what the ""cool"" people on TV are doing, would we enjoy the real consequences? Would we even look healthy without the extensive makeovers they get? Do we want to keep being suggested to do those things?
Do the TV ads often tell us about things that make our lives better? Or do they just try to make us feel bad about things we can buy affordably for what they are, rather than for what someone tries to make them seem?
Do you think we're doing enough things together as a family? If so, why? If not, why not? What could we do better together?

, For many family members, TV has become a source of relaxation, distraction, and switching off from working or studying hard. For others, it's a source of convenience that lets them get some peace and quiet to get work done while others quietly watch TV. And this will cause some family members to feel that being asked to watch less TV is attacking their relaxation or daily household routine options. While acknowledging that TV seems to have become a relaxation or distraction habit in your family, it can be helpful to tell the family that this is a ""brainstorming"" session, where every single family member has a role in expressing their feelings about TV viewing as a household, and to share ideas about what they'd like to do to reduce TV consumption.
It is suggested that following presenting your concerns about how TV has been sucking away time for doing other things, and after asking the open-ended questions suggested above, you open up a discussion about the alternatives that were raised as answers to the previous step, and suggest a few of your own. Some suggestions might include:


Spending the evening mealtime together, even if it is staggered between age groups or people's different comings and goings. And this mealtime should be TV-free. Part of the meal can, but need not always, be the preparation. Enjoy ""slow eating"", getting back to the place where food becomes a source of togetherness and experiencing the joy of talking and eating with one another.






Getting out together as a family more often. You could go to the park, go on a picnic, go to the movies, go to a sports game, go hiking, go ten-pin bowling, go for a walk around the harbor, visit a museum, visit the library, paint a community mural, join a community gardening project, and so forth.
Learning a new sport together. If everyone's feeling frustrated, why not get the whole family to enroll in a martial art or a team sport, or get into something like triathlon or marathon training as a family.

, As suggested by the Turnoff Week campaign, suggest that everyone just take a week off viewing to see how things feel and how they can change without TV being involved. Pull the plug from the wall and go out and do other things for the week. At the end of this period, have a round-up of what family members have done instead of watching TV. Share the experience with one another and share the excitement and enlightenment of doing other things than simply TV every day.


As part of this, cease talking about TV shows and characters altogether. It's very easy to confuse people we ""know of"" with people we ""know"" for real in today's media-filled world. Help children and other family members recognize the difference and discourage them from relating to TV stars, commentators, and newsreaders as people they ""know"". This sense of familiarity can be devastating if a person truly believes they are part of the TV family and less a part of a real life family, so spot the signs of too much reliance on what ""so and so on TV says"" and start gently reminding the person who is so besotted that the person on TV is not real family and that there is no real way of ever knowing what that person truly says or does off TV!, Why not set aside a time when the family all gathers together in one cozy or breezy (depending on the time of year) part of the house for an hour of just reading together. Make it a tradition of doing it at least once a week. You can choose whether to read out aloud in turns from different favorite books, or just to read in silence together. This can be a great excuse to have lovely hot or cold drinks and a few delicious snacks as well.


This can be a great time to read the newspaper out loud, so that everyone gets the news without having to read it singly; especially good for the large weekend editions! As a benefit, local newspapers often cover much more than the local TV news ever will.Or try passing out the sections of a serious big-city newspaper and reading it silently for half an hour. You'll all be amazed at how much more you see than in a half-hour of TV news.







, Set aside one night a week in which all family members get together to do something together. It might be going out, playing sport, playing board or card games, talking, reading, or even planning a vacation together. Whatever it is, just ensure it's minus the TV and any other electronic devices.

, Suggest that from this point on, that TV viewing become a conscious act focused on quality and not quantity. Favorite shows can be included in this ""quality"" (after all, it's a fairly subjective interpretation given what's usually on TV) but they must fit within a set amount of time. Once the time is up, the TV goes off for that family member.


Another suggestion is to compromise on TV viewing days. Sometimes there may be a day where a family member has all the shows they love at once, and this could be ""their"" TV night, and the rest of the week becomes non-TV time.






Try to find quality programs the family as-a-whole can sit down and enjoy, something that covers all ages, such as documentaries, cartoons, etc. And instead of simply watching the show, talk about it at the end, to get everyone's opinions and to ask them if they think the show has taught them anything, or what they would have preferred to have seen on the show, etc. Encourage critical discussion of TV shows as part of teaching children and teens critical thinking skills and not just accepting shows for what they are or simply liking or disliking a show - encourage them to voice the reasons behind their reaction. You don't have to limit yourself to what the TV stations provide: there are all kinds of high-quality, free programs, including audiobookson the Internet.

, If you haven't got doors or shutters to close over the TV, get a cloth to cover the TV for when the family has agreed it is not to be turned on. Shutting away or hiding the TV creates a ritual and the act on turning on the TV requires every family member to think about it before doing it.


Make the people, not the TV, the ""center of gravity"" in your main room. Don't arrange the chairs all facing the TV: instead, arrange them facing a central area and one another, with the TV off to one side. That way people in many of the seats can watch the TV fairly comfortably if they really want to, but will default to interacting with one another rather than watching it idly. The TV can be loud enough for whoever really wants to watch it and thus probably sits closest at a given time without being overwhelmingly loud for others.






Give the remote control a specific home near the TV. That way, anyone who wants to turn on the TV has to get up to get it and make a conscious decision about turning on the TV. It is also a good idea to switch off the TV after every use rather than leaving it on stand-by. Not only does this save on power but again it causes the person to think before turning on the TV.

, It can be a good idea to have a monthly to quarterly review of what everyone has managed to do without TV taking up so much time, as a family reminder of the importance of putting TV in its place. Use this opportunity to praise family members for their dedication to being involved in a variety of activities, and for their self-disciplined approach toward TV viewing.

Think things through.,
Choose a sensible location.,

Be certain your finances are in order.,
Plan for transportation in your new home.,
Think about the lifestyle you plan to have.,
Pick a good moment.,
Stay firm.,
Consider their feelings.",How to Tell Your Parents You're Moving out of Home," Your parents are going to have a lot of concerns about you leaving and will ask a ton of questions. Here are some things you’ll want to consider that will definitely be on their minds:;
, Whether you’re planning to move close to home or far away, your parents will still want to know all about it.


Don't settle on the first place you find. Shop around and make sure that you find the best place for you and take your parents with you so they feel more included in the whole process.
It may be a nice place on the inside, but learn what you can about the neighborhood, too. You'll be glad you did.

, If you are going to have a roommate, is it someone they’ve met?


If not, schedule an introduction to alleviate the stress that you may be living with a stranger.
Make sure you know enough about your roommate's lifestyle and financial situation to be able to judge whether there is a good fit between you.

, Moving can be very expensive, but don’t just think about the move. Your parents will want to know how you plan to support yourself over time. Be sure you’ve thought this through.


Make sure you have a steady source of income
Most places will require you to pay first and last month's rent, plus a deposit, upon moving in, so be sure to save up.
Movers can be expensive, and so can renting a van. It's always handy if you can get friends to help, but make sure you do something nice in return.
You have to make sure all of your utilities get turned on right away. This also costs money and may require deposits as well.
Don't forget about the little things. All the small household items that you may have taken for granted won't just be there waiting for you. The little things add up!

, You need to be able to get around on your own. Do you have a car or a bike, or will you be taking public transportation?

, Above all else, your parents will want you to be healthy and happy. It may sound trivial, but consider things like diet, cleanliness, hygiene and personal wellness.

, When you’ve done the legwork and believe that you’re ready to tell your parents that your moving out, pick a moment when you’ll be able to have a full discussion about it.

, In the event that they push back, stand by your decision. Let them know that the time has come for you to move on. But to avoid turning it into an argument, try to:


Be open and honest about your motivations to move out.
Speak clearly and confidently about your plans. This will not only make the conversation easier, but it will further demonstrate how much you’ve thought about the situation.

, Even though they may accept the fact that it’s time for you to move on, they’ll be sad to see you go. Demonstrate that you’ve been thinking about them, too.


Tell them that you love them.
Promise that you’ll be in touch as often as you can.
Assure them that you won’t forget about birthdays, family events, special occasions, etc.
Thank them for everything they've done for you.

Consider why you want to be a vegan.,
Figure out your reasons and write them down.,
Learn all you can about the vegan lifestyle.,
Take it in gradual steps.,
Approach your parents.,
Assure your parents that being a vegan is safe and healthy, and that you will be very careful to watch your diet and get all the right nutrients.,
Be prepared to be self-sufficient.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Be a Vegan," Is it because your friends or someone you admire is doing it? Is it because you want to stop supporting animal cruelty? Do you feel you'd be healthier? Do you want to adopt a religion that requires veganism?;
, Make sure they are worthy reasons and that you are really committed before you approach your parents. Do some research to support your reasons, many parents will worry about your health, so read some books or at least websites about vegan nutrition.

, It is a very big change and a couple of important nutrients are hard to find in plant products, so you will need to make sure you get some fortified foods and a proper multivitamin.

, If you are currently eating all different types of foods, consider starting off as a vegetarian. Eliminating meat and dairy from your diet gradually is safer than suddenly switching to nuts and celery after a lifetime of hamburgers. Your body does get used to the kinds of foods you eat, and it will react badly to extreme changes.

, Tell them you'd like to become a vegan and explain the reasons why.

, Back this up with medical research.

, Your parents may not be eager to cook special vegan meals for you, so be prepared to fix some of your own food. Suggest some vegetarian or vegan recipes that the family can try, and make them together.

Learn about autism.,
Do a lot of research.,
Learn about conditions that could be mistaken for autism.,
Reflect upon what you've read.,
Consider your childhood and your earliest memories.,
Talk to real autistic people.",How to Tell Your Parents You Think You're Autistic1," Autism is a very complex and misunderstood disability, so you need to do a lot of research before you can determine whether you may be on the spectrum. Read lists of symptoms and essays by autistic people. Autistic people are the best source, because they have firsthand experience with how their brains work, and some stereotypes are wildly inaccurate.


Unusual social behavior (such as accidentally saying rude things or laughing when inappropriate).
May not want cuddling.
Uneven physical or verbal skills. For example, poor handwriting or bad coordination.
Avoidance of eye contact,staring, or unusual eye contact
May prefer to be alone.
Intense focus and large memory, especially when studying favorite things; may remember childhood well
Difficulty with forming or understanding spoken words. May struggle with forming coherent sentences, and prefer written words, sign language, typing, or other forms of communication.
Passion about a few unusual subjects of interest.
Preference of routines and sameness.
Remarkable honesty and loyalty.
Idiosyncratic speech: echoing words or phrases,flat or singsong tone of voice, unusual pitch, and/or artistic and abstract language.
Exaggerated response or little response to sound, light, smell, taste, etc.
Interest in how things work.
Stimming behaviors (e.g. hand flapping, rocking, tapping pencils, hugging oneself, clapping hands, jumping, spinning)
Strong sense of justice and morality.
Difficulty reading faces and interacting with others.
Social confusion/cluelessness.;
, Reading one article on autism isn't enough to get a good sense. Read the diagnostic criteria, delve into the Autistic community online, and read how autistics describe autism. Reflect as you read. Does it fit you?


Research related and comorbid conditions. Is it possible that you have any of these in addition to autism, or instead of autism?
Keep in mind that autism is not perfectly understood. There is still misinformation out there, and there are studies with contradictory and unclear conclusions. Some information is written by non-autistic people who never consulted any autistics, and thus may have gotten something wrong.

, ADHD, reactive attachment disorder, social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder, OCD, and schizophrenia are examples of disabilities that can look somewhat similar to autism.It's possible to be autistic and have one of these disabilities. For example, it isn't uncommon for autistic people to have ADHD.

, Think back on your childhood, your quirks, your needs, and the accommodations that you and others make for you. When you consider autism, do things start to make more sense? Or is it a poor fit?

, Did you walk in circles, line up your toys, or make unusual repetitive movements? Did you hit your milestones in an unusual order? (This includes early childhood, and also later childhood, such as learning to bike or swim.) Reflect on your childhood and see if autism explains any of your quirks, strengths, or struggles.

, Visit a disability club, read blogs, or use #AskAnAutistic to ask about autism. You can even talk about the autistic traits you've noticed in yourself, and ask if they think it's a possibility.


It's considered bad manners to post in #ActuallyAutistic unless you are either diagnosed or quite sure that you're autistic. However, anyone is welcome to read, listen, and learn.

"
"
Choose a calm, quiet time to talk.,
Use ""process talk"" to explain that you have something important to say.,
Explain that you think you're autistic, and give some examples of why.,
Use tentative language.,
Focus on how a diagnosis, and the subsequent support, could help you.,
Be prepared to correct common misconceptions.,
Tell a strongly resistant parent how you seeing a doctor would benefit them.,
Give your parents time to process this.,
Ask to see a doctor or specialist.",How to Tell Your Parents You Think You're Autistic2," You'll want a time when no one is especially stressed or distracted. Try a time like doing simple chores together, a long car ride, or cleaning up after dinner.


If your parents are moving quickly, being louder than usual, or being short with you, that means they are probably stressed and not ready to listen.
Avoid times of extra stress, like when someone is sick, a big family transition (e.g. right before a vacation), or holidays with relatives over. Your parents may not be as focused, and have a hard time listening well.

, You can say something like ""I have something big to tell you, and I'm wondering if now is a good time.""

, Mention all the research you've done, and what aspects of autism seem to fit you.


For example, ""I think I could be autistic. I've been researching it for the past month, and a lot of the qualities describe me—meltdowns, sensitivity to sound, difficulty understanding others' thoughts and feelings, and fidgeting, for example. I've put a lot of thought into this and it's helped me understand myself better.""
Describe the symptoms that are most noticeable in you, especially that others can notice. For example, you lining up your things and having meltdowns may be easier for others to see than your face blindness. Bring up the most obvious ones first.

, If you show that you're open-minded about various possibilities, your parents are more likely to be open-minded too. Instead of saying you're sure you're autistic, say that you think it's possible.


You may have done weeks or months of detailed research, and thus be used to the idea. However, your parents are likely hearing this for the first time. If you sound uncertain, they're less likely to give a knee-jerk ""no"" response, and they'll take the possibility more seriously.

, Your parent(s) want what's best for you, so focus on how seeing a specialist could improve your life. Here are some examples of the benefits of a diagnosis:


You could learn autism-related techniques for reducing stress in your life, making you more comfortable and calm.
You could do better in school due to getting accommodations, which could improve your grades, enhance your understanding of the material, and/or reduce stress.
You could get therapy focused on your specific challenges (e.g. sensory integration therapy).
You and your parents would have access to a supportive community of autistics and their loved ones.

, Many people don't know much about autism, and rely on stereotypes that don't match autistic people in general, including you.


Many autistic people are able to speak.
Autistic people do care about others, often quite deeply. Many autistics have empathy. However, not all of them know how to show this in ways that others understand.
Autism is not a childhood disability. It is lifelong. There is no ""cure.""
Autism is not limited to white boys. People of all ethnicities, ages, and genders can be autistic.
Autism is not an epidemic. It isn't contagious, the word ""epidemic"" is misleading, and autistic people have many unique gifts to offer the world.
Each autistic person is different. Some need a lot of support, while others go for decades without knowing why they're different. The degree to which they have different symptoms may vary.

, Getting care for a disability can be tough if your parents are abusive, neglectful, or otherwise bad. If your parents are dismissive or cruel to you, focus on how their life might be improved by you getting a diagnosis.


For a parent who is annoyed by specific traits you have, such as meltdowns: ""A therapist could help me avoid meltdowns, so then I wouldn't be crying and making a scene so much.""
For a self-absorbed parent: ""Parents are really important in the diagnosis process. I bet they'd want to interview you. After all, you're the expert on what I was like in childhood.""
For a parent who is tired of you asking about autism: ""If we finally got answers, I wouldn't have to keep wondering why I'm different.""

If they don't believe you after some time, go to a school counselor or other trusted adult, and explain the situation. The adult may be able to talk to your parent(s). Once you can see the doctor, you can also explain to the doctor.

, This is big news, and your parents may need time to absorb it. They may also not understand what autism is very well. Do your best to be patient with them if they react badly. It's not personal; they're just confused.

, Your general practitioner or insurance company may be able to refer you to an autism expert, who can officially evaluate you for autism.


If your parents are skeptical, you can explain that seeing a specialist would clear things up.
The diagnosis process is not perfect, and can rely on your ability to produce anecdotes about certain traits you do or don't have. Being prepared for your appointment can help you get a more accurate diagnosis.

Start a conversation with your mom.,
Connect to her as a female.,
Write a note.,
Show her your underwear.,
Wait a while to be sure.,
Relax.,
Talk to someone you can trust.",How to Tell Your Parents You Started Your Period1," Approach your mother and simply state, ""I started my period."" This will open the door to an honest conversation. Reactions will vary from mother to mother, and include happy, excited, or flat. Regardless, your mom will never be angry or disappointed. Once the subject has been broached, your mom will likely take over the conversation and help you with all you need to know.


Choose an appropriate time. If it needs to be done immediately, feel free to do so. Otherwise, choose a time that allows for a lengthy conversation.
Sometimes it helps to write out a script ahead of time so you can approach the subject with confidence.
The hardest part is gathering the bravery to get started. Just remember that you'll feel less stress when the conversation is over.;
, Remember, your mom has gone through this too.In fact, she may still be getting her period monthly. The important thing to keep in mind is that she understands, and she is there to help.


Your mom has the ""hands-on"" experience to answer any questions you may have.
More than likely, your mom will be prepared with pads or tampons and will be more than happy to explain their differences and demonstrate the proper use.

, Write a simple note stating something like ""Mom, I started my period"" or ""Can you buy me some tampons/pads?"" Place the note in a place where only she will find it, such as in her purse, her makeup kit, or her underwear drawer.


Make sure the note is short and to the point so that there is no confusion.
Be prepared for the response. Once you let your mom know about your period, she'll want to have a face-to-face discussion regarding it.

, Change your underwear but don't wash them. Instead, call your mom to your room and show her the underwear. Having had a period before, she'll immediately recognize it initiate the conversation about what happens next.


You should be looking for discharge that is slightly pink, brown, or red.
Don't be embarrassed to show your mom your underwear. She won't be grossed out--she's been there before.
Blood will stain your underwear so immediately wash or soak your underwear to avoid staining.

, If you only have brown discharge then wait for your period. By the time your period comes, you may already have a plan for how to tell your parents. It's also possible that it was a false alarm and your body is just preparing itself for your period.


Brown discharge before a period is normal. This could be a layer of nutrients being discharged before the actual menstruation., Again, feeling nervous is a perfectly normal feeling. Just imagine how nervous your mom must have been when she had the conversation with her mom years ago.Try deep breathing and positive thoughts to help you cope with your nerves.


Breathe in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on taking 30 slow, deep, breaths and you should feel more relaxed afterwards.Ask yourself, ""what's the worst that can happen?"" Remind yourself that many people have gone through this and survived. Gaining this perspective can help you to relax., In some situations, parents aren't as supportive or understanding as one would hope. If this is the case, try talking to someone with which you feel comfortable. For example, a school nurse, a teacher, or a friend's parent.

Be ready for bumps along the way.",How to Tell Your Parents You Smoke," Your parents will react better if you talk to them at a quiet moment, ideally when they are relaxed. Look for a time when your mom or dad is relaxed and is ready to give you their full attention.Often the evening is a better time to break bad news than the day. Work is over and your parents will have less on their minds.
Dinner can be a great time to bring up difficult subjects. You might also try bringing up smoking while helping your parents cook or while unwinding around the television.
Hold off if you know that either parent is going through a stressful time at home or at work. Your news might trigger a bad reaction – which is not what you want.;
, Choose a time that is private as well as quiet. It’s best to have a heart-to-heart chat someplace where you won’t be interrupted and will feel free to express yourself open and honestly. The same goes for your parents.


Talking at home will work if you don’t have house guests. You might also be able to have a conversation in the car, on a walk, or another place where you’re alone.
Telling your parents over the telephone can also work, so long as you know that they are free to talk. Ask them, “Am I calling at a good time? Do you have some time to talk?”
Fessing up in public is probably not a good idea. Your parents might feel embarrassed if you tell them at a mall, restaurant, the home of family or friends, or elsewhere, and you will want to avoid a scene if at all possible.
Avoid using email or text message. This sort of talk needs to be discussed in person or at least in real-time. It might also be emotionally charged, and you don’t want your parents to misread your words., Ease into the talk by engaging your parents in normal conversation. Don’t jump right into a prepared spiel but chat, put your parents at ease, and get them ready gradually for the news.


You might start by asking your mom and dad how they are, i.e. “How are you doing? How was work today?” Answer with follow up questions: “Have you been really busy this week at work, Dad?”
Chatting with your parents will give you a sense of mood. Are they ready to talk? Or are they under stress? Are their minds on other, pressing issues?

, You’re probably concerned that your parents will be angry or disappointed at you for smoking. But don’t let fear stop you. Instead, put your concern into words as part of the conversation.


Get a sense from the conversation of whether your parents are in a good frame of mind. What is their mood like? Are you in a private place? Do they seem calm?
If you think the time is right, approach the subject. Say something like, “Mom, we need to talk” or “There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you, Dad.”
If you think your parents might be harsh or unsupportive, try to defuse their anger from the start. Say something like, “Mom, there’s something I want to tell you – but I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed in me” or “Can we talk about something, Dad? It’s something I’m not very proud of.”, Take a deep breath and go for it. Before you get into details, though, keep in mind that your parents have no idea what you are about to say. Be reassuring. Let them know that you are not in immediate danger.


Be clear that you are not in more serious trouble. They will probably be relieved to hear that you haven’t committed a crime, for example, and are not on academic probation.
Say something to the effect of, “Before you get too worried, just know that I’m not in any kind of danger or serious trouble.”
This reassurance can work to your advantage. For a worried parent, smoking may be a minor concern.

, Don’t mince words. Tell your parents that you smoke and that you want them to know because you’re concerned for yourself and for their opinion.


Consider something to the point, i.e. “Dad, all I want to tell you is that I smoke” or “Mom, I’m sorry but I smoke.”
If your parents are sensitive about smoking, adding an apology might soften a negative reaction: “I know how you feel about cigarettes and I’m really sorry. It just sort of happened. I feel like I’ve disappointed you.”

, Keep things frank with your parents during the conversation. Don’t lie about when you started or about how much you smoke, if they ask. Give an honest explanation so that they can understand the situation.


Offer details. Explain when and how you started smoking and how much you smoke. For instance, “Well, it started last spring when I was really stressed out. I got a pack from the corner store – they didn’t card me. But now I’m up to half a pack a day and it’s starting to get out of hand.”
Speak calmly. Use a concerned tone and look your parents in the eye. Try not to sound defiant or argumentative.

, Your parents might be supportive. On the other hand, they might be disappointed, preachy, angry, or all at the same time. Still, listen to what they have to say even if you disagree. Remain respectful.Let your news sink in and give your parents time to think and react. Wait for them to make the next move and let them speak their minds. Try not to interrupt.
Your parents may well have questions about your habit. Be willing to give them straight answers.
Try not to whine or argue. Even if your mom and dad are angry, resist becoming defensive and avoid a blowup.If they are really angry, try to defuse things by pointing out that the situation is urgent and that you want their help.

, Avoid getting angry with your parents. They have your best interest at heart, even if they are unhappy with your smoking. The important thing is for you to get their help to stop smoking.


Own up to your decisions. Remember that you made the initial choice to start smoking, even if it is now out of control.
Your parents may point out – forcefully – that you made a bad choice. Instead of becoming defensive, admit that it was a poor decision, i.e. “Yes, it was a bad decision. I shouldn’t have started in the first place.”

, Your mom and dad have a lot more life experience than you. Are they current or recovering smokers? Maybe they know what you’re going through or can advise you on quitting. Don’t be shy. Ask them.


Be clear that you want help. Say something like, “I know it’s really unhealthy. That’s why I’m asking if you can help me.”If you know that one of your parents smoked, ask them directly about the experience. Say, “Dad, I know that you quit smoking when I was little. How did you do it?”
Make it clear that you are having trouble addressing the issue on your own and want their support.
Consider surrendering your cigarettes as a goodwill gesture to your parents. Giving them up will signal that you’re putting yourself in mom and dad’s care.

, Make a plan of action with your parents so that you can get started with quitting. Take their advice, take their help, and do whatever it takes. They will want to pitch in and should make an effort to support you.Pick a quitting day. Whether you are going cold turkey or need a quitting aid, set a clear day to begin.
Talk to your doctor. With or without your parents, talk to a doctor about your habit. She will be able to advise you on how to quit, including the use of cessation products like nicotine patches, gum, or inhalers.Ask for solidarity. The biggest role your parents can play in quitting is to support you, encourage you, and pick you up when you’re down. You’ll need them on your side., Quitting won’t be easy. Stick to your plan and keep the lines of communication with your parents open. Let them know what you are going through and when you need extra support.


You’ll probably feel irritable or anxious and may have trouble concentrating. These are signs of withdrawal. They mean that you have a nicotine dependence and are natural when you’re quitting.You may also have cravings.
Limit things that trigger cravings. These could be when you’re feeling stressed or down, watching TV, with a friend who smokes, or drinking coffee. Try watching less TV if it triggers you to smoke, for instance. Or, drink tea if coffee tempts you.Be sure to stay hydrated and stay active. In fact, exercise may help to curb your cravings.If your parents are smokers, consider asking them to join you in your quitting program. If not, they may be willing to exercise with you or just offer a sympathetic ear on bad days.
The first 7 to 10 days of quitting are the hardest. Don’t be discouraged by slips and keep trying.

The important thing to remember is that the apprehension you are feeling will lessen over time.Know that your dad is mature enough to handle ""the period talk."" As an adult male, your dad not only knows what a period is, but has probably been expecting to have this talk with you for some time.
Your dad may be slightly embarrassed as well. Take comfort in knowing that you're not the only one trying to get a handle on your emotions.
Understand that your reaction is a normal one. Starting your period can be both confusing and emotional.

, Sometimes the easiest way to approach the situation is to just say, ""Dad, I got my period."" Keeping it brief and to the point will help you to avoid becoming emotional. Instead of building up to a big sit down conversation, try approaching the subject during down time such as when watching television or eating dinner.


By being direct, you avoid confusion and open the lines of communication between you and your dad.
Your openness may ease his discomfort and he may become a valuable resource for information., Sometimes it's easier to write words than to speak them. But what happens if you can't find the right words to say or write? There are scripted notes online that can be addressed to anyone and that allow you to ease into the topic. With titles like ""guess what"" or ""we need to talk"" it sends a clear message to dad without the awkward talk.The great thing about this option is that it informs your parent, but puts the responsibility of initiating the conversation on them.Be sure to put the note in a place where your dad is sure to find it, and make sure he'll find it at an appropriate time. Giving the note to him when he's running out of the house for work isn't the best option.

, Sometimes it's just easier to talk to a female about female problems. If you don't have a mother or older sister around, tell your dad that you need to speak to a female about ""female issues"" you are experiencing.


Your dad may become curious or worried at this point. You can ease his curiosity by simply stating ""I started my period and I would rather talk to a woman about it.""
You can make your dad feel like part of the process by asking for his advice about who to go to for help., As someone who is in charge of your healthcare, your dad will probably ask why you need to visit the doctor. At this point you can inform him that you are having a personal issue. This will either open the door to further communication or give your dad a clue that something is going on.


Your doctor is not only a great source of information, but they can also assist you in telling your dad about your period.A close alternative is the school nurse.
You can always get feminine products from your school nurse while you're figuring out how to tell your dad. But don't hide it from him for too long. It is definitely something for which you don't have to be ashamed.

, What happens if your dad isn't someone you can trust or if he is embarrassed by the situation? You can always choose to confide in a trusted confidant like a family friend, relative, or a trusted neighbor."

Clean yourself.,
Determine your flow.,
Use a pad.,
Opt for a tampon.,
Take care of your hygiene.",How to Tell Your Parents You Started Your Period3," If you started your period unexpectedly, chances are you've made somewhat of a mess. If you are at home, shower and change your underwear. If you are in public and can't get home immediately (for example at school), try cleaning yourself as best as possible with wet wipes and/or toilet paper.


As you are getting used to your period, it might be a good idea to carry extra supplies (underwear, pads, wet wipes) in your backpack or purse.

, Your flow refers to how light or heavy your blood flow is during your cycle. The number of pads and tampons used per day is in direct correlation to your flow. Over time, you should begin to recognize how light or heavy your flow is in order to be prepared for your cycle.


Light flow usually occurs at the beginning and end of your period.
Heavy flow is identified as bleeding which requires you to change your pad or tampon hourly.
Blood clotting is also common during a heavy flow. This is when you see ""blobs"" of blood that are darker in color.Knowing your flow will help you in purchasing the correct sanitary products.

, A sanitary pad is a thin pad that consists of absorbent material. It is placed in the lining of your underwear to absorb the blood flow, and has an adhesive side to keep it in place.Pads come in various lengths to account for the direction of blood flow while doing different activities (working out, sleeping, etc.).
Pads also come in various thicknesses to account for light through heavy flow.
Pads also come with ""wings"" to secure the pad in place and to stop accidental leaks.

, Tampons are made of cylindrical shaped absorbent material that is inserted into your vagina to absorb blood flow.Most come with an ""applicator"" that assists in inserting the tampon into the vagina. They come in various forms that allow for different levels of comfort and absorption.


If you're new to tampons, try a slender fit until you get the hang of it. They're not as effective against heavy flows but they may be more comfortable.
Applicators come in both plastic and cardboard form. Some have rounded tips and some don't. As a beginner, a plastic applicator with a rounded tip may work best.
It's best to try using a tampon for the first time when your flow is medium to heavy. This will allow the tampon to slide in more easily, and to be pulled out more easily later.Some people prefer to use tampons for activities such as playing sports or swimming.
You can be a virgin and still use a tampon. Using tampons has nothing to do with being sexually active.

, Once the period blood leaves the body, it is more likely to become contaminated. In addition, when these organisms remain in a warm, damp, place it's more likely to lead to infection or an unpleasant odor.Be sure to pay especially close attention to your hygiene during your cycle by changing your pad/tampon often and showering daily.


Even if your pad isn't ""full,"" try to avoid going the entire day without changing it. The standard for pads is once every 6 hours, and once every 2 hours for tampons.Blood can often enter small spaces like the skin around your vagina or legs. Be sure to wash off excessive blood when possible to avoid build up and odor.Discard your sanitary products properly. Wrap your pads in the pad wrapper or tissue paper before discarding in the trash. Check your tampon applicator to see if it is flushable or if you should wrap it and discard it in the trash.

Don’t procrastinate.,
Find a good time to talk.",How to Tell Your Parents You Got a Ticket1," Plan what you would like to say. Make sure you can clearly explain why you got the ticket. Write down the main things you want to tell your parents.List the facts that you need to tell them: what the ticket is for, when you got it, and how much it will cost.
Get ready to answer questions your parents will ask, like if anyone else was in your car.;
, Your parents will probably find out about the ticket sooner or later. You are probably on their insurance, your car is probably registered to them, and you might need their help paying the ticket.

, Plan to speak with your parents when they will be most receptive and positive. Make sure you will have their attention. Don’t talk to them when they might be tired from work, hungry, or feeling bogged down by something else.Ask your parents when you can talk: “Are you free? Is this a good time to talk about something important?”

Gauge your parent's acceptance of marijuana in general through leading questions.,
Consider why you smoke marijuana, and what benefits you get from it.,
Look into your state's laws about cannabis usage.,
Understand if your state has decriminalized marijuana.,
Ask yourself what you'd like to get out of this conversation.,
Wait to talk until a calm, quiet moment when everyone is in a decent mood.,
Do some research on current trends towards marijuana acceptance and legality.",How to Tell Your Parents You Smoke Marijuana1," Whenever the drug comes up, do your parents comment on it, either positively or negatively? If you mention that a friend or acquaintance of yours smokes marijuana, how do they react? See if you can bring up the conversation organically and let your parents talk and think about their relationship with marijuana before you tell them you smoke. Some ideas include:


""I heard that our state is considering marijuana legalization this year...""
""It's crazy how accepted marijuana has become in just the past 5-10 years, right?""
""Growing up, did you ever imagine people would be able to buy weed in a store?"";
, The best policy is the truth, even if the truth is simply that you enjoy smoking marijuana. Most people use weed for a combination of two things -- medicine and/or recreational inebriate. Know your own reasons for smoking to make communicating with your parents easier than simply saying ""I like it."" Some of the reasons to smoke include:


It helps lower or lessen anxiety and stress.It stokes your creative sideIt eases chronic aches, pains, and sores., Do you live in a state with completely legal weed, medical marijuana only, or a complete ban on the substance? This is an important point to note when talking to your parents, as one of their primary concerns is almost always legality. Currently, 25 states and Washington D.C. have passed some form of legalization, The states where marijuana is completely legal for all adults are:


Colorado
Washington
Oregon
Alaska
Washing D.C., Even if you don't live in a state with legal weed, you should still explain to your parents if the drug has been decriminalized. This means that, while police can stop you and seize your drugs, they can't throw you in jail unless you have a large amount on you, usually 2 ounces or more. All they can do is give you a fine. Many states, unable to completely pass medical or legal weed, turned to this measure to show that punishing marijuana smokers is not a major priority for police.


A complete list of decriminalized states can be found here.

, Knowing why you want to tell your parents will give you the courage to speak and help guide your words. Do you just want to open up to them, or do you want permission to smoke near them? Do you need help getting a medical card, or do you want to let them know your choices before you get caught awkwardly?


What is compelling you to tell your parents? Whatever it is, you should let them know. No matter their response, letting them know that you felt it important to talk to them shows your trust and openness.

, There is no sense trying to talk to them when tensions are high or people are busy. Be patient, and wait until a calm moment, like after dinner, when everyone is in a good mood and you can be sure of a reasonable, less-stressful conversation.


Of course, you may not have the luxury of waiting if you get caught smoking. That said, you can also wait and re-introduce the topic several days later, after the anger has passed, if you still have more to say.

, Every week, new studies and stances on marijuana are coming out, and almost all of them are positive. Current attitudes on marijuana are based on Schedule I drug classifications, which claim marijuana is just as dangerous as heroin and cocaine, and cannot even be researched. But international studies, as well as calls in the US to end the ridiculous Schedule I designation, are poking through the marijuana myths all the time. Before chatting, go online and see what news is new.

Help around the house.,
Be nicer to them, so they can see that you're at least trying to be different.,
Sit your parents down to have a serious talk.,
You'll have to listen a lot, too.,
Once they're done, start off by saying, ""Mom, Dad, I get what you're saying and I agree...."" If, at that last word, they faint, or ask you whether you're high, don't give up.,
Tell them you understand their concerns about your career and future.,
Mention to them how you regret not having paid attention in class before.,
Tell them, at the end of your talk ,that you got your grades, and they were really no good....Tell them you sincerely see your mistake in letting your grades slip down, and that you'll work on it.",How to Tell Your Parents You're Flunking Out," Offer to do small things like cleaning the dishes, setting the table, washing the car...They'll be suspicious at first, but chill. If you flash a smile at them, they'll freak out even more. Remember: known teenage trouble-makers are NOT supposed to smile.;
, Don't yell at your dad to get the door when the bell rings and you're playing Black Ops. Don't scream your lungs off when your mom feels brave enough to come into your room to help you clean up.

, This has to involve blunt honesty on your part (""Yes, dad, I was in detention again that day"") and superhuman levels of patience (""Yes, mom, I know I don't apply myself."").

, Parents usually don't feel like they're getting through to their kids, so make sure you don't just nod and grunt. Blurt in a few non-rebellious words, and let them do most of the talking.

, That's just parental defense mechanism.

, Assure them that your dearest dream, contrary to their expectations, is NOT to live in a doghouse. Be down to earth, and discuss your career options. Parents are usually a lot smarter than they let on, and they can help you out a lot.

, They will feel sympathetic, even if they don't let it on. Your parents aren't a pair of sleeping beauties, they would know that your behavior reflects your grades. Don't treat this as some master manipulation trick to gain their sympathy- realize that if you don't pull up your socks now, you're doomed.

, They'll be furious that you flunked straight-out, but at least this way, they're prepared in advance.

Start mentioning the idea of moving out when you haven't even reached 18 years old.,
Make sure you figure out a way to support yourself.,
See if you can find a roommate.,
Prove that you're responsible.,
If applicable, remind your parents how well you support yourself and your family.,
Show them that you will always care about them.",How to Tell Your Parents You Intend to Move Out when You Turn 181," Start a few months to a year before. Make sure to find the right time to tell them your intention. Don't tell them when they are in a bad mood. If you do, your parents will know that you want it badly, and they will have time to consider their decision (whether it be 'yes' or 'no'). Chances are, you don't want to let them know the day before, as they will likely disprove of the decision as it seems very rash. Start talking about what you want to do with your life, at the dinner table is probably the ideal place for conversation with your parents, and talk about your future. Simple stuff. However, never blurt it out. You don't want to make it look like they did something wrong, or you want to get away from them. Construct your ideas fully, analyze your plan, ensure that is it possible to keep your thoughts straight, make your point without any rejections.;
, In life, all parents wish that their children are stable in their lives. If your parents are the type of people who absolutely do not want you moving out of the house at 18, they may say that you need to have a stable job to support yourself in order to live separately. Take that moment as an opportunity to prove yourself rather than fearing failure. If you do your research properly, it is harder for them to say no.

, Sometimes, the only reason parents don't like their children living on their own at 18 is because the world isn't exactly the safest place. They might feel more at ease with the idea of you moving in with a friend. Make your roommate feel comfortable with your parents. In some cases, parents might believe the fact that trusting anyone is a threat. In that case, you need to make sure that your roommate is not a danger to you. They should be supportive, helpful, and someone you get along with. He or she must be first trusted by your parents and you.

, Taking out the trash, doing the dishes, doing laundry are all things you'll need to do once you're living on your own. Prove to your parents that you can handle these things without their help or them telling you to do chores. Even cooking dinner for the family can sometimes prove you'll be able to sustain yourself well. You will probably want to get a job. Showing your parents that you can keep a job will comfort them.

, At 18, you may be married with a child and a job. If you want to talk to your parents about moving out, it can't hurt to point out to them how responsible you already are., Some parents may feel that when you move out it means that they failed you. And remember, be as gentle as you can. As parents only desire to be remembered and loved by their own children who they have tried to help and support their whole life. If they aren't supportive, don't flip out. They are just nervous. If you make threats, and then leave, they will worry about you to death.


Understand that your parents love you no matter what they say, although they might show anger or shock at the beginning.
Be close to them, no matter how they shouted or showed massive anger to you. We all know how a parent deals with the truth of losing their kid. Show that you are grateful for what they've gave you. Parents love when their kids show gratitude.
Handle situations with strength and responsibility. Sometimes some parents tend to test your emotional and physical balance regarding taking important decisions. People who pass in this immediately gain their parent's confidence as their parents will feel that nothing wrong could happen. However, if you fail on handling tough situations, parents may realize that you are still a kid who cannot be let out flying on its own.

Give your parents the facts.,
Stay calm.,
Share your feelings.,
Ask your parents’ advice.",How to Tell Your Parents You Got a Ticket2," Tell them exactly what happened. Be straightforward and just state the facts. Show that you are mature enough to tell them about the ticket without making excuses.


Speaking to your parents in a grown-up way about the ticket can also show them that you are mature enough for the responsibility of driving.
Start by saying: “I have to tell you that I got a ticket.” Then tell them what the ticket is for.
Share some facts, like where you got pulled over and when.
Tell them: “I understand what I did was wrong.”
Ask them if they have any questions.

, Your parents will respond better to you if you speak calmly. Don’t get defensive. It’s hard to have a conversation with someone on the defensive. And acting defensive, especially when you are wrong, is childish.Don't say: ""But it wasn't my fault!"" or ""Don't blame me!""

, You might be embarrassed or afraid of disappointing your parents. Sharing how you feel can make it easier to have your conversation. Let them know how you feel about telling them and how you feel about the ticket. You might say: “I feel like I disappointed you” or “I am embarrassed.”
This is the right time to say: “I am sorry.”

, Tell your parents that you want to avoid tickets in the future. Ask your parents about how they drive and what they do to avoid tickets. This will show that you are serious about being a good driver.


Ask them: “How do you avoid tickets?” or “Do you have any advice to make me a better driver?”
Be sure to tell them: “I don’t want to get a ticket again.”

Accept the punishment you get.,
Suggest driving school.,
Offer to help pay the fine.",How to Tell Your Parents You Got a Ticket3," After you talk to your parents, they might decide to punish you. You should gracefully accept their punishment. Dealing with your punishment in a mature way shows them you can handle the responsibility of driving.


Say: “I understand that I have to accept the consequences.”
Don’t whine when you’re told what your punishment is.

, You might tell your parents that you want to go to driving school so you won’t get points on your license. Going to driving school can reduce your insurance premiums. It also demonstrates how serious you are about keeping your license and having a clean driving record.


Do some research and show your parents what you found out about driving school.
Make a plan for getting to driving school and paying for it so they know you are serious.

, Pay the ticket if you can afford it. If you don’t have enough money, offer to pay what you can. Taking this level of responsibility for your ticket is the best way to show that you can handle the responsibility of driving.


If you want a job, this might be a good time to talk to your parents about getting one so that you can pay for car-related expenses.
Ask your parents if you can gradually pay them back for the ticket. Setting up a definite plan to pay them back is another way to show your maturity and that you can handle the consequences of your actions.

Begin by letting them know you smoke, and then telling them why it is important to you.,
Point out the demonstrably positive effects of marijuana as medicine.,
Enlighten them about the surprising lack of long-term consequences.,
Remind them that alcohol and tobacco are far more dangerous and dependent.,
Point to ways in which marijuana does not impede your life or success.,
Show them that marijuana is very rarely addictive.,
Illustrate the marijuana isn't just about smoking joints anymore.,
Let them ask questions, speak, and get their opinions out.",How to Tell Your Parents You Smoke Marijuana2," A good way to approach this is to not let it be a big, terrifying ordeal. Remember that, even if your parents don't agree yet, marijuana is completely legal in some states, has never caused an overdose, and is non-addictive. It doesn't have to be a big deal. So keep the conversation light from the opening lines onward to prevent them from thinking they should be worried:


""I wanted to talk to you guys about something before you find out, and I know that I can trust you to listen.""
""This isn't a big deal, but I wanted to let you guys know that I smoke marijuana occasionally.""
""I know you guys trust me to make good decisions, and I just wanted to talk to you a bit about my decision to smoke marijuana.

, Did you know that the National Cancer Society promotes the fact that marijuana kills cancer cells?Marijuana has been used to successfully treat insomnia, glaucoma, chronic pain, slow Alzheimer's, reduce and control seizures, and increase creativity.Like most plants in the world, marijuana has surprising medical benefits we are only now discovering.


Because marijuana research is relatively new, new studies are coming out all of the time. Google ""marijuana studies"" every now and then to get more concrete evidence for your discussion if needed.

, Marijuana has been maligned for years not because it is dangerous, but because it is misunderstood. However, new studies are showing that marijuana has very few negative side-effects, and no long-term health issues arise from chronic usage other than a slight disposition towards gum disease.Be ready with these facts, and the articles to back them up (see ""Sources and Citations"" below) to head off any worries of ""health effects.""


There are almost no known cases of marijuana attributed deaths in the world and has no known effect on mortality rates.

, If you take marijuana purely for recreational enjoyment, then it may seem more difficult to convince your parents that weed is okay. But, when compared to other ""acceptable"" leisure-time substances, like alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is far safer.It is also non-addictive.


There is no evidence that being high causes criminal behavior. But alcohol is a factor in 40% of all violent crimes in the United States.Whereas tobacco use significantly decreases lung capacity, marijuana has been shown to actually increase user's lung capacity., Many parents worry that weed will make their child lazy, dependent, and dull. But studies and anecdotal evidence from Steve Jobs to Willy Nelson shows this to be blatantly untrue. If you're doing okay in school, can hold down a job, and feel happy and healthy, point out that marijuana has never stopped you from being successful. Remind them that, like a drink after work, marijuana is simply a recreational activity that you enjoy.

, According to Scientific American, only 9% of users exhibit signs of cannabis dependency, and very, very few of them are ""addicted.""Remind your parents that you like to smoke because it helps you relax or feel better, not because you're hooked. This is an important distinction, and one that shows that you've thought about the potential risks and issues thoughtfully.

, Many parents are clueless of the new, scientific, and exciting ways in which marijuana is grown and enjoyed. From candy bars to pocket-sized vaporizers, the red-eyed, coughing stoner is slowly fading into the background. Furthermore, advances in marijuana technology have led to demonstrable good, making the scene much less dangerous and intimidating:


Greater control over strains leads to specific, medical uses of weed and more precise highs which can target specific maladies, such as the famous Charlotte's Web strain that fights childhood seizures.Vaporizers, edibles (weed cooked into food),and even topical sprays allow people to get high without having to inhale any smoke whatsoever.
Increase revenue from marijuana acceptance brings in billions of tax dollars that previously only benefited drug traffickers., Don't try to talk over your parents, or feel like you need a perfectly written speech in order to succeed. Instead, try to have a pleasant conversation, taking the time to quietly, politely listen to their side of things. Don't cut them off, even if you have a good point to make. This conversation is as much about building trust and honesty with your parents as saying the ""right"" things.


Ask them if they ever smoked marijuana. If so, why did they smoke? Why did they stop?
If they want to know what, why, or how you smoke, be honest. If they feel like you're hiding something, they feel like there is some dark secret that they don't know.

"
Understand that total acceptance will take some time.,
Don't let marijuana take over your life, no matter what their response.,
Respect any negative responses politely instead of opening up a fight, which can only lead to further troubles.",How to Tell Your Parents You Smoke Marijuana3," At the very least, you need to give your parents some time to see you in a new light. Now that they know you smoke marijuana, they may spend a few days looking at you differently, trying to determine if you're high at the moment. Just keep being your normal, kind self and this will pass when they realize that, in reality, nothing has changed except their knowledge of the situation.


Most parents think marijuana is still a big deal, and dangerous. It will take some time to realize that this isn't the case.

, Since marijuana is rarely habit-forming, this shouldn't be difficult. That said, marijuana is an easy scapegoat if you aren't showing up at work, neglecting to do your homework, or spending all of your money on good bud. Your parents love and care about you, and want to see you succeed. If they believe (whether rightly or wrongly) that marijuana is hurting your future, then you'll face much stiffer resistance in the future.


Even if you parents are okay with smoking, you don't need to flaunt it or do it first thing every day. They will appreciate if you don't always smell like weed.
Show them that you can be productive while high, either by doing chores, cooking, working on a hobby, or exercising. Don't be a couch potato and they have no reason to get mad., If you parents aren't taking the conversation well, resist the urge to go into attack mode. This will only make it more likely for them to escalate as well, leading to unforeseen consequences and high tensions around the dinner table. If they don't seem receptive, remind them that this is not a choice you've made lightly, and you've done your research. By turning things repeatedly back to facts and data you can prevent an unwinnable argument over opinions.

Don't panic if your parents immediately say no.,
Explain to your parents that you are not a little kid anymore, if the last step does not work.",How to Tell Your Parents You Intend to Move Out when You Turn 182," Do this around the age of 17; talking much earlier may cause your parents to think that you are bluffing or just joking. Explain to them why you want to move out at a young age (even though you may not consider 18 to be too young to move out, your parents might) and tell them about your job and your ability to do chores on your own. If you've found a roommate, tell them about it.


Make them believe that you are capable for making life yourself independently.

, Calmly ask them why they don't like the idea. Calmly because it shows them that you are mature enough to control your emotions. And also in that way you will get to know that where exactly you are going wrong. Remember, in many places you are an adult at 18 and you don't need your parent's permission to live alone.

, # Don't push it. If your parents are still against the idea, wait about a month or two and talk with them again. Waiting can be hard, but this will also show your parents that you know how to be patient. Wait for the opportunity to rise, because after all, they have seen the world more than you.

, Have in mind a private and quiet spot where you can have the conversation. If you have siblings and don't want them to be a part of the conversation, think about times of the week that you are home with your parents when your siblings are away.If you have trouble finding alone time with your parents, create it. Ask them to step aside into a quiet room in your home for a private conversation.
If you don't have such a room, suggest that you go sit with them at a quiet park to have the conversation.

, Before you have the conversation, try to calm yourself down. You may find yourself getting nervous before such a serious conversation with your parents. Breathe in through your mouth for five seconds, holding your breath for a few seconds, and then exhale through your nose for six or more seconds.Repeat this process until you find yourself to be in a calm and relaxed state.

, If you have a friend who has gone through a similar situation, or who has had a difficult conversation with their parents, try asking them for advice or social support. At the least it may help reduce stress;at best you will gain some insight into how serious conversations between parents and children go.


Keep in mind, however, that the dynamic between parent and child may vary greatly across different families.

, Say you need to tell them something important and tell them what you hope to get from them from the conversation. There are a number of things that you might want:If you just want them to listen and offer emotional support, let them know that.
If you want their advice, let them know.
If you need their financial support, e.g., to see a mental health professional, mention that.

, You need to let them know that you want to have a serious conversation in private. This means starting the conversation in a general kind of way that conveys that you have a problem you want to discuss without getting into the specifics just yet. Here are some examples of broad conversation starters:""I have a problem that I need to tell you about. Can we go somewhere private to talk?""
""I could really use your advice on an issue I'm having. Can we go for a walk?""
""I really need your help with something private; I want to talk to you alone about it.""

, Try to remember that they may not know certain things about you, or that they may see the world a bit differently than you do. As you have the conversation, try to keep their perspectives in mind to ensure that you are all on the same page.As you are explaining things, keep track of their faces. If either parent looks confused, ask them if anything you said is unclear.

, Make sure you tell your parents all the information that you have about your eating disorder. Do you suspect that you have an eating disorder but have never been diagnosed by a mental health professional? There are also many kinds of eating disorders that are treated differently and that can have different negative effects on your health. This is all information your parents should know. Be sure to describe if you have:Anorexia nervosa, which involves an inadequate consumption of food leading to low body weight.
Binge eating disorder, which involves recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food.
Bulimia nervosa, which involves recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food followed by behaviors that are intended to reduce weight gain, such as vomiting.
Eating disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).

This may include, for example, night eating syndrome (eating excessively at night), purging disorder (purging without first binge eating), or atypical anorexia nervosa (in which weight is within the normal range).



, Once you have pulled your parents aside and disclosed to them that you have an eating disorder, allow them to ask you some questions. Answer as best as you can, and be honest with them.If you don't know the answer to one of their questions, it's fine to say that you don't know.
If you don't want to answer one of their questions, tell them this. However, keep in mind that you parents love you and want to help. If what they are asking is relevant to your eating disorder, think carefully about your decision to not answer.

, Once you have had the conversation with them, remind them what your goals are and what you need from your parents to accomplish your goals. This could be a stay in an eating disorder clinic or to get mental health counseling.


If you aren't sure what your goals are, or if you just wanted to express your feelings to your parents, ask them for advice. It can't hurt, and most parents love to give their children advice.

, If you prepared reading materials for them before having the conversation, pass them out to your parents. Give them some time to read the materials. Before parting ways, however, setup another time to meet with them for after they have read up on your specific eating disorder.


Make sure not to overwhelm them with too many materials or with material that is not relevant to your specific eating disorder.

, Sometimes the conversation could get emotionally rocky. You may feel that your parents aren't being as understanding as you'd hoped for, or that they don't believe you, or that they don't recognize that eating disorders are very real and serious medical disorders. Despite any of the scenarios, try to keep the conversation mature and adult-like, as anything besides that won't get you very far toward getting the help you need. If you find your parents are not understanding you or that you are getting upset for whatever reason, consider trying to have the conversation again at a later time when you are not as upset.

, There is a chance that your parents will view your disorder as their fault. However, it is important to keep the conversation on track, either by them offering you the emotional support that you need, or by offering advice, or by getting you into treatment."

Make sure you really do want to stop being homeschooled.,
Visit the school that you'd want to attend.,
Know why you don't want to be homeschooled anymore.,
Understand why they want to homeschool you.,
If you still want to go to a public/private school at this point, the next step is to talk to your parents.,
If need be, look into stats about homeschooled kids to others.

,
Act maturely when talking to them, and ask them to please at least consider letting you go to a public/private school.,
If they say yes, then well done, you succeeded!",How to Convince Your Parents to Stop Homeschooling You,";
, Assure your parents you'd do great there.

, There are advantages to homeschooling. If you really want to go to a public/private school then you may have to:


Wear a uniform
Carry a heavy bag of books (which can damage your spine.)
Get up earlier, so that you have the time to travel to school.
Give up the freedom of being able to watch television, go on the computer or listen to your ipod/CD player at lunch time.
Deal with a teacher you don't like.
Give up being able to do science experiments, etc., that could be done at home but not at school.
Make less progress at school, due to the fact that the teacher will have a whole class to teach and not just one student.

, They are homeschooling you so that you will not have to endure all the disadvantages of going to a public/private school, as mentioned before. Other reasons they may be homeschooling you are:


It may save them money as they won't have to pay for your uniform or for sports equipment, art materials, etc., as they may have to in a public school. If you want to go to a private school they will be paying even more money because they are paying just to get you into the school as well.
They may not like to see their ""baby"" go off to school, so they keep you at home.

, Plan your conversation in advance. Tell them that you understand why they would want to homeschool you, but if they could please listen while you tell them why you would prefer to go to a public/private school. Tell them the advantages of going to a public/private school:


You will have better facilities at school, such as sciences laboratories, P.E. halls, perhaps even a sports field or swimming pool.
You won't get distracted by television, radio, or other noises.
You will make new friends.
You will have people to talk to at lunch time.
It may be less expensive for your parents if they have been hiring a tutor for you rather than teaching you themselves.
Your parents will have more free time if they have been teaching you themselves.
You will have the experience of a new teacher(s) and what its like working in a classroom.
You will have the chance to go on a school tour.
You may be moving around for different subjects, particularly if you are in secondary/high school.
You may have a wider choice of subjects, again particularly if you are in secondary/high school.

,, Offer to pay part of the cost if money is the issue.

, But if they say no, then tell them you understand and try again another time.

Reflect on your reasons for changing schools.,
Introduce your issues to your parents.,
Show your parents you are trying to resolve the issue.,
Research alternative schools.,
Plan your talk like you would plan a party.,
Begin your case.,
Be brave and start talking.,
Be clear and direct.,
Explain how the new school will improve your situation.,
Anticipate your parents' concerns.,
Keep yourself collected.,
Be persistent after your initial conversation.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
Do something nice for your parents.,
Respect your parents' decision.",How to Convince Your Parents to Transfer You to Another School," Do you want to change your school because of the peers in your class or because of the lack of proper attention by your teachers? Before taking the necessary steps, really contemplate if you can resolve these issues by yourself.


Try setting up a meeting with your school guidance counselor to discuss the problem, if you feel comfortable.;
, Before talking of a new school, you should tell your parents about the problems you're having well in advance. It is essential that the issues are prone to repeat. This enables you to continue to tell your parents about your issue, and not present changing schools as a willy-nilly idea.
, If you are having an issue with a teacher, make arrangements to meet after class. If it's with a peer and you are not at risk of being further bullied at school, try setting up a meeting between the parents.Following this step could alleviate your needs to transfer schools, but it could also worsen your situation depending on the circumstance.

, There are a lot of schooling options that you could consider. Take time to evaluate which you think you could do well at and where you could imagine your parents being okay with. Look at the curriculum requirements for the different schools. Consider the options below:


Charter schools could be a good alternative if you are limited to selecting from a public school system. Charter schools typically specialize in technology or art, and are free from certain regulations that apply to conventional schools. Magnet schools are also good schools for those limited to public schooling; however, these schools tend to be highly selective and have higher academic standards. Private and parochial schools are everywhere and easy to become enrolled into, but do cost money. If you are considering one of these schools then it might be a good idea to also research scholarship opportunities.
Home school could be an option if you have willing parents and are also willing to sacrifice social milestones that come with a traditional school.

,

This might sound goofy, but its a good analogy that will help you organize yourself before the big talk. Consider these questions:

Who to invite?When to have the party?Where to have the party?, After deciding who, when, and where, initiate the conversation. Sometimes this can be the hardest part, so try some sample dialogue to help get things moving:


""Mom, I need to tell you about a problem I'm having.""""Grandma, I need your advice about something. Can we talk?""""Dad, I've been feeling depressed about something. Can we talk?""

, They are your parents and your happiness brings them happiness.Start with the issue that your parents should be aware of. Remind them that you've already tried to solve this issue, but nothing has seemed to work.


You could reiterate what you have done to solve the problem, like ""I've already talked with Mrs. Smith and met with a guidance counselor, yet I'm still feeling . . .""
Or, ""We've tried setting up a meeting with Syd's parents, but nothing has seemed to change.""

, Be as clear as you can about what you think, feel, and want.If you become nervous try deep breaths and be honest if you are feeling uncomfortable.


You can even say if you're having trouble, ""This isn't easy for me to talk about"" or ""I'm sorry but this is hard to talk to you about.""
Opening up to your honest feelings of insecurity will create a deeper trust between you and your parents. This could even initiate more sympathy from your parents, thus creating more of a chance for them to take action.

, Make sure you explain how your academics will improve with the change. Be prepared to show your research during this conversation. You don't need notes and graphs, but a few memorized details will help.


Discuss other types of improvements this school has over your current school like sports and extra-curricular activities.

, Lay out all the information for them to digest. If the school you have in mind is across town, then have a rough idea of how you'll get there in the most convenient fashion.


Don't leave out potential issues you foresee. If you're hiding something from them then it'll merely weaken your chance of them following through with the change.

, If the conversation goes in the wrong direction, just remain calm and do not throw a tantrum. Listen carefully to your parents and take what they tell you seriously.


If an argument begins then try your best to sort it out without yelling. Do not run away from the potential roadblocks that may arise from talking to your parents.

, If they said they'll talk about it, then remind your parents weekly. Add more developments to your problem and link the new school as a solution.

, Sometimes parents have problems of their own. Others just can't be available in the ways you might need. Others have a hard time being flexible.If your are reminding them on too frequent of a basis then your parents might become annoyed and not let you change schools.

, If your parents are still deciding this could show that you really care. Even if your parents have already agreed then doing something nice will show your appreciation for them. Try one or more of these suggestions:


Wash their car.
Clean the house or your bedroom.
Pick up their plates after meals and do the dishes without being told to.

, Changing schools can be a hard sacrifice for your parents so you must respect their wishes. If it's the middle of the school year and your parents said ""no,"" then continue preparing a case for the next school year.

It's easy to want to be the next Tom Cruise, the movies are full of young actors trying to do just that.,
Showing your folks that you do not have the all-too-common teenage bug about wanting to be a movie star and have instead considered your career realistically and carefully will go a long way towards their taking your choice seriously.

",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Act2," Few if any of them will make it. There are a lot of different ways to make your living as an actor other than movie star. For example:


Stage acting. A modest living but a lot of fun.
Character acting.
Commercials.
Acting coach or teacher.
Acting as path to writing or producing.

,"
"
If you are not already involved in acting you should be.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Act3," Let your parents know how seriously you take your choice by studying the subject. The main way you will convince your parents is to show them that you are passionate and realistic about your ambition. Some ideas include:


Learn how to act by taking acting lessons.
Join the thespians.

Try out for a school play.
Read plays and talk about them.
Go to plays, not movies.

Audition. If you already have a part in a semi-professional or professional production when you tell your parents that's great, but if they hear that you have simply auditioned and gone through the rejection process they will feel better about your understanding of this career.

"
"
Parents like to see that young adults are approaching their life choices in a mature manner and nothing will do that better than doing your homework.

,
Think about what other careers you may be able to do with acting skills if you don't make it as the kind of actor you wish to be.,
Research what you will need to do to achieve your goal.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Act4,", For example sales, publicity and marketing positions often require the same kinds of skills. Showing your parents you have sensibly considered an ""escape route"" if things don't work out should impress them with your mature sensible nature.

, For example:


Research and price acting schools. Each school will have its own style and, more importantly, its own placement rates in various acting careers. Find and choose the one that is right for you.
Honestly evaluate your talent and find areas you are lacking. Perhaps you need to be a better dancer dancer, or singer, or tell better jokes. If these skills are a part of your plan, figure out how you will learn the skills.

"
"
Choose a time when they are in a good, receptive mood and not tired or distracted by other things.,
Consider raising the subject in a public place.,
Show them your passion and excitement about your choice.

,
Calmly tell them of your plans, your reasons why this is the best choice for you and your goals.

,
Carefully listen to what they have to say.

,
Do not argue with them at this stage, just listen.,
Try to compromise or find common ground.,
Ask for their help in making the decision.",How to Tell Your Parents You Want to Act5," Parents are usually busy all the time, although it may not seem that way. Usually the weekends are when they are the happiest.

, Eventually you will have to have an intense private conversation, but first raising the issues in a public setting, like a cafe, can give you an idea of their initial reaction and what you may be up against.

,,,, They are your folks, they probably have some smart things to say.

, For example, you might suggest that you would like to follow the acting path but also take a different part time job ""just in case"".

, Perhaps you need some financial help paying for acting classes? Help them discover if this is the right thing for you on their own time. Remember, you have been thinking about this for a while, but it is all new to them.

Start early.,
Act out the symptoms.,
Pretend you are getting a fever.,
Apply some makeup if you can.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Stay Home from School2," If staying home from school isn't a last minute decision, start preparing for your performance. Scream a lot to make your voice raspy, or practice your fake cough.Make sure your parents aren't around while you practice. If they catch on, you'll be going to school.
Most people can feel a cold coming on a day or two before it happens. If you can, mention to your parents that you think you're getting sick., Sneeze and cough, but don't overdo it. Act like you're having a hard time standing up. Keep talking to your family and friends to a minimum. Don't change your mind about what part of your body hurts. If you say you have a headache, stick with it.Try to fall asleep often, especially if you're watching TV. Sick kids tend to fall asleep easily. If you say you're sick one minute, but then get excited about your favorite show, your parents might not believe you.Avoid complaining too much. The trick to acting sick is to not give the impression that you are acting sick. Keep the whining down, and don't make a scene.

, A common way to make it seem like you have a fever is to hold a hot water bottle to your head.Another way is to run a thermometer under hot water to raise it's temperature. This method requires a little work, as well as trusting parents.Be careful when you fake a fever. If your temperature is too high, you may end up in the emergency room where you will soon be found out. Try to keep the fever right around 100-degrees Fahrenheit.Don't stick the thermometer in the microwave to warm it up. This will only ruin the thermometer., This takes quite a bit of skill, but if you can pull it off using makeup will add to your performance. Lighten your skin with some foundation, and make your nose red with a little bit of lipstick.If you don't have your own makeup to use, be careful. If you get caught using mom's makeup, you might be in more trouble than it's worth.
When choosing a lipstick to make your nose red, don't use anything metallic or shiny. Just find a basic red lipstick.Don't go too light when making yourself pale. Find something similar to your natural skin tone.Try putting some of the lipstick you used to make your nose red around the corners of your eyes. Be careful not to get lipstick in your eyes, and only use enough to make it look like you've been rubbing them."
"
Spend a lot of time in the bathroom.,
Make your skin clammy.,
Pretend to be dizzy.,
Refrain from vomiting.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Stay Home from School3," When it comes to faking a stomach ache the best thing to do is go to the bathroom. You're not likely to get a lot of questions if you spend a significant amount of time in the restroom. Aside from some general questions, people probably don't want to know what you're doing.


Don't groan or make any gross noises. Remember, keep it simple.

, Splash cold water on your face to make your skin feel cold. Wet your hair a little, but try to avoid soaking yourself. You just want to give the impression that your skin is cold. When asked, say you feel hot. This will make your parents think you have the cold sweats.


You could also try doing some physical activity, such as push-ups or sit-ups. Do just enough to get a small band of sweat going on your forehead., A lot of times nausea is accompanied by a general feeling of dizziness. Don't make any sudden movements. Try to stay seated as much as possible. If you have to walk, take your time., When faking nausea, don't make yourself vomit. Say you aren't hungry and that your stomach hurts. Try to eat as little as possible, but whatever you do, do not make yourself throw up. It isn't healthy."
"
Rub your head.,
React to bright lights.,
Be as lazy as possible.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Stay Home from School4," To fake a headache, just rub your head and close your eyes a lot. Lie down on the couch or the floor and keep your hand pressed to your head.When your parents ask what is wrong, mention that your head hurts right behind your eyes. The better you are at describing the pain, the more likely it is they will take you seriously.

, A lot of the time people with intense headaches can't stand bright lights. If someone opens a window, or you're in a room with a lot of sun, avert your eyes. Complain about the brightness.Don't take this step too far. Light sensitivity is common with migraines, but a general headache may not call for it. Use this tactic at your discretion., If you have a headache, the last thing you want to do is engage in any physical activity. Stay in bed. Go to sleep as early as you possibly can.For an added bonus, keep your room quiet. Turn your television off, and don't listen to music. Few parents will believe their children are choosing to stay in a dark room all day with no entertainment."

Research boarding schools.,
Prepare for the entrance tests.,
Think about the cost of boarding school.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go to Boarding School1," Have you already talked to your parents about boarding school? What were their major concerns about letting you attend boarding school? Did they have any questions? Before you talk to your parents again (or for the first time), take time to research several boarding schools.


As you research, write down facts and statistics that will answer their questions and find solutions to their concerns.
Write down facts about class sizes, teaching methods, number of student borders, extracurricular opportunities, sports teams, tuition, and location.;
, In order to apply to boarding school, you must take the Secondary School Admission Test (SSAT) or the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). To perform well on these challenging tests, you must study and prepare for the evaluations. Studying for these exams before your parents agree to let you take them will show them that you are serious about commitment to attending boarding.


The SSAT tests students in grades 3 through 12.It costs approximately $120.00.The ISEE tests students in grades 2 through 12. It costs between $105.00 to $185.00. There are fee waivers available., Boarding schools are expensive. The cost of private eduction causes many parents say ""no"" to boarding school. In addition to paying tuition, students and their families must cover the cost of room and board and travel expenses. Before you talk to your parents, spend time brainstorming how you could help fund your private education. Coming up with a creative solution may help convince them to let you attend boarding school.


Do the schools you are interested in offer scholarships and financial aid packages?
Do you qualify for need or merit based aid?
Are there independent scholarships you can apply for and receive?
Are you able to work while you attend school?
Will the cost of your current extracurricular activities (private music lessons, sports clubs, dance classes) offset the cost of boarding school?"

Recognize the symptoms of depression.,
Realize that this will be a difficult conversation.,
Ask someone you trust for guidance.,
Decide who you want to break the news to first.,
Write a letter if you have a hard time finding words.,
Practice what you’ll say.,
Anticipate their questions.",How to Tell Your Parents that You're Depressed1," Before you tell your parents about your depression, you may want to make sure it fits what you're going through. Do some research to learn more about depression from credible sources like the National Institute on Mental Health.Depression in adolescents and teens can manifest in different ways. You might feel indecisive, fatigued, angry, or overly sad. Recently, you may have pulled away from your friends and family and chosen to spend more time alone. You may have trouble sleeping or sleep too much. You might also try to numb your feelings with drugs and alcohol, or engage in other risky activities.Even if you aren’t so sure what you’re experiencing is depression, it’s best to speak up about your symptoms so you can get help.;
, Telling your parents about depression can make you very emotional. You may cry, or your parents may cry. This is perfectly okay. Depression is a difficult subject, and you are doing the right thing by addressing it now before it gets worse.


Chances are, your parent(s) have already noticed something is wrong. They just don't know what it is or how to help. By naming the problem, you will help them feel better and know how to take action.

, You may worry about your parent’s reaction to your mental illness. If so, you might choose to ask a school guidance counselor, a teacher, or a coach for their advice. This can help you warm up to the idea of talking about your depression.You might say, “Ms. Anderson, I think I might be depressed. I don’t know how to tell my parents.”
This trusted person might call your parents in for a meeting so that you can break the news in a safe and comfortable environment.

, Consider whether you want to talk to one parent first or both parents at the same time. Chances are you may be closer to one parent, think that one parent may react better, or even feel like one parent is part of the problem.If that’s the case, talk to the parent you feel most comfortable with first. That parent can help you tell the other parent.

, Sometimes, communicating your feelings is really difficult. You may feel better about sharing the news with your parents in an indirect way like writing a note or sending a text message.Be sure you convey a serious tone, so your parents know that this is a real issue. Describe some of your symptoms, explain how they have been affecting your life, and ask to see a doctor.

, Discussing a tough subject like depression may be hard to do off-the-cuff. Do a practice run by sharing the news aloud in front of a mirror, or by role-playing with a close friend. This can make you feel more comfortable during the talk.

, Be prepared to explain depression and describe your feelings and symptoms. From your research, you might also share your insights about how your parents can help you. Your parents will likely have many questions. You can think about your answers beforehand, or you can simply tell them you’ll feel more comfortable talking to a mental health professional. Here are some examples of questions your parents may ask:Are you going to hurt or kill yourself?
How long have you felt this way?
Did something happen to make you feel this way?
How can we help you feel better?

Study to be sure you are secure in your religious preferences.,
Use the waiting time to do your research.,
Gather the notes you have collected and organize your thoughts.,
Tell your parents you have something important to discuss with them and you'll need some time to do it.,
Tell your parents you have been researching diverse religions.,
Ask your parents what they know about your chosen religion.,
Handle a poor reaction with grace.",How to Tell Your Parents You are Following a Religion They Don't Approve of," If you have lingering doubts about your own faith, it may be best to tell your parents after you feel comfortable and confident about your beliefs.;
, Examine many sources, not only ""faith promoting"" ones related to the religion you are investigating.


Start a journal to keep notes in regarding your spirituality. Include any questions you may have and the reasons why
Discover what you can about your chosen path. Is it monotheistic (worshiping only one deity), polytheistic (worshiping multiple deities), pantheistic (worshiping the universe), or atheistic (believing in no deities)? Are there any notable people in history that have believed as you do?
Search online for forums to find others who believe as you do.
Purchase a number of books about your religion, or borrow them from a local or school library. Just be sure to keep them in a place where your parents won't find them until you're ready.

, You may have to re-write what you have written to assure that you have a solid foundation from which to discuss religion with your parents.

, Make sure that they are allowed to choose the time when this discussion is to take place.

, Tell them this is the religious path you have decided to follow. Watch for their response, if it is shocked or angry, tread carefully and discuss any concerns they may have about your researching religions.

,


Listen carefully to what they say.
Clear up any confusion they may have.
Keep up this back and forth of asking, listening, and responding.

, Don't try to convert your parents to your beliefs. In this instance at least, resist the urge to proselytize and do not argue with them. If they have objections, especially faith-based objections, don't contest with them. Honor your parents and yourself by actively listening and not arguing. Remember that acknowledging is not agreement, so listen and acknowledge their concerns and, as far as possible, let them know that for you at least the relationship is important and that you are still their daughter or son.


If they are very upset, don't panic; give it time and maintain your love for them.
As with all people, when dealing with your parents and deciding how to treat them in contemplating your reactions to them, ask yourself ""is this the best expression of who I really am?""

Gather a list of schools in the area.,
Offer to help pay.,
Make a list of positives and negatives.,
Verify your facts.,
Keep a clear and calm tone.,
Make a deal.,
Note the educational focus of private schools.,
Mention the status private school brings.,
Explain that private schools focus on preparing for the future.,
Point out what you’re missing.,
Highlight their support of art programs.,
Talk about the athletic opportunities.,
Explain that private school offers a chance at lifelong bonds.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go to a Private School," Pick the schools that you might be interested in and write down their information, such as location and tuition. If you think one of the reasons your parents don't want to send you to private school is because it's too expensive, place those lower on the list.


Try making a presentation on power point or on paper so that your parents can see you’re serious about this.;
, Taking on the financial responsibility can help remove some of the doubts your parents might have. Private school is expensive, and your parents may not be willing to pay money for school that isn’t college.


Look into financial aid when browsing schools. Many private schools offer aid for those who qualify for financial need.Get a part time job. Start putting money away early to make sure you can help pay when the time comes.
Let your parents know that aside from tuition, private school is cheap in some ways. For example, many require uniforms, meaning you only need only purchase one wardrobe.

, Share the list with your parents. When it comes to the negatives, have the issues already addressed to set their mind at ease. You want to have done your homework thoroughly to make your case as strong as possible.

Ask your parents for a list of their concerns prior to presenting your case. You can perform the research ahead of time in a way that is tailored to their specific concerns.

, You want to build a foundation of trust for such a big decision. There is nothing worse than your parents going to the school and finding out all of the good things you said about it are a lie.


Send your parents a directory with several of the private schools on your list. They can use the directory to look at the school website and double check the information you presented to them., Talk maturely like an adult and don't lose your cool. Whining will do little to make your case. You need to demonstrate that you are mature enough to handle the responsibility of private school.


If your parents are getting emotional over the discussion, try to change the tone, or leave the discussion for the time being. You want cool heads from both parties., Suggest a deal that is beneficial for everyone involved. For example, if you can prove you have what it takes to get the most out of private school by getting straight A's the rest of the year, then next year you can enroll into a private school of your choice, as long as your parents are okay with the school.


Lay out a plan and timeline for your private school graduation and beyond. This shows a level of maturity that can help sway your parents.

, Graduating from private school requires a greater effort on the part of the student, meaning you will be more likely to give it your all, and benefit from the experience. Private schools often hold their students to a higher standard than public schools.


Private schools also place a greater focus on the relationship between teacher and student by keeping the overall class sizes much smaller than public schools., Featuring your private school on your resume after college can also help establish a line of hard work and education that can entice potential employers. Private school is not the direct gateway into high ranking colleges it once was, but it still offers a good look for your transcript. , Tell your parents that many private schools are also known as “prep” schools, which focus on preparing you for a successful transition into college. Public schools are supposed to prepare you in theory, but often lack specific classes dedicated to making that transition.


Point out to your parents that getting a college degree lets individuals make nearly twice as much as those who just earned a high school diploma, on average., Compare the experience you are currently having at school with the possibilities available at private school. This is particularly effective if you are homeschooled – the differences between the two schooling styles are quite large.


For example, highlight the lack of extracurricular activities available at home, such as sports.
Making new friends is also very difficult when you are homeschooled.
Explain that private schools have much more in the way of resources available to them, meaning you can learn with some of the newest technology and equipment available., Budget cuts are forcing many public schools to cut art education from their curriculums. Some of the classes cut from public schools include those dedicated to drama or theatre, dance, and even music and visual arts.Not only do private schools not have this budgeting issue, and thus feature robust art classes, but many offer majors in art programs., Nearly all private school students get an opportunity to participate in sports. Though public schools offer athletics programs, the large number of students at public schools means that many students will not get an opportunity to play on a team.


Many private schools also make athletics mandatory, in order to help create well rounded students., The close proximity in which students live means they will have plenty of time to get to know one another. The small class sizes associated with private school also allow students to easily network with a number of their classmates and teachers.


Small class sizes also result in an overall greater student engagement, as well as teacher retention."

Know your reasons.,
Do some research.,
Make a list of benefits of the private school.,
Realize that your parents are trying to do what's best for you.,
Keep the discussion between you and your parents.,
Be mature about it.,
What will happen if you go against your parents' wishes and attend the public school?,
Talk to people who go to both schools.,
Brace for the truth.,
Retain your dignity no matter what.,
Even after you go, if you are still angry that you went, show it!",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Attend a Public High School Instead of a Private One," You may be making a choice that you will regret later by not attending a private school, so it is important for you to really think about what you want. Your chances of getting into a good university are much higher if you go to private school than a public school in most instances. However, keep in mind that this is not always true. If you are sent to a private school for religious reasons, or your public high school as benefits/courses better for you, chances may be better at the public school. Weigh the benefits of private schools with your reasons for wanting to switch to public schools.;
, If you are still adamant about going to a public school, compile a list of all the positive attributes of the public school. Make sure to have references suggesting it is better than the private school. For example, take a look at some courses offered only in the public school and not in the private school, courses which you and your parents would approve of. These could pertain to the field you will pursue in college. Any college-preparatory programs should be mentioned too.

, Even though you may be tempted to only research one side, look at the positives of both schools. You might even find that you like the private school better than you thought. If not, you will be able to strengthen your own argument by knowing your parents' position.

, Believe it or not, your parents really do want you to succeed. They probably plan to invest a lot of money in your education, and you need to respect that they have most likely researched both schools even more thoroughly than you have. Listen to them and don't immediately discount their arguments. However, keep in mind that adults are not always fully mature. They may be unreasonably adamant on sending you to this private school and are unfair about the public school. Make sure to have your research ready.

, While it may be tempting to get your friends to help you argue your point, don't. Your parents will be less likely to give up their position if you do. That's a natural defensive nature that everyone has and since you will be hard pressed to make them give in already, you needn't make it harder on yourself.

, Don't cry, go on a hunger strike, or try to commit suicide over which school you go to. You are a high school student and need to act like one and all of those methods are very childish. One of your parents' reasons for your attendance at a private school may be to keep you from being exposed to the crude behavior found in public schools. If you show them you can handle situations in the proper way, you will find it easier to negotiate.

, Will your parents eventually forget about it? Or will they continually despise you? Will they send you away from home? Decide what is best.

, The best way to assess a school is by talking to people who go there. They know what the website doesn't tell you. Maybe you'll find some things out about the private school your parents wouldn't like.

, A general good time to start negotiating about high schools is whenever your parents bring up the topic, no matter how early. You should really start the research process right away. Within three months, if you have failed to convince your parents, understand that while it is not too late, hope is running out. After five or six months, you should be almost sure that your ideas will not work. Your parents are strict on this and you must go.

, Even if your parents won't budge, try not to let it eat away at you. High school can be one of the most exciting times of your life. Don't let this decision get in the way of enjoying yourself. No matter where you go you will have a lot of fun and make tons of new friends. Be optimistic about the new school and maybe you'll realize it's not as bad as it seems.

, Complain about how unhappy you are an how well you could've done in the public school. This will make your parents regret. In the long term, if you are so unhappy and do badly in the private school, your parents may relent and send you to the public school. But remember to be open minded to both places.

Highlight the school’s rigorous academic expectations.,
Express an interest in the school’s fine arts program.,
Emphasize the school’s impressive sports programs.,
Identify your need to attend a therapeutic boarding school.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go to Boarding School2," The faculty at boarding schools expect a lot from their students. Their goal is to develop students' critical thinking skills and preparing students for college. Boarding schools also offer smaller class sizes. This allows teachers to work directly with each student. When you talk with your parents, mention that:


Your current classes aren't challenging you.
You want to take college level courses.
You would benefit, or be helped by, smaller class sizes., While public institutions continue to cut funding for the arts, many boarding schools have fantastic fine arts programs. Boarding schools provide their students with the time, instructors, and opportunity needed to develop as a musician, artist, and/or theatrical performer. During your conversation, bring up the fact that:


Your current school does not have a fine arts program.
Attending boarding school would increase your chances of getting accepted into a reputable performing arts college or university., Many boarding schools have outstanding athletic programs. Since their teams can afford to compete around the nation and world, their student athletes are more likely to play in front of recruiters from high ranking college programs. They also offer a variety of sports that are not available at every public school, such as squash and equestrian. As you talk with your parents, mention that:


You want to train and compete at a high level.
Playing for this school will help you get recruited by a Division I college or university., Therapeutic boarding schools are ideal for students struggling to cope with and/or recover from a variety of issues, such as substance abuse, eating disorders, severe traumas, and learning disabilities. These institutions offer students all of the academic and extracurricular opportunities of traditional boarding schools. During their time at school, however, certified providers oversee rehabilitation services for students. When you talk to your parents, let them know that:


You want focus on improving your mental, physical, and/or spiritual health.
You want to receive intensive therapy while attending school."

Have a conversation with your parents.,
Don't give up.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go to Boarding School3," Before you talk with your parents, you may want to prepare and rehearse a small presentation, or pitch. In this presentation:


Include information about specific schools you are interested in, like cost, available aid/scholarships, class size, and location.
Explain why you feel boarding school is the best option for you. ""I want to attend boarding school because it will (help me prepare for college, increase my chances to play DI sports, allow me to attend therapy and school, etc.).""
Mention that you've started preparing for the application process. ""I've started studying for the entrance exams."" ""I have a draft of my personal statement."" ""I've asked my current teachers to write letters of recommendation."" This will demonstrate to them that you are serious about applying to boarding school.
Provide answers to your parents' previous questions. ""I know you are concerned about paying for the school. The scholarship I qualify for will help cover the cost."" ""Last time we talked, you mentioned that you didn't want me too far from home. I found an excellent boarding school just a few hours from town."", When your presentation is complete, ask your parents to meet with you. When everyone is settled, ask your parents to hold their questions until the end of your presentation. Take a deep breath and start your presentation.


Provide your parents with additional information, like handouts, brochures, and/or contact information for various school administrators.

, Following your presentation, ask your parents if they have any questions or comments. As they talk, try not to interrupt them.


You may want to take notes. This will help you keep track of all of their concerns and questions., When they’ve finished, start a conversation with your parents. Do your best to answer their questions and provide solutions to their concerns. Continue talking back and forth until your parents reach a decision. If your parents say “yes,” congratulations! You can start applying to boarding school!


""You wanted to know more about the boarding school I like. Would you be open to talking to a representative from the school?""
""I'm not sure how financial aid works either. Can we find someone to explain it to us?""
""I understand that you love watching me play basketball. If I go to this boarding school, I would play five games within a few hours of our hometown.""
""Would you be open to a boarding school closer to our hometown?""
""If I improve my current grades, can I apply to boarding school?"", If your parents say “no,” ask them what you can do to convince them to let you attend boarding school. Take their suggestions seriously. As you find out more information or meet their requirements, update your parents and ask them to reconsider."
"
Choose a good time to have the talk.,
Let them know that this is serious.,
Make ""I"" statements about your feelings.,
Put a name to what you’re feeling.,
Ask for a doctor's appointment.,
Don't panic if your parent(s) react badly.",How to Tell Your Parents that You're Depressed2," You’ll want to pick a time when neither you nor your parents are distracted. It should be a quiet time when you can talk one-on-one, or alone with both of them. Long car rides, quiet evenings, doing chores together, and long walks are all good opportunities to bring up the subject.If your parent(s) are busy, ask when is a good time. Say something like ""I have something really important to talk to you about. When would be a good time for us to have a private conversation?""

, Sometimes, parents make the mistake of not taking their children seriously about depression. You can get their full attention by letting them know that this is serious right off the bat.


You might convey seriousness by saying, “I have a really big problem, and I need help,"" or ""This is hard for me to talk about. I really need you to listen.""
In some cases, the opportunity to talk—and the seriousness of the issue—may present itself naturally. For instance, you might start crying and just blurt out your feelings, or you might be extremely frustrated with school and they ask you if there’s a problem., Using “I” statements help you communicate your feelings without making your parents defensive or putting them on guard. For instance, saying “Your fighting is making me sad” may make your parents feel like they need to defend themselves, which makes them less likely to listen. Instead, make it all about you and what you’re feeling.


”I” statements may sound like ""I feel really exhausted and gloomy. It's hard to get out of bed"" or ""I know I've been cranky lately. I get really mad at myself, and I hate myself sometimes. I keep wishing that I could die.""

, Now that they know how it is affecting you, say its name. Talk to them about any research you did, and offer to show them any articles you found helpful. Show them wikiHow articles like Deal with Depression and Know if You Have Depression if this helps.


""I found some articles about depression. It sounds a lot like what I'm going through, and I think I may have it.""

, Don’t just bring up the subject of depression and expect your parents to know how to handle it. Make sure they know you are worried about your condition and that you want to get help.You might say, “I think I need to make an appointment with Dr. Rogers for an evaluation.”
A doctor can help you figure out whether you have depression for sure. Seeing your doctor is also typically the first step in getting treatment, or being referred to a mental health provider who can treat you.

, There’s a change your parents won’t respond to the news how you would like. They may react with disbelief, self-blame, anger, or fear. Keep in mind that although you have been battling with depression for a while, they are just learning about it. Give them some time to digest the news and figure out how they truly feel.If they are confused, say ""It took me a long time to understand depression, too."" Remember that this is not your fault. You did the right thing, and this is the best way for them to find out.
If your parents don’t take your claims seriously, keep telling them (or another adult) until they take action.Depression is serious, regardless of whether your parents believe you.

Share your feelings with them.,
Make a list of actions your parents can take to help.,
Ask them to accompany you to appointments, if you want.,
See if they’d like to participate in a support group.",How to Tell Your Parents that You're Depressed3," Opening up about depression can be challenging, but you may feel better if you try to share your feelings. Gather the courage to talk to your parents about what it’s like to have depression, especially when you are feeling particularly low.Talking to them doesn’t mean you expect them to “fix” you. It just gives you an outlet for your emotions, and helps you feel less alone.
Your parents would rather know that something is wrong, as opposed to wondering if something is wrong. Be honest about your feelings. This way, they can start helping you.

, You can help your parents help you by passing on useful information you learn about improving your depressive symptoms. You can ease depression by taking your prescribed medication, getting a good night’s rest, eating balanced meals, and getting physical activity. Tell your parent’s how they can help you with this.Make a list of ways your parents can support your treatment. For instance, they might go walking with you outdoors in the evenings, start a family game night to help you relieve stress, keep track of medication refills, or make sure you are going to bed at a decent time to be well-rested.

, A great way to involve your parents in your treatment is by having them join you at appointments. That way, they can stay updated on the treatment process and ask any questions they may have. Driving you to doctor visits and therapy appointments also helps you feel supported during this difficult time.You might say, “I’d really like it if you came to my next appointment with me.”

, Your doctor or therapist may have recommended that you join a local support group of other teens and young adults who are experiencing depression. These groups are great for you because they help you bond with others who are going through similar situations. However, it might also help for your parents to attend such groups, too.


In these groups, your parents can learn more about how to support your depression treatment. Plus, they may also forge bonds with other parents and family members who are supporting their child’s treatment.
The National Alliance on Mental Illness has peer and family support groups. Search for a NAMI chapter in your area to look for a support group you and your parents can join."

Understand what atheism is.,
Know what agnosticism is.,
Know what a coexist is.,
Consider the consequences.,
Talk about it with someone you trust.,
Tell your parents.,
Be confident.",How to Tell Your Parents You Are an Atheist," An atheist is simply someone who does not believe in a god (or gods). This position is sometimes called weak atheism, because it consists of no beliefs in and of itself. Some atheists go further and believe that no gods exist. This position is known as strong atheism, as it includes the active belief that there are no gods. Your parents might not know the meanings of these terms, so be careful to clearly define what your position is. For example, in common usage, some people will refer to weak atheism as agnosticism, even though these two terms have different meanings.;
, While theism and atheism deal with belief, agnosticism deals with knowledge. An agnostic is someone who holds the view that the existence of god (or gods) is unknown. Weak agnosticism is the view that the existence or non-existence of gods is not known at this time, but might be known in the future. Strong agnosticism is the view that the existence or non-existence of gods is something that is inherently unknowable. Agnosticism and atheism are not mutually exclusive. An agnostic atheist might recognize that they do not know for certain whether or not gods exist while lacking a belief in gods, or even while maintaining the belief that there are no gods. Similarly, agnosticism is not mutually exclusive with theism. An agnostic theist might recognize that they do not know whether or not gods exist, but still maintain a belief in a god or gods.

, A coexist is someone who believes that no matter what religious belief you have, you can come together and study your scriptures, compare notes and exchange world-views without starting the Crusades part II! You know that we're more evolved than that, so we should be able to discuss what we believe, notice differences, and come away from it unscathed. Again, it's not exclusive to any religion at all. Anyone with any belief can come together and figure out what they believe. It's like a debate club for religion. We go in, we compare, and we may argue a little, but you'll come out smiling and shaking hands.

, If you have been brought up in a religious home then revealing a lack of faith can be difficult. ""agnostic"" or ""atheist"" or even ""coexist"" can be a dirty word, because they don't know what it means to you. You can say three words that make total sense to you: ""agnostic christian coexist"", and all they'll do is sit and stare at you with a blank stare. You could practice with a friend who has similar beliefs and had to go through something similar before going in to fight for what you believe in. A lot of your family life might be based around the traditions of the faith. Ask yourself to what extent you wish to withdraw from the festivals that punctuate our lives. If you wish to continue practicing the traditions in your home, be sure that your parents know that your beliefs will not separate you from these family activities. If you are unsure of how your parents will react, try testing the waters first. Discuss with them a topic that is not directly related to religion but influenced by it, such as abortion, same-sex marriage, or other religiously charged political issues. That might give you more of an idea of how they would react to outright atheism. If you feel that admission of atheism would put you in danger, don't tell them. Remember that you'll have to live with them only until you are able to move out on your own. In extreme cases, it may be better to just fake religious belief until you are more independent.

, There are many atheist groups both locally and online. Some of them have gone through similar experiences and may have good advice on how to proceed. They may also give you moral support or assistance when needed. At the minimum, they will offer safe venue for expressing your atheism. If you cannot find an atheist group, you may confide in a trusted friend. It is easier when you don't have to go it alone.

, If you feel that you are ready to tell your parents then do so when they have the time to listen to you and there are no other distractions. Make it clear that you love them and appreciate what they have done for you, and that you are in no way rejecting them. They might find what you are about to say difficult, so be sure to respect their opinions and beliefs, while taking care not to be easily offended. Make it clear that taking part in acts of worship would be hypocritical and that you wish to bow out of them. It might also help to say that you still wish to play a full part in family life.

, Make it clear that you have come to your decision after much thought, and are no longer soul-searching. Let your parents know that you have reasons for thinking what you do, but do not argue with them, and under no circumstances should you raise your voice. If you feel that you have not been heard, respectfully end the conversation. Give your parents time to digest what you have told them. Remember, the purpose of the conversation is to let your parents know what you have decided, not to debate. There will be plenty of time to enter into discussions later, once everyone has had time to settle their thoughts.

Although it may seem to be a daunting mission, opening up to someone will help you feel supported and loved. Be sure that your friend will not judge you or spill your secret. Otherwise, be confident about your sexuality and realize that there are others who have the same sexual preferences as you.;
, When telling your parents, be clear and concise with your words. Get straight to the point rather than dancing around the topic. Ensure that your parents receive a clear message. To avoid conflict, find an appropriate time to tell them, such as when they are in a good mood. .

, After you tell them, they may feel shocked by the sudden news. Although it may seem strange, they need time to mourn for the loss of their dreams for you. They most likely had plans to have grandchildren, a son/daughter-in-law, etc. They will need time and space to process the information and figure out how to respond to you.

, After telling one person or more about your sexuality, continue telling your trusted friends until they all know. Be sure to approach the topic lightly without scaring them off. Find an appropriate time and location to tell them, and gradually ease the subject into your conversation. Understand that they too may need time and space to accept the news.

, Once people know that you're bisexual, stay proud of yourself. Continue leading a positive life without a care for other people's opinions. Others may not approve of your choices, and they might spread rumors or call you names. However, ignore them because they are jealous of your happiness. If you're facing severe bullying, be sure to tell a trusted adult or a teacher.

, For those who are heterosexual, they may not understand that bisexual people do not find every single person attractive. They might warn you not to kiss them or fall in love with them. However, be patient and explain to them that being bisexual does not mean automatically feeling attracted to everyone. Always have a good comeback for every insult.

, Negativity often surrounds bisexuality, but you must understand that remaining strong in who you are is essential. Allowing people's opinions to push you down will only make you unhappy. Never allow people to prevent you from taking chances, missing the best moments, and seeking happiness. By being proud of who you are, you will be able to find the right partner.

(It is best not to latch onto one single diagnosis, to prevent bias during the professional diagnostic process.) Read both medical descriptions, and descriptions from people who have the disorders.


Consider the fact that you may not be mentally ill, but may have a neurological disorder (such as autism), a food allergy, or another illness that needs treating.;
, They'll take time to adjust to the news. Be ready to respond to questions and comments such as:


How long have you felt like this?
How severe is it? (Reflect on your past to think of several examples that demonstrate something is unusual with your brain.)
Could you have something else? (You can show them the disorders that best matched your symptoms, and mention the disorders that you researched and ruled out.)
What sort of treatment do you think you need?

, You want to minimize stress for both you and your parent(s)/guardian(s). An ideal time is when...


There are no major tasks to be done at the moment. Try long car rides, quiet meals, washing dishes after supper, etc.
Both you and they feel relaxed.
You can speak in private without likely interruptions.
You can access a computer or papers with some of your research (optional).

, For example, ""Dad, I have something important to tell you and I really need your attention. I think I have depression."" Being direct signals that you are serious.


Avoid throwing subtle hints beforehand, drifting off topic, or making jokes. If you do so, they may not realize how important it is for them to take you seriously.

, Your parent(s)/guardian(s) will probably feel surprised, worried, and confused. Be prepared to reassure them.


Don't worry if they react badly. Sometimes people deny it (""But you're so normal! You can't be mentally ill""), rationalize their denial (""It's just side effects from your asthma meds/worries about college/alien abduction""), or overreact (""Are you going to die? Should I call an ambulance?""). Do not panic. This is temporary. Any decent parent or guardian will overcome this and do their best to help you get treatment.
You may have to assure them that it's not their fault, they raised you well and it's only coming from chemicals in your brain, you aren't planning on suicide (assuming that this is true), and that you've researched this and understand how to proceed.
If you have been considering suicide, explain that you want to live, and this is why you are telling them instead of keeping quiet.

, They will probably feel a little lost due to the shock, and you can guide them with your educated perspective. Ask to set up an appointment to your family doctor, who can evaluate you, provide medication, and/or refer you specialists.


If you have health insurance, your insurance company may be able to recommend some experts. Check their website.
Consider therapy, medication, and noninvasive alternative treatments (e.g. dance therapy).

If there isn't, ask your teacher for advice on how to improve your performance in the future.Simply approach your teacher after class, and say something like: “Hi, Ms. Guardiola, can I talk to you about my last exam?”
Also, inquire about the possibility of doing extra credit to make up for your poor score.
Having this feedback from your teacher will help you explain the situation to your parents and offer you possible ways to address the situation.;
, Besides figuring out how to tell your parents about your score, you should figure out what you are going to do to address it. Speaking with your teacher is good preparation for this since they can help you identify what options you have and steer you on the right path for the future.For instance, you can plan to earn a few points back through extra credit work and attend the after-school review sessions hosted by the English Club.
To make a good plan, you should know what exactly went wrong. Was it simply that you didn’t understand a particular formula? Were you distracted by a personal issue or competing obligation? Did you not study as much as you should have? Take some time to reflect so that you can be sure your strategies will fix it.

, If you’re worried about how to tell your parents about your score, take time to practice first. You can confide in a stuffed animal or talk to yourself in front of the mirror. Either way, having some sense of what you will say and how you will say it ahead of time can be very helpful in the moment.For example, you might try out ways to broach the subject, such as: “Mom, I’ve been struggling a lot lately in Biology, and I failed the unit test we had last week,” or, “I got a D on my Trigonometry exam...I’ve already talked to Mr. Williams about it, and he recommended a tutor and agreed to let me do enough extra credit to bring up my score by one letter grade.”

, It will look like you’re being dishonest or trying to cover up your grade if you wait two weeks to tell them about your score. Try to get it out of the way within a few days of getting the news. Getting it off your chest will make you feel better, too.Your parents may also be able to help you rectify the situation by giving you support and advice. The sooner you tell them, the more likely they are to be able to help.

, If you approach them when they're already stressed or angry, they'll be less likely to react well. Try a calm, family time when your parents aren’t distracted by other concerns, such as during or immediately following dinner or when you’re out on a dog walk or have just parked the car.If test scores and grades are a frequent concern, try agreeing on a designated time each week when you can talk to your parents about how you’re doing in school.

, If you’re worried about how your parents will respond, start the conversation by directly communicating what you would like from them. If you are calm and direct and act like an adult, your parents are more likely to do the same.You can say, “I’d like to talk to you about my score on the last Chemistry test. It’s kind of hard to talk about, but it’ll be easier if you’re patient and hear me out.”
Alternatively, you could try something like: “I got a bad grade on my French exam. Before you respond, can you give me a few minutes to explain the situation and how I’m going to address it?”

, It’s fine to honestly explain the factors that contributed to your score, such as having a basketball tournament suck up your study time. However, your parents are probably less interested in excuses than in how you are going to improve the next time around. Taking responsibility for your performance will give your parents proof that you have thought about what went wrong and are ready to learn from your mistakes.Being up-front about what went wrong will also communicate to your parents that you realize you are responsible for your own education and academic achievement. In other words, they don’t need to give you a lecture about it.
For example, you might say, “I was very busy with rehearsals, but I know that studying should be my top priority,” or, “I knew that I didn’t have that particular formula down, so I should have gone to the teacher or a tutor for extra help before the test.”

, If you tell your parents that you’re disappointed with yourself, they’re more likely to sympathize with you. They may also be less inclined to express any disappointment they may feel since you’re already feeling guilty.Try saying something like, “I’m so disappointed with my score; I’ve been upset about it all day,” or, “I feel terrible about failing the test; sorry for letting myself and you down.”

, Now it’s time to unveil your strategy for self-improvement. Explain the ways that you intend to bring up your grades in that subject. Your parents should be impressed that you have a plan.For instance, you could say, “I’m going to do my best to get a better grade on the next exam. I plan on spending more time on my homework, studying with my friend Lisa who got an A on the last test, and doing extra-credit assignments to make up some of the points I lost.”
You can also show that you respect their experience and know-how by seeking their advice and feedback about your plan. Just ask questions like: “Does that sound like a good way to improve my scores?” or, “Do you have any recommendations for how I can do better in the future?”

, A bad score can seem overwhelming, but it’s just one test. Offer an honest explanation of how this score will impact your overall performance in the class. Reminding them and yourself about the positives can also help put this one incident into perspective. Take time to call up all the good things that are happening with your education.For instance, you might say: “I struggled with this test, but I did really well on the last two,” or, “I missed all the questions about one particular theory but got full points for all the others.”

, It’s possible that your parents may lecture you to instill the importance of good grades or punish you to show that getting poor scores has consequences. If you willingly accept their reasonable advice and punishments without anger or whining, it will show that you’ve learned your lesson.It may even help to suggest what you feel is an appropriate punishment, such as: “How about if I stop playing video games during the week until my scores have improved in Trigonometry?”

, Your parents won’t be very impressed if your promises and plans were empty. You have a plan for addressing your bad score, now it’s time to act on it. Do so in a timely manner so that you can get your studies back on track.


If you don’t follow through, it will suggest that you have not taken responsibility and that you cannot be trusted. Both will make it more difficult to tell your parents about a bad score in the future.

, Rectify your past mistakes by amping up your studying. Inform your parents of when and how you are studying or study in front of them so that they can see you’re committed to getting a better score next time.

, Show your parents that you are dedicated to improving future scores by going to study groups or sessions, meeting with your teacher, and/or getting tutoring through your school or an outside organization. If necessary, you can ask your parents to help you arrange a private tutor in the subject to ensure that you have the support you need to improve.Start the conversation with your parents by saying something like: “I would really like to improve my grade in German, but I’m still struggling. I think it might help if I got some one-on-one tutoring. Would you be willing to help me find a tutor and pay for a few sessions?”

, If your parents are worried about your grades, suggest ways that they could help you to improve your scores. That way, they know that you’re working hard and can share some of the responsibility.For instance, you may ask them to help you study for the next exam by quizzing you with flashcards. All you have to do is say, “Dad, do you have a minute to help me review for my American History exam?”

In the beginning of the cycle, your body creates more estrogen, which causes the lining of the uterus to thicken with blood and mucous. At the same time, the ovaries release an egg. An egg that gets fertilized by male sperm would attach itself to the thickened uterine wall. But, if the egg is not fertilized, it breaks apart and is expelled by your body. At this time, the excess uterine lining is also shed, and this is what comes out as your monthly period.Girls usually get their periods between the ages of 12 and 14, but it can happen as early as 8 or 9 years old.
Lots of people talk about monthly periods, but it’s pretty normal to be slightly irregular, especially at first. Don’t be worried if you don’t get your period on the exact same day every month. Generally, people get a period every 21 to 35 days, and they usually last anywhere from three to five days.;
, Every girl has a different preference when it comes to feminine hygiene products. The best way to figure out your favorite is to try them all! You can buy menstrual products at drug stores, grocery stores, and online, but if you know where your mom or sister keeps hers, you can always borrow those until you’ve had the talk with your mom (most people keep them under the sink in the bathroom, in closets or cupboards near the sink or toilet, or maybe in a linen closet near the bathroom). There are actually quite a few of feminine hygiene products on the market, and while some are disposable, other are reusable.


Pads and liners are disposable, and protect your undergarments by absorbing menstrual fluid after it’s expelled from your body.
Cloth pads work similarly to pads and liners, but are washable and reusable.
Tampons are disposable, and are inserted into the vagina and absorb fluid before it’s expelled.
Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are inserted like tampons, but they get cleaned and reused throughout your period. Because tampons and cups catch menstrual fluid before it comes out, these are ideal for swimming and sports., Premenstrual syndrome is a term used to describe a variety of symptoms that some people experience in the days or weeks leading up to their period. Although the exact cause isn’t fully understood, PMS seems to be caused by hormonal and chemical changes that occur during the menstrual cycle, and they are possibly affected by diet and vitamin levels as well. Everybody’s different, but symptoms can include depression or heightened emotional reactions, cravings, fatigue, bloating, aches and pains, headaches, and tender breasts.Abdominal cramps are also common during menstruation, and they are caused by contractions of the uterus.


Anti-inflammatories and pain medicine like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen can help control cramping and aches.
Avoid smoking,(which is illegal under the age of 18) drinking alcohol, (which is illegal under the age of 21) consuming caffeine, and excessive salt consumption (this will help prevent water retention and bloating).
Regular exercise will help reduce menstrual cramping and improve your mood.
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet all the time.Keep healthy snacks on hand to combat over-indulging your cravings. If you have trouble controlling cravings, opt for healthier snack options. For salt cravings, try homemade rice and soy sauce instead of high-sodium junk food. Make yourself some hot cocoa from scratch instead of binging on chocolate bars. Make your own French fries in the oven if you are craving deep-fried food.

, It’s important that you stay calm and not panic when you get your period! It’s totally normal and not a big deal, and neither is telling your mom. Give yourself time to process the changes happening to your body. Don’t worry if you aren’t ready to tell your mom right away: it’s your body and your choice.


Before you tell your mom, make sure you are relaxed. Do whatever works for you, whether it’s a bath, walk, book, nap, deep breathing, or something else.
Think about what you want to say to your mom. Try writing down a few points or questions, or rehearse what you’re going to say.
You can ask a school nurse, doctor, teacher, or other trusted adult for help if you have questions and still aren’t ready to tell your mom. Sometimes it can be easier to tell someone else first, and then telling your mom won’t seem so hard.
You can try talking to a friend or sibling first if it's easier. If female chances are they've went through or are currently going through and can give some tips.

, Find some quiet time when you and your mom can have a chat alone. Don’t freak yourself out! Try not to think about it too much, and instead just dive right in. Remember, she’s your mom; there’s nobody in the world who loves you more, and she understands what you’re going through. Approach the topic any way you like, whether you’ve got a whole song and dance planned, or if you want to start off by saying you feel a little uncomfortable but need to talk to her. If you are having trouble figuring out what to say, try something like:


“ I think I started my period.”
“Can we go to the store? I need some things.”
“ this is difficult for me to say, but I’ve started my period.”
“I don’t know how to say this, but ‘‘it’’ came…”
"" I just wanted to tell you I've started my period...""

, Anytime you are alone together is a great time to approach the subject with your mom, especially if the idea of a formal sit-down with her seems too nerve wracking. You can do it on the way to school, soccer practice, or piano lessons, while watching TV, out for a walk, before she says goodnight, or any other time you have together that isn’t rushed. Casually let your mom know that you got your period.


Segue into the subject by asking her how old she was when she got her period if you don’t feel comfortable coming out and saying it.
Work it into a conversation about something completely non-related if you need to. That will give you time to get talking and relax, and then you can slip it in when you feel comfortable.

, Out shopping together can be a great opportunity to tell your mom about your period without really having to bring it up. Steer her toward the feminine hygiene products in the grocery or drug store, and tell her that you need to pick up some supplies. This is a great time to ask her about recommendations, and she’ll pick up on the fact that you’re trying to tell her about your period.

, Getting your period means your body is going through a number of changes. Ask your mom any questions you have. This is a great time for you to bond, and she’ll probably have loads of stuff she wants to talk about.


Use this time to ask her about sexual health as well if you are comfortable bringing it up.
Ask if she has any favorite products, what she craves when she’s on her period, and how she manages any PMS symptoms or cramps.

, Telling your mom in person can be scary, and if you don’t feel confident doing that, you can always tell her with a note. That way, she can initiate the conversation with you next time you’re alone together.Leave the note somewhere private that she’ll definitely find it, like in her purse. Notes can be long and complicated, or short and sweet, like:


“Hey Mom, I got my period today! Maybe we can get supplies at the drug store later? I love you.”
“I got my period. Could you please bring home some pads/tampons? Thanks!”

, You can still kind of tell your mom in person by doing it over the phone if you really don’t feel comfortable telling her face to face. Use the same techniques and tactics that you would if you were telling her in person, or you can say something like:


“I’ll be home in an hour, and maybe we can talk for a few minutes, because I got my period.”
“I’ll be home later than normal because I’m stopping at the drug store for some tampons.”
“Can we have chocolate cake for dessert? I’ve really been craving it since I got my period!”

, Another way to let your mom know what’s going on with you is by sending a text. It’s not the most personal way, but it’ll get the job done! You can use similar phrasing as if you were writing her a more personal letter, such as saying:


“Just wanted to let you know I got my period. See you at home later!”
“Can we talk later? I've started my period.”
“Are you going shopping soon? I got my period and need some supplies.”

Figure out if you're prepared for the worst.",How to Tell Your Family You Want to Join the Military," Your family is going to have a lot of questions, and they're going to want to know how and why you’ve reached this decision. To prepare for the discussion, think about a few questions they might have and write down your answers in advance. Your family will want to know:What branch of the military you want to join
If there's a specific job you're aiming for
How long of a commitment it will be
What kind of training and education you'll get
Why you want to join
How long you'll be away from home
What it means for your future
How often you'll be able to see them;
, If you're worried that your family might not be happy about your decision, it can help to have the support of one or two close family members before you tell everyone else.


Choose a family member or close relative that you think will be sympathetic and understanding of your decision.
Your confidant can help you brainstorm questions you should prepare for, and get you ready for reactions that you might expect.
You may even want to have a practice conversation with this family member in advance to help prepare you for the real talk with everyone else.However, don’t try to determine what the conversation will actually be like, otherwise you might be thrown off guard if your family reacts in a way you didn’t expect.

, A family meeting is a good way to get your family together so you can talk to them all at the same time about your decision. You don’t have to include extended family, but you should discuss your decision with parents, siblings, and children.


Talk to your family in advance and let them know you want to get everyone together. Schedule a time when everyone is free.
Ideally, make the meeting on a weekend, or at a time when everyone has had a couple hours to relax after work or school.
If there are immediate family members who live out of town or far away, consider including them through a conference call or video chat., When the time comes for your meeting and you're ready to tell everyone that you want to join the military, it’s best to come right out and say it. They will surely continue the dialogue afterward by asking questions. To start, say something clear and understandable,such as:


“I want to join the military”
“I have been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and have come to the conclusion that I'm joining the military”
“After thinking long and hard, I’ve realized my calling is the military”

, Part of this discussion involves getting help from your family as well. You can facilitate this process by telling them how they can support you. This may include:Telling them how they can keep in touch, such as by letters, phone calls, or emails
Deciding how often you want to talk to them when you're away
Having them be available for you to talk to and share news with
Having them be excited for you, even if they don’t agree with your decision

, Unless you can explain your decision, your family may think that you aren't serious, that you haven't thought this through, or that you aren't ready. Use the research you’ve done to explain to them:What kind of job you're aiming for
The pay scale and career path
The opportunities this choice will create for you
What you expect to gain from the experience
That you understand the risks involved

, The more candid you are, the more likely your family is to accept your decision. If you're secretive or unwilling to answer questions, they may assume the worst, and will think that you're not making the right choice.


For example, if you don’t explain your decision, your family may think you're just trying to run away from something and don’t want to involve them.
Have answers prepared for the why-type questions you'll be asked, such as why you want to join the military.
Don’t make up answers. Instead, if someone asks a question you can’t yet answer, tell them you'll figure it out and respond later.

, As long as you meet the requirements, your family can’t actually stop you from joining the military. Although they may, try, ultimately the decision is yours, and only you can decide what's right for your life. However, it’s still important to listen to your family’s concerns. Some of the criteria for enlisting may include:You must be 18 years old, or 17 and have parental consent.
Height and weight restrictions
Academic qualifications

, Some people try to get their way by inducing feelings of guilt in others. If your family tries to make you feel guilty about joining the military in an attempt to change your mind, there are ways you can manage this tactic.Restate how important this is to you.
Let them know that you see what they're trying to do and don’t appreciate it.
Ask them to reframe their concerns in a way that doesn’t involve making you feel guilty
Reframe guilt as gratitude. Interpret this guilt trip as a sign that your family cares for you and wants the best for you.

, When you join the military, there is a chance that you may have to kill someone else, destroy someone’s home, or that you yourself will be killed in the line of duty. Your family knows this, and they may become preoccupied with the violence associated with a life in the military.


Let them know that according to three decades worth of statistical tracking, only about 0.082 percent of enlisted service members die in the military.You can also remind them that it’s possible that you may also never be deployed and may never see war, depending on what happens in the world during your time in the military and your duties there.

, Your family loves you and cares about you, and that’s why they're perhaps scared, angry, and panicking about your decision. It’s important that you remain calm, otherwise emotions will run higher and the discussion could escalate.


Understand that panic is a common reaction to a family member joining the military, especially if there's a good chance you'll be deployed.Reassure your family that you love them, but that you need to do this. But don’t become angry or heated yourself, as this will only increase tension.
Use active listening techniques to hear your family out. While a member of your family is speaking, look them in the eyes, nod at what they're saying, and focus on what they're saying (not what you're going to say to respond).Help your family calm down by using a soft, love voice. Show them that you understand their panic and concern.For example, you could say, ""I understand that you're worried about my safety, but this life decision is really important to me.""

, The job of a recruiter is to advertise the army, talk to applicants and potential enlistees, convince people to enlist, conduct interviews, and assess applicants.A recruiter will be able to answer questions, explain the process, and can take your information to get the ball rolling.


To find a recruiter near you, visit the U.S. Army website.If you're having trouble talking to your family about your decision, you can also request that a recruiter come to your home to talk and answer questions., While recruiters will be able to answer your questions, they are biased because it’s their job to convince you to join the military. To get a well-rounded perspective on what life in the military will really be like, talk to people who have served and who aren't being paid to recruit you.


Recently discharged veterans are good candidates, friends or family members, or a civilian counselor.Ask about what it’s like, whether they enjoyed their time in the military, and whether they would recommend it for someone else.

, Your family might have a lot of reasons for their concerns, and knowing the pros and cons of joining the military will help you make the most informed decision. Understand that joining the military:Won’t alleviate problems in your life, and will only put them on hold
Isn't necessarily the only way to obtain an affordable education
Means you might have to go to war
Demands that your actions are controlled by your superiors

, People often join the military for the job training that they’ll receive, but this won’t necessarily be applicable training once you leave the military and rejoin civilian life.


When you're looking at joining, examine the job descriptions you're considering and ask yourself how those skills would translate to a civilian workplace.Also, be warned that many employers are hesitant to hire veterans, and this may make it difficult for you to get a job when you leave the military., The amount you'll get is based on the amount of time you spend on active duty,so you may have to extend an initial four-year contract beyond that to ensure your education is paid for.


Talk to a counselor or recruiter about what tuition assistance is available from that branch of the military, and how long you'd have to serve to have your education paid for.

, When you join the military, you sign a contract that dictates the number of years you have to serve. Many first-term contracts are six years long,and during this time you might:


Be deployed to a foreign country
Have to fight and kill
Have to risk your lifeSuffer psychologically, including from things like post-traumatic stress disorder

Prepare what you'll say.,
Anticipate how your parents will react.,
Pick the right time to have the conversation.",How to Tell Your Parents That You Are Pregnant1," Though your parents will be overwhelmed by your news no matter what, you can ease the blow by sounding as articulate and mature as possible when you tell them. Here are some things to think about:Prepare your opening. Don't scare your parents by saying, ""I have some really bad news."" Instead, say, ""I have something very difficult to tell you.""
Prepare how you will explain the pregnancy. Do they know you're having sex, or even that you have a boyfriend?
Prepare how you will share your feelings. Though you will feel upset and may find it difficult to communicate, you should hold off on the tears until the end of the conversation, when they will surely come. You should tell them that you're shocked, and that you are so sorry to have disappointed them (if that's the case), that you're going through the hardest time of your life and that you'd really like their support.
Prepare to answer any questions. Your parents will have a lot of questions for you, so it's best to know what to say so you're not caught off guard.;
, Once you've figured out how to best communicate how you feel and what you'll say, you need to start thinking about how your parents will respond. This will depend on many factors, including how they have reacted to difficult news in the past, if your sexual activity will be a complete shock to them, and what their values are. Here are some things to consider:


Do they know you're sexually active? If you've been having sex for months, or even years, and they don't have the slightest clue, they will be more surprised than if they suspect, or even if they know, that you are having sex.
What are their values? Are they liberal about premarital sex, or do they think you absolutely should not have sex until you are married, or close to being married?
How have they reacted to bad news in the past? Though it's unlikely that you've delivered such dramatic news to them previously, you should consider how they've reacted to disappointing news in the past. How did they react when you told them you failed a class or dented their car?
If your parents have a history of reacting violently, then you should not tell them alone. Find a trusted relative who is more open-minded to join you, or even bring your parents to your doctor or a school counselor to deliver the news.
You can even practice having the conversation with a close friend. If you're pregnant, it's likely that you've told your best friend about it, and she may not only have some insight into how your parents will react, but she could also rehearse the conversation with you so you'll have a better sense of how your folks will react., Though it's important to deliver the news in a timely manner, it's also crucial to pick a good day and time so your parents are as receptive to the news as possible. Here are some things to consider:


Don't be dramatic. If you say, ""I have something incredibly important to tell you guys. When is a good time to talk?"" then your parents will likely want to have the conversation right then and there, and you may not be prepared. Instead, try to be as calm as you can when you say, ""There's something I want to talk to you about. When is a good time to talk?""
Pick a time when your parents can give you their full attention. Pick a time when both of your parents are home and when they're not planning to go out for dinner, to pick up your brother from soccer practice, or to entertain friends later. They should ideally be free after the conversation, so they can take the time to let the news sink in.
Pick a time when your parents are the least likely to be stressed. If your parents are usually very stressed or tired when they get back from work, wait until after dinner, when they've loosened up a bit, to have the conversation. If they seem to always be stressed during the week, talk to them on the weekend. A Saturday may work better than a Sunday, because by Sunday evening, they may already be worried about their work week.
Pick a time that works for you. Though you should pick the best possible time for your parents, don't forget to factor in your own feelings. Pick a time when you're not too exhausted after a long week of school, and when you're not worried about a big exam the next day.
If you want anyone else to be there, pick a time that works for that person too. If you want your significant other to be there, this is a very big decision and you should make sure that this will make the situation more comfortable instead of even more unpleasant.
Don't delay the conversation for too long. Picking an optimal time will help the conversation go as smoothly as possible, but delaying the talk for weeks because everyone is too busy and stressed will only make things worse.

First, confirm that you are actually pregnant.,
Tell someone else you trust first, like a very close friend or a teacher or counselor.

,
Sit down with your mother, and tell her that you need to discuss something very important with her.

,
Tell her that you made a very big mistake and you decided to tell her, make sure you say that you know she won't judge you.

,,,, She might immediately want to know who the father is. Tell her, and don't lie about it. Be completely honest with her.

, If they haven't abused you in the past, they're unlikely to start now.

"
"
Tell them your news.,
Take the time to listen.,
Discuss the next steps.",How to Tell Your Parents That You Are Pregnant2," This is the hardest part of the plan. Though you have prepared what you'll say and have anticipated their reaction, and though you have picked the best time to have the conversation, this will still be one of the toughest conversations of your life.



Relax. Chances are that you've already played out the conversation in your head a thousand times. But what you need to realize is that you're predicting, most likely, is the Worst Case Scenario. Stop. You are 100 times more likely to get a better reaction from your parents than the ones you might be expecting. Relaxing will only make things easier.
Make your parents feel comfortable. Though it's unlikely that you'll have small talk for a while, you can smile, ask them how they are, and reassure them with a pat on the hand before you tell them the news.
Say, ""I have something very difficult to tell you. I'm pregnant."" Say it firmly and with as much strength as possible.
Maintain eye contact and open body language. Look as approachable as you can when you tell them the news.
Tell them how you're feeling. It's likely that they will be so shocked that they won't react right away. Tell them how you're feeling about the pregnancy. Remind them that this has been very tough for you.

, Now that you've told them your news, they will have a strong reaction. Whether they are angry, emotional, confused, hurt, or full of questions, they will need some time for the news to sink in. Take it slow and listen to their side of the story without interrupting.


Reassure them. Though they are the adults, they have just received some big news, and you should try to stay strong for them.
Answer their questions. If you're prepared, then you should be able to answer their questions as honestly and calmly as possible.
Ask them how they feel. If they are shocked into silence, give them some time to gather their thoughts, and then ask them how they are feeling. If they won't share their feelings after you shared yours, it won't be easy to move the conversation forward.
Don't get angry if they get angry. Remember, they just found out some life-changing news.

, Once your news is out in the open and you and your parents have discussed your feelings as well as their feelings, it will be time to figure out what to do about your pregnancy. If there is a difference of opinions, as there may well be, then this may be more difficult. But remember that you should feel relieved now that the news is out in the open and that you can work through it together.


You may not be able to discuss the next steps immediately in the conversation. Your parents may need some time to cool down, and you may both need some time to get a hold of your emotions.
Remember that though this crisis is probably the toughest thing you have gone through, that you and your family will grow stronger by working out the problem together.

Assess your personality.,
Consider the ways in which you can change your approach before expecting others to change.,
If you have been behaving badly, slowly but surely behave in a better way.,
Carefully convince your parents to give you more attention.,
Start your conversation off positively.,
Coax yourself into expressing your feelings about the undivided attention they are giving your sibling.,
Consider that there may be a need to be sympathetic to your parents, especially if you're the eldest.,
Try to be more open with your parents.",How to Tell a Parent That You Feel Neglected Due to Their Attention to Your Sibling," Have you done things to cause your parents to feel uncomfortable or annoyed around you? For example, lacking manners, snapping at your parents and hassling them out a lot can lead to being ignored or treated differently at times.;
, Indeed, simply changing how you act toward your parents may be sufficient to get you the attention you deserve, and to restore the sought after balance between you and your sibling. For example:


Ask your parents questions starting with ""May I?"" rather than ""Can I?""
Always say ""please"" and ""thank you"".
Never be rude. This means, always use your manners, never hit or kick others, communicate in a calm and constructive ways, etc.

, If you change too quickly, your parent will think that something is wrong or that you're after something more than behavioral change. Don't be a goodie-two-shoes overnight. In short, become an individual that deserves good notice but slowly doing things nicely and calmly around the house.

, Your sibling can't have the attention forever. Find a time when your parents aren't with your sibling. Get them together in a room when everyone is calm and ready to listen.

, Begin with some compliments, such as: ""Your hair looks nice today, Mom!"" You could also share good news about what's happening to your life.

, Be sure to confess you feel jealous and feel neglected.


You could say something like: ""Mom (or Dad), I think you have been paying too much attention to X and that it is very unfair. I would appreciate it if you show me as much attention as you give my brother/sister"".
Explain to your parents how you feel about your siblings.
Tell your parents why you have the impression that they don't love you as mush as they love your sibling. Always state things from your position, so that they can see how you're feeling. Do not blame them or tell them off; it's possible that they don't even realize what they're doing to you.

, They just want to have a little time with the younger kids, maybe because you've grown up and they feel like they don't know how to talk to you.

, Talk with them about your daily activities (at school/during a visit to somewhere/about your school, friends etc). This will give them cause to believe you and you can gain their trust.

Go to your safe place.",How to Tell Your Mom You Are Bisexual," You may be processing many different emotions. Writing out your ideas, feelings, beliefs, and sexuality may help you organize your thoughts before your conversation. Try answering the following questions to help you iron out what you feel and how you want to approach your mom:


How comfortable are you with your sexuality? Are you still coming to terms with it? Are you still questioning your bisexuality, or are you secure with it? Do you think your mom can help support you emotionally? How so?How do you feel about coming out to your mom? Are you scared, anxious, or worried at all? If so, why?
Do you want your mom to know about your romantic life? Do you feel comfortable telling her if you have a partner of the same gender? Do you feel as though your love life is none of her business?;
, Serious conversations are best done face to face, but if you live far away from your mother, this may be difficult. Consider the best way to break the news to your mom. Take her feelings into consideration. How might she want to deal with this news?


A phone or video call can make this big conversation more personal and intimate. Choose a time when you know your mom is not busy. Just before or after dinner time is usually a good time.
If you are worried about your mom's reaction or if you think that it will be too difficult to say what you want to say, you can write a letter or email to your mom. Write the same things that you would say in person.
If you can, try to meet her in person to tell her.

, Before you have the talk with your mother, you may find it helpful to practice. Ask a friend to pretend to be your mother. If you do not feel comfortable discussing your sexuality with anyone, you can talk to yourself in a mirror. Practice starting the conversation, and rehearse what you want to say to your mom.


If you're writing a letter, you can ask someone to read over it and give you advice. If this is too personal, however, you can just send it to your mother.

, There are many LGBT groups that provide mental and emotional support as you prepare to tell your parents. Others who have come out can tell you their stories, and they may be able to prepare you for the talk.You can look for local chapters of:


A campus or school LGBT group
GLAAD
The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Center
Human Rights Campaign
Gay Straight Alliance

, While you cannot predict exactly how your mom might react, you may be able to mentally plan for different outcomes. Think about your mom’s beliefs towards bisexual people. You can ask yourself:


Doe she agree with bisexuality? Do you think she will be accepting or angry about you coming out?
Is she familiar with what bisexuality is? Will she be confused by your coming out?
Do you think she will dismiss or ignore your feelings?
Does she have religious or moral beliefs that disagree with bisexuality?
If you are financially dependent on your parents and you believe that there is a real risk they will throw you out, you may want to consider waiting to tell your mom until you are independent. This includes situations where you no longer live with your parents but rely on them for tuition, rent, or other living costs., Bisexual people can be successful and happy people, just like people of all other orientations. They make up a valuable and lovable part of the world. Bisexuality is more common than you'd think, and it's as valid as any other orientation. No matter how your mom reacts, you can be a successful and valuable member of society.

, If you are having this conversation with your mother in person, you should find a safe place where you can escape if things go poorly. This should be a place where you can stay for a few days if you need to. Ask a friend if you can stay over at their place. You might also contact your local LGBT support group, and see if any of the members are willing to take you in if things take a turn for the worse.


You may want to pack a bag ahead of time. You can even leave it at the safe place before you have the talk if you are very worried.
If you are in crisis before or after the talk, you can call the Trevor Project helpline at 1-866-488-7386., You do not want your mom to be busy or stressed when you speak to her, nor do you want to be rushed during your talk. Pick a time when the two of you can be alone. Do not choose a busy time or celebration such as a birthday party, holiday dinner, funeral, or family reunion.Some good times might include:


At dinner
During chores
On a day off
During a long car ride

, If you're unsure if she'll be accepting, you can ease her into the subject. You might bring up a book or movie where the character was bisexual, and see how she reacts. If there is a news article about the LGBT community, you can read it to her and ask her what she thinks about it. This can help you figure out how accepting your mom will be of your sexual orientation.You can say, “I was reading this piece about LGBT organizations. They say that people are being bullied for being bisexual. What do you think?”
If your mother uses homophobic slurs or reacts with anger against LGBT people, you may want to reconsider coming out to her. Evaluate your safety before continuing the conversation.If your mom demonstrates support of LGBT people, this may be a good time to tell her.

, When starting the conversation, use a gentle but relaxed tone. If you sound somber or scared, your mom might think that you are telling her bad news, and she will react accordingly.Let her know that you want to talk, and ask her if she has a few minutes to discuss something with you.


You can say, “I want to tell you something about myself. For a while I’ve been thinking about my sexuality, and I’ve realized that I’m bisexual.”
You might also say, “Can we talk? There’s something I need to tell you.""
If you are doing this over the phone, make sure that she is at home or in a private place where she can have a potentially long conversation. You might want to say, ""Hey mom, do you have a few minutes to talk about something?"" If she is busy, say, ""I'll call you later then. Everything is fine; I just need to talk.""

, Your mother may not understand why you need to have such a serious conversation. She may brush off your concerns or try to end the conversation early. In some rare cases, she might think that you are trying to hurt her personally by telling her this. Even if she reacts lovingly, she may still be uncertain about why you need to have this talk. You might want to tell her:


""I don’t want to feel like I’m keeping secrets from you. You know me better than anyone, and I want you to know this too.""
""I know this may not seem like a big deal, but not telling you would make it one!""
""I know you care about me, but I'm scared of being rejected by my family. I need to know that you accept me and love me as I am.""
If you are struggling with your sexuality or if you are being bullied, you should let your mother know. State, “This is part of who I am, and I understand that. But others do not accept me, and that is difficult. I hope you can support me, Mom, because I love you, and I need your help right now.”

, Not everyone knows what it means to be bisexual. Some people may believe that you can only be gay or straight. If your mom has questions, it may not mean that she is doubting you. She just may be confused and trying to come to terms with what you are telling her.If you mom asks what bisexuality is, you can say, “I’m attracted to both men and women.”She may ask if you’re gay or straight. You can say, “Neither. I’m attracted to both genders.” You might explain that sexuality exists on a spectrum.
If your mom asks if bisexuality is the same thing as polyamory or having multiple partners, you should say, “No. It’s different. I can be bisexual and still only have one partner.”, Some people may respond to your bisexuality by trying to tell you that you’re “going through a phase” or that you are uncertain and experimenting with your sexuality. If your mom says the same things, you will have to assert that you are sure about your sexuality. You can say: “I understand why you might think that, but this is a real thing. I am bisexual, and it is not going to change.”
“I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. I’m not experimenting. I’m just attracted to both genders.”

, Your mom may have questions for you regarding your sexuality and relationships. How you answer these questions is up to you. Do not feel pressured to tell your mom about any relationships or sexual partners if you do not want to share. If you do answer her questions, try to avoid becoming defensive. In a calm voice, simply state how you feel.


If she asks if you are being safe in your relationships, you might want to reassure her by saying, “Yes. I’m using the same protection in all of my relationships.”
If you do not want to tell her about past or current partners, you can say something general and vague, such as, “I have had relationships with different people” or “I’m not telling you I have a boyfriend or girlfriend. I just want you to know what I’m feeling.”
If you are currently seeing a same-gender partner, you might say something like, “Yes, I am seeing someone. And yes, they’re the same gender as I am.”
Your mom may think that your bisexuality means that you will not have children. If you do want kids someday, you can say, “I can still have children. Either I’ll do it the traditional way, or I can adopt. I can even do in vitro fertilization.”

, Your mom may be concerned about your mental health or welfare. The most important thing you can tell her is that you’re secure and satisfied with your sexuality. Let her know that coming out to her makes you happy and that you hope she can accept you.You can say, “I know this might be difficult to hear. It was difficult for me to say. But it’s who I am, and I’m so happy that I can finally accept this part of me.”
You might also say, “The moment I accepted that I was bisexual, I felt as though a burden was lifted. I feel so much more comfortable with my identity now.”

, Some parents are more accepting than others. Some will want to get a rainbow cake to celebrate you coming out. Others will smile and say ""okay"" and nothing more. Some may respond with sadness or anger. Try to get a sense of how your mom is feeling so that you can respond positively.


Sometimes the reason that parents seem angry, worried or upset is that they only want the best life for their child. Typically, members of the LGBT community have a harder time because of ignorance and bullying.You can say, “I don't look forward to discrimination, but it would hurt me even more to hide who I am. I don’t want to keep secrets from my own family.”
Your mom may act distant or dismissive at first. This does not necessarily mean that she is not accepting of your sexuality. She may be surprised, startled, confused, or uncertain how to act. It’s possible that once she's had time to absorb the information, she'll show you more love and acceptance.
If your mom reacts well, she may want to start an entire talk on your sexuality. If this makes you uncomfortable, let her know. You can say, “Thanks for looking out for me, Mom. I’m so happy you’re accepting. I just don’t think I’m ready to start talking about my love life yet.”
If your mom reacts angrily, you can try to calmly tell her, “I know this is upsetting, but this is who I am, and it’s not going to change.” If she threatens you, find your way to a safe place.

, You should direct your mom to a book, website, or community organization that gives her information and support on bisexuality. Your mom may need someone to help talk her through your sexuality. If your mom is worried about your safety or mental health, these resources can help her support you in a healthy way.


The Parents and Friends of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Persons (PFLAG) is a great place to start for your mom. She can find other parents of bisexual people to get the support you both may need.If your mom is Catholic, Dignity USA can help her reconcile her faith with your sexuality.Other Christians can find support through the Gay Christian Network.If your mom is Muslim, you might contact Muslims for Progressive Values for support., Your mom may not be sure how to react right away, especially if the revelation came as a surprise to her. Allow her to take some time and space to think over what you told her. You might want to revisit the topic in a week or two.You can say, “If you need some time to process this, I understand. Please let me know when you are ready to talk.”

, If your mom reacted badly, take some quiet time to calm yourself and re-affirm your identity. Try listening to comforting music, texting an accepting friend, or venting on an LGBT-friendly forum.


You can tell her, “Maybe we need some space from each other until we can both calm down.”
If she criticizes you, say ""I'm hurt that you cannot accept my sexuality, and I need some space to cope with my feelings right now. Let's talk later.""

, Your mother may try to convince you that you are not bisexual or that bisexuality does exist. She may think that bisexuality is a sin or that it is morally wrong. If she becomes angry, you should stand firm.


You can say, “I did not choose to be bisexual. This is not something you can change. It is who I am, whether you like it or not.”
You might want to tell your mother, “I am who I am. I'm still your child, and I still love you. That won't change either.”

, If your mom threatens you or kicks you out, you will need to go to your safe place. If you do not have a ride, call a friend or a taxi to take you there. Take what you can, and do not return to the house until your mom is ready to talk.


If you believe your mother is going to physically harm you, separate yourself from your mom, and call the police.
If you are afraid of your mom, do not return to her home unless you have a friend accompanying you. You can also ask a family counselor or social worker to mediate the conflict.
If your mom pays for tuition or living costs, she may try to cut you off. Give her a day or two to cool off. In the meantime, make sure that what money you do have is in a safe location where she cannot access it. Consider what options you will have if she does cut you off. For example, you might look into loans to pay for college or take a part time job.
If you are financially independent, your mom may try to cut off contact. If you want to maintain a relationship with your mom, give her a week to sort out her feelings before you try calling her. If she does not respond, try writing her a letter or email.

Find a time where you can talk to your dad in private.,
Remember that your dad knows what menstrual cycles are.,
Prepare what you want to say to him.,
Plan to ask your dad for help in getting the supplies you need, if necessary.,
Remain calm.,
Tell your dad the news when you are able to have the conversation with him.,
Suggest that you come up with a code word for your period.,
Thank your dad for supporting you and taking care of you.",How to Tell Your Dad You Got Your Period1," You likely know his schedule pretty well, so you should know when he will be home from work and will have time to talk to you.


Ask him if you can talk to him about something important at that time: “Dad, can we talk about something important after dinner?”
If he tells you that it is not a good time, ask him to tell you when he will have time to talk to you for a couple of minutes.;
, Even if your mom is not present, your dad has at least a basic understanding of menstrual cycles.


He might have learned about it in school.
He will probably have some knowledge about it due to living with his own mom, sisters, and aunts, as well as any other women in your family, like your mom or sisters.

, If you are your dad's first daughter, he might not be expecting you to start your period. It would be best to not ambush him with this news, as that will make the conversation awkward. Be clear in what you are talking about, but ease into the conversation.


“Dad, I need you to know about a change in my life. I've started my period.”
“Dad, I want to be honest with you about what's going on with me. You need to know that my period started.”
“I don't want this to be too awkward, but I started my period.”
“I know this is a little bit uncomfortable, but my monthly cycle started.”

, If your mom is not available, for some reason, then your dad will be responsible for helping you get the supplies you need.


“Can you take me to the store to get feminine products?”
“Would you mind giving me money so that I can go buy pads?”
“Do you mind picking up pads/tampons for me the next time you're at the store?”
“I've been experiencing cramps, so I think I need a pain reliever.”
“I've got a headache, and I need pain reliever to help with that.”

, It does feel scary or nerve-wracking, but if you stay calm, then your dad will stay calm, too.



Take deep breaths and focus yourself.
Do not give your dad any reason to believe that something is wrong. Getting your period is natural and expected, so you do not want to scare your dad into thinking that you are ill or injured.

, When the time comes for you to sit down with your dad and tell him, it is important to follow through.


Avoid feeling embarrassed or awkward. He will pick up on those emotions and mirror them, making the situation uncomfortable for both of you. Instead, be confident when telling him.
There is no need to have a long, drawn-out conversation. Tell him what he needs to know, ask for whatever help you need, and bring the conversation to a close., This could make talking about your period less uncomfortable and make it funnier.“Aunt Flow”
“Monthly visitor”
“Red wave/red sea”
“Crimson wave”
""My little friend""

, Your dad wants what is best for you, and he wants to help you stay healthy and happy.“Thanks for understanding and supporting me, Dad.”

Be honest and upfront about your bad grades.,
Propose solutions.",How to Tell Your Mom About a Bad Report Card1," Parents appreciate honesty, especially about something as important as your grades. Avoiding this conversation will make you anxious and will likely frustrate her. Try to have a talk with her shortly after you receive your report card.


Approach her when she is not busy, stressed, or in a bad mood.
Don’t forget, your mom might have access to your grades online. This means she might already know about your bad grades and is waiting for you to approach her.;
, Starting off a conversation with great news is a good tactic. Before you address your bad grades, tell your mom how well you did in other class. You could even explain why you performed so well in these courses. Alternatively, you could let your mom know that you cleaned your room, mowed the lawn, or made a sports team.


For example, you might say: “Mom, I ended up with an A in English! I connected really well with the material and my teacher” or ""Mom, I know you've been really busy, so I picked up the kitchen and cleaned the bathrooms for you."", Once you’ve softened the blow with your success, let your mom know about the classes you performed poorly in. In addition to telling her the letter grade, explain why you did poorly in the class.


For example, you might say: “While I did great in English, I struggled this semester in my math class. My final grade was a D+. I did great on the homework and in-class assignments, but the tests were overwhelming. My teacher did not offer retakes.”
Avoid making excuses., Even though you can’t change your final grade, you want to demonstrate to your mom that you will try harder next time. Potential solutions include:


Retaking the course with a different instructor
Hiring a tutor
Attending summer school or a credit recovery program
Managing your time better

It's possible that he learned about it in school.
He might have some knowledge about it from women in his life, like his mom, sisters, aunts, and so forth.

, Some people communicate better in writing than in speaking, so use that to your advantage. Come up with an outline of what you want to tell him.


“Dad, you should know that I started my period.”
“There's been a change in my life lately, and it's that I got my period.”
“I felt uncomfortable telling you in person, and this feels easier to me.”
“I was afraid it would get too awkward if I told you in person.”
“I need feminine products, so can we go to the store?”
“Can you give me money to buy pads?”

, If you chose a small notecard for your note, it probably has an envelope. Otherwise, you can fold up your paper and slide it into a mailing envelope.


You can seal the envelope by licking it yourself, or you can use an envelope moistener or a damp sponge.
On the front of the envelope, address is to your dad by writing, “Dad,” “Daddy,” or “Father.”

, Consider rooms in the house your dad frequently visits or items he frequently uses, such as his briefcase or laptop bag.


Avoid leaving your note in a public place where someone else might pick it up.
Leave your note where he will see it, such as on a counter near a gadget he often uses, inside his briefcase, or on his desk.

, If your dad does not approach you about the note, it is a good idea to ask him in a day or so if he read it. (Be sure to ask him in person). This way, you can know that he knows that you got your period and can help you get supplies.


Be confident when you follow up with him. Ask him, “Did you get my note?” and let him know that you need to go to the store, if that is the case.

Write a letter.,
Give the letter and report card to your mom.,
Have a follow-up conversation with her.",How to Tell Your Mom About a Bad Report Card2," If you are extremely nervous or struggle with confrontation, consider writing a letter to your mom. Writing a letter allows you to collect, organize, and revise your thoughts before the other person reads them. In the letter, guide your mom through the highs and lows of your report card. Discuss your good grades and tell her what courses you got poor marks in. You should explain why you did poorly in those courses and how you intend to do better next semester.


For example, you might write: “Dear Mom, My report card came in the mail today. I aced Gym, Chemistry, and Algebra II. My English grade was better than I expected—I ended up with a B-! I didn't do so well in U.S. History. My final grade was a C-. I studied really hard for the tests and the final, but I have a very hard time writing timed essays. Love, Jordan.”, Stuff an envelope with your letter and report card. Hand the envelope to your mom and step out of the room so she can read it.


Alternatively, you can leave the letter for her on a table or countertop.

, After your mom has read your note, it is likely that she will want to talk to you about it. Don’t panic—she already knows your secret! As you talk to her, remain calm. Express that you value your education and want to improve as a student."
"
Keep track of your grades.,
Give your mom regular grade updates.,
Talk to a teacher or trusted adult.",How to Tell Your Mom About a Bad Report Card3," Throughout the semester, check your grades at least once every week. This will allow you to identify potential problems before your final report card is issued. When you notice your grade starting to slip, be proactive. Ask your teacher if you can retake the test, do extra-credit, or turn in late/missing work.


If you don’t have access to a computer or the internet, ask your teachers for a grade update each week.

, In addition to checking your grades consistently, you should also update your mom on a regular basis. Let her know how you are doing in your courses. When you ace a test, share that with her; when you bomb an assignment, let her know you are struggling. If you keep your mom informed about your grades, your final grades won’t shock her., Every parent reacts differently to their child’s bad report card. Some are caring and understanding, while others resort to physical violence. If you are afraid that your mom will react negatively, please confide in a teacher, principal, or trusted adult.

Don’t give up.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Anxiety Disorder," It can be hard to talk about an illness like anxiety disorder. You might be afraid that your family will judge you or become uncomfortable and not know how to act around you. Still, it’s worth it to talk even if you’re not sure how your family will react. Ask to have a talk with someone, whether it’s your dad and mom, siblings, other relatives.Your family will probably have already realized that something is amiss. They may want to do something to help you, but not know exactly what is wrong. Having a serious conversation will give them a better chance to assist you.
Start with asking to sit down and talk. You don’t have to say anything specific at this point, but only indicate your desire for a conversation. Say, for instance, “Hi Dad, do you have some time to talk later? There’s something I have to say.” Or, “Mom, can we talk later today? I want to talk about something important.”
The right moment to break the ice could come naturally. Your parents might see you have an anxiety attack and ask you afterward, “What’s going on? Is everything OK?” Use this opportunity to raise the topic.;
, Your family may realize something is wrong, but don’t assume that they do. People are often busy and caught up in their own lives. That said, it’s best to bring up the subject when there is plenty of time. Choose a moment when your family is at home, relaxed, and at leisure—after work or dinner, for example.Talk when you’re feeling well and ready. You also shouldn’t rush an important conversation like this. Make sure that you have a good block of time (probably an hour or more) and to approach your family when they are free and won’t need to rush off.
Pick a quiet and private place, ideally at home, so you can speak openly and honestly without being self-conscious.
If it’s an emergency, however, act immediately. Say that it’s urgent and you need to talk.

, You might find that the idea of talking about your anxiety triggers more anxiety for you. In that case, think about writing an open letter to your family members. You can include all the same information and can either read it aloud or ask them to read it privately, leaving the chance for a later face-to-face conversation.


Your letter can be as short or as long as you’d like it to be. Make sure to express the main point, though, i.e. “Mom, I’ve been having trouble managing my stress and anxiety. Sometimes I get panic attacks.” Or, ""You might have noticed that I have odd routines, Dad. I keep thinking that, without them, something terrible will happen.”
Leave the letter where your family will find it, like on the coffee table, the kitchen table, or the mantle. Or, bring it along to the talk to read aloud. Say something like “I wrote down a few words that I’d like you to hear.”

, Explaining a mental illness like anxiety disorder is challenging and you might not know what to say, initially. “Process talk” simply means talking about talking rather than sharing information. It’s a technique that will help you put your thoughts in order, and also ask your family for patience.For instance, say something like “I’m not sure how to talk about this, but can you please listen to me and try to understand? I’m hoping to feel better after talking about it with somebody.”
You might also try “I don’t know if this makes sense and I feel uncomfortable talking about it, but I want to tell someone. Can you listen to me and not laugh or make a joke out of it?”

, Remember that your family will want to help you but may not fully understand what’s going on. Having a serious anxiety disorder is hard and isolating. But you’ll feel better with loved ones to support you. Explain how you feel and begin to open up about your problem.Be clear about what is going on, i.e. “I’ve been having episodes lately where I feel overwhelmed. I panic, get afraid, and feel like I can’t breathe. It’s happening more and more often.” Or, “I feel like I have to follow these routines and rituals. I can’t explain why. I just feel terrified at what might happen if I don’t.”
Name the disorder. Your family needs to know what you’re struggling with and that it is a recognized condition. You might say, “I think this is social anxiety disorder, Dad” or “I feel like I may have obsessive-compulsive behavior disorder.”

, Your loved ones might also not know much about anxiety or even about mental illnesses. They may not react well or deny there is a problem, thinking you can just “snap out of it.” It will help them understand the problem you’re facing if you can offer concrete examples of how anxiety is affecting your life – and the fact that it’s serious. Focus on events that have occurred or the impact they’ve made on you.For example, you could say something like “I’ve been having trouble coping with stress at school. I feel so overwhelmed that I’ve started to skip class sometimes.”
Or, “I can’t stop thinking about germs and always feel dirty. Some days I wash my hands 20 or 30 times, so much that they’re raw.”
You don’t have to share everything, of course. But don’t sugar coat the situation to spare your loved ones. Be very clear that anxiety is preventing you from living a normal and healthy life.

, Don’t get drawn into trying to analyze or explain why you feel the way you do. Just say, bluntly, that you want to get better and need others to help you do so. Again, you don’t need to go into detail. Just focus on the most important part: you want and need help.You can say something like “I just want to feel like myself again and learn ways to control my anxiety. Can you help me find a counselor or a therapist?”
Your family might say that what you’ve described doesn’t sound abnormal, or is a stage, or isn’t that worrisome. If that happens, tell them that you are sure it isn’t, i.e. “No, Dad, I’m pretty sure that this is a serious problem.”

, Tell your loved ones how they can help. This might be assisting you with locating a professional like a therapist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist, but it might be in other ways. Loved ones can contribute by assisting you with everyday tasks, encouraging you to eat well, get exercise, and socialize, or offering moral support.Ask them to help you find treatment, i.e. “I’m afraid to make an appointment, but I know I should see a doctor. Can you help me find someone and follow through?” You might also ask them to take you to appointments and make sure that you attend any support groups.
You might also ask for day-to-day support, i.e. “I need you to be there and to encourage me. Can you make sure that I’m getting out?” Or, “I just would appreciate your love and a hug once in a while.”

, Chances are that your family will reach out and want to know how to help you. Still, you should expect to field questions. Just be patient and answer as best you can, remembering that the more your loved ones know, the better they can support you and your recovery.One question you may get is, “What’s causing this?” They may also want to know how long you’ve been having severe anxiety. The exact cause of anxiety disorder isn’t usually clear, but try to answer as honestly as possible.
Your loved ones may also be worried that the anxiety is related to something they said or did. Reassure them that it’s not their fault.

, Keep at it even if it takes your loved ones a while to accept your anxiety disorder or to believe it. Repeat yourself. Raise the topic again and reiterate your desire to get help, if you feel your family is brushing you off. Stress that you think the problem is serious and interfering with your daily life. Treatment is important enough to ask as many times as need be.Repeat yourself as often as necessary. For example, you could say, “Mom, I really think that something is seriously wrong. I want to see someone.” Stress that your situation is not just everyday fear: i.e. “No, Dad, this is different. I feel immobilized by this anxiety.”
Talk to another trusted adult if your family is not able or willing to help. Think about other people you can confide in—like teachers, mentors, counselors, friends, or coaches—and let them know what you’re going through. Tell someone that you trust, who will listen to you, and who will respect your privacy.

Talking when your mother is busy or stressed will only make an uncomfortable situation more stressful.Choose a time with no external time constraints. If you're telling your mother something private or embarrassing, you want to make sure the two of you can talk out the issue for as long as necessary.
You should also pick a time when you and your mom are generally not stressed. You don't want to talk to her about something embarrassing or awkward when you're already in a bad mood. If you both tend to have down time Saturday, this may be a good time to talk as you'll both be relaxed.;
, If you're talking something private over with a parent, there is likely to be some embarrassment. This is normal. It will be easier to go into the situation if you expect you're going to be embarrassed.Do not try to talk yourself out of feeling embarrassed or awkward. This is only likely to make you focus on these feelings more.
Instead, accept that you'll feel embarrassed but remind yourself why you want to talk things out. For example, you may want to talk to your mom about something like sex or dating. While raising the topic is difficult, your mom can give you valuable advice on the topic as she's older and more experienced.

, You should not go into the conversation without some idea of what you want. If you're telling your mother something private, you're doing so for a reason. Think about why you want to talk this over with your mom. Knowing what you want can also help you better direct the conversation.You may just want your mom to listen. If you're going through an embarrassing personal problem, you may just want to vent to someone. If this is the case, you can let your mom know you don't want advice or guidance.
However, you may want advice about something. Think about whether or not your mom's input would be helpful. If you want advice, you can ask for it directly. For example, ""Mom, I need to ask you for advice about something.""

, You may be very nervous approaching your mom. However, one simple sentence can easily get the conversation going. Take a few deep breaths and approach your mom to start talking.Try something simple. For example, ""Mom, do you have a minute? There's something I want to talk to you about.""
If you're nervous your mom will be mad, try to give her a head's up about this. For example, ""Mom, something happened that I think you might be upset about. I need to talk to you about it anyway, even if you end up mad at me.""

, There's no sense hovering around the subject. If you have something important to talk about, bring it up right away without hesitating. Being as direct as possible can help the conversation start off in an open, honest place.Provide your mother with everything she needs to understand the situation. Avoid hinting at anything.
For example, start off with a clear, direct statement like, ""Mom, I've been seeing Joe for awhile now and he wants to have sex for the first time. I'm not sure I'm ready, but he keeps pushing me. I don't really know what to do.""

, You may not necessarily want guidance. However, it's a parents' job to offer a child guidance. Even if you disagree with your mom, try to let her share her opinion without interrupting.Try to understand your mom's point of view. If you're feeling frustrated with her, pause and try to step into her shoes. Consider why your mom may feel the way she does about a situation.
For example, you're telling your mom a friend of yours has been experimenting with drugs. Your mom has a very negative reaction. While you may feel your mother is being judgmental, maybe she had a friend develop a serious drug problem in high school. This may be why she's having such a negative reaction.

, If you're sharing something private, there's always a chance your mother may not react the way you want. She may be upset, worried, or even angry. However, despite your mother's reaction, try to stay calm. You do not want the situation to turn into an argument, as this will not help the two of you work things out.Remember basic manners. Do not interrupt or raise your voice.
Always acknowledge you heard what your mom said, even if you didn't like it. For example, ""I understand you think Audrey's a bad influence, but I really care about her as a friend.""

, You never want to let a discussion turn into an argument. Even if your mom reacts negatively, refrain from arguing with her. Keep your tone calm and respectful throughout the conversation, even if you feel like your mom is being unfair.If you feel like you're losing your temper, it's okay to take a break. Say something like, ""I feel like we're not getting anywhere. Can we take a break and talk about this later?""
You can then do something to get rid of your anger, like go for a walk or vent to a friend.

, Your mom may not react the way you wanted. She may get angry about the subject, or even punish you or make a new rule regarding your behavior. If your mother has a negative reaction, try to cope with it effectively.If your mom is lecturing you or talking to you in a way that is not helpful, let her know. Say something like, ""I really don't need advice. I just wanted to talk.""
If your mom makes a rule for your behavior (i.e., ""I don't want you hanging out with Krista anymore."") accept the rule for now. You can talk to your mom again once she's calmed down. Being argumentative may just make your mom double down on the rule., You may want your mom's advice. This may be why you're raising the conversation to begin with. If you want guidance, ask for it after telling your mom about the topic. Say something like, ""I just really wanted your advice because I'm not sure what to do.""Remember, just because someone offers advice doesn't mean you have to take it. However, it can be helpful to just listen to and consider your mom's point of view.

, Some subjects may be too tricky to introduce to your mom. If your mom reacts very negatively and does not want to talk about it, reach out to another adult.You can talk to another parent, an aunt or uncle, an older sibling, or a friend's parent.

Don’t feel worried, anxious, or embarrassed as your parents are meant to be there for you always. They may also know more than you think., With proper planning and communication, you will be able to have the conversation that you’re looking for. Your parents get worried because they care about you and want the best for you. With that in mind, they will be happy that you are seeking their advice for a problem., Any problems or awkwardness won’t simply go away if you avoid having a conversation with your parents. Relieve the stress by getting it out in the open. Knowing that your parents are trying to understand you and solve any problems can help alleviate your stress and anxiety., Do you want to talk to both your parents or is it something mom is better suited to handle? Your relationship with each parent is going to be different so ask yourself what will be the most appropriate course of action.Some topics might be easier to discuss with one parent over the other, one parent might be calmer while the other is quicker to anger. In this case, it may be best to talk to your calmer parent first and then talk to the other parent together.
Know that your parents are most likely going to tell each other about a conversation you have no matter if you only tell one of them. It’s best to include both in your conversation but smart to enlist the help of one to talk to the other if you feel that’s the best course of action. For example, you don’t want to alienate your dad by only telling your mom about a school bully. Ask your mom if you can talk to your dad together because you’re scared he will get angry at you for not standing up and fighting.

, Find out your parents’ schedule so you know when a good time to chat will be. You don’t want your parents to be distracted thinking about a meeting or having to prepare dinner. The location of your conversation is also important as you may not want any distractions like tv or your parents’ coworkers chiming in., While you may know what you want out of the conversation, there could be several different answers your parents give you. Plan for everything. Ideally, you want the conversation to go your way but it’s okay if it doesn’t. You are never alone as there are numerous resources including teachers and other responsible adults.


If the outcome is not what you desired, you can try several things:

Talk to your parents again. Perhaps you caught them at a bad time. If they are already having a bad day they might not be in the best frame of mind to discuss your situation with an open mind. For example, don’t ask them if you can go to the school dance after you just made them late for your sister’s dance recital.
Drop it. There’s no sense in infuriating your parents and ruining your chance at getting what you want anytime in the near future. If you have had a respectful and open conversation and both sides have pleaded their case, accept that your parent’s point of view. Showing them that you are mature enough to respect their perspective will help your case in the future as they will be more receptive to what you have to say knowing that you are able to keep your emotions in check.
Seek outside support. Enlist the help of your grandparents, your friends' parents, or teachers to help plead your case. Your parents will always be protective of you so asking outside support can convince them that you can handle a situation. For example, you can ask an older sibling tell your parents that they have been to the area that you want to go to and can escort you to the location to make sure it's safe.



, You don’t have to prepare an entire script but it at least gives you a few jumping off points. It will also allow you to organize your thoughts so you can get a sense of how the conversation might go.You can start with saying things similar to, “Dad, I need to tell you something that I’ve been stressed about.” “Mom, do you mind if I talk to you about something?” “Mom, dad, I’ve made a huge mistake and need your help.”

, IF you don’t already have a relationship with your parents where you talk everyday, begin one by talking about little things. If you make it a habit to talk to your parents about anything, it will be easier for them to hear you out. It also builds your relationship stronger.It’s never too late to talk to your parents. Even if you haven’t talked to them in over a year, start with a simple hello. Say something similar to, “I just wanted to let you know what I’ve been up to and chat for a little bit. We haven’t spoken in a while and I’d like to let you know what’s going on in my life.” Your parents will appreciate the gesture and may find it easier to keep the dialogue open.

, If you think a topic is too sensitive or you know that your parents will react harshly, ease into the conversation over a period of time. Ask probing questions to get a sense of their response or to hint at what you want to talk about.For example, if you need to talk to your parents about being sexually active, say something like, “Mom, Lisa has been dating her boyfriend for a year now, it seems really serious. Do you think things can be serious in the 11th grade?” By using your friend to give context to a situation, you can gain a lot of insight into how your parents may react to you. You can pick their brain but be careful not to be too obvious as they may be able to figure out your line of questioning and ask you about your situation.

, It’s impossible to plot out the course of a conversation if you don’t know the destination. Ask yourself what you want the dialogue to accomplish so you know what tools you can use., Clearly let them know what you think, how you feel, and what you want. It’s easy to get nervous and ramble or fumble on your words. Prepare for the conversation to ease your nerves and give detailed examples until you are sure your parents understand what you are saying., Don’t exaggerate or lie. It may be difficult to hide your emotions if the topic is highly sensitive. Speak sincerely and make sure that your parents aren’t dismissing anything you say. If you have lied in the past or are regularly dramatic, it may take time for your parents to believe you but be persistent., Anticipate your parents reaction. Have you talked about related issues? If you know that they will react negatively or disagree, let them know that you understand where they are coming from. If you show that you have their feelings in mind, they may be more likely to be open to your perspective.For example, if your parents are concerned with having a cell phone you can say something like, “Mom, dad, I know that you don’t want me to have a cell phone. I understand that they cost a lot of money, are a lot of responsibility, and you don’t think they’re necessary for kids my age. I know you see the other girls in my grade with their own phones and you think that it’s a waist because they just play games or use Instagram. What if I saved up for a phone and we can use a pay-as-you-go plan to make sure I only use my money? You can also check out the games and apps I download because I just want to use it for times like that time my volleyball game ran late or when you’re on the phone with grandma.”

, Be respectful and mature by using a positive tone. Do not be sarcastic or snarky when you hear things that you don’t agree with. If you speak to your parents as you want to be spoken to, chances are that they will take the conversation seriously., Certain conversations are best had with certain parents. Perhaps you talked to your dad more about school or your mom about dating. Make sure you’re having the right conversation with the right person., Make sure you have your parents full and undivided attention when you talk to them. Avoid public places or when they only have a short time to talk to you. Allow them to be able to digest everything you’re saying and don’t make them feel blind-sided by sneaking in an important conversation at an inappropriate time., Don’t get distracted by trying to think of the next thing that you want to say. Absorb what your parents are saying to you and respond appropriately. It’s easy to dwell on something when you don’t get the response you want immediately.You may even repeat what your parents say to ensure you understood them and to let them know that you’re listening to them carefully.

, You don’t want to have a one sided conversation so ask questions and elaborate if you feel your message isn’t getting across. Do not interrupt or raise your tone. However, if your parents become upset, say something similar to, “I understand you’re upset. I’m not dismissing how you feel but want to be more constructive. Should we talk later”, You probably want the conversation to accomplish one of these things or a combination of a few:Have your parents listen and understand what you’re saying without passing any judgement or offering any commentary.
Have your parents support or receive their permission to do something.
Give you advice or aide.
Provide you with some guidance especially if you’re in trouble.
To be fair and not put you down.

, This may be difficult especially if you need to talk about sex or open up in a way that you never had before. It’s natural to feel awkward or anxious when talking about difficult topics with your parents. Recognize what you are feeling and let your parents know so you can unburden yourself.For example, if you’re worried that you’re parents will be disappointed then let them know immediately. Say something like, “Mom, I know that you had talked about this before and you’ll be disappointed at what I’m about to say but I know that you’ll listen to everything and give me what I’m looking for.”
If your parents are particularly emotional and you expect a very harsh or unsupportive response, let them know that you have taken this into consideration yet have gathered the courage to still approach. Be proactive and diffuse the situation with positivity. “Dad, I know how mad this is going to make you but it’s important to me that I tell you because I know that you love and respect and only get mad because you want the best for me.”

, If your parents are already having a bad day, they may be even more prone to give you a negative response. Unless it is an emergency, wait for an appropriate time to approach your parents. Wait till you feel their mood is receptive and their day is relatively stress free.For example, ask “May we talk or is now not a good time?” Going for a long drive or being out on a walk can be the perfect time; however, if you never find these opportunities you can simply make a good time.
Make sure you know what you want to say ahead of time or write down key points to ensure that you don’t missing anything. You don’t want to get off guard and have your parents initiate a conversation that you aren’t ready for.

, You don’t always get what you want so don’t be stubborn if your parents tell you something that you do not want to hear. If you have made your point respectfully and listen to what they say, they will be more receptive to what you have to say in the next conversation., Sometimes our parents might be dealing with their own set of problems. If one of your parents suffers from addiction or mental health issues, talk to other adults that you trust. Whether it's teachers, relatives, or counselors, there are many resources out there for you to talk to.Before speaking to anyone that you haven’t established a relationship with, put in your research and ask your peers to help you.

, If you choose not to talk to your parents, deal with your issues maturely. Don’t avoid any issues especially if it has to do with your health or safety. If you wanted to speak to your parents about another person, talk to them directly and respectfully."
"
Act like an adult.,
Plan your whole discussion.,
Do your homework.,
Stay calm, be professional, and tell the truth.,
Be direct and come right out with your situation.,
Handle their objections with respect.,
Take their responses gracefully.,
Know when to end the discussion.",How to Discuss Important Issues with Your Parents," Use proper grammar and keep a calm tone of voice. Don't whine. Present yourself as maturely as possible.;
, Go over it again and again in your head. Write down the main points you want to be sure to hit. It still probably won't come out that way when it comes down to it, but at least you'll have an outline to follow. If you want you could make a power point presentation. Your parents might get a kick out of it.

, You know your parents better than anyone. Try to anticipate their reaction to what you say. If you have an idea of how they will react, make sure you already know what you will say in response. This will keep you from getting flustered and saying something that will make things worse.

, As a matter of fact, you will be much more successful if you have a reputation for telling the truth to begin with. Remember, you can't believe a liar, even when s/he's telling the truth. If you gain a reputation for being less than truthful, it will be years before you are thought of as anything but a liar.

, Don't beat around the bush and falter, stammer, stutter, and stumble over yourself. They understand that you have serious situation - you don't ask them to come in and sit down when you just want to spend the night at a friend's house. Take a deep breath, think about what you want to say, and then simply say it. Deal with the aftermath once you've stated the problem or request.

, Your parents love you, and they want the best for you. They have years of experience that you lack. Keep in mind that, if you present an idea to your folks that looks good and sound to them, there will be no objections. It's only when they see trouble ahead that your parents will argue or deny you permission. You must respect their ability to think around ideas more thoroughly than you do. If your parents raise an objection that you cannot immediately counter, ask for time to consider the problem. In turn, they will respect your thoughtful response.

, No matter what you have shared with your parents, they will still love you. Their love does not guarantee that they won't be angry, disappointed, or upset. If you allow them their feelings and give them time to process their initial feelings before allowing things to turn into a huge conflagration, this and all future ""serious talks"" will go better. Know how to handle various situations:


Example 1: You are getting an F in chemistry. You sit your parents down, tell them, and their first reaction is anger, then they ground you for six months. Instead of yelling back and running to your room in tears, then sneaking out of the house anyhow, try talking to them. First, accept their anger - say, ""I don't blame you for being angry, I'm angry and upset, too. But yelling at me and grounding me isn't going to change the F. I need your help."" Tell them that you thought you could handle the class, but it turned out to be harder than you expected. Tell them how upset and embarrassed you are to be failing. Ask if they could help you find a tutor, talk to the teacher to negotiate a way for you to pass (ie, extra work, re-take a test, etc). Approaching the problem this way shows your parents that you care, that you want to handle the problem responsibly, and that you are mature enough to absorb their anger without reflecting it back on them.
Example 2: You and your mom constantly fight, and you want to move in with your dad and his new wife. Expect your mother to cry and be terribly hurt. She feels you are rejecting her (and this may be not that long after she felt your dad rejected her) and choosing someone over her. If you approach it with sensitivity for her situation, you will be more successful. Instead, try saying, ""I hate you, I'm moving in with dad"" is not going to work - your mom probably has court-ordered custody of you and/or your siblings. But saying, ""Mom, I want you to know how much I love you, no matter how much we fight. The thing is, I miss being with Dad every day. I'm not saying this is forever, but I would like to live with him for a while, at least. Can we try it? If it doesn't work out, of course, I'll come home right away. And it might not last that long anyhow - I just want to see how it is with Dad; it would give me a fresh start at a new school, and I might have better prospects than where I'm at right now. Can we at least think about it?"" This reassures your mom as to your feelings for her, and gives her some concrete, objective reasons to think about allowing the move, rather than just having another fight.
Example 3: You are gay and want to come out to your parents. For a more detailed exploration of this, see How To Come Out As a Gay or Lesbian Teen. But generally, anticipate their concern. They will probably be sad - remember, if you're a girl, they've been planning your wedding since the day you were born. If you're a boy, they've been dreaming of all the girls you'd bring home. They will feel sad that they won't have grandchildren (of course, that may not be true - you may give them grandchildren by any number of means these days; in vitro or adoption are two possibilities). You must give them time to grieve the dreams that will not come to pass. Stating your orientation calmly and firmly, and not allowing them to become hysterical is key.

, Don't allow the situation to escalate out of control. If your news has them in a tizzy, remaining calm is crucial - and sometimes that means that you must end the conversation and leave them to their thoughts or to discuss it between themselves. Before you all start saying things that will be difficult to forgive later, instead, say, ""I can see how upset you are. But this isn't going to be productive. Let's agree to disagree for the moment (or, let's not take this further right now) and table it for later, okay? I'm going to go to my room and give you some space to process this whole thing - I know it's a lot to take in. Thanks for listening. We'll talk more later.""

, You do not have to eat junk food to prove it to them just eat normally.

, Explain you have learned about it at school (if you have - or know about it at least) and you understand how dangerous it is.

, If you see a ultra-thin model or celebrity declare ""ugh - she needs to put on some weight, then she'd be really pretty"" or something similar.

, Being more confident and going out enjoying yourself with friends is how your parents expect you to behave and will help them believe that everything is OKAY with you.

, You can also say something similar to: ""I'd better eating more then, can we have my favourite tonight?"" and laugh.

, People who are anorexic don't like to talk about food because it makes them uncomfortable.

, If you are the sort of person who eats lots of junk food then you may be tempted to lie to your parents about what you ate at school (for example). However, if your parents found out that you were lying they may think it's because you are anorexic instead. If they find lots of food hidden in your room then they may think you are bulimic. Be truthful - if they honestly thought you had an eating disorder then will most likely be relieved to find you're actually just a bit greedy.

, If they are so concerned that they want you to go to the doctor about it then don't storm off and argue because they will only think you have something to hide. Instead laugh and agree but ""only to prove you wrong"".

For example, say something like, ""Hey mom, can you pass the peas? By the way, are those new earrings? Speaking of which, can I get a second hole in my ear?"" If you bring it up in passing, it won't seem like as much of a big deal to your parents.;
, Be prepared, because you're probably going to get an eye roll or a straight-up ""no"". Make sure that you expect your parents to say ""no"", so that way you'll have a backup plan. If they do say yes, be happily surprised.

, Just saying ""I want a piercing"" isn't going to get you very far. Explain to your parents why you want a piercing. Point out the fact that you are young now, and need the opportunity to try new things and find out who you really are. Tell them you love the look of them, its very fashionable, you want to try it out before you have to consider dress code for a career, or tell them it's your way of expressing yourself and showing who you really are.

, If your parents just aren't having the whole piercing thing, try to get one of your parents to see your side of the story. You should probably pick the more easy-going parent. Once you've convinced them to see your side of the story, they can help you convince the other parent.

, For example:


""I want to be myself, I don't care what people think of me.""
""I'm growing up, and feel like I need to express myself.""
""This will make me feel like I'm really getting rewarded for the good things I do.""
""I will never wear it when I'm in the house."" - this last one is fine if you aren't required to have them in all the time.

, Look for key words that will help convince your parents about getting pierced. Use words like please, help, will, myself, me, I, free, decorate, personality, express, who I am, etc. Just be careful not to use them too much and get super-repetitive.

, Don't actually use words like 'pierce' too much; use decorate, don't use 'earring'; use ornament, don't use 'like'; use 'love', as if it were your favorite hobby.

, One of the worst and most immature things you could do is say ""But Jane's mum let her have piercings, why can't I?"".

, They will not change their mind if you yell at them. This will show a big lack of maturity.

, Discuss the reasons you want to get multiple piercings and be prepared to have to answer questions such as ""What are the benefits of getting it?"". Make sure to give good, convincing reasons. If your religion is against multiple piercings, then maybe you should stop there.

, Practice what you're going to say right before you ask. If you want, write it down and memorize it, but don't sit there and read off a paper; it looks too rehearsed. Just have a good idea of what you're going to say so that you don't get off-topic or distracted.

, The more you know about the piercings you want, the better. Your parents will see that you know exactly what you want, and will see you are very mature. Also, the more you know about the piercing you want, the more you'll know if you really want it for sure or if it isn't the right piercing for you.

, If you can, find out the price of the piercing you want, save up your money, and offer to pay for it yourself.

, A big worry for parents is having their kids get pierced at unsafe places with uncertified piercers. Look at certified piercers in your area and figure out where you want to get pierced. The cheapest places aren't usually the best option.

, If your parents say no, discuss with them why they aren't comfortable with it, and try to find some middle ground: For example you could have a second hole in each ear instead of a nose ring. If you're mature about it and show that you're willing to consider their concerns, they may be more open to discussion.

, Be very careful of what you say think about it! Don't ask every day. They might say no

Talk to your parents about your grades between report card periods.",How to Talk to a Parent About a Bad Grade on Your Report Card," Depending on your grade, your report card may have information that doesn't fall into the typical A or B in math or science category. Your report card may show social skills or work habits, like pays attention or talks too much. It may also give grades like S, N, or D for satisfactory, needs improvement, or developing.Make sure to ask your teacher to explain any unclear parts of your report card. You want to be able to explain your grades to your parents as knowledgeably as possible.


Know what your grades are based on. Have you only had one test you bombed, or have you had 5 tests this grading period? How many quizzes, tests, and homework assignments are included?You might also want to gather together some of your tests, quizzes, and homework so you can go over them with your parents.
Another thing to think about is what kind of report card this is. Some schools give report cards every 9 weeks to show the student's progress through the semester. These 9 week report card grades are not the ones that will be put down into your records; they can be improved. If your school does semester report cards, the report card you get that lists the grades for the entire semester is important because these are the grades that will go into your records and stay with you. Make sure you understand how your school does report cards and which ones are temporary and permanent.;
, Write down all the reasons you can think of for why you got bad grades in the classes you struggled in. One of the first things your parents might ask you is why this happened, so have an answer ready for your parents. Be honest in your self-evaluation. Some reasons for why you’re not doing well in a class might be:


You sit next to a friend and get easily distracted.
You find the teacher boring and fall asleep in class.
You like to relax or have fun after school instead of doing your homework.
You don’t like the subject matter, so you don’t pay attention.
You understand the material pretty well, but you have test anxiety that drags down your test scores.You’re trying your best and paying attention, but you can’t keep up.
The teacher doesn't prepare you well enough for the quizzes and exams. Are other people struggling in this class, too?

, You’ll probably know that your report card is going to be bad before you get it, so talk to your teachers before report-card day to get your improvement plan under way. Be honest with your teachers about your reasons for struggling in the class.


Ask if there is any extra credit you can earn through extra work.
Ask what they think the problem is with your performance. Teachers have a lot of experience with struggling students; they might be able to see some problems in your performance that you wouldn’t even be able to recognize as problematic.
Ask for advice on how to better understand the material.

, Remember to use all the information and ideas you came up with in your self-evaluation and your conversation with your teacher to figure out how to do better during your next grading period.By approaching your parents with a plan for improvement, you’ll show them that you understand that you made a mistake and, more importantly, that you’re mature enough to take steps to fix the situation. This will likely make them trust you more when you promise to improve your grades. Some ways to improve your grades might be to:


Stay after school for tutoring with the teacher.
Do the extra credit you discussed with your teacher.
Sit somewhere where you can’t see or talk to the friend who distracts you in class.
Make sure you get enough sleep every night and eat a good breakfast that gives you the energy to stay awake all day.Come up with a list of ways that the information covered in this class will be useful to you later in life. You may not want to be a mathematician when you grow up — maybe you want to be a writer. But you still need to get good grades in math to get into college!

, You might be the kind of person who needs to work all in one stretch, so make a schedule where you start homework the second you get home from school, then relax for the rest of the evening. If you’re always burned out by the time school ends, then give yourself an hour or two of break time when you get home from school. Figure out what works best for you.


The important thing is that you start your homework at the same time every single day. Routine is an important part of making studying a part of your life.

, Why are these grades important to you? What do you want to do later in life? Most students want to go to college and get a job. Do you know the kinds of schools you want to apply to or what subject you'd like to study? Knowing the scholastic expectations and what kind of grades you need for your colleges can help you figure out if A's, B's, or C's will suffice.


Report cards aren't just about getting a grade. Report cards should reflect your hard work, improvement, and learning of the subject matter. You want to foster a love of learning, or at the least, an understanding about why learning and hard work is important., Though the impulse may be strong to just hide the report card from your parents, resist the temptation. Hiding your grades will point to your immaturity, while taking responsibility and approaching your parents shows maturity. Your parents may also be madder if you hide it from them, which is something you definitely don't want.


Don't put off telling your parents, either. You don't want them to ask, ""Why are you just telling me about this now!"" or ""Why didn't you tell me as soon as you got the report card?"", Even if you approach a more understanding parent individually at first, eventually you’re going to have to talk to both of them together. By addressing them both in person, you show them that you’re owning up to your mistakes and are willing to have hard discussions with them. This will go a long way toward earning their respect.


Tell them that you have some bad grades before showing them the actual report card. It’s easier to hear something than to see it in black and white, so the shock won’t be as jarring for them.

, When you talk to your parents, explain why you think you did poorly this grading period.This opens up a dialogue between you and your parents. You want to communicate to them that you are aware of your performance and your strengths and weaknesses. Show them the list you made and go through all the reasons together. Have an honest discussion.


Don't provide excuses. Refrain from saying things like, ""My teacher is mean!"" or ""It's not my fault!"" Also, don't lie or deny what the report card says by saying, ""I didn't know I was missing homework"" or ""I didn't know I talked too much in class.""Take responsibility for your actions. This shows your parents you are mature, responsible, and willing to improve.

, Present your parents with the way in which you plan to improve your grades. Explain the reasoning behind your plan and why you think it will work. Write down the plan and give it to your parents so they know the steps you are taking.Ask them for their advice on how you could improve it further.


Explain to your parents that you are not satisfied with your grade. This shows them that you are taking this very seriously.Don't just tell your parents that you are going to do better - show them. Giving them a structured plan of how you aim to improve shows them you are serious about improving.

, Knowing what you and your parents think are good and bad grades and comments can help you face your report cards. This also helps you understand their expectations of you.


At the beginning of each school year, after a bad report card, or whenever you first think about it, you and your parents should get together and discuss what they expect your performance in school to be, what you expect your performance to be, and what you think you can achieve. This puts you and your parents on the same page, and gives you a mental idea of what you want to achieve.
Keep in mind that doing well in school doesn't mean perfect straight A's. Not every student is a straight A student. For some students, their best is B's or even C's. Maybe A's in English is normal for you, but C's in math is an improvement. Strive to be the best you can be, but don't have impossible goals for yourself.Remember that as you move through school, the work will become more challenging. Don't freak out if you start making B's in a class you may have made A's in as you move to middle and high school. If this happens to you, explain to your parents that geometry was easy, but algebra and trig are much more difficult for you. Tell your parents that physical science was easier than chemistry., During your talk with your parents, point out the positive things on your report card. Even if you get some bad grades, it is important to focus on the good things on your report card. Sometimes, this might be difficult, but highlight any of your achievements. Did you get a positive effort comment from your teacher, or perfect attendance?One of the most important things to focus on are any academic achievements or improvements - no matter how small. Did you bring your grade up two points? Did you maintain your B average in science?
Don't let the bad grades erase all the good work you did that is reflected on your report card. Also evaluate your bad grade - are you and your parents unhappy with your C in history? Is that C an improvement over your grade last term? If so, focus on the improvement and vow to keep improving it since you already have!

, Your parents were kids once, too, so don’t assume that they’re going to come down hard on you. They probably remember getting bad report cards themselves, and if this is your first one, ask them to be understanding. Remember, if you talk to them calmly and maturely, you will set a positive example.


Stay polite and respectful, even when you get frustrated. When your parents get your news, they may be shocked and a little angry, but don’t let yourself get defensive or angry in return.
Be willing to take the punishments they throw at you like an adult.

, No report card is the end of the world. There is always room to improve and to better yourself and your grades. Plus, you now have a plan on how to fix the problem! You know how to do better, so promise your parents and yourself that you’ll follow through. Improving your grades should be as much about yourself as it is for your parents.


Don't get so discouraged and upset that you give up. Don't tell your parents, ""I can't improve! I'm a loser! I'm stupid! This is impossible!"" These types of thoughts aren't encouraging to your or your parents. Start by giving yourself small goals if the end goal seems too unattainable. Try saying, ""I will improve my next quiz and test grade by 5 or 10 points."" These small goals will add up to a noticeable larger improvement.

, Do you think that part of the reason you're struggling in class is that the teacher might be at fault? Be very honest here — don't just blame the teacher if it's really your fault that you're doing poorly in school. Blaming the teacher without a good reason will only get you in hotter water — both at home and at school. However, if you know that many other students in the class are struggling and that the teacher hasn't prepared you well enough to pass his or her exams, let your parents know that your teacher might be part of the problem.


Suggest holding a parent-teacher conference where you are included. Talking to both your teacher and parents not only can help give you motivation and tips on how to improve, but it shows them that you are serious about your achievement.Be thoughtful in how you present this argument. Your parents might assume that you're trying to shift the blame, so give enough evidence to convince them that the teacher might be at least part of the problem.

, Promise that you won’t resent them for helping you stick to your own plan. Some other ways parents can help you study include:


Explaining difficult concepts in their own words. Sometimes teachers and textbooks phrase things in ways that are difficult to grasp. Maybe your parents, who know you and how your brain works, can explain things more clearly.
Helping you make flash cards for yourself.
Quizzing you.
Going over your homework to make sure you didn’t make any errors, and helping you correct those errors.
Giving you extra assignments outside of school to give you more practice on the concepts you’re struggling with.
You need to understand that your parents are very busy, and they may not have as much time to spend on your homework as they’d like to. It’s ultimately your own responsibility to study for school, so be grateful to your parents for any extra help they can give you.

, A private tutor will be specially trained to help you catch up to the rest of your classmates, but they can be pretty expensive. Don't hold it against your parents if they can’t hire one for you.


If a private tutor isn’t an option, consider asking a classmate who’s doing very well in the class to be your tutor. This way, you won’t feel like you’re working alone, and your parents won’t have to spend a bunch of money on a tutor.

, Keeping your parents informed about your grades through the school year eliminates any surprises on the report cards. Show them tests and quizzes when they are returned. Another idea is to take time every weekend to go over the past week's assignments. This keeps you and your parents aware of your progress.


Keeping up with your assignments can also help you to identify any struggles you are having. If you suddenly got a bad grade on a quiz or a test, you and your parents can discuss what might be the problem and figure out how to correct it. This helps you deal with any difficulties you have in school before they become a huge problem.

Choose the right time for the conversation.,
Maintain a mature tone.If you act childishly, you’ll only make your parents think you're not ready to wear makeup.,
Explain that makeup will conceal skin issues.Your skin goes through a lot during your teenage years.,
Describe how a little bit of makeup will boost your self-confidence.,
Explain that makeup will help you express yourself.,
Reason with them about how useful a skill makeup can be.,
Ask them to explain their concerns.,
Start small at first.,
Ask only for age-appropriate makeup.,
Negotiate a deal with your parents.You don't want your parents to think that you want something for nothing.,
Make makeup a bonding experience.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Wear Makeup," Don’t start the makeup conversation when your parents are busy or in a bad mood. Wait until they’re in an open, approachable mood to bring up your desire to start wearing makeup. Make sure they have the time to have a long conversation with you at the time. If you catch them at a bad time more than once, your parents might start to feel like you're nagging them, and that never helps you win an argument!;
, Instead, show how mature and responsible you are. Don't ever raise your voice, and do your best not to let your voice get whiney. If the argument isn't going your way, control your emotions instead of crying or yelling.

, The hormonal changes in your body might cause your skin to break out, and that can be incredibly stressful.Explain to your parents that makeup isn't always about attracting boys. Concealing your skin problems until you grow out of them will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin.

, Research shows that women who view makeup positively feel stronger and more confident in themselves when wearing it.You're at a delicate age, and your self confidence is very important. Without it, you might not make the best decisions for yourself. Your parents want what's best for you, and feeling strong is in your best interest.

, Your parents might think that you want to wear makeup to attract boys. You need to convince them that you want to wear makeup to express yourself, not to fit the mold of what boys like.Just like clothes and hairstyles, makeup tells everyone around you — boys and girls, young and old — something about who you are. This is about sharing something about yourself with the world. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing this for yourself, not for boys.


Makeup is just one aspect of your overall image. Encourage your parents to see it as ‘’part’’ of who you are, not as a defining feature.
You’re at a time in your life when self-expression is very important to you. You’re figuring out who you are! Try to persuade your parents that a little bit of makeup will help you explore your identity.

, Whether right or wrong, society judges women by how they look. Being able to wear makeup properly will help you succeed in the professional world as an adult.Your teenaged years are a time to hone the skills you'll need later. You need to make mistakes like smudging your eyeliner or wearing unflattering colors at a young age, when the stakes are low. You definitely don't want to make them as an adult, when your appearance has more real-world consequences.

, Don't just be willing to hear your parents out — actively ask for their input in the decision. The better you understand why they don't want you to wear makeup, the better you can address their concerns.


""I know why I think makeup will make me feel better. Why do you think it will be bad for me?""
Pay close attention to what they say, and try to answer each of their concerns directly.

, Your parents might be worried that overnight, you're going to change from their little girl to a fully made-up woman. Ease that concern by starting small.


Say that you want to start with only concealer and blush to hide your acne.
You might ask for a little more leeway every year, as you get older. After a year, ask if you can add eye-shadow to your makeup routine, or eye-liner.

, If your parents are worried that you're trying to grow up too fast, they might be right. Think of how silly your mother would look with bright pink lipstick and blue nail polish! She looks good in makeup because she wears makeup appropriate for her age. Explain to your parents that you'll do the same thing.


Ask for lightly tinted lip balms or glosses instead of a deep red, sexy lipstick.
Keep all makeup on your face light and natural-looking. You want to enhance your natural beauty, not change your face. Maybelline Baby Lips is a good tinted lip balm to start out with.

, Be willing to give them something they want in return for your makeup privileges. Some examples might include:


You can only wear makeup as long as you keep your grades up.
You'll take on an extra weekly chore around the house.

, Makeup doesn't have to mean that you're growing up and away from your parents. It can actually bring you closer together! Go to sephora/local makeup store or watch YouTube tutorials with your mom, you could look at products and find out what is acceptable and unacceptable. YouTube tutorials would give clear ideas of what makeup looks are okay and what aren't. Going into the store also allows for an associate to help find products that satisfy your wants and your parents rules.Ask your mother to go shopping with you for the first time so she can teach you how to choose makeup. When you get home, ask her to help you practice applying it.


Get her advice on how to match makeup to your skin color.
Take her advice on what colors she thinks will look good on you.
Make sure to maintain a good attitude the whole time. By making makeup fun for your mom, you increase the odds that she'll let you wear it more often.

Practice with your therapist ahead of time.Before you subject yourself to your loved one’s remarks or questions, it may be useful to practice what you will say with someone supportive, like your therapist.,
Be direct in your explanation.,
Offer resources to inform them about the disorder.,
Be prepared to answer questions and cope with negative reactions.,
Suggest ways they can support you.,
Select someone to serve as a support or mediator.,
Be selective about who you choose to tell.,
Feel comfortable with how much information you share.,
Come to terms with the news on your own.,
Practice self-compassion.,
Educate yourself.,
Understand the significance of social support for treatment.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Psychotic Disorder," Also, rehearse how to respond to questions or negative comments.


Practicing can also help you to feel more comfortable voicing this information aloud. Role-playing different scenarios may even help you decide to whom you will feel most comfortable disclosing.
You may even be able to schedule to meet with your immediate family members, like your parents and siblings, in the presence of your therapist. That way, he or she can help you share news about your diagnosis, and also provide professional answers to any questions your family may have.;
, Remove any emotion or opinions from the conversation and simply explain the condition to the best of your ability and the treatment you are getting for it. This will help you maintain some objectivity in sharing this difficult information and take some of the pressure off.Say something like “I wanted to talk to all of you about something important…An incident happened at my job last month that required me to see a doctor. After getting some tests done, they determined that I have schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a type of thought disorder. I will need to take medications and go to therapy to manage this condition.”

, Providing information from trusted sources—like your therapist, if he or she is present—can help your family gain a better understanding of your psychotic disorder, treatment options, and the general prognosis. Gather books, pamphlets, and websites that give info about your condition and present these resources to your family.Your therapist or mental health provider may have pamphlets that describe your condition in easy-to-understand terms. You may also give a list of reputable websites like PsychCentral, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or the National Institutes of Mental Health.

, Your family will likely have many questions about what’s going on with you. Call on your rehearsals with your therapist in guiding you on how to respond. You may not choose to give every detail about your symptoms or condition. Use discretion and only share what you feel comfortable sharing.


Also, a loved one may react negatively with a comment like “Are you just pretending?” or focus on stigma like “So you’re mentally crazy? What will people think?”
You have a right to set boundaries and tell your loved one how you would prefer them to not use words like “crazy.” You also have the liberty to try to educate this person more, or simply agree to disagree., Every person battling a mental illness has different needs. Don’t expect your immediate family members to naturally know how to handle this situation. Instead, give them some suggestion on how they can support you.Your loved ones can show you support by going to appointments with you, participating in family therapy, joining a support group, or by helping out with some errands or chores.
Let them know what would actually be helpful for you. Try not to let them do things that you can handle on your own.
Say “I would appreciate it if you guys attended at least one session of therapy with me. If we do this, my therapist can help all of us learn how to manage my symptoms so that I can improve.”

, After you have successfully shared news of your psychotic disorder with immediate family, you may choose to tell a few extended relatives. If you decide to do this, it can be a comfort to have a member of your immediate family there for support.


This person can help redirect inappropriate questions or comments, or even help you manage your emotions as you share the news. Select someone who makes you feel emotionally supported for this role.

, Keep in mind that you are not obligated to tell everyone you know about your mental illness. In fact, there will be some people who are not great candidates for self-disclosure. Some people simply are not capable of offering emotional support or of navigating difficult situations. Use your judgment to determine who else in your family or network of friends should be informed., Those extended relatives whom you do choose to disclose to do not have to know the whole story. You have the flexibility to decide not only to whom, but also how much you want to tell. The best approach is to keep your disclosure short and simple.You might briefly say something like “I went to the doctor and learned I have a brain disorder. It’s going to require that I stop working for a time to get the necessary treatment.”

, Despite advancements in research and greater public attention and advocacy, there is remains a stigma associated with mental illnesses in society. Before you make it a point to share news of your diagnosis with others, it’s a smart idea to take some time and actually acknowledge your own feelings about the news.Take a few days or weeks after your diagnosis to gain acceptance for your condition and overcome any negative feelings you have.

, If you are bothered by stigma or negative feelings associated with your psychotic disorder, self-compassion can help you to feel better. Use this time to process your emotions and show yourself kindness.


There are many ways you can practice self-compassion.Go to your therapist for support. Treat yourself as you would your very best friend. If you don't mind being touched, get a massage. Read a good book. Give yourself a hug. Listen to guided meditations to help you move towards acceptance of your diagnosis.
Another thing to focus on is that you are not alone. Joining a support group or participating in group therapy can help you acknowledge this. A mental illness is only an illness—it does not have to define you. Just like people living with diabetes, there are millions of people living active and productive lives with mental illnesses. So can you.

, Learning more about your specific psychotic disorder can guide you in how and what to share with your family. In general, psychotic disorders are conditions in which a person loses touch with reality. Some of your symptoms may include hallucinations, which are having false sensory experiences (e.g. seeing, hearing or feeling something that is not really there), or delusions, which are false beliefs (e.g. believing you are being targeted by the CIA).Talk to your health care provider, mental health therapist, and other trusted sources about your diagnosis. You can also turn to trusted online sources for more information, such as the National Institutes of Mental Health or the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

, It can be tempting to want to keep your mental illness a secret or only share with a close friend or two. For some people, this may be sufficient. However, sharing with at least a few core family members can actually prove beneficial to your recovery.


Being able to talk about your psychotic disorder with people who care can help you relieve stress and cope with the disorder.
You may be surprised by the reaction you get. In some cases, disclosing your condition to your family and friends can make them feel comfortable enough to discuss their own mental health struggles.
Plus, sharing info about your illness may also help you gather assistance in areas such as getting help with childcare, getting rides to therapy appointments, or having people help you develop a crisis plan, if necessary."

Prepare yourself for how they might react.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Move out when You Turn 16," Living on your own and supporting yourself takes a lot of money, so you will need a job with a steady income. Holding down a job will also show your parents that you're responsible and mature, and make it more likely for them to appreciate your need for independence.


Look for a job that offers flexible hours, and that can accommodate the time you still have to put in as a student.
It can be difficult to manage work, school, and homework, so consider setting up a time budget for yourself.;
, When you're living on your own, you'll be responsible for the cooking, cleaning, laundry, garbage, and maintenance. For your parents to see that you're ready for this, consider accepting more responsibility around the house.

, Your parents may drive you to and from school, work, practices, and other places, but you won’t have that luxury when you're living on your own. To get yourself used to that, and to demonstrate that you're capable of being independent, consider not relying on your parents for rides anymore.


Public transit is an option available in many towns and cities to get people from place to place.
If you’ve been able to save enough money for a car and have a driver’s licence, talk to your parents about buying your own car.

, Before moving out, consider researching safe neighborhoods to see what's available there. And if you're going to be taking public transit, check the routes and make sure the housing you're looking at is close to stops. Furthermore, before committing to a specific house or apartment, research the cost of comparable housing to make sure the price is fair. You'll also need to make enough money to support yourself, so you will have to know how much to budget for things like:Rent and utilities (heat, electricity, water, etc.)
Food and toiletries
Public transit or having your own vehicle (monthly payments, insurance, gas, and maintenance)
Clothes
Phone, cable, and Internet

, A large part of being mature and responsible enough to live on your own is understanding how much money you'll have going out, what you’ll have coming in, and how much is left over at the end. A budget can be extremely useful, because then you know exactly where your money is going, and whether you can afford certain things or not.For instance, if you know your budget only allots $40 for food per week, you'll immediately know that you shouldn’t spend $10 of that on a single fast food meal.

, It’s not enough to tell your parents that you want to move out: you need to figure out where you're going, if you're going to live with anyone else, and if you'll have equally responsible roommates.


Consider moving in with another family member if you really feel like you need to be away from your parents. Another family member may be able to give you some space from your parents, but they’ll also still be able to help you when you need it.Many landlords will be reluctant to rent a place to someone who’s only 16, because they're concerned about damage, noise, and irresponsible behavior., The rest of your life, and your goals, won’t stop just because you move out, but these things may be harder to manage. It can be good to have a five- or 10-year plan laid out. Not only will this demonstrate to your parents that you're concerned about the future, but it will also help guide you over the next few years. For instance, you might want to consider things like:


Are you planning on going to college or university after you graduate high school? How do you plan to pay for your school?
Do you want to continue working at the same job for the next number of years? If not, what kind of job do you hope to find instead?
Do you have any financial goals for the near future?
Will you need to buy your own car? If so, can you afford a safe and reliable vehicle?

, Part of being an adult is understanding and managing risks, and living away from your parents when you're a minor can be risky. For one, people may think they can take advantage of you because of your age.


Because you'll be juggling work and school, it may be difficult to manage your time properly.
If you're going to be living on your own and not with family or friends, know your rights and responsibilities as a tenant.
If any medical emergencies occur, you may need money to cover the expenses.

, Many rental agreements require a deposit or first and last month’s rent up front, and that may cost you a couple thousand dollars. You may also need money for a deposit to get certain utilities set up, and you should always have money put away for an emergency.


It’s a good idea to have enough money set aside to cover your monthly expenses for three to six months, in case anything happens and you can’t work or bring in money., Even if your parents agree, you may not legally be allowed to move out, depending on where you live. For instance:


In the United Kingdom, you can only move out at 16 with the consent of a parent.In the United States, you have to become emancipated before you can legally leave home at that age. Emancipation means you're legally considered an adult for the purposes of taking care of yourself, and your parents are no longer responsible for your welfare. You can become emancipated at the age of 16, but barring abuse or other circumstances, you will need the consent of your parents.In Australia, there's no legal age for leaving home, but the authorities can take you back home if they feel your basic needs aren’t being met.Take note that if you do require parental permission to leave home and don’t have it, you could put other adults in legal trouble if you move in with them., Your parents will likely be very resistant to the idea of you moving out, so it’s important to approach the topic the right way. You will need to have open and honest communication with them in order to explain what you want and why you think they should agree.


Schedule a family meeting with your parents and let them know you have something important you want to talk to them about.
Pick a quiet time when your parents are calm and ready to talk. Don’t just drop this conversation on them in the middle of a fight, holiday, or family trip.

, When you and your parents do sit down to have the talk, start by explaining to them that you're responsible and capable of living on your own. Tell them about all the things you’ve been doing lately to prepare yourself for living on your own, and explain to them how it’s made you realize that living on your own will be tough, but that you're ready.


Tell them about how work is going and how you're saving enough money.
Show them the budget you created and the expenses you researched.
Talk to them about how you’ve been managing school along with your extra responsibilities at work and around the house.

, Your parents are going to want to know why their baby wants to leave, and it’s best if you have an answer ready. Maybe you feel like you need more freedom, or maybe you’ve all been fighting a lot lately. Whatever the reason, be ready to answer openly and honestly. Part of being an adult is taking responsibility for your actions and owning up to your choices.


If there have been problems at home that are making you want to move out, maybe now is a good time to discuss them with your parents. It’s possible that you can come to an agreement so that you can get what you need and still live at home.Another option to address family problems is counselling and mediation, which could help you and your parents work through some issues and reach compromises that allow you to keep living with them while still getting more freedom., Above all, your parents may want to know where you're going and who you'll be living with. Now more than ever, it’s important to communicate openly. Don’t keep secrets or try to hide anything.


Remember that your parents want to know because they care about you, and want to know that you'll be safe.Explain that you’ve thought through your plan, and that you're ready to take on the challenge. To help ease their minds, create a list of emergency names and numbers that you'd contact in different situations so they know you're prepared., Every person is different, but it’s safe to say you can expect your parents to be hurt, angry, sad, and confused by your desire to leave home. React to their feelings with understanding and calmness: getting angry in return won’t help your cause, and it won’t help the discussion at all.


Give your parents time to process your request, and reschedule another family meeting in a few days to follow up and discuss their reactions.

Pay attention in school and do your homework. Help out around the house and do your chores. Spend time with your parents and don’t argue or whine or fight with them or your siblings. Your parents will be more likely to want to give you what you want if they feel like you deserve it., Before you ask your parents if you can have a party, create a basic plan for your party. Have a general idea of when you want it, what you want to have it for, and who you want to invite. It will be easier to ask your parents if you know you want. Simply asking for a party is vague and will probably lead to an immediate no.


Make a list of who you want to invite. This could be your closest friends or more people you know from school or other activities.
Look at your calendar and write down possible days you want to have the party. Try to pick a date you know your parents don't have anything scheduled for.
Think about where you want to have the party (such as at home, at a swimming pool, or at a roller skate rink).

, Figure out the estimated cost of the party if you can. Think about how much food and décor and anything else you will probably need costs. Once you get a general idea of the cost, think about how much you can contribute to the cost and what things you can cut back on to make the party cost less. If you do the math ahead of time and have a plan to help pay, your parents will be more likely to say yes.


For example, you might want 30 dollars for pizza, 40 dollars for decorations, and 10 dollars for invitations.
Think about where you might have to cut the budget (such as buying frozen pizza instead of restaurant pizza, buying less decorations, or making your own invitations).
Figure out how much money you can contribute if needed. If you have a part-time job, start setting aside money for the party about a month in advance so you can contribute to paying for the event.

, It is important that you don’t ask your parents for a party at a bad time. Don’t ask them too early or late in the day or when they are busy or distracted. Ask your parents for a moment of their time when they don’t seem too busy and seem like they have time to talk.


Try saying something like, “Mom and Dad, do you have a minute to talk?”, Your parents might not want to give you a party for no reason, but they might want to give you a party if they have a good reason to. You might want the party for your birthday and have not had a birthday party in a while. The party might be so you can get closer to new friends or get out of your shell. For example, “I have made new friends at school this year and I think having a Halloween party would help bring us closer together. Would it be possible for me to please have a party on Halloween?”

, When you ask them, be calm. Don’t cry, whine, or scream. Keep your tone calm and your behavior polite. It is a lot harder to say no to someone who is being respectful and friendly when they ask than someone screaming and crying. Say something like, “Is there any way I can please have a party for my birthday this year? It has been so long since I have had one. I would really appreciate it.”

, When you ask your parents for the party, offer to pay for some of the costs. Your parents might want you to have a party, but are just not able to afford it. Point out the general cost of how much you think it will be and offer to pay for some of the costs. They might just appreciate you acknowledging that the party costs money and not make you pay for any of the party.


Say something like, “I calculated it and I think the party will cost around 50 dollars. If I pay the 25 dollars that I have from babysitting, can you pay for the rest so I can have a party?” , If you parents are nervous about you having a party, invite them to be at the party. They will probably feel a lot more comfortable about a party that they can oversee.


If you are old enough where alcohol and drugs is a concern, offer to make sure to tell your friends that there will be no drugs or alcohol at the party.
Say something like, “You guys can chaperone the party so you feel more comfortable and to make sure everyone is being safe.”

, Letting your parents be involved in the planning of the party will make them feel more comfortable about it. Let them help plan food and decorations so they know what to expect for the party.


Let them help you decide where you should have the party.
Go shopping with your parents for food and decorations.
Let them help you make the invitations or Facebook event for the party.

, Tell them who and how many people you want to invite. If they are uncomfortable with the guest list, try to come to a compromise. If you want to have a boy-girl party, but they won’t allow it, you can try to convince them to change their mind.


Try saying something like, “I have friends who are boys and girls. I want to be able to invite boys so that I can spend time with all my friends on my birthday.”
Offer for them to meet guests beforehand so they feel more comfortable.

, When the party is over make sure to clean it up. If you leave a mess, your parents are not likely going to let you have any more parties in the future. Make sure your house is spotless after the party is over so it looks like there was never a party.

, When the party is over thank them for letting you have it. Take responsibility for anything that went wrong and let them know that it will not happen again. This will let them know that you are interested in keeping any future parties to their expectations.


For example, “Thank you so much for letting me have this party. I am very sorry that Kyle spilled soda on the carpet. Next time I will make sure everyone is more careful.”

Say what?,
Be True to You.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become a Vegetarian," Find the reasons why you are doing this. Some good ones are as follows. Explaining the impact of each of these to your parents can help greatly.


Environment- The cows and livestock take up so much space in America that they are tearing down forests to hoard them. They have masses of animals who's wastes are dumped anywhere.
Animals- The animals are tortured from the start of their lives. As a calf, they are ripped away from their mothers and killed for meat, or kept to be a milk cow.
Morals- Animals are injected with a 'rape gun' without any consent(obviously).
Your Health- Fat from meat can clog up arteries. You won't get high cholesterol with an animal free diet.;
, You don't have to have it completely memorized, as that may sound fake, but have everything in your knowledge. Save some things for if they ask you questions.

, Find out about nutrition. Impress your parents with your knowledge of what you would have to eat to 'make up' for meat. And remind them of all those vegetarian athletes out there.

, Search for some recipes. Print them out or bookmark them so your parents see how responsible you are. If you have the money, go take a cooking class!

, Get them on a good day. Good days are a number of things!


Payday.
When they get a new client.
If they won something.

, Ask them to sit down with you to have a mature discussion. Recite your speech (avoid index cards!) to them and observe how they react. If they seem stressed, find ways to reassure them.

, If they say no, read below. If they say yes, you won! Cook up some of those yummy recipes.

, If they say no, ask why. Don't whine, ""But why?"". You must show them you are mature enough to handle this.

, If they really refuse to allow you to do this, and you really want to, do it. If you really do want to become a vegetarian or vegan, you shouldn't let them stand in the way of your moral decisions. Ask them if they wouldn't allow you to be a different religion, or date someone of a different race. This is along the same lines, and they should respect your decisions!

"
"
Find a good time.,
Be honest.,
Compromise.,
Stay calm.,
Listen actively.,
Agree to a 'sex talk.',
Write a letter.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have a Boyfriend1," Pick a time when they are in a good mood. Avoid approaching them right after a hard day at work. Try to figure out their mood by asking, “How was your day?” Choose a time when you will not be interrupted or competing for their attention with other people or issues. Right after dinner or before bed is usually a pretty peaceful and private time.


If you don’t get a chance at home, you can also be more creative and talk with them while out on a walk or even while riding in the car. You might say, “Dad, do you want to go on a quick walk? I have some things I’d like to talk with you about.”You can always talk with just one parent too and ask them to approach the other one, if needed. This works best if you know your mom, for example, is a bit more lenient or if you feel closer to her.;
, Staying honest and straightforward is just one way to show your maturity. So, don’t tell lies, even white lies. If you’ve already gone on a date with this guy, you might as well tell them now, if they ask. If you are caught in a lie you will lose any ground that you’ve gained.


Another part of honesty is your being open to their concerns so you can respond to them. For example, if they don’t trust your boyfriend because they don’t know him very well, try to create more opportunities for everyone to get to know each other.
Avoid comparing yourself with others if it involves exaggeration. For example, don’t tell your parents that your best friend has had a boyfriend for the past 2 years, unless it is really true. Your parents will sense that you are not being honest and can easily check the facts.

, To get what you want, you may have to give a little. If your parents agree to let you have a boyfriend, they will most likely place some conditions on their agreement. If these are promises that you can actually keep, it is best to say yes. You can also bring up compromises as a way to bring your parents back to the bargaining table if they say no initially.


This will create an opening for greater freedom in the future as you gain their trust.
Many of the conditions will involve your performance at school. For example, you must keep a certain GPA to have a boyfriend. Or, you need to spend at least 1 hour each night studying. These are all goals that you should have anyway, so there is no harm in agreeing to them.
It likely that they will also try to limit your time with your new boyfriend, out of an effort to keep you from getting in over your head. They may ask you to only go out once a week or to stick to a strict curfew.
They may also want you to see and talk with a health professional. You will need to decide individually if you are comfortable with this type of compromise.

, Try to control your emotions during your talk. Avoid yelling, crying, whining, or begging. A temper tantrum of any kind will make them lose all respect for your position. To stay calm, repeat in your head the word “control” or “calm.” Count for five seconds, in your head, before you answer any questions or make any statements you may regret.


Make sure to watch your tone as well. It is really easy to say nice words with a sarcastic attitude. For example, “That’s great,” sounds really different depending on your tone of voice.If you feel increasingly frustrated by the conversation, plan a way to blow off some steam after. Visualize taking a long run, swimming some laps, or going shopping with friends.

, You parents will most likely have quite a bit to say back to you, so make sure to pay close attention to what they are saying. Look into their eyes when they are talking. This will help to show that you are not embarrassed or ashamed to talk about your possible relationship. Nod your head when they make good points and even smile if you really agree with something.A big part of active listening is asking questions. If they say no to you, respond by asking, “Why not?” Tell them that you honestly want to understand their perspective in this situation. This will help you to figure out what is bothering them so you can work on it., If you haven’t already discussed it, your parents may want to sit down with you at a later time to discuss their concerns about you having sex. Again, this ‘sex talk’ could actually be really useful for you. This will be a safe time for you to ask questions or express concerns., If you just can’t talk to your parents face-to-face, you may need to write down your feelings and thoughts via a letter. This is also a good idea if you think your parents may have an extreme reaction to your request.Make sure that your letter is well written and calm. Do not write anything that you will regret. Instead of saying, “I’m going to have a boyfriend whether you like it or not,” you might write, “I really want you to understand where I’m coming from.”
It may be helpful to show your letter to a trusted friend or family member for feedback before presenting it to you parents.

Let them get to know him.,
Arrange a group date.,
Show your maturity.,
Be patient.,
Practice gratitude.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have a Boyfriend2," Introduce your parents to your potential boyfriend. You can do this via photos, showing them some of his texts, or in person. Give them an idea about his personality and good qualities. If he does well in school, brag about it. Tell them about his major and future plans.


If you have them meet in person, set it up in advance. Don’t just spring your boyfriend on your parents, or they may feel ambushed. This might result in a more negative reaction than normal.A boyfriend should be supportive of your dreams as well. Make sure to highlight that trait. You might tell your parents, “He always asks how my SAT prep is going.”

, Tell your parents that you will only go on group dates with your guy for one month. This gives your parents the security of knowing that you will be safe and will have time to get to know him without the pressure of being solo.Group dates provide some safety, however, they also result in peer pressure. Address these concerns by reminding your parents that they have done a good job teaching you to be your own person. You might say, “Don’t worry, if I’m in a group I never drink and won’t just because others tell me to.”, Follow all of your parent’s rules. Show them that you can honor commitments over time, even if they are boring or annoying. For example, always make your curfew, do your chores without being asked, and avoid petty arguments, if you can., Show your parents that you are in control of yourself. You have the self-control to know that they will need time to think over this issue. To show your patience, you may decide to wait two weeks before bringing up the subject again.For example, if they say, “Your dad and I need to think this over.” You might respond, “I understand, this is an important decision.”
Try not to pressure them, as this can work against you.

, Demonstrate your appreciation for what they’ve done for you over your life. You might say, “Thank you!” more often. Or, you might do little nice things for them, like making breakfast. If they say that you are just trying to convince them, you can respond, “Of course I want you to say yes. But, that is because I value your opinion too. I want you to know that.”"
"
Wait until you find someone.,
Question yourself.,
Talk with friends.,
Talk with another trusted adult.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have a Boyfriend3," Don’t ask to have a boyfriend in advance of finding a guy you really like. You can end up in an argument with your parents, and you will have few details to back you up. Instead, if you have someone in particular, you can think about what you like about them and bring that up. You can also use this as an argument to convince your parents by saying, “I’ve waited until I found someone I really like to approach you about this.”

, Are you actually ready? Or, do you just want a boyfriend to fit in with others your age? Are you willing to set boundaries, even sexual ones, to protect yourself? Are you prepared to handle rejection? Your parents will surely question you, so get ready by thinking through these issues on your own.Ask yourself whether he is a good guy in general or a good guy for you in particular? He may be a great person, but this may be the wrong time due to an age gap, difference in experience levels, etc., Your friends are probably aware of your feelings and they may know your parents too, so it is a good idea to seek out their advice. You might ask them how they think you should approach your parents or how to describe your guy to your parents? You could even invite some of your friends over and let them talk to your parents about the boy, if you are comfortable with that.

, If your parents refuse to budge from their position, then you may need to bring in reinforcements. Meet with your pastor, a family friend, or another relative and tell them about your situation. Ask for their advice. You might say, “What kind of compromises can I suggest that will make my parents happy?”"

Protect yourself.",How to Convince a Parent to Quit Smoking," The first step in convincing your parent to quit smoking is to let them know that you would like them to quit. Although the decision to quit must come from the smoker themselves, knowing that you wish they would quit will begin a dialogue between you and your parent.


Give your parent specific reasons why you would like them to quit: “I would love to run a marathon with you,” “I care for you and want you to stay healthy,” and other personal reasons for quitting will help to put your parent’s smoking into perspective and remind them of things smoking doesn’t allow them to do.;
, Make yourself available to talk when your parent gets a cigarette craving or is frustrated and cranky from nicotine withdrawal. Make sure to be available particularly during occasions when a smoker would crave a cigarette, such as that first morning coffee or a coffee break at work, after a meal, or at a party.Help out with chores, cooking dinner, taking care of children, and any other tasks that may be stressful to somebody trying to quit.
Help them get the types of things smokers need when they try to quit: hard candies, gum, straws or other things to chew on, and so on., Invite your parent out on excursions together that will help to take their mind off smoking, particularly during “nicotine fits,” or particularly difficult days. Going for a bike ride, shopping, eating at a new restaurant, seeing a movie together, and so on, are fun activities that both of you can enjoy and will focus your parent’s attention away from smoking., Forbid smoking in any part of your house, and remove everything from their home that may cause your parent to relapse: cigarettes, ash trays, matches and lighters, and so on.


Try to remove the scent of smoke from your parent’s home, as well. Clean any clothes, sheets, curtains, carpets and other materials that have absorbed smoke. , If quitting is proving to be particularly difficult for your parent, you can suggest that they explore cigarette alternatives. Nicotine alters a smoker’s brain and leads to an addiction that is difficult to shake off. Your parent may need to try one or more of the following in order to quit for good:


Nicotine patches can be bought over-the-counter and come in a variety of strengths. Depending on the amount they smoke, your parent can control the amount of nicotine they take in and gradually taper down according to a suggested schedule.
Nicotine gum and lozenges are readily available in pharmacies and have helped many people quit over the past two decades.
Nicotine spray can be obtained with a prescription from a physician.
Nicotine replacement medicines. These will continue to provide your parent with nicotine, but in gradually reduced dosages, easing the smoker through the headaches and irritability that accompany quitting. Your parent should speak to their physician about medication options.
Bupropion hydrochloride, a prescribed antidepressant, also helps people to quit smoking. Suggest to your parent that they speak with a physician or therapist about the benefits and risks of using this type of medication., Tell your parent that you believe that they have the strength to quit, even if they have attempted to in the past and have not been successful. Tell them that you are always there to provide more encouragement when the going gets tough.


Don’t question your parent’s ability or will to quit, as your belief in their success will serve as a reminder that they can, indeed, quit smoking.
Avoid getting angry, passing judgement, scolding and other types of behaviour that may hurt your parent’s feelings and self-confidence. A smoker will often turn to a cigarette to deal with this type of stress. , Smoking is not only addictive, but over time becomes an integral part of a smoker’s everyday life. It can become like “an old friend” who is always there during the tough times. If you have smoked in the past, empathizing with a parent who smokes may come naturally; otherwise, try to understand the importance of smoking in your parent’s life, and the difficulty they face in quitting.


Make sure your parent knows that you understand the role of cigarettes in their life, and how difficult the task ahead of them is., Smokers who quit – especially cold turkey – will most likely experience one or more of the following withdrawal symptoms: intense nicotine cravings; irritability; headaches; difficulty concentrating; anxiety and depression; nightmares; and increased appetite and weight gain. These symptoms can appear two to three hours after your parent smokes their last cigarette and hit hardest about two to three days after that. If you understand the very real difficulties associated with quitting, you will be able to better empathize and help your parent to quit., Each day, week, or month that your parent goes smoke-free, let them know how impressed you are that they are quitting. To show your appreciation, give them a gift or take them out on the town as a reward for their achievement.Small tokens of encouragement will help your parent to begin seeing quitting as a positive step in their life, rather than simply as the loss of the nicotine they crave.
Encouragement can come in many forms: words of gratitude; a card; flowers; a meal at their favorite restaurant; a trip to the cinema, and so on.It is best to give your parent an immediate reward, rather than a promise of a future gift or activity. Immediate rewards are more effective during the difficult early stages of quitting., Most smokers struggle to quit cold turkey, and ""slipping"" - taking a puff, or smoking a cigarette or two - is common. Encourage your parent during this time, even if you are disappointed or angry.


Remind your parent of all of the reasons they quit in the first place, as well as the amount of time they were able to go without smoking before they slipped.
Refer to them as a ""quitter,"" rather than a ""smoker,"" even after they slip. In this context, of course, ""quitter"" is a positive term.
Avoid getting angry, showing disappointment, or nagging your parent when you discover a slip. Keep up the encouragement., Most smokers require several attempts before they quit smoking for good, and relapses - reverting back to regular smoking patterns - is not out of the ordinary. Remain positive and supportive if a relapse occurs.


Let your parent know that you are proud of them for trying to quit, and for staying smoke-free during that time. Make sure they know that they didn't fail, but made an impressive first try.
Encourage them to learn from the experience and help them to see that they will be better prepared the next time they attempt to quit.
Say ""When you try to quit again...,"" rather than, ""If you try to quit again..."", Some parents will have serious difficulties with quitting, whether out of ingrained habit, a deep addiction, or emotional reasons. If your parent would like to quit smoking, but faces difficult obstacles in doing so, seek outside help to help them over the hurdles. Possible options include:


Quit-smoking program. These can done in-person, online and over the phone. Check with your parent's physician, local health unit or lung association for recommendations.
Support group. Ask your parent's physician to recommend a smoker's support group, or inquire at your local health unit or lung association.
Apps. There are a number of quit-smoking apps available for your parent's phone, tablet, and other devices. Examples can be found here., A parent trying to quit smoking may take several attempts - and weeks, if not months or years - to finally quit for good. If you live with your parents, and particularly if you will be living with your parents for many more years, it is important to protect yourself against the dangers of second-hand smoke


Hold a family meeting. If you feel confident enough to discuss your parent's smoking in an open and honest manner, sit down with your family and let them know the reasons why you would like a smoke-free home. Make sure your parent knows of the multitude of dangers their smoke poses to your health. Ask them to read up on second-hand smoke and ways to protect you from it, such as can be found here.
Ask your parent to smoke outside. Have them smoke in a designated area where there is little risk of the smoke blowing back into the house. If they agree, remove all ash trays from your home and ask your parent to clean any carpets, curtains and clothing that has absorbed smoke.
When confronted with a stubborn smoker, ask them to at least smoke in one specific room of the house, rather than anywhere they please. Also make sure to open the windows if your parent insists on smoking inside, and ask your parent to install an air purifier or other filter for the vents.
Tell your parent you would like the car to be a smoke-free zone. Ask them to stop driving and smoke outside if they get a craving.

Don’t ask your parents in the middle of cooking dinner or right as you’re heading out the door to school. Look for, or help create, a good time to talk.


Ask your parents to go for a walk with you.
Stay at the table with your parents after dinner to talk.
Instead of turning on a movie or TV show, sit with your parents and start a conversation.;
, If your parents are concerned about your friends, then immediately expecting them to let you go on an overnight trip somewhere isn’t going to happen.Think about something specific and start by discussing that.


Having friends over for a movie night once a month.
Going to a friend’s birthday party.
Grabbing a pizza with friends after soccer practice.

, Talking with your parents can be stressful, especially when it’s about a difficult topic. When emotions take over a conversation we tend to become angry or forget what we wanted to say. Practice the conversation in front of a mirror or write down what you want to say. This will also show your parents you’re serious about this conversation.

, Ask your parents why they don’t like your friends. You can’t convince your parents you have good friends unless you know what they dislike about them. Once you hear their concerns you will be able to address the issues.If your parents express concern over a friend’s driving, try responding with “Tommy can get a little distracted when driving, but I don’t think he has any tickets. If it makes you uncomfortable than I won’t ride in any car he’s driving. Jacob is a very responsible driver, I promise to ride with him any time we go someplace.”
If your parents are worried about the type of language a friend uses help reassure them that it’s not influencing your behavior, “I’m sorry you’ve heard her using inappropriate language. I don’t talk that way and I’ll make sure she understands what is and isn’t appropriate to say in the house.”
If your parents know that a friend smokes you need let them know that it doesn’t affect your choices, “I know Sam smokes, and I don’t like it either. But he is still a good, trustworthy friend and doesn’t smoke around me.”

If you do have a friend that smokes, try talking to them about quitting!, If your parents asks you something about your friend, don’t lie. Your parents may already know the answer and are testing to see if you’ll be honest with them. And if not, the truth almost always comes out anyway. Additionally, if your parents see that you recognize the good and bad in your friend, you can talk about how you disagree with what your friend did, and show them you are mature enough to make your own choices., Help your parents understand why your friends are good people. If all they’ve heard are the negatives, then that’s all they can base their opinion on.


Let your parents know if your friends help you in school, “Susan is great at math and helped me study today at lunch.”
Tell your parents when your friend supported you, “Matt ran with me when I started falling behind at track practice today.”
Remind your parents that friends help you have fun, “I was laughing so hard today when Jess did a spot-on celebrity impression!”

, Make sure that your friends know your parent’s rules. They may be different from their own rules, and need to respect your parents while in their house. Sometimes your parents might not like a friend because of small behaviors, or different parental expectations for manners. Show your parents that you and your friends can be mature together., Give your parents the opportunity to spend some time with your friends. Then once they get to know your friends and see how well you can behave together they will be more comfortable with you seeing friends outside of your house.

, Your parents may not like your friends because they think you’re changing who you are to be with them. Help reassure your parents that not all changes are negative. Teenage years are a time for you to expand and grow, tell them why being with these friends is a positive change for you.If you’re trying out for a new sport tell your parents “She’s a star on the basketball team and is helping me practice for tryouts.”
If you are interested in joining a new club say “He’s signing up for the yearbook committee too.”
If you have a new goal let your parents know “We both want to go to college for biology.”

, Tell them how much you appreciate that they took the time to listen to you and to get to know your friends better. Let your parents know that your relationship with your friends is important to you but you don’t want it to strain your relationship with them., If you’re trying to convince your parents that you can pick your own friends, you need to show them that you’re responsible. Offer to take out the trash or clean the dishes. Talk to them about the schoolwork you’re completing. Help reassure them that you’re responsible in your actions and the choices you make.

, Even if you have a well planned discussion, talk maturely, and think you have a reasonable request, your parents may still dislike your friends and not let you see them. While this seems like the peak of unfairness you still have to respect their decision. They way you respond to this will likely influence their decisions in the future.


Do NOT scream at them about how unfair they’re being.
Do NOT resort to name calling.
Do let them know that you’re upset with, but will respect, their decision.
Do tell them that you hope this is something you can discuss again in the future.

Reach out to others.,
Stay strong and be true to yourself.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Wear Girls Clothes," Start by casually asking what your parents think of boys or men who wear traditionally female clothing as a way to test how they’ll react to your own desire to do so.


If you see boys or men in girls’ clothes on TV or in a movie, point them out to your parents to ask about what they think. Or reference popular transgender women in the media like Laverne Cox or Caitlyn Jenner, especially if you also identify as trans and are thinking about discussing this with your parents.;
, Tell your parents the reasons behind your desire to dress in girls’ clothing. Be specific about how dressing in this way does or would make you feel, how you benefit from it, or what occasion you want to wear this clothing for. If you don’t know why you want to do it, just explain that you feel the need to experiment right now.


Let your parents know that clothing is an important way to express yourself and feel confident in your own body.
You can point out to your parents that dressing as a different gender than the one you were born as can have all kinds of positive effects, like being able to access a different side or yourself, understand and relate to others better, and even see things you’ve never noticed before, like your resemblance to a family member or features of your body that you love.Perhaps you only want to dress in girls’ clothing for a certain occasion or event. Explain the need or desire to dress in girls’ clothing for a play, another performance, or a dance. You can point out that boys have been dressing as girls and women on stage for centuries!, Talk with your parents about what gender you feel you identify with, as this may or may not be tied with your desire to dress in clothing associated with a different gender. Maybe you feel more like a girl sometimes, all the time, or you still feel like a boy but just enjoy the way that girls’ clothes look and feel.



“Coming out” as trans doesn’t have to be a big deal, and you can do it in whatever way makes you feel comfortable. Tell your parents, tell everybody, or tell just your closest friends for now and until you feel comfortable revealing it to more people.
You may not identify as trans at all, and be perfectly happy with the body and traits of your life as a boy, but just want to dress in girls’ clothing, and that is perfectly normal and worth discussing with your parents.
Maybe you feel you identify with being a boy at some times, and a girl at other times, or you don’t particularly feel like you fit into either gender! This is perfectly okay too, and you can discuss it with your parents in terms of “gender-queer” or “gender-neutral” if you wish.

, Be prepared to respond to any negative or untrue stereotypes surrounding boys and men dressing as girls or women. You can start by explaining that nothing negative or wrong has “made” you have this desire or identity, and that it is not just “a phase.” Even if it is something you don’t do forever, tell your parents to take you seriously.


Tell your parents that cross-dressing is more common and normal than they might believe. You can tell them that one conservative estimate says at least 2 to 5% of all adult males dress in female clothing.Explain the unbalanced or unfair situation of girls and women being able to wear clothing that was once considered more traditionally masculine, like jeans, t-shirts, and blazers, and it is seen as normal. But when boys and men attempt to dress in more traditionally feminine clothing like dresses and skirts, it is viewed with much more negativity and seen as “weird” or “wrong.”Your discussion about gender identity or cross-dressing doesn’t need to be a discussion about your sexual identity or preference for who you’re attracted to, and the two issues do not have anything to do with each other, despite many stereotypes. Calmly but firmly explain this difference to your parents., Assure your parents if they are having any doubts that your desire to dress in different clothing doesn’t change who you are and all the other aspects of yourself that your parents know and are familiar with.


Revealing information about your desires to dress as or identify with another gender can come as a shock, a surprise, or just something your parents wish you had told them sooner. You can explain that it’s not something you want to keep from them and that you just wanted to find the right way to bring it up and explain it.

, Tell your parents that you would really like their acceptance of your decision and feelings, their permission to buy the clothes, or anything else you need from them. Express that you want them to be a part of your life and let them know what’s going on.


You can say, “I really want your support on what I wear and how I feel about it. This is something that’s really important to me right now, and I want you to be involved. Will you help me buy the clothes I want to wear?”
Ask your parents for advice they might have for telling friends, teachers, or other important people in your life and how to get their support and acceptance, too.

, If your parents are hesitant about how you want to dress and revealing it to other people, discuss and agree on certain places or occasions you can wear girls’ clothing.


Find a compromise with your parents, like being able to wear girls’ clothes after school but not at school or church. Or decide on special occasions that you can wear female clothes for.
Your parents may just need to get used to your new wardrobe in small amounts before they let you wear it all the time, so be patient and agree to let them set some limits at first.

, Come to an agreement about the clothing your parents will feel comfortable with you wearing. Try more androgynous (gender-neutral) clothing or mixing boys’ and girls’ clothes together in the same outfit to ease them into the idea of dressing in more girls’ clothes.


Try asking for or buying boys’ jeans and tops in a slimmer and tighter fit for a more feminine look. Or add girls’ accessories or a few key clothing items to a typical boys’ outfit.

, Invite your parents to come with you to the mall or stores where you’d like to buy girls’ clothing. Offer to let them help you make decisions and be involved in the whole process.


If they won’t go to the store with you, show them pictures of what you want to buy or the kind of outfit you might like to wear to get their approval beforehand.
You might even ask a parent who identifies or dresses as female if you can borrow some of their clothes or get tips on dressing from them. Being more involved in your decision or transition may help them to become more accepting of it.

, If you want to add makeup, jewelry, and other typically feminine accessories, discuss these with your parents, too. Talk about what they’re okay with you buying and wearing.


Come up with compromises for these things, too. Maybe your parents will allow you to wear just makeup and not girls’ clothes yet. Or you can agree with them on how much makeup you wear and when you can wear it.

, Ask your parents for their reasons if they say no to your desire to cross-dress or they express disapproval of your identity or lifestyle. Seek to understand their viewpoint and concerns so you can gauge whether you can convince them over time, or need to seek help or guidance from others.


Some parents may have strict religious views that prevent them from easily accepting or allowing cross-dressing. Try talking to someone of their faith who might be understanding of your situation, and have them talk to your parents.
If your parents think you are too young to make this decision for yourself, think you don’t know what you want, or simply don’t want you cross-dressing under their roof, note that it is expected for you to abide by their wishes as long as you are under 18 and a dependent of your parents.
Try to understand that it might be difficult for your parents to understand something they’ve never experienced or don’t know much about, but give them time to get used to the idea that you are the same person they know and love even if you dress in girls’ clothing or come out as trans.

, Carefully weigh the risks of dressing in girls’ clothing without parent permission, or otherwise disobeying them. You should do what makes you comfortable and happy, but without running the risk of verbal, mental, or physical harm if possible.


If your parents are reluctant to accept what you’ve told them and won’t allow you to buy girls’ clothes, but don’t show signs of verbal or physical abuse or consequences if you disobey them, consider buying the clothes yourself and changing into them once you get to school, or other times when your parents aren’t around.
If your parents show a lot of anger and hostility, strictly forbid you from buying girls’ clothes or living a certain lifestyle, and threaten serious consequences of verbal or physical abuse if you disobey them, do not go against them. Seek help from a friend, teacher, or other adult right away.

, Talk to a friend, friends’ parents, teacher, guidance counselor, therapist, or other trusted person if you are having trouble talking to your parents or if you feel unable or unsafe to live as yourself in your home.


If you are trans and want to talk to another trans person who knows exactly what you’re going through and how to help, dial (877) 565-8860 from anywhere in the U.S. to reach the Trans Lifeline.If you need help or have questions regarding cross-dressing and gender or sexual identity, call or chat online with a peer counselor at GLBT National Help Center., Don’t let your parents' disapproval or other negative reactions to the way you dress or identify cause you to suppress or deny your feelings and wishes. This can cause severe mental and emotional disturbance. Be true to yourself and defend your choices as healthy, normal expressions of who you are.

Identify reasons you might need braces.,
Understand the potential benefits.,
Write down why you want braces.,
Ask your dentist about braces.,
Practice what you want to say.,
Be ready to answer questions.,
Pick a good time to talk.,
Adopt the right tone.,
Understand that your parents may see things differently.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Get Braces," If you want to make the argument to your parents that you should get braces, you ought to be sure about the benefits of braces as well as the indicators that you need them. The signs that can demonstrate you need braces include crowded or crooked teeth, gaps between your teeth, an overbite or underbite, and a crossbite.


Keep in mind that in many cases these symptoms will be easily apparent, but not always. In some cases they will not be evident until an orthodontic evaluation has taken place.;
, Once you have identified the signs that indicate braces may be necessary you need to understand what the result of wearing braces would be. Successful orthodontic treatment helps you get the best from your teeth. You will be able to eat and speak more comfortably, bite correctly, and care for your teeth and gums more easily. Having straighter teeth will also improve your smile and can make you feel happier and more confident., After you have determined the medical benefits of braces, you should think about why you really want them. If you feel embarrassed or awkward about your crooked teeth be honest with yourself. Remember that most people have teeth that are somewhat crooked, but if your smile is getting you down be sure to include this in the list of reasons why you want braces.


The best time to get braces is thought to be when you are around 12 or 13 years old. If you are around this age explain that the time is right.When you draw up your list include both objective medical information as well as your own personal feelings about it.

, It's a very good idea to talk to your dentist or orthodontist about your teeth and the benefits of braces. Each person is different so you should talk to an expert in order to get a full understanding of how your teeth will develop over time. If your orthodontist doesn't think you should get braces, it is highly unlikely that your parents will pursue it.


Having a dental expert helping you make the argument to your parents will make it much more convincing and harder to ignore.
If your dentist agrees that braces would be beneficial for you they will most likely raise this with your parents anyway.
If your dentist tells you you really don't need braces you should reconsider.

, If you are going to approach your parents to try to convince them that you need to get braces, it's a good idea to take some time to rehearse the sort of things you want to say. You need to be able to express yourself as clearly and articulately as possible, so preparation helps. Go through your list of reasons why you want braces and break it into medical reasons and personal reasons. Demonstrating that you have thought long and hard about it, and put in work to research it, will show your parents that you are serious about it.


Be prepared to say things such as ""I have done some research and I think getting braces would really straighten my teeth"", and ""I think having straighter teeth will help me speak more clearly"".
You could say ""I understand that wearing braces can be irritating and they are expensive, but I think the long-term benefits justify it"".
If you are self-conscious about an underbite or overbite, be honest about it and say something like ""my overbite makes me feel self-conscious and I think getting braces would help"".

, If your parents have shown some skepticism in the past about you getting braces, you should be prepared to deal with some questions from them about whether you need braces. They might ask you things such as ""are braces really necessary"", or suggest that you shouldn't be worried about having slightly crooked teeth. It's important that you state your case clearly without being impatient and rude.


You could answer by saying something like ""they might seem only slightly crooked to you, but my teeth stop me from smiling"".
You could point out that over time they may become more crooked and cause more serious problems that might even require surgery.You could encourage them to speak to your dentist about it to get a real expert opinion.

, Once you are well-prepared you should feel confident to go and speak to your parents about braces. Don't jump in before you feel like you have enough information to support your argument and pick a moment when your parents will not be stressed or distracted. Say ""have you got a minute for a chat?"" or ""are you free to talk?"".


If you are struggling to find a good time, ask your parents when they will be free to talk to you.
Say something like ""I know you're busy, but I could do with a chat. When's a good time?"", When you do get to talk to your parents try to be as confident and clear as you can about why you think you should get braces. Be direct about how you are feeling and encourage your parents to try see the situation from your point of view. Give details on why you are asking them so they can try to better understand your situation and your reasoning.


Don't whine or be impatient when you talk to them, be sincere and honest about how you feel.
Being friendly and respectful towards your parents will help them to sympathise with your situation.
If you act like an adult and are mature and respectful they are more likely to respond to you in that way and take your appeals more seriously., You should understand that your parents won't focus on minor crooked teeth in your smile in the same way you do, so they might not understand how it is impacting on you. You can acknowledge this by saying ""I know you think it's not a big deal, but it makes me feel uncomfortable and I find it hard to relax"".Showing maturity and self-awareness without overstating the influence a brace would have on your happiness and well-being is important.
Try to understand your parents' point of view and be sympathetic to it, while maintaining your argument.

Admit to a lesser charge.,
Practice telling your story backwards.,
Avoid using the word “Well.” Well is a placeholder word that liars frequently employ when they’re trying to buy more time to think of their lie.,
Keep your story short.,
Avoid proclaiming your honesty.",How to Convince Your Parents That You're Innocent1," People who flat out deny their involvement in wrong-doing are less likely to be believed than people who cop to committing a lesser offense. Admitting you did something wrong, even if it’s not the wrong thing you were accused of, may help convince your parents of your innocence.If you stand accused of skipping school, explain that you didn’t skip school, but you did give someone a ride home when you know you weren’t supposed to.
If you’re accused of throwing a party when your parents are out of town, explain that you didn’t have a party, but you did invite a few close friends over to hang out.;
, One trick investigators use when trying to separate the innocent from the guilty is to have the suspect tell their story backwards. Most suspects practice their story in chronological order, so being able to confidently tell your story out of order will make you appear more truthful.Even if you’re telling the truth, repeating your story out of order will be difficult. Don’t be too rehearsed about it or your parents will know you’re lying.
Rehearse your gestures as well as your words. If your gestures look forced, that’s a clear indicator that you’re not being forthcoming.

, Avoid using placeholder words like “Well” or “So” or “Look” and instead focus on giving clear and concise yes or no answers to questions.Don’t give yes or no answers to longer questions or it will look like you’re avoiding answering the question.
For questions requiring longer answers, be concise and keep your answer focused and courteous.

, The more details and information you include in your story, the more it seems like you’re lying and trying to cover up the truth. To tell a believable lie, keep your story short and deliver it confidently.The longer your story is, the easier it is to get tripped up by details.
The best lies are the ones that are rooted in truth. Include as much truth as you can and fudge only on the details that will get you in trouble.

, If you truly want your parents to think you’re innocent, don’t keep telling them that you are. Repeatedly stating that you’re not guilty only makes you look more dishonest.Honest people don’t use lines like, “Would I lie to you?” so you shouldn’t either.
The more defensive you get, the more dishonest you seem.

Make eye contact.,
Move around.,
Smile with your eyes.",How to Convince Your Parents That You're Innocent2," Making eye contact with your parents is incredibly important; eye contact establishes trust and makes you look alert and interested in the conversation.By not making eye-contact, you are essentially proving that you are guilty of the crime.
Hold the eye contact, even when you feel uncomfortable. Looking away or avoiding eye contact will make you look guilty.

, Standing completely still suggests a deer in headlights and may further convince your parents that you’re guilty. Move around, but do so naturally – if you don’t usually gesture with your hands when you talk, don’t start using excessive hand gestures now.Don’t cross your arms over your chest. This makes you look closed off and threatening, but not trustworthy.
Don’t touch or cover your mouth. This implies that you don’t know what to say.
Don’t fidget. Fidgeting only makes you look guilty and anxious.

, Facial cues are an easy way to detect if someone is being dishonest and a fake smile usually points to a guilty person. When smiling, concentrate on smiling with your whole face.Crinkle your eyes when smiling. This makes your smile look more genuine.
Don’t smirk. Smirking usually suggests that someone is being disingenuous.

Establish an alibi.,
Establish your lack of motivation.,
Catch the culprit.",How to Convince Your Parents That You're Innocent3," If you are actually innocent of the crime you’re being accused of, the best way to prove your innocence is to establish an alibi. If you were with someone else at the time the crime was being committed, they can vouch for your innocence.If you stand accused of cheating on a test and you know you were actually at the nurse when the test was occurring, have the nurse call your parents and explain.
If someone else knows who committed the crime, convince that person to come forward and exonerate you.

, When most people commit crimes, they have a motive or reason for doing so. Proving that you had no reason to want to commit this offense is a useful way to prove your innocence.If you’re accused of stealing money from your parent’s wallet, point to all the money you just made baby-sitting as a reason why you wouldn’t need to steal.
If you know that your brother really wants a new video game, but he doesn’t have the money, point to that as a possible motivation for committing the crime.
If you know someone else has a clearer motivation for committing the crime, suggest them as a possible suspect.

, The only real way to exonerate yourself fully is to catch the person who actually committed the crime. Depending on the crime and person who committed it, this may be impossible to do, but you owe it to yourself to try.


Set up a trap to catch the criminal. If you’re accused of stealing food from the pantry, set up a hidden video camera above the pantry to see if you can catch the person in the act.
If you think you know who did it, stage a conversation with that person and try to trick them into confessing. Record them on your smart phone and use the recording to prove your innocence.
Remind your parents that under American law, you are innocent until proven guilty."

Remember that a bra is really not a big deal.,
Go for something else instead, or as well.,
Do something else during the trip.,

Accept that it will be awkward, and go in and get it over with.

Choose something plain.,
Keep your purchases in a bag, in the back seat or trunk on the way home.",How to Go Bra Shopping With Your Dad," Really. Most women wear them, and most dads know that (though some are surprised to find out their little girls are growing up). There's no reason to be embarrassed, ashamed, or bothered by having to shop with your dad, any more than you would be shopping for socks. If you're still embarrassed, though, keep reading.;
, You needed some new socks anyway, right? Those will get you into the right vicinity, and they'll give you an easy, non-embarrassing reason to go that way.

, Don't just sit there in the car with the dreaded, awkward silence. Turn on the radio to a station that you and your dad both like and listen to. Start up a conversation about a common interest. Talk about something else instead of sitting there dreading the trip.

, This is the easiest way to go about your business. Suggest that he goes to a store or different department that he likes while you shop. Many dads will agree because they have no desire to wander around in the underwear section with their teenage daughters, anyway.

,, Instead of going to the bras with frilly lace and pink and black sexy details, go for that plain white t-shirt or sports bra. They are usually more comfortable, cost less, and they are usually placed towards the front of stores that sell lingerie. It's much less awkward to buy a simple bra with a nice price in front of your dad than the sexy thong and padded push-up set. You'd buy a t-shirt in front of him, and this is practically a t-shirt, anyway.

, The awkward part is now behind you, so relax.

You want to hit them from both angles to make sure your argument is thorough. That shows them how important this is to you.


Most people make decisions based on a combination of reason and emotion. They are interconnected, always influencing each other. That is why you always want to appeal to someone’s reason and emotion when you are trying to influence them.When you plan your strategy, write down how you will approach them reasonably. What kinds of things do your parents typically react to on a logical level? Then, write down the things you can say to them that will affect them emotionally. What are their weaknesses? Do they have a strong sense of pride? Are they quick to avoid fear? These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about.
Keep a close eye on your parents for a while to see what kinds of things they react to, so you have a better idea of what kinds of things you can say, and what topics to avoid.;
, An important part of your strategy is appealing to your parents’ sense of reason. A well-reasoned argument includes persuasive justifications for wearing a thong. Write down five or six logical reasons why you want to wear a thong.Thongs don’t show panty lines. The main benefit of this is that it avoids attention to your butt. Surely your parents can get on board with that.Thongs last longer. Since there is less fabric to deal with, they reshape better than regular panties. If you change shape at all, it is less likely that you will have to buy new panties, saving money.Thongs keep you cooler in hot temperatures. They are lightweight, allowing for better airflow. By avoiding sweat in your panties you will also avoid possible skin rashes or blemishes., Prove to your parents you are a responsible person who makes responsible choices. Doing this will give your argument more credibility. Kick up the responsibility before your argument happens so it does not look obvious.


If you have chores or homework, do them on time without being asked.
Save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things.
Do not stay out late or come home drunk.

, Take control of the situation by offering to pay for your thong. This shows them that you have put thought into the decision, rather than being impulsive. This is also an opportunity to show them you have saved your money.

, To be convincing you need to have the discussion with your parents full of confidence. One of the best ways to achieve confidence is to practice what you are going to say to your parents, so you are not bumbling over yourself or forgetting your arguments. Imagine that your parents are there with you when you practice.Read your notes out loud in front of a mirror. By the time you sit down with your parents to convince them, you will be well prepared.Be sure you pace yourself and take breaths. You want your practice to be as natural as possible so that your conversation with them does not look rehearsed.Keep practicing until you feel confident you are ready to talk with them in a calm and collected voice. Once you feel comfortable with what you are going to say, you are ready to convince them.

, When you are ready to ask your parents to talk, there are a few things to consider. Ask when they seem to be in a good mood. Do not be pushy when you ask, be nice about it. Make sure you choose a time that is good for everyone. Weekends are best, when your parents are less likely to be stressed out., You may not need them because you practiced what you want to say, but you should have them with you in case you forget anything and need to reference to them. You can hide them in your pocket or another discreet place., Open the conversation by letting them know this is something you have considered and want to ask their permission for. Let them know that you want to tell them why, and that they can ask questions after. Try to control the conversation as much as possible. The more you are interrupted, the easier it will be for you to lose your place and forget what to say., One by one, tell your parents all the logical reasons you want to wear a thong and believe they should support you in this decision. Whether it is to hide panty lines, be more comfortable, avoid pimples, or any other number of reasons.


Try to get through your whole list without interruptions, but be polite if they do happen.
If you get resistance, offer to provide them with sources to back up your reasons. This way they know you are not making excuses.
Feel free to wing it if you come up with more reasons while you are talking with them. Do not feel like you have to stick to what you practiced from your notes.

, Once you have gone through your logical reasons you can appeal to their emotional side. Studies have shown that emotional arguments can be quite effective. Remind them that you are growing up, old enough to make decisions about how to adorn your own body., They may have questions so be prepared for that. Even if they do not, invite questions from them. Validate and answer every question they have to the best of your ability. Any question you cannot answer, offer to answer after some research or further thought.They might want to know why you are interested in wearing a thong. They may ask you why you feel like you are ready for a thong. They might even ask you why you think they should agree with you.They might ask about boys. What if they see you as a sex object? Why are you trying to flaunt yourself to them? It might be a good idea to have an answer prepared for this just in case., They might not have an answer for you right away. Offer to give them time to talk it over between the two of them and get back to you. This gives them time to ask questions or think about your well-thought out argument.

, Do not assume you know what they will say. Prepare yourself for the possibility that they will say “no” or drag the discussion out. It is a good idea to come up with possible solutions to those scenarios, even if they do not happen., Regardless of your parents’ response, it is important that you react in a calm and collected manner. They need to see that you are mature enough to make your own decisions. If they say, “no” now, they may be more likely to say, “yes” to the next decision based on your reaction.If they respond with an immediate “no”, don’t storm off in a huff or raise your voice. Listen to what they have to say, or suggest that they discuss the topic again later. The important thing is that you respond to them with respect. They may still come around.If you feel yourself getting upset, breathe. Check to see if your body is tensing up, and relax your body. If none of that works and everyone is still glaring at each other, tell a joke. Humor is a great way to defuse a tense situation., If they are still not convinced, ask them why. You may be able to address their concerns or counter their objections. If they do not want to talk about it anymore, at least you know the reason for future reference., If your parents will not budge, offer them a compromise. Maybe you can suggest revisiting the topic later after you have shown more responsibility. Perhaps you can agree to get a thong at a certain age. You can ask them what compromise works for them.Find out what your common interests are with them and work from there. You want to be seen as a grown-up, and they want to encourage your maturation, right? That’s a great place to start negotiating.Waiting until everyone is calm will make the process much easier. This is one conversation where you want to avoid dealing with too much emotion. Instead, try to stick to facts and needs. Be honest with them about your goals and offer a compromise that will please them but still get you what you ultimately want.

, If all else fails, accept your fate and walk away. Do not continue to beg or harass your parents. Doing that will only diminish any chance of convincing them later, and it will put them in a bad mood. Walking away from the argument with grace allows you to keep your parents’ respect."

Be sure about your decision.,
Do extensive research about getting a piercing.,
Explain the safety of the process.,
Tell your parents that piercings are temporary.,
Show your parents successful people with nose piercings.,
Explain why a piercing would be good for you.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Pierce Your Nose1," If you’re going to convince your parents that you’re ready for a piercing, you have to show them you’re mature. Mature people don’t back out of their decisions because they get bored with them. A piercing, especially a cartilage piercing, is a long-term commitment that requires daily maintenance.Make sure that you’re informed about the entire process in advance.


If you’re not sure whether your piercing will look good on you, put a dot on your face with a non-toxic marker. Wear it all day and check your face periodically to see if you like how it looks.
When in doubt, wait a few weeks. In the meantime you can do extra chores to help butter up your parents.;
, Your parents will have a lot of questions about your decision and you need to be able to answer them with confidence. By taking the initiative and getting informed, you’re showing them that you’re mature enough to handle a piercing.You need to know how much it costs, where to get it done, and how to take care of it afterwards.


For example, some piercers will tell you to rinse the piercing with a saline solution twice a day, while others will tell you to use Neosporin.
The price of a nose piercing will vary depending on where you live. They are generally more expensive in larger, popular cities than in small towns.

, Using your research as a guide, explain the various methods of aftercare to your parents and reassure them piercings are safe procedures. In the U.S. piercers and piercing shops have to finish an apprenticeship and take bloodborne pathogens classes.As long as you go to a certified, reputable piercer, you will be safe from scarring and bloodborne illnesses.


If your parents aren’t squeamish, show them videos of the procedure so that they know what to expect.

, Many parents are nervous about letting their children get piercings because they think piercings are permanent. If you follow the aftercare instructions that your piercer gives you, your piercing won’t leave a scar if you have to remove it. This means that a piercing won’t negatively affect your job prospects in the future.


If you need to take your piercing out for work but don’t want it to close, buy a nose piercing retainer. These acrylic studs keep your piercing open and are almost invisible.Your nose piercing can close up in a matter of hours. If you leave your ring out for too long, you will need to re-pierce your nose.

, Plenty of celebrities wear them, such as Solange Knowles and Kelly Clarkson.In the past, nose rings have been seen as unprofessional. However, nose piercings are much more common than they used to be. In younger generations they are now seen as cute accessories instead of extreme statements.


Choosing a smaller nose ring over a larger one may help show your parents that your nose ring is a harmless fashion statement.

, Your parents are interested in your well-being. If you can show them that a piercing would improve your self-esteem they are much more likely to let you get one. For example, fashion choices such as body piercings help you explore your own unique style.The more you know about your sense of style, the more confident you will be in your social circle.


Research has shown that self-expression can build confidence in teenagers. Nose piercings are a form of self-expression.

Go above and beyond with your daily chores.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Piercing," The very first step in convincing your parents to let you get a piercing, is to know exactly what piercing you want. Some of the more popular piercings are ear, belly-button, lip, and/or tongue. Each of these piercings comes in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Lists can be found online, or at a nearby piercing facility.For example, if you were to get a piercing in your ear, there are about 10-15 different places on your ear where the piercing could be located. This includes, the upper lobe, temporal lobe, inner conch, etc. Know exactly what type of piercing you want, and where you want it located.
In terms of piercing shape, you might want a barbell, a closed circle, an open circle, a plug, a flesh tunnel, etc.

Don't: start with a large or unusual piercing your parents are unlikely to allow.Do: consider piercings you've seen on your parents or their friends.
;
, Use phone books, or advertisement lists online to find a nearby facility. Look for ratings as given by customers, usually on a ""5 Star"" scale. Facilities that have lower than 4 stars should not even be considered. After you find one, go to the place in person to check it out. Note the cleanliness of the facility, and the attitude of the workers. Ask some customers in the store about their past experiences there, and write them down., Some of your friends have likely had experiences, either getting piercings, and/or having to convince their parents to get a piercing. They will be able to give you first hand knowledge about pain levels involved with the piercing, their preferences when it comes to jewelry, and where they have gone to get a piercing before.


Make sure to write this information down on a sheet of paper. You will want to add tidbits of what they had to say to your argument later on.

Don't: mention a friend your parents consider a ""bad influence.""Do: relay the facts you've learned from these conversations.


, Using clear and concise language, create a list of main reasons you feel you need and want a piercing. They can range from the mundane, to the very serious. Acknowledge both aesthetic (jewelry is pretty) and emotional (makes me feel good inside) reasons. After you have created a list, cross off anything that might be off-putting to your parents, and those which are not that important. Form those thoughts into coherent sentences, with nouns, adjectives, and verbs.For example: I want a black plug, on the temporal lobe of my ear. This is because it is a beautiful addition, as well as makes me feel more independent as a person.

, You can do this in front of a mirror, or in front of some of your friends. Try to memorize as much of the argument as you can so that it seems more convincing to your parents. Use a forceful, yet non-confrontational tone, when using specific words and/or points. Rather than just memorizing a script, add in additional phrases as you practice. Make the argument sound as convincing as possible. Practice at least 3-4 times.

, You will want have a picture of the exact piercing you want to get. Pictures of the facility you want to get your piercing at. Pamphlets and brochures concerning piercings. Medical statistics that cite the rate of infections among pierced individuals. The idea is to be more prepared than you have to be. If your parents have a question or inquiry, you want the information either in your head or at your fingertips.Note, you do not want to present medical statistics that run contrary to your argument. If you find that all the medical statistics are negative for a particular piercing, you should perhaps get it somewhere else.

, Your parents should be in a good mood when you sit them down. You will also want some time to yourself. Think about the research you have conducted. A rash or ill-advised decision is almost never a good one. Waiting an extra week, month, or year can give you time to prepare and think about what you are about to do.If you notice that they are yelling a lot, do not confront them yet. If they are dealing with a traumatic problem themselves, do not overburden them.

, Let them know that this is no joking manner. Use forceful language, and be assertive. Leaving notes is not as good as initially confronting your parents to let them know you want to talk. Set a time and day with them. You do not want to bombard them with information, but rather, set aside a particular time in which serious discussion can take place.Don't: mention the piercing yet. Give them time to wonder what it's about, and most parents will end up relieved.Do: say ""I want to talk to you about something serious. It's nothing bad, but it is important.""

, A great place to have a serious talk is in a living room or a bedroom. Dim the lighting so as to not distract. You also want to make sure your phones are off and put away. The T.V. should also not be on, which can be a major distraction as well. Make sure that you and your parents are seated close together so the talk isn't awkward.


You might want pillows around, which can feel better when you sit down. You want yourself, and your parents to be as comfortable as possible.

, You can list off your academic success, events you have volunteered at, or family members you have helped out. This is a great way to break the ice, and show your parents what you have achieved. This will ease the conversation into something more controversial like getting a piercing. After you have your parents warmed up, and reminded of your good deeds, they may be more receptive to what you are about to ask of them.


List all the A's and B's you have received recently in school. Tell them about the book reports you have written. Tell them that you are helping other kids with their schoolwork as well.
Volunteer activities, such as at a blood drive, or cleaning a road, show your parents that you are a responsible young adult.

Don't: go on for more than a few sentences, which can sound suspicious.Do: move on if your parents ask what this is about.


, Either read from your prepared statements, or speak from memory. Use your arms when you speak as to show emotion and engagement. Use clear, logical sentences. Remember to stay on point, and do not stray into other areas of conversation. If your parents interrupt, remind them that they will have a turn to ask questions later on. State your argument, give evidence, and then repeat your argument again.Don't: talk over your parents or patronize them.Do: say ""I know you have questions, I'd just like to tell you the details first.""

, Crying, weeping, and/or frowning shows your parents that you are unable to handle your emotions and, therefore, not mature enough to get a piercing. You want to be calm, cool, and collected. Speak with heart, but don't let it get to you. Present yourself as a clear thinking, rational adult, whom has facts to back up his/her argument., Give your parents the pictures and pamphlets you have collected. You can either disperse them individually as they come about during your argument, or give them to your parents at the end of your talk. Point out which item is which so that your parents are not confused. You want them to come back to these materials later on and know what to expect.If you want, you can read the pamphlets with them, or let them read and then ask you questions.

, The conversation is not one-sided. You want to get your parents engaged in a dialogue. Every time they ask a question, have a clear response ready. If your parents sense weakness, or a lack of research, they will seriously doubt your readiness to get a piercing. If you do not know an answer, you should refer them to specific websites where they can find the answer they are looking for. Do not leave them wondering, with doubt in their minds., A little extra push is sometimes needed to convince parents you are ready. Show them where the facility is. Take them inside, and introduce the person whom would be piercing you. Demonstrate to them how clean the place is. Show them pictures inside of the facility of people's past piercings. You can even let your parents talk to some of the customers there to get their comments about the facility and it's level of professionalism., Your parents might be okay with you getting a piercing if you can agree to some stipulations. This might involve boosting your grades in school, doing more chores around the house, or treating your siblings better. Together, write down on paper exactly the terms of the contract, and when you have to accomplish the goals by. If you meet the goals, you should be guaranteed a piercing., Sometimes one talk is not enough. Some parents are stubborn, while others are simply bad at listening to their children. However, don't let this get you down. Always remind them throughout the following days and weeks that a piercing is still important to you. Write them notes, perhaps better explaining your arguments. You can even schedule more serious talks in the future, and engage in further open dialogue with your parents.Don't: bring up piercings when your parents are in a bad mood.Do: show them new information, such as blogs written by parents in the same situation.

, Instead of having them wonder about the ""dangers"" of getting a piercing, bring them along with you. They will feel more comfortable standing by your side as you are getting a piercing. They might even want to get a piercing as well, thereby creating a family bonding moment.

, A sign of maturity is that you are taking responsibility for at least some of your finances. Many parents live paycheck to paycheck, and don't have the extra money to shell out for a piercing. Apply for a job, and save up your own money. Make sure you have enough to cover the piercing and the piece of jewelry you want. Tell your parents that you are willing to pay for part of, or the whole procedure out of pocket., You don't even have to talk with your parents to demonstrate your level of maturity. Do the laundry or the dishes without being asked. Volunteer to take out the trash, or pick up your brother from his soccer game. Spend more time with the family at game night, and/or go out to dinner with them. Be a real part of the family and show them you are taking on responsibility. They might then reciprocate, and reward you for your newfound level of maturation and standing.Don't: mention the piercing every time you do a chore.Do: continue to do extra chores for at least a short time after the piercing.

Try not to break any rules and try to take on more responsibilities; this will allow your parents to see you in a different light.Figure out small tasks that your parents would see as acting with responsibility. For example, add a chore like washing the dishes, or cleaning your room without having to be told to.
Always keep your promise. Nothing shows a lack of maturity more than not doing what you said you would do. Always do what you've promised--and more.;
, As early as the 18th century, people started seeing their hair as a form of self-expression.Explain to your parents that having long hair shows that you are not influenced by others, shows that you're confident enough to make important decisions, and explain that it would simply make you happier.Give examples that support your argument such as afros, mohawks, and dreadlocks. These are just a few examples of how people have used their hairstyle as a way to express who they are.
Explain that your uniqueness should not be hidden. When people try to change themselves to fit others' perspectives, it can be damaging to their self-esteem.Your parents wouldn't want that to happen. Right?

, Find well-known individuals with a ""clean image"" to help support your argument that there are many ""good people"" that have (or have had) long hair.


Some respected Hollywood actors with long hair include Johnny Depp, Chris Hemsworth, Hugh Jackman and Cole and Dylan Sprouse.
Don't limit your examples to modern celebrities. Try finding well-known people that your parents might know and respect. For example, singer David Bowie, former Beatle John Lennon or even the religious figure Jesus Christ.

, The goal is to remind them of their own hair battles in order to gain some sympathy from them.Your dad probably had either an afro or long hair back in the 60's, 70's or early 80's when they were in style. Even your mom may have had a hairstyle that her parents thought was taboo.


Even if you don't have pictures to support your argument, you can still make the case that your parents didn't always agree with their parents. The same argument can be made for clothes, cars, music and more. The goal is to make them remember how important these decisions can be.

, Your parents might argue that the bible forbids men from wearing their hair long.You can counter that argument by using the bible as well. Show your parents places where rules from the bible are not followed in today's society. Additionally, you can use text that supports your rights as a child.


For example, you can argue that the bible states that women should wear headdresses as a sign of submission to their husbands. Most modern women don't do this but they are not seen as being in opposition to the bible.Additionally, Ephesians 6:4 says, ""Do not exasperate your children."" Parents should take the biblical advice and learn to pick their battles with their children. According to the bible, parents should try not to apply too much control over minor issues in their children's lives., Parents might worry that you'll be called a girl or gay because your hair is long. Respond to this by reminding your parents that you are mature enough to not believe these sexist stereotypes. Also, reassure your parents that you are strong enough and confident enough to handle teasing.


Reassure your parents that you are able to assert yourself in the face of teasing. Show them that you are able to not only point out bullying, but to tell the aggressor to stop.Show your parents that you are mature enough to ignore bullying. By walking away or looking disinterested, you take away the bully's power and help stop the teasing., Tell your parents that this is discriminatory and that their is no correlation between the length of someone's hair and their professionalism.In addition, you can remind them that you're just a kid and that you can always cut your hair when it's time for you to move into the business world.


You can use women's hair as an example. Straight hair is often seen as more professional on women but that doesn't determine her capabilities.
Tattoos are also a great example of individuality, and their place in the business world is hotly debated. But remind your parents that their are doctors, teachers, and business people with tattoos. Their personal style is not a reflection of their abilities., Your parents may argue that people will think they are ""bad parents"" for allowing you to grow out your hair. But remind them that everyone will always have an opinion about parenting, and all that matters is if their children are safe, happy, and successful.


Remind your parents that they should be confident in their parenting and able to stand up to criticism and bullying--just like you.

, Never talk to your parents when they are angry or stressed--they'll be less likely to listen to your arguments, and even less likely to say yes to your requests.Plan ahead of time and choose a time that allows for a conversation that isn't tense or rushed.


Plan ahead of time by choosing both a time and place that will make you relaxed and comfortable.
It also helps to plan what you will say ahead of time. Choose your arguments, research your topics, and even write out a script to prepare yourself., Although it may be a topic about which you're passionate, avoid getting angry or begging. Try to speak in a level tone without raising your voice, and make sure you present your arguments--by stating the facts, you're able to avoid emotional appeals.


Avoid raising your voice, whining, interrupting, storming off, and slamming doors.If your emotions start to get the best of you, take a deep breath and take a small break from the conversation. Come back to it only when you are composed and ready to continue., I statements help you to make an assertive statement without the receiving party becoming defensive and closed off. Listen to your parents' argument, describe how you feel, how the decision affects you, and how you hope for it to change.


For example, you can start the conversation by saying ""I feel that I'm mature enough to grow out my hair.""
Follow it up with ""I feel like a child when I'm not allowed to make decisions about my personal style.""
Lastly say something like, ""I would like to grow my hair out to prove to you that I am still a responsible and mature individual.""

, Be willing to ""meet in the middle."" Not only does compromising show that you are mature, but it can keep both parties happy.Promise that you won't grow your hair any longer than shoulder length, or agree that you won't add any wild colors or styles.


Promise that you'll get your hair cut every once in a while, trim dead ends, keep your hair looking nice, etc.
Remind them, that long hair can always be cut, so it's not like you're trying to make a permanent change.
Use your long hair as a bargaining method. For example, tell your parents that you will cut your hair if your behavior worsens or you become irresponsible.

, If your parents say no, politely ask what it would take to change their answer into a yes. Avoid being annoying but be persistent. You can also ask for a ""delayed response,"" meaning asking your parents to revisit the answer later.If you receive a no, you have two options: obey your parents and cut your hair or disobey them and grow your hair out anyway.


Following your parents' wishes could work to your advantage in the end. You could use it as an argument to show how well-behaved and mature you have been--even when you didn't get your way.
Following your parents' wishes could also result in no change at all. They may prefer the way you look with haircuts and continue to require them.
If you choose to disobey your parents, they may look at it as a sign of rebellion and punish you for it.
It's not very likely that your parents will see your long hair and instantly fall in love with it.

Anticipate questions and concerns. This will help you plan out your slideshow.
If you’re having trouble thinking of potential concerns, ask a friend’s parent for input.

, Exercise your sense of showmanship by setting up a viewing area with seats and snacks. Introduce your slideshow by stating your purpose and asking them to hold all questions until the end.

In the conclusion the benefits to your audience could include chores you’ll perform in exchange for a piercing.

, Use your outline as a guide to write your letter. Keep the tone of your letter positive and reassuring.

Find a compromise.,
Wait until you’re eighteen.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Pierce Your Nose3," Instead of arguing with your parents, ask them why they’ve decided to say no.

Show them that you want to take responsibility and work for what you want.If your parents give you a clear way to improve, do it! By following through, you’re showing them that you’re ready for a piercing.
If this approach doesn’t work let a few months pass before you bring it up again.

, If there’s something your parents have always wanted you to do make a deal with them. For example, if your parents want you to get a summer job, ask them if they’d consider changing their mind after a summer of hard work. By following through you’ll show your parents that you’re mature and dedicated.


When in doubt, suggest a compromise including something that will directly benefit your parents. For example, you could clean out the garage or take out the trash more often.
Don’t suggest an exchange involving chores you already have. If you do those chores without being told, you’re more likely to get what you want anyway., This can be very difficult to do. However, most states in the U.S. don’t allow body piercing on minors without parental consent.If your parents aren’t on board, you’ll have to wait until you’re old enough to do it yourself. Fortunately, this will give you plenty of time to decide whether or not you really want that nose ring.


Never attempt to pierce your own nose. Piercings are extremely vulnerable to infections and should be handled by professionals.Buy a clip-on nose ring if you want to play with the look but can’t get a real piercing.

, Let your parents know the exact type and placement of the ear piercing you want. There are a lot of different types of ear piercings; show your parents you’ve researched and thought a lot about the placement and jewelry you can wear for it.For example, you can say: “I would really like a helix piercing, which is at the top cartilage part of the ear. There’s a store at the mall that I know has jewelry for this kind of piercing.”
If you know of any online stores with the jewelry you want for the piercing, show them to your parents. You can also show them a diagram of ear piercing placement to help them visualize what the piercing would be like on your ear or ears., Point out that your parents have given their permission for your previous ear piercings and this one will be no different.

You can say: “I’d like your permission to do this, but you don’t have to give me an answer right now. Can I ask you for your answer tomorrow?”If you try using the reasoning that you’ve gotten a piercing with their permission before and they say no, come back to them a couple weeks later with a new way to ask, like suggesting the piercing as a reward for good grades.

Exchange for chores or good grades.,
Offer to pay.,
Set limits.,
Let them come with you.,
Create a contract or agreement.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have Another Piercing in Your Ear3," Offer to clean your room and the kitchen every week, get all A’s and B’s on your next report card, or another similar deal that you and your parents can agree on in exchange for their permission. You can also participate in volunteer or extracurricular activities if that’s something your parents want you to do more of.


Give your parents something specific, both to show that you’re willing to work for what you want and that you can make specific goals. Rather than saying, “I’ll work on getting better grades,” say “I’ll get better grades in Math,” or whatever subject could use some improvement., Tell your parents that you’ll pay for the cost of piercing, jewelry, and cleaning supplies. Research all the costs ahead of time and save up your own money from an allowance or a job so you have the full amount ready to offer as soon as your parents agree to give their permission.


Try raising the money with a lemonade stand or other simple fundraising activity that your parents approve of.If you can’t save or raise the entire amount of money yourself, ask if your parents will match the amount of money you have or chip in the rest. Say: “Mom/Dad, I have enough money to pay for the piercing itself. Will you chip in for the cost of the jewelry?”, Promise not to get any more piercings after this one, or set a limit for the number of piercings that your parents are comfortable with. You can also agree with your parents on wearing a certain type of jewelry in the piercing, like smaller studs instead of dangly or large earrings.


If you are going for gauged ears, agree on a size that you won’t go over when stretching.You can even let your parents choose the jewelry you get pierced with, or choose the piercing place where you get it done.

, Tell your parents that they can come with you to the piercing place, either beforehand to check it out, during and throughout the piercing process, or both.


It may be a long-shot, but you can ask your parents if they want to get their own piercing with you! Depending on the type of people your parents are, they may appreciate this effort to include them and experience exactly what you’re experiencing.

, Whatever bargaining tactic you decide on or agreements you come up with with your parents, write it down or type it out as a way of showing them you are making a well-thought-out decision that you’re committed to sticking to.


Try making a checklist or a step-by-step process for everything you’ve agreed to do to get the piercing and what’s required afterward."

Define what you want.,
Describe clearly why you want dreadlocks.,
Think of people your parents admire who had them.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get Dreadlocks2," If you want to be extra persuasive when you talk with your parents, you need to know as much about dreadlocks as possible.


Learn exactly what they are. Dreadlocks are created by sectioning the hair carefully and then backcombing it. The hair is then twisted and secured. Eventually, your hair will be “trained” to the style. Find photos or Internet links with examples of styles you are suggesting. Having something concrete to show your parents will help them visualize you with the new hairstyle. If left to their imagination, they will think of the worst possible outcome.
Figure out how you will take care and style them. That way, you can say something like, “I’ve already researched the shampoo or wax I plan to use, and it is very affordable, easy to obtain, etc.”

, If you can fully explain your desire for dreads, your parents will take your request more seriously. Otherwise, they could just dismiss your request as a passing fad.


If your primary motivation is individuality, focus on that. Say something such as, “I want to set myself apart from my friends. My clothing choices are already unique, and I want to go a step further.”
Perhaps you are moved by a newfound religious faith and want to express that through wearing dreadlocks. Some followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Rastafarianism believe that dreadlocks show an aversion to the material world and a fuller devotion to the creator. , If you can remind your parents that someone they respect (such as Bob Marley, Whoopi Goldberg, Lenny Kravitz, or Stevie Wonder) has worn dreads, they may be more open to the idea of you having them."
"
Write down your thoughts.,
Educate your parents.,
Tell them how you expect to care for your dreads.,
Stick to the topic.,
Keep your emotions in check.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get Dreadlocks3," After you’ve figured out exactly why you want dreads, gather your thoughts and put them to paper. Then, you’ll be prepared to effectively make your case to your parents.

, You may be surprised that your parents don’t really know much about dreadlocks.


Tell them how dreadlocks are created.
Let them know whether you expect to style them yourself or go to a salon. Saying something like, “I’ve found this great hair shop that will style dreadlocks for a reasonable price,” lets your parents know you are serious and have done your research.

, If your parents are unfamiliar with the style, they may not know how easy they are to care for once you have them.


Bring a list of salons or hair shops in your area that specialize in dreadlocks. Your parents may be reassured knowing that your hair will be cared for properly.
Show them samples of shampoos or other styling products (wax) that you plan to use with your dreads.

, If your parents are really opposed to your dreadlocks, it will be easy to stray from that discussion and just argue with them.


Your argument will be strengthened if you only talk about your desire for dreadlocks, rather than focusing on other differences you may have with your parents.
Gently nudge your parents back to the topic if they stray away from it.

, It will be challenging not to get frustrated or upset if the discussion does not go well. However, if you remain as calm as possible, you will be perceived as more persuasive.


If the discussion becomes heated, suggest taking a 5-minute break. You could go for a short walk to calm down during this time.
A good strategy for calming your parents could be to thank them during this time for taking the time to discuss this with you.

"
"
Remain calm while listening to their objections.,
Work hard to really understand their concerns.,
Remind them that dreadlocks are not permanent.,
Explain that dreadlocks are actually a clean hairstyle.,
Negotiate and compromise until you receive a “Yes,” from your parents.,
Thank your parents for listening to you and for giving you the chance to express yourself in a mature way.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get Dreadlocks4," If necessary, take some deep breaths or count slowly to ten to distract yourself from your anger or frustration.


If you don’t react poorly, they may be more willing to work with you on this.
Actively listen to them. Repeat their concerns in your own words so that you are clear about their objections.

, If you can put yourself in their shoes, you may figure out a way to calm them and make them feel better about your decision.


Maybe they’re concerned people will judge them because of your dreads. If that’s the case, say something like, “Mom, everyone knows how great you are. I don’t think that will change based on a particular hairstyle I choose.”
If they’re concerned about notions that dreads go hand-in-hand with a drug-fueled lifestyle, tell them, “I am the same kid I was yesterday. I just want to choose a new hairstyle, not a new lifestyle.”

, Unlike tattoos or piercings, other current ways to express individuality, dreadlocks can easily be removed if you change your mind about them in the future.

, Many people, including parents, mistakenly think that dreadlocks are dirty or smell. By gently informing them this is incorrect, you could help persuade them.


Educate them that dreadlocks are not a magnet for bugs, as some say.
Tell them that those with dreadlocks should actually wash their hair twice a week, because clean hair is more easily styled into dreads than dirty hair.Show them the research you have done on maintaining dreadlocks in a clean, hygienic way and promise them you will keep your hair neat and clean once you have your dreads.

, During the negotiation process, be open to their suggestions. They may be willing to strike a bargain with you so that everyone is happy with the result.


If necessary, tell them you are willing to wait a month or two before styling your dreadlocks to show them that this is not a passing whim on your part.
Ask them if there is anything else you can do to convince them of your decision. They may suggest additional research or more chores around the house.
Be open to compromising on the length of your dreads. Your parents may be more open to a shorter style.
Suggest that you get temporary dreadlocks so that they can see how they look on you. , By being respectful throughout the process and ending with a real expression of gratitude, you set yourself up for good discussions with your parents in the future.

Ask a friend or older sister first.,
Ask calmly and politely.,
Understand their reasoning.,
Give them time.,
Put them in your situation.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Shave Your Legs As a Preteen1," Talk to a friend who has already started shaving about how they convinced their parents to let them start. Ask an older sister, if you have one, what she said to your parents that worked.


You can ask questions like: What did your parents respond well to? How did they react? What age were you? Did you have to make a deal with them?
You can even have a sister, friend, or friend’s parents talk to your parents if you need help later to convince them.;
, Sit your parents down for a talk in the living room or dining room, or wherever you’re comfortable having a conversation. If you don’t want to make it a big deal, you can slip the question into a casual conversation about something else.


If you sit your parents down for a serious discussion, you can start with something like: “Mom, Dad, I want to talk to you about something. I’m starting to grow hair on my legs, and I’d really like to shave it. Will you give me permission to buy a razor and start shaving?”
If you want to slip a question about shaving into another conversation like an upcoming trip to a pool or waterpark, for example, you can say: “Yeah, I want to wear my new blue bathing suit to the pool, but I just feel really uncomfortable about showing my legs. All the other girls are shaving them and mine are hairy. Do you think it would be okay if I shaved mine?”
If you’re too embarrassed by talking to them in person at all, you can even send them an email or text with your request to shave., Listen carefully to what your parents have to say about why they don’t want you shaving yet if they say no. Don’t use their reasons to start an argument or complain that they’re not fair. Instead, consider what they say and see if you can use it to do your own research and come up with a new, mature argument that you can use after some time has passed.


For example, if your parents say they don’t like the risk of you cutting yourself with a razor, you can do some research into alternative methods like waxing or hair removal cream, and show them what you find. If they are concerned about the expense of razors, start saving up money so you can offer to pay for all the supplies yourself.

, Let your parents have time to consider your question, ask their own questions, and give you an answer.


You can even tell them not to answer right away by saying, “I don’t even want you to say yes or no right now. Please consider my request carefully and I’ll come back to you tomorrow for your answer.”

, Ask your parents to imagine what it’s like to be in your position, where you have hair in new and weird places, friends your age who are already shaving their legs, and you feel like you have to hide your hairy legs all the time.


Ask what they would do in your situation. Chances are they’ll remember what it was like when they were preteens and have more sympathy for your situation.
Don’t push it. Even if your parents had similar feelings and experiences as a preteen, they may still have important reasons as parents to say no.

"
"
Remind them that age doesn’t matter.,
Bring up peer pressure or bullying.,
Let them know it’s uncomfortable.,
Mention your activities.,
Tell them it will boost your self-confidence.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Shave Your Legs As a Preteen2," If your mom uses an argument that she or an older sister didn’t start shaving until a certain age, point out that girls start growing body hair at very different times, can have darker or thicker hair that shows up more, or just don’t have the same circumstances with friends at school or other pressure to shave. Just because things are happening to you at an early age doesn’t mean they’re less valid.


You can tell your parents that puberty, when body hair starts growing, is happening at a younger and younger age on average, which explains why your mom or older sister might not have had to deal with it until later than you.
Reference friends that started shaving at even younger ages than yours, pointing out that it just depends on each body and hair.

, Let your parents know if other girls are pressuring you to shave your legs or bullying you about the fact that you don’t. They may let you start for this reason, and they may also give you valuable advice about dealing with bullies or peer pressure.


Tell your parents exactly what other girls are saying or what they’re doing to make you feel bad about not shaving. Be honest because your parents can help.

, Tell your parents that your leg hair causes you discomfort, either because you’re embarrassed to show it or because it makes you feel itchy or hot.


Point out that you have to wear pants or tights even when it’s very hot out because of your embarrassment, and that this is very uncomfortable or even dangerous in high temperatures.

, Bring up the fact that you are about to go to summer camp, start lifeguard training, or participate in a sport for which you’ll be wearing shorts all the time. Let them know this is an ideal time to start shaving.


Point out that shaving your leg hair will help you to focus on and enjoy your activities more.

, Let your parents know that you want to do this for YOU and not anyone else. Assure them that you don’t want to shave to impress boys. Even if your motivation is just to fit in with other girls, explain that having self-confidence and being comfortable with your own body is really important for you and for all girls.You can say, “I just think having smooth, shaved legs will feel good and make me more comfortable with my body.”

Use a method they’re okay with.,
Show that you know about health and safety.,
Agree to a tutorial.,
Start with other body hair.,
Offer to pay.,
Agree to shave part of your leg.,
Be willing to wait.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Shave Your Legs As a Preteen3," Talk to your parents and agree on a method for removing your leg hair if they’re concerned about the safety of shaving. Buy razors with nourishing strips and multiple blades to avoid cuts, or opt for waxing or a hair removal cream like Veet to avoid razors altogether.You can also opt for electrolysis or laser hair removal treatment later in life, but this is definitely an option to wait on till you are older and have enough money for the procedure.

, Make a deal with your parents that you’ll do all the research about the health and safety risks of shaving and show them that you understand how to prevent those risks before you can start.


Let them know that you understand shaving can cause razor burn or bumps, nicks and cuts, and even skin infections or painful ingrown hairs, and that you should use sharp and clean razors with shaving cream or soap and water to prevent these problems., Allow your parents to give you a short shaving lesson either from them, an older sister, or a video. Make them feel more comfortable with you shaving by letting them control the information you get about doing it safely.


You can even offer or agree to have your parents there with you while you shave the first couple of times. Consider sacrificing a little bit of privacy for what you want.

, If you haven’t started shaving your underarm hair, ask your parents if you can start doing that first. Get them comfortable with the idea that you’re shaving at all by doing it to a smaller area of the body, and then they should soon work up to the idea of you shaving your legs, too.


If you do already shave your underarm hair, you can use this to show your parents that you are already mature enough to shave safely. Make the point that doing the same to your legs is really no different.

, Make an agreement with your parents to pay for any of the equipment you need to start shaving, like a razor and razor blades, shaving cream or gel, waxing strips, or hair removal cream. Save up your own money from an allowance or job for this.


Offer to pay either for the first round of supplies, or for all shaving products in the future.
Make a payment plan with your parents if you need to pay them back for supplies by agreeing to a certain amount taken out of your allowance every week, for example.

, Start out by shaving your legs below the knees only if your parents are okay with just that. This is where hair is usually darkest and more noticeable anyway.Your parents might also ask you not to shave more than a certain number of times per week or something similar, which you should follow.

, If they won’t say yes right away, agree with your parents on a time when you can start shaving, or when you can bring up the issue again for them to reconsider. Show your parents that this means a lot to you by being patient and waiting until the agreed-upon time to ask again or get an answer.Schedule and write down a time that everyone agrees with so you won’t forget and can remind each other.

Accept your parents’ answer.,
Try to enjoy not having to shave.,
Embrace your leg hair as a good thing.,
Know that most people don’t notice leg hair.,
Stand up to peer pressure.,
Wear pants or tights.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Shave Your Legs As a Preteen4," If your parents don’t give their approval to you to start shaving, simply accept their decision without complaining or getting angry. Recognize that they only have your best interests at heart and there will come a time when they feel it’s right for you to start shaving.


Thank your parents for their time listening to you. They will be much more likely to say yes at a later time if you deal with rejection in a mature and respectful way the first time.

, Know that many parents, especially mothers, will try to delay you from shaving as long as possible simply because they know that once you start, shaving quickly becomes an annoying burden and waste of time.


Imagine waking up an extra 15 minutes early in the morning, or having to take the time to shave when you’re late for a pool party or want to wear shorts but need your legs to be smooth first. Shaving is an on-going chore and time commitment.

, Know that body hair is natural and considered very beautiful on women in many countries. It’s your decision, and you can choose not to shave at all.


Know that shaving has no hygiene benefits. Shaving does not benefit your health or hygiene and is not required in any way. In fact, body hair holds good bacteria that can help you ward off dirt and illness.Shaving only makes your hair grow back more prickly and sometimes darker and coarser. Note that once you shave for the first time, your leg hair may be more noticeable than it was before and have to be shaved more and more often.

, Consider the fact that most people don’t even see or notice your leg hair! Even if it seems like you’re the only one who doesn’t shave, many people won’t ever be close enough to your legs to notice, or won’t even care!

, Don’t let other girls pressure you into feeling like shaving your legs is a requirement or necessary to fit in.


Try finding a friend who doesn’t shave yet either and teaming up with her to show other girls it’s okay not to shave.You can tell other girls that you don’t care or you don’t want to shave your legs, or you can tell them about the negative effects that you know, like razor burn or hair coming back in thicker and darker after shaving.

, If you really can’t deal with having your legs exposed without feeling embarrassed, cover them up with tights or pants.


You can also wear tall boots and leave the rest of your legs bare, as most of the hair is usually on the bottom of your legs.

Speak clearly and directly.,
Strike the right tone.,
Don’t push your luck.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Get a Video Game," They might have a number of reasons why they don’t want to have a video game, so you’ll need to be prepared to refute all of their arguments. Make a thorough list of all the reasons you can think of that they would say no to your request. Draw from previous arguments they may have made about video games to help flesh out your list. Some example might be:


Too violent
Too expensive
You didn’t play with the last game they bought you
You’re not doing well enough in school to get a new video game
You spend too much time playing video games;
, When you’re in the heat of the moment during a conversation with your parents, you might not be able to think as quickly or as clearly as you’d like. It’s always best to plan your points ahead of time. Write down all of your refutations of your parents objections and commit them to memory, so you’ll remember them when you need them.


Point out that there’s research that suggests that playing action-oriented video games actually improves people’s ability to process information quickly.Point out that interacting with technology is an important part of life that’s actually necessary for employment these days.,

The order in which you present the points of your argument is very important, so you should place them in the best possible order in an outline before you talk to your parents. Because they will likely say “no” at first, you want to put the most important parts of your argument at the beginning. End your argument with the most positive points of your argument, including promises for how you will earn this privilege.

Some examples of early/major points might be: a demonstration that you understand the difference between violence in video games and in real life; promising to get a part-time job to help pay for the game; promising to adhere to a strict schedule so that you don’t spend too much time playing the game; promising to raise your grades
Some examples of closing/minor points might be: promising to give the game up if you fail to meet any of the more important terms of the agreement, such as letting your grades slip; promising to do extra chores around the house for a month or two as added incentive; etc.

, Speaking from notes allows you to make more eye contact with your audience, which makes them trust and believe more in you. It also makes you look like you know your argument inside and out, and that you’re speaking from conviction. However, speaking from notes is a difficult task to master, so if you’re more comfortable, just write out your argument like an essay for school. You can read from it when you talk to your parents.


Speaking notes should outline your argument as concisely as possible, without too much detail. You don’t want to look like you’re reading your whole argument; you want just enough detail to spark your memory so you can explain the point in your own words.Use symbols or visual clues on your outline to help jog your memory more easily and quickly than words. For example, you might put words that you want to speak slowly, with great emphasis, in bold. You might leave a blank line or a line of asterisks where you want to take a pause for emphasis.

, You want to be as familiar with your points as you possibly can be before talking to your parents. Present your argument from your notes or speech where your parents can’t hear you.


Deliver your presentation into a mirror so you can practice making eye contact with your reflection.

, Don’t drop your request on them out of the blue. Instead, bring up the game without asking them for it for a week or so. Tell them, in casual conversation, that you tried out this new game at a friends house, and that it was so much fun! They’ll probably know that you’re buttering them up for your actual request, but at least they won’t be surprised when you ask them.

, Actually, they’ll probably be able to tell that you’re trying to slide a request in under the radar, and get mad at you for being sneaky. Find a time when your parents are relaxed and in a good mood, and can focus on talking with you for a few minutes.

, When it comes to decisions like this, both parents are going to have to agree on the purchase. Even if one parent is more likely to say yes if you approach them alone at first, he or she will still have to run it by the other parent before buying the game. It’s better to just talk to both of your parents at once, like ripping off a bandaid.

, Ask them ahead of time to let you give your full presentation without any interruptions. Show them the speech or presentation notes you’ve prepared for this discussion; hopefully, they’ll be so impressed, they’ll start softening their position on the video game issue before you even begin your argument!


If you don’t feel comfortable speaking from notes, feel free to type out a full speech and read it directly off the page.

, When making an argument, you have to make sure that your parents can hear and understand you! Speak loudly, and make as much eye contact with your parents as you can without losing your place in your presentation.

, The last thing you want to do is undo all your hard work and preparation by sounding rude or childish. Being polite and respectful throughout demonstrates to your parents that you’re taking the discussion seriously, and that you’re mature enough to have your request granted.


If your parents say no at first, don’t immediately lose your temper. The argument’s not lost yet! Calmly consider any reasons they may give you for their refusal, and do your best to offer solutions to their concerns.

, Even after all your hard work, your parents might still say no. If that’s the case, you should drop the issue after exhausting the argument. Nagging them will only irritate your parents and make them less likely to grant the next request you make.

If you show you are mature in life, it might help your parents see you are mature enough for an iPad., You don’t want to ask your parents if they are in a bad mood or angry. If your mom or dad is really rushed, it is probably not the best time to ask for something.Asking around a holiday or birthday might improve your chances of getting the iPad.

, Your parents might not want to give you the iPad because they will see it as just another toy or game console. Mention features of the iPad they might like for you to help convince them to get you one.

I know it is a lot to ask, but I was wondering if I can have an iPad.”, When you ask for the iPad, offer to pay for some of it with any money you have or to give your parents payments. You can also offer to work off the iPad by doing extra chores around the house.


In example, “Mom, I really want an iPad, but I don’t have enough money. If I pay for part of it with my leftover birthday money and do extra chores around the house, can you buy it for me?”, Don’t pressure your parents to give you an answer right away. Instead, tell them to think about it. Otherwise, they will be more likely to say that you can't have it.


Tell your parents to think about it and then give them space to decide.
Say something like, “Mom, you don’t have to answer right away. Take time to think about it.”, In a mature way, figure out why they said no and it might turn their answer around to a yes. When they explain why they don’t want you to have an iPad, ask what you can do to change.


In a calm manner say something like, “Okay. That is completely fine. What is the reason you don’t want me to have an iPad?”
Do what they want you to do before you ask again. In example, if they say you need to get better grades first, then work on your grades and ask them again when your grades improve., If the reason your parents don’t want to get you an iPad is because of money, suggest similar options. There are other tablet brands that are less expensive than iPads that you can suggest instead. There are also used iPads that are less expensive than new iPads.

, Don’t whine, cry, or get upset if they say no. If you show your parents that you can handle it when they say no, they will be impressed. Be mature and stay calm. An iPad is expensive and a big responsibility. If they don’t think you are ready to handle it, then you need to respect that.

If you can show your parents how Instagram will benefit your life and creativity then they will be much more likely to let you get an account. Luckily, because Instagram is a photography site, it is easy to show your parents the benefits of the site:


You want to practice photography.
You want to explore famous photographers and locations.
You and your friends capture and share special moments together online., Instagram is an inherently creative app -- you get to take photos and edit the brightness, contrast, saturation, cropping, filter effects, and much more. This makes it different from other, more gossipy social media sites, and you should remind your parents of these differences.


Show them professional accounts, like National Geographic or the Food Network, that match up to your interests. There is incredible art and photography on Instagram that your parents may not be aware of.

, Knowing that this conversation is taking place in living rooms across the world, Instagram has put together a helpful guide for parents to help them and their children navigate the service. The guide discusses what Instagram is, ways to fight common concerns, and the potential pros and cons of the app.


You can find the guide in multiple languages through the Instagram Help Center → Privacy & Safety Center → Tips for Parents., Help them set up an account and let them follow you, which lets them feel like they can be a part of your Instagram and eases their concerns.

Look them in the eyes and invite them to ask you questions. If they feel like you are reasonable and responsible then Instagram will seem reasonable and responsible as a result.Make eye contact.
Keep your voice calm and collected.
Agree with them on certain points, even if you have a ""counter-point.""
Focus on you and your trustworthiness, not the shadow of ""evil"" online lurkers.

, If they say yes, thank them and give them a quick hug. Stay true to any promises you made about the account and start enjoying Instagram. If they say no, let them know that you understand their decision, but would love to talk to them a little more about Instagram later. Assure them that the site is safe and ask them if they would be willing to do a little more research -- the Instagram Help Center, for example, has an entire section on ""Tips for Parents.""

, If you want to increase your changes of getting a ""Yes,"" pick a good time to talk. A PlayStation is a big purchase and your parents will have a lot of questions and concerns. Asking them when they're already busy is a bad idea.


You can talk to your parents at times when you're both free. When they're driving you home from school, for example, you could bring up the issue. You could also ask them after dinner.Ask if it's a good time to talk first. Even if you don't realize it yourself, your parents may be busy or stressed.

Do you think it's something you guys would consider buying for me?""Your parents care about you and want to understand you. They probably dislike conflict as much as you do. Therefore, explain why you want the PlayStation. Pick reasons that will appeal to your parents. ""I think it'll be really fun"" may sound like a petty reason. Instead, try saying something like, ""I work really hard at school and in my extracurriculars. I think I would benefit from having a new hobby.""It may be helpful to assure your parents you'll use the device responsibly. Say something like, ""I promise I'll only play after I'm done with my homework. If you want, I can agree to only play for an hour or two a day.""

For example, say your parents are worried about the level of violence in video games. Respond with something like, ""I definitely understand why that would be a concern for you. I would be open to allowing you to screen the games I pick. If there's anything you feel is inappropriate, I'll go with a different game.""

, In the event your parents do say no, accept the answer. Arguing or complaining will only frustrate your parents. If you're respectful of their decision, this shows maturity. They may soften them. In a few months, try bringing up the issue again. Say something like, ""I know you said 'No' last time, but I still really want a PlayStation. Would you be willing to reconsider.""

, Oftentimes, asking your parents directly can be stressful. If your parents are often argumentative and shut down discussion, try writing a letter. You can state your case, explaining why you want a PlayStation. You should also state why you think you're responsible enough to have a game console.


Start the letter by directly stating what you want. Open with something like, ""Dear Mom and Dad, I would really like a PlayStation for the living room."" Proceed to explain why. It can be something like, ""I work really hard at school and do a lot of extracurriculars. At the end of the day, after finishing my homework, I would like to have something I can use to relax.""Do you have anything else that can help you make your case? For example, maybe you have some money saved up. You can say something like, ""I have saved up almost $100 from my birthday money and my allowance. I would be more than willing to put this money towards a PlayStation.""You should also think of any potential responses your parents may come up with and think of a counterargument. For example, maybe your mother is the type to worry about you wasting your time with video games. Write something like, ""I know you probably worry about me spending all my time playing video games. If you allowed me to get a PlayStation, I would be happy to have you and Dad decide how long I can use it each day.""End the letter respectfully. Thank your parents for taking the time to read it and ask them to get back to you. For example, ""I hope you'll take this all into consideration. Thank you for reading this letter.

Otherwise, you can get jobs around the neighborhood, cleaning up yards for people, mowing lawns, or babysitting.
Ask your parents if you can open up a bank account. This will prove that you are committed to good money management.

, Don’t be afraid that they will think that you are trying to trick them. Let them know that your new responsibility is for a reason, and it will not stop once you get the iPod.


Say, “I’ve been taking the iPod really seriously. I’ve been taking up new responsibilities so that you know that I am not taking it too lightly. I realized that responsibilities are not that difficult, so I promise I will keep doing them if you decide to buy me the iPod.”

Find good deals.,
Prove that the iPod touch is a valuable tool.,
Prove you will use it.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have an iPod Touch2," You can find refurbished iPods for much cheaper than new ones. If you can prove to your parents that you can find a good deal, it might be easier to persuade them. A good idea is to show them the difference in prices. Say, “I don’t need a new iPod. If you get a refurbished one, you can get $50 off. That’s 25% off of the original price!”

, Your parents might think that the iPod touch is just an expensive toy. Prove to them that you can use it in multiple ways. Tell them that you can use it as a calculator, an organizer for homework, and a pocket camera incase you see something you want to take a picture of.


There are dozens of apps available on the app store that can boost your productivity, from note-taking to scheduling.Show your parents some examples of apps online. Mention how they could help you keep track of your schoolwork. Say, “The iPod can make staying organized fun!”

, Nobody likes to see a gift that was used once and then forgotten. Make sure to let your parents know that you won’t use the iPod for a week and then forget about it.


It’s good to prove to your parents that the new tool will just help you do the things you already do, but better. Say, “I’ll be able to use the iPod as my planner, and it will give me reminders for when to do my homework.”
Remind your parents of all the other things that you like to do. Say, “I really like listening to music as I walk to school. And I take pictures of my friends all the time! With the iPod, it would all be in one place!”.

Get an allowance.,
Get a job.,
Get a bank account or a piggy bank.,
Offer to help pay for the iPod.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have an iPod Touch3," See if your parents would be able to pay you weekly in exchange for chores and good behavior.


Your parents may only want to pay you to do certain chores. This is okay too-- every bit adds up.
Mention that you are saving up for something specific, not asking for extra spending money.

, You can work part time when you are fourteen, but if you are younger you can still work around your neighborhood.


Families are often looking for babysitters, so it’s a good idea to find parents and ask if they need any help watching their kids.
People often need help with yardwork, especially lawn mowing. You can go door to door asking if people need any work done on your yard.

, If you are going to save money, you should make sure that you won’t spend it on anything else. Ask your parents to help you set up bank account, or at least keep your money in a place where you can’t get to it.


Tell your parents you want to learn how to save money. They will appreciate your effort.
A bank account is a great way to keep your birthday and holiday money safe.

, Once you have $75, you have enough money to pay for half of a refurbished iPod.Approach your parents and tell them that you’ve saved enough money to pay for half of the iPod, and ask them if they would be willing to pitch in the other half.


Let them know how long you have been saving up. Say, “I’m taking the expense of the iPod very seriously. I’ve been saving up for three months in order to help pay for it.”

"
"
Find a good time to ask.,
Ask in a good place.,
Be reasonable.,
Set ground rules.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have an iPod Touch4," A good time to ask for an iPod is near a birthday or Christmas or another holiday. If you do ask for one around those times, don't ask for a lot. Your iPod will be your ""big"" present.


If your parents have been arguing or talking a lot about money, it is not a good time to ask for an iPod. Wait until you stop hearing those kinds of conversations.
Don’t stress that you need the iPod immediately. Instead say, “I know that maybe I can’t get this immediately, so I was thinking that I could wait for a few months, or until my birthday.”

, If you can ask when you can have a long discussion, your results will be better than if you ask when your parents are rushed or irritated.


Car rides are a good time to ask, since your parents will be sitting for a long time.
If you spend time doing chores together, like washing dishes, your parents might be able to spend more time talking to you.

, If your parents say that the iPod is too expensive, they may not be able to afford it. Wait a few months, and try to save up some money before asking again.


Do not whine or complain that everyone else has an iPod. Instead, revisit previous steps, and try to demonstrate why having the iPod would be useful to you.
If your parents turn you down without much explanation, do not be too aggressive. Wait a month or so, and then casually bring up the reasons that you would like an iPod again.

, If your parents seem like they might say yes, but have some reservations, make sure that they know how responsible you will be.


Let them know that you will not be distracted while your parents want you to be paying attention to them. Say, “I won’t let the iPod distract me from what is important. I won’t use the iPod when you’re talking to me either.”
Make sure they know that your schoolwork won't suffer either. Say, “I know that you might be worried that I won’t pay attention in class. I really only want the iPod for my down time, or when I’m waiting for the bus. I won’t use it during school.”

Come up with good reasons for getting a Wii.,
Come up with a sensible budget for paying for the Wii.,
Come up with some other trade-offs in return for getting a Wii.,
Show your parents that you are responsible.,
Ask your parents nicely for a Wii.,
Give your parents power.,
Keep offering incentives and power until your parents agree, even if you can only play it for an hour a month.,
Make a written contract.,
Follow the rules of your agreement and have fun playing the Wii.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Wii," This is the first hurdle––convincing your parents that having a Wii is worth the cost and the time you'll spend on it. Some reasons might include:


There are exercise games you can play, which will help to keep you fit indoors during the colder months. You can tell them it is better than most game consoles because you exercise a little. It also helps with hand-eye coordination.
It's more affordable than some of the other game consoles.
Find some of the games you plan to play on it to show your parents. This may help convince them that the games are suitable and not too violent or too mature, depending on what you select.
You see having a Wii as one option among other activities, and that you will still participate in sport, playing outdoors, reading, doing hobbies, etc. Reassure them that you won't spend all of your time on the Wii.;
, This is a chance to show your parents that you're responsible and willing to help either pay for some of the Wii or to do things in return for being given a Wii. When negotiating, first offer your parents the conditions possible fair options for you to contribute toward a Wii. These could include:


Paying for part of it yourself. This will show your parents how much you want the game system.
You could also offer to treat the entire purchase as a loan and pay it back over time.
Promising to pay for the games and other add-ons to the Wii out of your own funds.

, These could include:


Improving your grades.
Doing extra chores.
Quitting doing something that aggravates your parents.
Any other incentive that would make your parent happy.

, Do your chores, take out the garbage and clean your room without being asked to do so. Get good grades, do your homework as soon as you arrive from school, behave in class, etc.

, Don't whine or beg, ask them maturely, as if you were an adult. If they say yes, read no further! But, if they said no, you will have to begin negotiations.

, This may be the most important step. Agree on how many hours you can play the Wii before you even get it and what days you can play it on. Give them the right to take away the Wii if you fail to fulfill the conditions you offered them. Promise that you will get off when they tell you to. Tell them they can play it whenever they want to.

, You can work out a new deal once you have the Wii and your parents see how responsible you are.

, Put a deal on the contract and have both you and your parents sign it. Make a copy of it so both parents have one.

, After a week or two, you can try to re-negotiate again if you choose to.

Stay calm.,
Give her some time.,
Bring up the topic at a later time.",How to Ask Your Mom for Birth Control," You might be interested in birth control but unsure of what kind would work best for you. The most common form of medical birth control is the pill, but there are other options that contain fewer hormones. The most common forms of birth control are:IUDs
Birth control patches
Birth control pills
Birth control shot
Condoms;
, Before you talk to your mom, find out about the ways that birth control affects your body and the changes it can make, both positive and negative. Some of the benefits of different forms of birth control are listed below:In addition to preventing pregnancy, hormonal birth control like the pill, patch, shot or IUD can prevent ovarian cysts and cancer, bone thinning, iron deficiency, acne, and PMS.
Condoms and dental dams prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

, Use the information from your research to prepare your argument for your mom. If you come to her with knowledge and facts, she might be more willing to give in to your request, as you will seem more mature and thoughtful. Compile a list of all of the reasons you want birth control. Think ahead about the reasons that she might not want you to get on birth control and plan rebuttals for those concerns.


For instance, perhaps your mom doesn’t want you to get on birth control because she is afraid that you will gain weight like she may have. Find some birth control options that do not cause weight gain.

, You might be very nervous to broach this topic with your mom, which is understandable. You can calm your nerves by practicing in the mirror beforehand. Practice delivering your pitch for why you should get birth control until you can do so without stammering or saying “um.”


Consider practicing with a friend if you feel comfortable.

, If you have friends who have asked for birth control, find out how they did it and if they were successful. Consider consulting with friends who have mothers similar to yours so that you can develop the best approach.


You might say “Hey, aren’t you on birth control? I know your mom is just as strict as mine so how did you convince her?”

, Before you speak to your mom, you will need to prepare yourself for her reaction. If you have a mother who is very religious, then she might react very strongly, particularly if she is just learning that you are sexually active.


If you feel that your mom might kick you out of the house because of this request, then you might want to wait until you are a bit older. If it is worth it to you, then make sure that you have somewhere else to stay for the time being.
Your mom might also feel confused or even sad at your request. Think about what her reaction might be so you can be better prepared.

, If you are truly serious about getting on birth control, you will have to have a talk with your mom at some point. Ask your mom if she has some time to talk soon.After she gets off work, you might say “Hey Ma, can we talk later on tonight? I have something I wanted to run by you.”
Don’t text her while you are at school or early in the morning asking to talk later. Avoid leaving her in suspense so that she doesn’t worry.

, The most difficult part of having the conversation is starting it. Make sure that you are in quiet and private location when you have this talk, away from your other siblings. Start by saying something like “So, I really wanted to talk to you today about me getting on birth control.”, Explain to your mom all the reasons why you want to get on birth control. This will help guide her as she is making her decision on whether or not to allow you. Be very honest with her; if you want to get on birth control because you are having sex, you should tell her this. If she finds out you are keeping secrets, she will be less likely to trust you to make important decisions like this.


Perhaps you don’t want birth control for contraceptive purposes and are interested in it only to regulate your period. Tell your mom this.

, In addition to the health benefits, one of the most important outcomes of birth control is preventing pregnancy. If you are still at the point that you have to ask your mom for permission to get on birth control, then you probably are not at the stage in your life to have your own child. If you are sexually active, tell your mother about this concern of yours. She very likely does not want you to have a child at this time, either., Finally, you should tell your mom how important her opinion is on this. Tell her that you would not want to get on birth control at this age without her knowledge and consent and that you respect her opinion and judgement.You can say “Mom, I know that if no one else will take care of me, you will. And I think that getting on birth control is really important for my health right now, especially since I’m sexually active.”

, After you have spoken your peace, listen to your mom. She may have not even considered the idea of you getting on birth control, so bear with her. This could be new information. Hear her out and answer any questions that she might have honestly.


Don’t interrupt her when she is speaking.

, If your mom seems open to the idea of you getting on birth control, ask about her experience with it. See if it affected her emotionally, made her gain weight, have headaches, or eased off her periods. Ask her any other questions that you might have, whether they be about birth control, sex, or periods., Perhaps you are a bit too afraid to talk to your mom in person. If your mom tends to lash out or overreacts, then sending her your thoughts via email might be the best decision. You can also write her a letter explaining how you feel and all of your reasons for wanting to start birth control., Though your mom may not want you to get on birth control at the moment, she may not have a problem with you going to see a gynecologist, especially if you have a very heavy period. Talk to her about wanting to see a gyno about this issue as well as any others you might be experiencing; the doctor will likely suggest birth control for you., No matter how you mom reacts to this request, do you best to stay calm. You reacting emotionally and immaturely to her will only make her less likely to allow you to get on birth control. Take some deep breaths when the conversation gets heavy.


Walk away and get some space from the conversation if you need to.

, After you have told her your feelings and heard from her as well, give her some time to process and make a decision. Don’t pressure her into deciding before she is ready, as this will likely yield you a “no.” Allowing her the time she needs to think will allow her to a more rational and calm decision rather than one rendered out of haste or pressure.

, Once your mother has made her decision, don’t lash out if it is not in your favor. She may have told you no, fearing that birth control would incentivize you to have sex, or perhaps she has other medical reasons like fear of hormones. Whatever your mom’s decision is, respect it for now. Make other arrangements to prevent pregnancy in the interim by practicing abstinence or using condoms.

Pick a good time and place to talk.,
Identify how you feel about the issue.,
Think about why your parents may refuse.,
Plan what you'll say ahead of time.,
Be direct when beginning the conversation.,
Express gratitude when asking.,
Listen to your parents point of view respectfully.,
Avoid arguing or complaining.,
Ask politely for an explanation.,
Ask them to think about it and decide later.,
Offer to do something in return.,
Accept a ""No"" for now.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Bring Your iPod Touch on the School Bus," If you want to ask your parents something, the time and place matters. If you bombard your parents with a request when they're busy or stressed, they're more likely to say ""No."" Ask them when they're free.Pick a good time. Wait until both your parents are not busy with work or other activities. For example, a lazy Saturday afternoon can be a good time to talk.
You should also pick a place free of distractions. For example, ask in the dining room instead of the TV room, where electronic devices may be distracting.;
, Before going into the conversation, have a sense of your own feelings. Why is bringing your iPod on the bus so important? How can you convey this to your parents?Think about how you feel about the conversation itself. Are you nervous? Angry? Frustrated? Try to work on letting go of these feelings. Go into the conversation without expectations.
Identify why the issue is important. Maybe other classmates and friends bring their iPods on the bus, and you feel left out when you can't play the same games or listen to music. This is something you could address.

, It's a good idea to try to predict why your parents may refuse. That way, you can offer up counter arguments right away. Think about any questions or concerns your parents may have about you bringing your iPod on the bus.Your parents may worry about you getting too much screen time. They may also worry you will lose your iPod. They may want you socializing instead of tuning others out.
What counterarguments could you make to these complaints? Maybe you could promise to limit your screen time after school. You could agree to pay for the iPod with your allowance if you do lose it. You could also point out the iPod is a social tool, as your friends often talk about games that they're playing and music they're listening to.

, You do not need to write out a speech word-per-word. However, it's never a bad idea to have some idea of what you're going to say. Try to jot down your thoughts ahead of time and then read back what you wrote. How can you express these thoughts most effectively? Have a rough idea of how to begin the conversation going into it., Stop your parents and say something like, ""Do you have a minute? I have something I want to ask you."" Then, get right into the topic. Do not beat around the bush. Being as direct as possible can help the conversation run smoothly.For example, start off with something like, ""This is about my iPod. I wanted to know if it would be okay for me to bring it on the bus.""

, It's always a good idea to make your parents feel valued. You don't want to look entitled or demanding. If your parents feel you understand and respect their authority, they're more likely to give you permission.For example, say something like, ""I really appreciate you guys buying me that iPod. I know it wasn't cheap and I know how hard you worked to earn the money for it.""

, When your parents talk, pause and listen. They may have reasons for saying ""No"" and expressing hesitation. Understanding these reasons can help you guys reach a compromise if necessary.Once you've stated your case, pause and let your parents respond. Do not interrupt or talk over them while they're explaining their concerns to you.
Show you're listening by nodding and responding with things like ""Yes"" and ""Uh-huh.""

, You're unlikely to get your way if you complain, argue, or otherwise talk back. If you show maturity, your parents are more likely to say ""Yes"" to you. Instead of arguing with your parents, say things like, ""Okay, I understand what you're saying, but I see it a different way."", If your parents flat out say no, it's okay to ask for an explanation. Do so politely and respectfully. Frame it as a way to understand their perspective more.For example, do not say, ""That's not fair. Why won't you let me?""
Instead, say something like, ""Okay, I understand you don't want me to take my iPod on the bus. Can you tell me why it's an issue?""

, If your parents express hesitation, you can always ask for a delayed response. If your parents see you're mature and willing to give them a chance to decide, they may be more wiling to say ""Yes"" later on. If your parents have reservations about letting you bring your iPod on the bus, say something like, ""Okay, I get that you're unsure about this. Why don't you take a day to think about it and we can talk tomorrow?"", Your parents may want to feel you're earning rewards via good behavior. Is there anything you can do to earn the right to bring your iPod on the bus? Try to offer positive behavior in return.For example, you could promise to bring your grades up if your parents allow you to bring your iPod on the bus.

, If your parents say ""No"" despite your best efforts, accept this for now. Ignoring their rules, or arguing with them, will make them more likely to enforce them strictly. However, if your parents see you're mature, they may change their minds later on. They may realize you're responsible enough to carry your iPod on the bus.If your parents continue to refuse, calmly say something like, ""Okay. I understand. Thank you for listening.""

,
Talk them through the safety features of the site.,
Let them know that you are aware of the dangers of giving your personal details out on the internet.,
Set your own time limits.,
Show your parents your maturity.,
Bide your time.,
Practice your plea ahead of time.,
Be open with your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Facebook Account," Tell them that you would really appreciate the opportunity to explain why you should be allowed to have such an account. This may not work if your parents are very sheltering.;
, However, don't read off of the paper when you're talking to your parents. It will look too planned. So instead, try to memorize your key points. It will look like you're speaking from your mind rather than practicing for a public speaking event. Try to be mature and reasonable with your parents.

, Be clear that you will not use the account to talk to people they do not know and do not approve of. The general purpose of Facebook is to catch up with your friends from school, friends you meet at summer camp, old friends that had moved away, and people that you met from other schools.

,, Show them how you can restrict access to your page so that only your friends can see it.

, Reassure them that you will follow all sensible steps to stay safe.

, You will have to judge what your parents will find an acceptable amount of time spent on Facebook. Assure them that all homework and chores will be done before you spend time on Facebook or the computer in general.

If they are worried that you will get addicted to Facebook, offer to write down a list of boundaries to be posted beside the computer (such as ""I will only use it for 60 minutes a day"", ""I will only use it only if my room is clean"", ""I won't go online until all my chores are done"" etc.)







, If they don't think you're mature enough, prove it to them. It may take two or three months, but it'll be worth it.

, If your parents stand firm and it doesn't happen, wait a while. Let them forget about it, and then ask them again in a few weeks.

, Memorize something like:


""I want a Facebook account to keep in touch with friends who are not allowed to have a phone yet, and that do not spend as much time on their phones. I can restrict access to my page so that only my friends can see my name and page. I can design it how I want to show my personality, and what goes through my mind by posting pictures. I can have the page however I want as well. I will let you guys tell me how much time I can spend on it, because I know it can be addicting. It will not get in the way of any homework or sports. And at school everyone talks about Facebook, and it makes me feel left out."" You could also involve a friend to show the point that nearly everyone else has it, including the friend. But do not use the phrase ""everyone else is doing it"".""

, If your parents have an account, add them so that they can see everything that you are doing and what pictures you are posting. If neither of your parents have an account and that is what they're worried about, suggest that you could add a close friend of your mother's or an uncle or aunt as a friend who could keep an eye on what you were doing.

Know what you did wrong.,
Create the right mindset.,
Decide on what you are going to say.,
Make sure your apology is sincere and shows your reflection.,
Figure out if your parent is a night or morning person.,
Avoid interrupting what the parent is doing.,
Plan what you would like to say in your apology and speak clearly.,
Avoid turning the table on the other person after apologizing.,
Sound courteous and sweet, avoiding defensive, accusatory, or frustrated tones.,
Tell them you love them.,
Take steps to stop that behavior from happening in the future.,
Listen to everything they have to say without getting defensive.,
Get your parent to understand your reasoning.",How to Call a Parent to Apologize," By reflecting on what you did and knowing what specifically you've done wrong, you can show that you are actually sorry. Sorry means nothing unless you're willing to learn from the situation you're apologizing for.;
, Let go of past resentments - forgive or forget. This is a sign of maturity and distinguishes you from a great individual who is free from negative energy.

, Be ready to face any frustration with courage and calmness.

, Hearing a non-apology is worse than no apology at all. A non-apology is an ""apology"" that sounds as if it is blaming the other person, such as, ""I'm sorry you got mad,"" which places the blame on the other person for getting mad. Apologize for what you did, and avoid placing the blame on the other person. It is recommended that you use ""I"" statements. For example, say something like, ""I was wrong to break the lamp. I was really angry, but that's no excuse to break something. I'm really sorry.""

, Don't call at night if they're a morning person, and don't call in the morning if they always wake up on the wrong side of the bed. Also avoid calling them during times you know are busy for them.

, If you know they're out doing something, like going to the movies or shopping, hold off on calling. If you don't live with them, it's harder to know, so answer with, ""Hi, Mom/Dad, are you busy right now?"" If they are, ask when you can call back.

, Instead of saying, ""Um, I'm sorry 'cause I made you mad, and... um... sorry,"" say, ""I've thought about my actions and I've realized that I was wrong for the way I acted. I want to apologize. In the future, I will try my best to keep my feelings and actions under control.""

, Don't say, ""I'm sorry for stealing your bracelet, but this never would've happened if you kept it somewhere else!"" If you have to mention something, it's best to keep it about how they can help you deal with whatever problem you had. Remember to stay tactful.

, If you find that you're still angry about what happened, try cooling down some more before you call them. Try asking if you can calmly and blamelessly discuss the situation after apologizing, so that you both can better deal with similar situations in the future.

, It's always nice to remind them that you don't hate them just because of some silly argument or a stupid action of yours. It also aids with cooling down a situation.

, Sorry is meaningless if you're going to keep doing it and don't learn from your actions.

, Honestly listen and consider whether what they're saying is true. If it is, then acknowledge it and keep note of it. If it isn't, consider calmly explaining your side. If they're adamant about something that just isn't true, say something like, ""I'll be more aware of what I say and do in the future.""

, If you help them understand what you're thought process was upon an action, they will not only be more likely to forgive you but will understand you more. Note-justifying an action is entirely different than explaining it.

Decide whether to come out to one or both parents.,
Use simple, approachable language.,
Explain that you know who you are.,
Tell them what you need from them.,
Propose ways of continuing the conversation.,
Reread and revise your letter.",How to Come Out to Your Parents by Email or Letter1," First, figure out whether you should address your letter to both of your parents or start by coming out to one. You might feel more comfortable writing your letter to one parent, who can then help you come out to the other.If you address one letter to both of your parents, it might be a good idea to make a copy of your letter, print two copies, or send each of them an email. That way, they’ll each have their own copy to read at their own pace and in their own time.;
, Be clear and direct, but use terms that you’re most comfortable with and that will be easiest for your parents to digest. Sometimes, telling your parents that you’re attracted to men or women is easier than saying, “I’m gay.”Further, sometimes the most specific terms are hard for parents to understand. For example, they might be able to understand that you’re transgendered, but you might confuse them if you start by describing your specific trans identity using terms they’ve never heard., Be confident, and let your parents know that discovering who you are has been a process. Tell them that you want to be honest with them, but you aren’t asking their permission to be yourself.For example, you could write, “I hope you understand that this isn’t just a phase, and that it’s taken some time for me to discover and accept myself.”

, After writing about who you are and how you’ve come to accept yourself, you should include specific, actionable steps that your parents can take. Let them know exactly what you want and need from them.For example, let them know that you want to have an honest relationship with them. Write that you hope you can continue to rely on them for support and guidance.
If you’re writing to one parent, tell them that you’d like them to help you come out to your other parent.
You could also ask them to keep this to themselves and mention that you’d like to come out to other family members on your own time.

, If you’d prefer to continue the conversation in writing, ask them to reply with letters of their own. If you’re writing to a parent who lives far away, ask them to write back to you or to set aside some time to talk on the phone.If you don’t have a preference, you could write, “I’m not sure what steps we should take next. You can write me a letter if it would help you make sense of all this, or we could talk face to face.”

, After composing your letter, set it aside in a secure place and take some time away from it. Get a good night’s sleep, then read it back to yourself. Look for spots where you could be clearer, more confident, or more respectful, and revise it accordingly."

Make a list of your parents' concerns.,
Find ways to address potential concerns.,
Do your research on cellphones.,
Identify the benefits of having the phone.,
Practice what you'll say.,
Find a good time to talk.,
Be direct.,
Present any information you gathered.,
Express gratitude when asking.,
Listen to their perspective.,
Ask for a reason if they refuse.,
Refrain from arguing or complaining.,
Offer to earn the phone.,
Request they think it over.,
Accept a ""No"" for now.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have a Cell Phone," Many parents have practical concerns in regards to cost and monthly bills when it comes to a cellphone. However, parents also worry about the dangers of phones. Many parents are also concerned about their kids spending too much time in front of a screen. Make a list of hesitations your parents may have so you can figure out how to address them., After you've made a list of potential concerns, think about how to approach them.. What can you do or say to ease your parents worries about you getting a phone? For every problem, think of a solution.If money is the issue, offer to pay for some of the phone yourself. You could get a part time job or save up your allowance to help with finances.
Promise to be responsible with the phone. Let your parents know that you'll be upfront with them about what you're doing on the phone and will use it responsibly.
Promise to limit your time on the phone. You can agree to only use the phone for a set number of hours each day.

, Look up the kind of phone you want and see how much it costs. In addition to the basic cost of the phone, figure out any accompanying monthly bills.See if you can find a deal on a phone. For example, look into buying used phones on sites like eBay. This can be very helpful if money is a big concern for your parents.

, Cellphones can have some benefits. If you emphasize how the phone can help you thrive, your parents will be more likely to allow you to have one.

Emphasize any learning possibilities from the phone. For example, you can listen to audiobooks or download apps to help you organize your homework.
Tell your parents unlimited texting can allow you to alert them of your whereabouts if you're ever running late.

, You don't have to have your speech written out word-per-word, but it can help to jot down your thoughts first. Practice what you'll say a few times in front of the mirror. This way, you'll go into the situation feeling a little more prepared.You can start the conversation with something like, ""Hey, I'd like to talk to you guys about something that's been on my mind.""
To introduce the topic of the cellphone, say something like, ""I've been really wanting a cellphone for awhile now.""

, The timing of a conversation can make a big impact on its success. Wait until your parents are not busy or stressed out by other things. For example, instead of asking on a Thursday night after your dad got home from work, ask on a Saturday afternoon when everyone is relaxed.You can let your parents know you want to talk by saying something like, ""Do you guys have a minute? I wanted to talk something over with you.""

, It's always best to be direct. Instead of dropping hints, politely introduce the subject right away. Say something like, ""I wanted to discuss me having my own cellphone."" You can also try something like, ""I wanted to ask if you would let me have my own cellphone."", Remember the information you gathered earlier and use it now. Talk about why you want a phone, how you'll be responsible when using it, and any benefits the phone my have.

For example, say something like, ""I would really like to be able to interact with my friends. I'd be using the phone for socializing, so I wouldn't be doing anything irresponsible.""
Add any benefits. For example, say, ""My friend has this neat app that helps them organize their schedule. That could help me stay on track with homework.""

, Showing your parents you appreciate them can help increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Tell your parents how much you appreciate everything they do. This way, it will not come off like you feel entitled to a cellphone.For example, say something like, ""I know how hard you guys work to pay for everything and I really appreciate that.""

, Your parents have a right to express themselves and any concerns they have. If your parents have follow up questions or want to make a comment, let them talk. Do not interrupt as your parents respond to you., If your parents say no, it's okay to ask why. However, do so politely to avoid seeming argumentative.Do not say, ""But why? Everyone else has one!"" Instead, try something like, ""Okay, but is there any particular reason you're saying no?""

, It's okay to try to compromise or persuade your parents if they say no. However, do not start complaining, raising your voice, or otherwise behaving in an argumentative fashion. This will only frustrate your parents and will greatly decrease the likelihood they'll change their minds.Avoid phrases like, ""It's not fair!"" This can come off as argumentative.
Instead, try something like, ""Okay, thank you for listening, but I feel like you're not hearing my side.""

, If money is a concern, offer to pay for some of the costs yourself. If you already have a job, say you'll save money from that. You can also offer to get a job to help pay for the phone.You can also offer to earn the phone in other ways. For example, ask if you can have a phone in exchange for bringing your math grade up.
Say something like, ""I could put $25 of my own money towards the bill each month.""

, If your parents seem hesitant, request a delayed response. Say something like, ""I can see you guys aren't entirely sure about this. Why don't you take a few days to think about it and then we can discuss it again?"", In the event your parents are not at all willing to let you get a cellphone, politely accept this. If you accept a ""No"" with grace, this shows responsibility. Your parents may be more willing to change their minds down the road.End the conversation by saying something like, ""Thank you for your time anyway. I appreciate you guys listening.""

Choose a stress-free time to give them your letter.,
Provide them with educational resources.,
Give them time and space to process your letter.,
Try to follow up with a conversation.",How to Come Out to Your Parents by Email or Letter2," Coming out is hard enough, so avoid giving your parents your letter during an argument or during a period of crisis. Try not to use coming out as a weapon or way to shock them, and avoid using alcohol or drugs before giving them the letter or discussing it with them.For example, if a relative is sick or your sibling just got in major trouble, you might want to wait until things settle down before giving them your letter.

, If you’re sending them an email, you could attach links to online resources that can inform them and help them process the news. You could also print out information and include it with your printed or handwritten letter.Parents are often afraid that their LGBTQ children will face prejudice, violence, contract diseases, or never live a happy life. Providing them with information can ease their fears and help them understand that you’ll be happier if you can be open and honest about yourself.
You can find plenty of excellent websites online. Check out University of Southern California’s resources for parents and family.PFLAG (formerly known as Parents, Family, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) also offers lots of helpful information., Give them your letter in person, mail it, or send your email, then let them digest the news on their own terms. Be patient, and understand that they might need a little while to process and, hopefully, accept what you’ve written.When you give them the letter, tell them, “I hope you can read this with an open mind, and I hope we can handle what I’ve written about patiently and honestly. Please take all the time you need to process it.”

, You and your parents might find that exchanging a few letters is the best way to handle the situation. Eventually, try to have a face to face conversation with them. Once you’ve broken the ice in writing, you might find it easier to talk to them in person.If your parent lives far away, talk to them on the phone. The next time you see them, have a face to face conversation.

Try to anticipate their reaction.,
Hold off if you think they’d cause physical harm.,
Wait until you’re financially independent if necessary.,
Lean on your support system.",How to Come Out to Your Parents by Email or Letter3," Pay attention to how your parents respond to LGBTQ issues in the news. Take note if they make homophobic remarks or talk negatively about issues like marriage equality and adoption. Getting a feel for their basic outlook can help you anticipate how they’d react if and when you come out to them.When and if you do tell them, understand that your parents might feel shocked, sad, angry, guilty, or afraid. Try to respect their emotional response, and have faith that their emotions can change over time.

, In a perfect world, no one would have to live in the closet. However, your safety should be your number one concern. If one or both of your parents have ever threatened to harm you or any member of the LGBTQ community, consider holding off until you know you can come out safely.For instance, if you really need to be honest with them but are concerned about your safety, you could wait until you live on your own or are otherwise out of harm’s way before sending them your letter.

, In addition to physical safety, take your financial well being into account when deciding how, when, and if you should come out. If you live at home or depend on your parents financially, it might be in your best interest to come out when you’re financially independent.Ask yourself, “Do my parents make homophobic comments or otherwise indicate that they wouldn’t accept me for who I am? Would they continue to let me live at home, or pay for my college? What are my options if they kicked me out of the house?”

, Before coming out to your parents, identify family, friends, and anyone else you can trust, like counselors or teachers. If you think you might need a place to stay, ask someone to stay with them for a little while. At the very least, having someone else to listen and lend emotional support will help you get through a difficult coming out process."
"
Consider how receptive you think your parents will be to the news.,
Decide how you want to tell them.,
Gather the support you need to go through with telling them.,
Find books, pamphlets, or websites about the LGBT community to provide to your parents.,
Research questions you anticipate that they might ask.,
Have a back-up plan if the conversation goes badly and you live with your parents.,
Have a back-up plan if the conversation goes badly and you are independent of your parents.,
Choose an appropriate time and place to come out.,
Think about how you want to start the conversation.This will likely be the hardest part, because taking the first step always feels the most challenging.,
Come out to your parents by explaining your sexual orientation.,
Explain your perspective in the moment to help your parents understand.,
Explain to your parents why you have not come out to them before now.This will be a big assistance in helping them to understand you.,
Share with your parents what they can do to support you.,
Come out to your parents according to the plan that you created.,
Be clear in your decision to tell them and in your self-awareness that you are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.,
Understand that parents will go through a similar series of stages as if they have just suffered a loss.,
Remain calm as you talk with them.,
Reassure your parents that you love them and that you are doing this for the betterment of your relationship with them.This reassurance will go a long way in maintaining a strong relationship with your parents.,
Remember that this will take them time.,
Accept your parents' emotions.,
Encourage your parents to ""come out"" to others.,
Learn to accept how far your parents go on the path to true acceptance.",How to Come Out to Your Parents," If you think that your parents might already suspect your sexual orientation and that they will likely be supportive, then move forward with making a plan. If you think this will be a complete shock to your parents, then consider how they might react.


If you think your parents might react negatively, you should wait to tell them. Consider questions such as whether your parents make homophobic comments, whether you would be crushed if they reacted negatively, or whether you are financially dependent upon them. If any of these thoughts leads to a ""yes,"" then it is probably better to wait until you are independently living and supporting yourself or until you feel more prepared with a stronger support system.Listen to your instinct when deciding whether to tell them. There is a difference between feeling nervous to tell supportive parents and feeling afraid to tell reactionary parents.
Remember that your parents think they know everything about you because they raised you. If they are unsuspecting, then take this into account as you consider how to tell them.

Drop hints if you want to get a better sense of how they might respond.;
, There are different ways that you can go about doing this, such as a face-to-face conversation or with a letter.


Consider your family dynamic as you contemplate how to tell them, and consider how you feel most comfortable communicating. Explaining everything in a letter might feel easier for you and might give them more time to digest the news. On the contrary, perhaps your family likes to talk things through, or perhaps you express yourself better verbally.
Stick to your decision once you make it. This will prevent you from delaying telling them or being disorganized when you do so.

, Once you have decided how you will tell them, the next step is to build a support system of people who will always be there for you.


If you have relatives, friends, teachers, or counselors who already know that you are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, establish a support system with them. Make sure that they are okay with you coming to them for advice and in the event that coming out to your parents goes negatively.Ask the parents of other gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender individuals to act as a support system for your parents. Being able to send your parents to another set of parents who have gone through the same experience can help them accept your sexuality. Have another set of parents prepared to meet with your parents prior to coming out.Make sure that you are mentally prepared to have this conversation and that you are open to answering your parents' questions. Also consider being open to going to therapy, if they suggest it, because it will likely confirm for them that you are, in fact, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender., Giving them information to help them better understand your perspective will help them through the stages of loss.Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG)

""Why are you gay?""
""I heard that all gay people have HIV/AIDS.""
""Isn't being gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender unnatural?""
""Why did you wait so long to tell me?
""Will you be able to get a job?""
""How will you have a family?""

""What are the statistics of a gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender person being physically attacked?""
""Will you be able to lead a happy life?""
""Will you be different now?""
""Will you flaunt your sexuality? That will make me uncomfortable.""
""How can I support you?""

, For example, if your parents cut you off financially or ask you to leave the house, you need to have somewhere to go and someone to help support you through this time.Reach out to a friend, relative, teacher, or counselor to whom you have already come out. Ask them if you can stay with them, or if they can help you find somewhere safe to stay, in the event that your parents kick you out of their house. This is also a good place to go in the event that you do have your own housing but need someone to talk to and to support you after a negative experience coming out to your parents.
Take time to save some money so that you have a means for supporting yourself. This could mean getting a part-time job, if you are of legal working age, or savings another means of income.
If you do not have your own transportation, figure out a means for how you will get around to where you need to go. This could involve getting rides from the person or family with whom you are staying, getting rides from another friend or supportive person, or using the public transportation system in your city.
Figure out a way to thank the person or family with whom you would stay during this time. This could look like paying them ""rent,"" if you are able, or helping to pick up some chores and errands to make things easier for them.

, You will still need support in the event that the conversation does not go well.


Reach out to friends, relatives, or counselors to whom you have already come out and who support you. Make arrangements to meet with one of them at their home or in a place that you enjoy in the event that the conversation with your parents goes poorly.
If you live independently from your parents but they still financially support you, and you think there is a chance that they may cut you off financially, get a part-time or full-time job so that you can support yourself.
Think about how you will give your parents time and space. You might want to try occasionally reaching out to them via phone, email, or in-person, or you may want to wait for them to reach out to you. Go with what feels best for your family dynamic.

, There is often never a ""right time"" to do things like this, but you do need to put thought into when you will tell them.


Avoid coming out during an argument, a large family gathering, a celebration, or a family crisis. This could cause your parents to think that you are coming out because of anger or because you want to show up another person.Find or create a time when it will be only you and your parents. Then, there will be no other distractions or interruptions.
Be sure to come out at home rather than in a public place. Your parents might react badly, which would cause a scene in a public place. They could also think you are joking, or they might think you are trying to embarrass them.

“I have something that I need to tell you, because I've felt like I needed to keep it a secret for a long time. I feel ready to talk to you about it now.”
“I've had something on my mind for a long time now that I find hard to talk about.”
“I need to talk to you about something that's important to me. It's important to me that I'm honest with you.”

, There is no right or wrong way to say it, so choose what feels comfortable for you.""I'm gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender. I've known this about myself for a long time.""
""I think I might be gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender. I feel attracted to people of the same sex, and I'm not sure what to think about that."" OR ""I feel like I was born in the wrong body. I think I might feel more comfortable as a boy/girl, doing the types of things that boys/girls do.”
“Ever since I was ___ years old, I've known that I'm gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender.”

, The more you can do to help them understand you, the better.


“This feels natural for me, just like it feels natural to you to be heterosexual. I'm not choosing to be this way; I just am.”
“I'm still the same person I was before. I'm choosing to outwardly identify now as gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender, because I've inwardly identified that way for so long.”
“I'm attracted to both boys and girls. I'm coming out to you because I feel like I'm punishing myself when I push those feelings down, and I want to be honest about who I am.”
“I want to do the types of activities that boys/girls do. They interest me more and feel more natural to me, but it seems unnatural do them right now because I'm a boy/girl.”

,


“I was afraid that you would reject me.”
“Our society is so homophobic, and I was afraid of how others might view me.”
“I was afraid that it would ruin our relationship, and I value our relationship very much.”
“Our religion teaches that being gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender is a sin, and I didn't know how to come to terms with that.”
“I felt like I had to keep it a secret because society tells us that this is wrong.”

, You will still have others to come out to in your life, and their support will help you do that.


“I would like it if you took the time to learn more about what it means to be gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender.”
“I would love it if you would allow me to tell you more about my friends and how important they are to me. When you feel ready, it would be great if you would meet them.”
“I got this book for you to read so that you can learn more. It should answer any questions you have, so I hope that you will read it.”
“I came up with this list of websites that you can browse to get more information. It would mean a lot to me if you took the time to do that.”
“There is a support group for LGBT individuals and their families. I have the information about when it meets, so we can go when you feel ready.”
“I need you to tell me what I can do to support you, because I want to do that for you, too.”
“I need you to stand up for me and for the LGBT community when you hear us being attacked. Our community becomes stronger when we have allies.”

, Use your plan as your guide to have the conversation or to give them the letter.


Be prepared to answer their questions.
Have the book, pamphlet, and other resources you found with you to give to them so that they can learn more.
Remember your back-up plan if the experience does not go well.

, Having a firm stance in this self-awareness will lessen confusion for your parents.


Show your parents that you are certain about your sexuality and that you have sound judgment by remaining firm in your stance.Share with them why you are coming out to them, which should be that you want to be honest with them and further build your relationship with them., This will be their path to acceptance, but remember that some parents might skip some stages, and some parents may never reach true acceptance.This could be a particularly challenging time as they work through the first few stages.


Shock
Denial
Guilt
Expression of feelings
Personal decision-making
True acceptance

, This shows your parents your maturity, and it shows them that you are taking this conversation seriously.


Remember to avoid getting angry and turning the conversation into an argument.
Take time to teach them. For a while, your role may be reversed with your parents as they work through understanding your sexuality. You may find yourself having to teach them and guide them through accepting this.Answer all questions they have to the best of your ability, and when you cannot answer a question, direct them to a resource where they can find an answer.
Avoid getting annoyed, frustrated, or exasperated in the event that they seem slow to understand what is going on. They will need time to adjust.,


It is also helpful to reassure your parents that you love and accept yourself. They will want to know that you are happy.Remind your parents that you are healthy.They may find themselves coming to acceptance more quickly when comforted with this thought.
Be their support system during this time. The ultimate act of showing them that you love them and want to help them through this period of understanding is to support them. Do whatever you can to help them learn and understand why you came out and more about the LGBT community.

, Life will not simply go back to ""normal"" immediately after the conversation.Remind yourself of the stages above that parents will go through as they work through accepting your coming out.
Consider the emotions that parents will likely experience while they process your coming out: guilt, self-blame, fear, confusion, doubt, denial.Your parents will very likely blame themselves and think that they have done something wrong in raising you. This will be a challenging time for them.
One of your parents may make their way to true acceptance more quickly than the other. Although you think of your parents as a single unit, remember that they are individual people who process things in different ways and have different personalities., While your parents work through your coming out, it is important that you accept whatever emotions they feel and project.


Be strong even if your parents project anger, hurt, or sadness. In time, they will stop feeling controlled by their emotions and will begin to think about your coming out more rationally.Avoid projecting negative emotions back on your parents. Just like you should avoid anger when coming out to them, you should avoid projecting negative emotions back on your parents while they come to grips with this. Becoming angry or spiteful with them will slow down their process of accepting.

, Part of their acceptance process could include sharing this news with other relatives or close family friends.Refer your parents to the other set of parents who have already gone through accepting their child's coming out for support.
Encourage them to seek out support networks like PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays).Have a mutual relative who supports you who can be a point of contact for both you and your parents. It will help your parents to have someone close and trusted to talk to about your coming out., Not all parents will be able to truly accept that their son or daughter is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, and you will need to learn how to respect that and learn how to interact with your parent(s) in that scenario.If your parents are willing to learn more, take time to introduce them to your friends who are also gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. This might help them confront stereotypes they hold.
If your parents do not want to talk about the matter, then take care in how you approach your sexual orientation with them. They may still need time to accept, so do not force the issue on them repeatedly.
If one or both of your parents is unwilling to accept it, reach out to your support system for help on how to handle that. Your parent(s) may come around in time with continued support and positivity."

Examine your own motives before questioning theirs.,

Urge your parents to work with a financial consultant.,
Remind your parents that the typical nest egg cannot be stretched to the same lengths as it could be years ago.,
Actively assist your parents in finding ways to achieve their dreams and goals in financially astute ways.,
Stay attuned to how your parents are faring.",How to Stop Your Retired Parents from Blowing All Their Money," If thoughts of ""my inheritance"" keep bobbing up before all else, then it's possible that you're in a very self-centered frame of mind and might not be thinking in their best interests at all. Set aside your expectations in relation to inheritance or ongoing assistance and put their interests first––trusting that your parents can make that decision for themselves is part of approaching them with genuine care for their well-being rather than your own.


Be honest with yourself: Are you good with your own finances? Or have you grown used to having your parents bail you out financially? In the latter case, fear that they won't keep doing this might be driving your worries. It is important to acknowledge this––addressing their spending habits means ensuring that your own are in good shape.;
, If you're worried that your parents are spending beyond their means and this will soon result in them owing more money than they can ever repay or leave them destitute, what evidence do you have of this? Do you actually know how much money they have or are you simply viewing the things they're bringing home, the things they're doing or trips they're taking and making assumptions without further facts? Have you seen bills go unpaid due to their inability to pay or poor financial management?

, Imagine yourself 20, 40 years from now and how it would make you feel if your adult child came to you and asked about your spending habits. Thinking from their perspective can help you to create a non-confrontational, caring and considerate way to raise the issues and find solutions without seeming to be bossy or intrusive. It's not easy but you owe it to your parents to be sensitive to their feelings as you deal with your own worries about them.


What age are your parents? Recently retired parents are likely to be agile, in full possession of their mental faculties and itching to do all the things their careers have prevented them from doing - that hard-earned money is there to be spent on their futures. Parents who have been retired a long time and are often older. If they suddenly change their usual thrifty ways, they may have health problems or other private concerns you may not be aware of. Though sudden changes can be a sign that something is wrong, be careful of their privacy and observe their actions. Offer help with problems that don't involve money. Tread with care and look for facts before making up your mind.

, Find a time and location when everyone will be together and comfortable, and discuss the matter in a private setting. It's best to bring this issue up when they're relaxed (not defensive) and ideally, when thoughts of the future are in the air (like when watching the grandkids play).


Act as though you're seeking financial help from your parents about budgeting and saving. Instead of making accusations, inquire about how your parents are budgeting post retirement. A red flag for you is if they inform you that they don't have any specific plan or advice in place, along with any indications that they're not comfortable living on a fixed income. Listen carefully for the things they're not telling you, as much as the things they do say. A red flag for them will rise when you repeatedly ask about a situation that they feel you may be intruding into. Truth is best.
Ask your parents if there is something they aren’t telling you. Could one of your parents be dealing with a terminal illness or the possibility that they may be pondering divorce? In some cases, huge life changes beyond retirement may produce irrational spending.
Don’t bring up the fact that you believe they're squandering their nest egg away around your siblings or spouse (especially other relatives or friends). This is primarily your concern at this stage and it isn't a good idea to make more of it until you have the facts. If other family members have concerns, you can consider a joint meeting but take care to not overwhelm your parents; just immediate family only.

, You may feel annoyed, worried or even angry that your parents seem to be spending a lot of money and don't seem to have much of a financial plan to accompany their expenditure. However, you must listen to them and to their reasons. Hearing what is truly motivating their choices and treating them as adults capable of being responsible for managing their own affairs is crucial to facilitating a more financially aware approach for them. If they sense that you're bossing or intimidating them into doing something just so that they're not on your ""list of worries"", you risk having them shut down on you and refusing to listen to anything else you have to say. Remember that you are all adults here and that whatever you say, ultimately their choices remain their choices and you can only offer sound and caring advice, as well as offering to facilitate helping them to develop a new financial approach if they agree.

, However, if there is clear evidence that they are buying things they can't afford and their usual financial commitments like rent and fuel are in arrears, then draw in a third party, someone neutral but capable of telling things like they really are. Even suggesting this may cause resentment but it does at least allow for continuing advice to be on a professional, detached level that ensures that your parents continue to be treated as adults.

, A certified financial planner can help your parents assess and determine a budget that will allow them to accomplish many of their “bucket list” wishes without going broke. Of particular importance, as noted above, this creates a professional relationship for your parents to be a part of and distances the emotional fray that can develop if you, as their adult child, try to remain their sole source of financial awareness.


Make sure you convey that your concern is only for their financial well-being and that it has nothing to do with an inheritance, trust, etc. Communicate that you want to make sure that your parents spend their golden years independent and happy and not penniless. Explain that you're already working on this for your future and would like them to benefit from taking a similar, professional approach to handling money.
Suggest that your parents consult with a money manager in order to obtain a “big picture” assessment of their nest egg. Let them know that a money manager can take the headache out of trying to wade through finances and design a customized financial plan based on their goals and savings.
Help your mom and dad to find and secure a reputable money manager. If you use a financial planner who has provided you with solid advice, consider making a referral. Otherwise, ask friends or family members for a suggestion or consult with your banker for a reputable money manager. In particular, look for someone who is reputed to be good with retirement advice.
Ask your parents if you can be involved. You don’t want to intrude, but offer your assistance during the initial or ongoing consultation. If you have insight or experience with financial planning provide your expertise and/or help throughout the process.

, Saving a million dollars a few decades ago was considered to be a fortune; however, today the same amount can no longer take you as far and is soon stretched.


Point out that in the USA by way of example, Social Security is not going to provide complete support. Although reports point to benefits being intact until 2037, these benefits are not going to support your parents in the lifestyle to which they’ve become accustomed. While Social Security can provide some income, it will most likely not cover all the bills, which makes having a secure nest egg to draw from vital to a happy retirement.
If your parents are in good physical condition, remind them that with medical support, a healthy diet and exercise, their longer lifespan during retirement creates a strong need for them to be conservative with their finances.
List any large expenses that could crop up in the near (or even distant) future. Expenses such as needing a new vehicle, new appliances, roof repairs or replacement or even the regular rates bills could put a significant dent in your parent’s nest egg.

, Go beyond paying lip service to the issue and be a proponent for mom and dad’s financial and lifestyle freedom. If your parents have a clear list of things they’d like to do, help them find ways to achieve these goals on a more financially aware basis.


Use your connections to give your parents a financial edge when it comes to meeting their goals. For example, if mom and dad want to travel the world, sift through your list of connections for friends who may be travel agents or work in the travel or hotel industry. Or suggest volunteering options, budget options or perhaps even sharing vacations with them on occasion.
Offer to provide financial assistance from time to time. If you're in the position to help, offer to pay or help pay for some of your parent’s ventures. For example, if mom and dad travel to Greece, consider fronting a few nights at the hotel or pay for dinner as a gift.
Research any special deals or financial breaks for seniors. In addition to AARP (in the USA), make sure your parents are eligible to receive any kind of deals or financial breaks they entitled to receive. For example, many community banks or credit unions offer special senior accounts that waive fees and pay a better interest rate. Additionally, some financial institutions, community colleges, non profits and organizations have special travel and social clubs for seniors, with ventures at a discounted rate. And for travel around the world, many countries have taken to reciprocal recognition of seniors' cards, entitling them to discounts when they travel, something well worth looking into.

, Even if you're successful in helping your parents to sort their finances well at this point in time, things will change at different stages of their retirement. Ill health, accidents, loss of friends, etc., will all have impacts on how they're coping and simply being available to talk to and give them support is a vital part of your role as the adult child. In many cases, early intervention where you spot worrying behavior, such as spending to cover a sense of loss, can help to prevent a bigger problem later. And that means knowing how your parents are coping, on a regular basis. Even if you live far away, set up a Skype account and stay in touch as often as possible; there are definitely no technological excuses for staying distant anymore!

Work on respecting their rules.,
Do your best in school.,
Get in the habit of keeping your room tidy.,
Practice good general hygiene.,
Consider using a testimonial.,
Talk about the history.,
Explain that you are trying to express your true self.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Lip Ring1," Your parents will be much more likely to let you get a piercing if you show respect for the way they’re raising you. You can do this by speaking politely to them, showing appreciation for the time they spend with you, and following their basic rules such as curfew and chores. The more you respect your parents, the more they’ll respect your wishes.;
, If you’re meeting or exceeding your parents' expectations for you in school, they may be more open to allowing you the freedom to get the piercing. Some parents may be concerned that body art is a way to rebel against them. If you’re doing well in school, you’re fulfilling their wish that you succeed academically, which is hardly rebellious.

, If you don’t take good care of your belongings, your parents may not trust you handle having a lip ring. Be sure to keep your room clean (put your clothes away, make the bed). This is a good way to demonstrate that you’re responsible and well organized, which should count towards your parents' agreeing to the lip ring.

, Brushing your teeth, showering, and combing your hair regularly are good ways to show your parents that you can take care of yourself. This way they will be less concerned about your keeping the lip piercing clean to prevent infection.

, If you know someone who has a lip piercing, and is happy with it, ask them if they’d be willing to talk to your parents about the experience. A simple phone conversation to answer some questions could do the job. And if you’re close friends with the person, invite them over, and make it clear to your parents that they’re coming over especially to talk about the piercing.

, Many people may be unaware that body piercings are an ancient form of self-expression. Tell your parents that the ancient Egyptians, Israelites, Greeks, and Romans were all known to practice piercing in one form or another and for different reasons, one of which was to show their status within a group.Knowing this may help keep them from having the misconception that piercing is just another meaningless fad.

, Try to have a talk with your parents about how important it is for a teenager to be able show who they are by their style. To try to get them to relate to you, ask them about how they expressed themselves when they were your age, and if they remembered having a desire show their individuality.


Try bringing up your reasons by saying something like: “I don’t want to do it to seem rebellious--piercings like this are so common these days that they don’t intimidate anyone,” or “You wouldn’t think twice about letting me get an earring. This isn’t much different, and it just feels like a better way to express my style.”

Discuss the risks of infection.,
Offer reassurance about swelling.,
Set things straight about tooth chipping.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Lip Ring2," Your parents are likely to have concerns about how having a lip ring might affect your health. They will appreciate it if you’re up-front and open about the matter, which will show them that you’re not hiding anything.


Highlight the low risk of infection,hepatitis, and nerve damage as the main concerns.Emphasize that these complications can be prevented by using a certified, licensed piercer,ensuring you have the proper immunizations for tetanus and hepatitis B,and by regularly cleaning the ring and the piercing., Mention that noticeable swelling is an expected aftereffect of a lip piercing, and that to make room for the enlarged area, a longer-than-usual piercing called a post is put in place until the swelling goes down. But add that while the larger post can cause gum damage, its potential to do so is limited since it will be replaced by a regular-size piercing after the swelling goes away in six to eight weeks.Try to play down the change in appearance by observing: ""It won't look or feel much different from a fat lip after a sports accident, or a mouth sore.""

, If your parents say that they’ve heard that lip piercings can damage your teeth by chipping them, point out that it is actually tongue piercings that cause the most tooth chipping.While there may be a slight risk of tooth damage while eating, depending on the type of lip ring you wear, you can calm any concerns your parents may have by agreeing to remove your ring before meals once the piercing has healed.


You can reassure them by pledging something like, ""I'll get in the routine of taking out the ring by making notes for myself as reminders.""

Find a certified body piercing specialist.,
Have your parents attend a consultation with the piercer.,
Make sure about proper sterilization.,
Give them time to think about it.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Lip Ring3," Assure your parents that any risks associated with lip piercing are significantly reduced by choosing a piercer certified by the Association of Professional Piercers. This organization screens and approves piercing businesses according to their compliance with general standards, including licensing and the use of proper sterilization facilities.Try asking your parents to do a search with you for an APP-certified piercer in your area, using the organization’s member search page., If they seem to be unsure about letting you get the piercing, ask your parents to go with you to an initial consultation with a piercer at an APP-certified business. The piercer should explain the procedure, possible complications, care for the piercing, and a timeline for healing.Having a clearer understanding of these aspects will help your parents decide, and most likely reduce their fears about the risks., While at the piercing shop, ask an employee about recent spore test results. Every reputable piercing business should have these. They show proof of the proper working order of the autoclave, which sterilizes the piercing equipment and jewelry.Make a point to ask about these test results yourself. This will demonstrate to your parents that you're taking the whole process seriously, and are genuinely concerned about health and safety issues related to the piercing.

, Try not to give your parents the impression that they need to decide right away. If they feel that they’re being pressured to give you an answer, there’s a greater chance that they’ll just say “no.” Remember that this is probably a major decision for them, so give them time to think it over and discuss it with others. This also shows them that you’re mature enough to be able to wait some time for an answer.


For example, you can introduce the idea by saying something like, “Mom, I’d like to ask you something pretty serious. I know this might be a hard decision for you, so please don’t feel like you need to decide right away. You’ll probably want to take some time to think about this.”"

Do your homework on the hair dye.,
Learn about the risks involved in dying your hair.,
Make sure whatever you're doing is within the dress code for school/work.,
Bring up the issue delicately.,
Explain how it's not permanent.,
Offer to pay for the dye and supplies.,
Tell them you're prepared for the worst.,
Explain your reasons for wanting to dye your hair.,
Let them know you'll dye it back if it goes badly.,
Suggest getting it done professionally.,
Allow them to have some input on the color choice.,
Ask if you can partially dye your hair instead.,
Ask if you can get colored extensions instead.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Dye Your Hair," Decide what color(s) you want to dye your hair. Figure out which product you want to use. Look for reviews to make sure you get a quality brand.


Some dye products are linked by brand to shampoo/conditioner/sprays, and it may help your case to pick a brand your parents use to wash their own hair.
Stain protectant for your skin and hands is not always sold with the dye package. Look on the label/box to be sure.;
, Hair dye contains hydrogen peroxide, which is damaging to your hair. It's unlikely that dyeing your hair once will cause any sort of serious damage, but be aware that it is damaging.The chance of you being allergic to hair dye is low, but it's still worth doing a patch test before you apply the dye to your head. Just put a small amount of dye on your wrist or ankle, and wait 24 hours to make sure there's no allergic reaction.
There are many peroxide free hair dyes. They may not be as cheap as drugstore box dyes, however they are much better for your hair.

, You don't want to get in trouble. If your school doesn't allow unusual colors, it's also very unlikely your parents will give you the okay.


Additionally, be at the right age. If the package says ""Not recommended for use if under sixteen years of age,"" do not use it as a thirteen-year-old. You could get serious hair follicle damage.

, Start by bringing up the subject of hair dye. Ask them a question at dinner like ""What do you think about hair dye?"" Then tell them you've thought about it a lot and you want to try dying your hair. Tell them exactly what you want to do to your hair. Avoid saying things like ""all of my friends are doing it"" or sentences to that effect. It will automatically trigger ""if all your friends were jumping off a bridge"" type responses.Keep your focus on ""I"" statements, which will sound less accusing or demanding. For example, you could say ""I am getting older now, and I really want to experiment a little bit by dyeing my hair"" rather than ""You should let me dye my hair because I'm getting older.""

, Truthfully tell them that the hair dye you plan on getting is not permanent. Add that it will come out little by little, each time you wash your hair. You can say something like ""I've found a temporary hair dye that I think would let me experiment with my hair without making any drastic changes."" This will ease a lot of their concern, because they'll think that even if they don't like it, it's only temporarily.

Make sure you find a dye that isn't permanent before you talk to them about this, so you aren't lying when you say it.

, If you say that you're prepared to pay for it all, it shows them that you're committed and responsible. And it always helps your case when money isn't coming out of their pocket. For example, you can say ""I've thought about this a lot and so I'm willing to pay for the dye and all the supplies myself.""

, If your parents don't want you to dye your hair because they're afraid the dye will ruin it, bring up the fact that you'd rather learn your lesson and suffer the consequences than not dye it at all. You can say things like ""I've researched what to do if the dye doesn't look right,"" and ""I know how to take care of my hair after dyeing it to reduce any damage."" Let them know that whatever the consequences are, you'll deal with them.


It might help to explain that you understand how it can go wrong, how the color might not turn out right, or how it can damage your hair. Research these things before hand and what possible solutions there are.

, Don't just tell them you want to dye your hair, explain what caused you to feel this way. Some people like dyeing their hair because it allows them to exert more control over their appearance. Some people like it because a change in appearance makes them feel more confident. Figure out your reasons and then explain them.One example of a responsible reason to dye your hair is that you might like to have the experience of dying your hair now, while you're young and don't have a lot of responsibilities. That way in the future, you'll know if you want it or not.

, Often, parents will agree if you give them a little of what they want. Such an example would be: if you dye your hair and it turns out badly, you'll dye it back to its original color. Tell them ""I'm fully prepared to dye it back to my original color if I don't like the color or it looks bad.""

, If your parents are worried about you potentially messing up the dyeing process by doing it on your own or with a friend, this might be a good option. Say ""If you're worried about it being done badly I could always get it done professionally instead. Then there's no worry about the quality of the outcome.""The only downside to this is that getting your hair dyed professionally will cost a good deal more.

, Offer that you both have to agree on the color you get. That allows you both to be in control. You could say ""I'll try a more natural color close to my hair color first if you'd be more comfortable with that.""If you're having a tough time getting your parents to let you dye your hair the color you want it, ask them to let you dye your hair the same color as it already is. Once this is accomplished, you will have already dyed your hair, and they won't have any defense saying that the color you want to dye your hair will damage it

, Instead of dying your whole head, ask to put in highlights, lowlights, or streaks. You can say something like ""Maybe instead of dyeing the whole thing, I can just dye the ends. That way it's less different and it can always be cut off if it doesn't work out."" Purple can still pack a punch from underneath your natural color. If you have long hair, then you can compromise with just dying ends. If it doesn't turn out well, or if you or your parents don't like it, then you can always cut it off.

, If they are adamant against dying your real hair, suggest buying and coloring clip-in extensions so they can see how the color would look. It's not permanent and you can easily change the look if you or your parents don't like it.

Be subtle.,
Get her to respond.,
Be direct.,
Plan your argument.,
Write out your sentences.,
Choose a good time.,
Use your reasoning.,
Hear her out.,
Calmly give your response.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Be patient.",How to Convince Your Mom to Let You Shave Your Legs (Girl)," Don’t be sneaky or manipulative, just casually drop hints here or there. Your mom may notice, or she may just start to get an idea of what age you and your peers are reaching.


A subtle hint might be something like, “My friend has started shaving her legs.”
Don't feel too awkward. It shouldn't be a big deal. Casually mention what is going on with yourself or other girls at your school.;
, Your mom may be picking up on your hints, but choosing not to respond. Getting her to respond is the best way to start a conversation.


Use questions that require an answer. For example, “Some of my friends have started shaving their legs. When did you start shaving your legs, mom?” Asking direct questions like, “When do you think it is a good age to start shaving your legs?” will give you a sense of what your mother thinks. Just make sure to ease into it.

, If you think that your mother will say yes, and if she hasn’t acted strangely to your other hints, try hinting more directly.


The most direct way is to ask for razors when you are at the store.
You can say, “I think that it’s time for me to start shaving my legs. I’m one of the only girls who has hairy legs in gym class.”

, If your mother says no or does not pick up on your hints, then try new strategies. List the reasons that you want to shave your legs, and plan out a way to present these reasons to your mom. Separate your reasons in a numbered list. For example, your first reason might be that you feel uncomfortable in social situations. Your second might be that you enjoy the feeling of smooth legs. Your third might be that you feel like you are responsible enough and old enough to start shaving.

, After making a numbered list of all the reasons you want to start shaving, you should write some sentences so that you don’t feel unprepared when the time comes.


For example, you might want to write, ""My friends have noticed that I still have hairy legs and it is making me feel uncomfortable. Being able to shave would allow me to fit in more and feel more comfortable with my body.”

, Make sure you will have plenty of time to have a full discussion. A long car ride, doing the dishes together, or during down time on the weekend are all good times to have a conversation. Don’t start a conversation when one of you is busy or about to leave. Start the conversation by saying, “Mom, I wanted to ask you something, and I want you to listen to all of what I say before responding”. This will leave room for you to have a calm conversation.

, This is where planning your argument will come in handy. List your reasons in a calm and collected way.


Use the list that you made in the planning stage. You can say, “There are a few reasons that I want to shave my legs. The first is that it is making me self-conscious to have hairy legs. The second is that my friends are noticing that I have a lot of leg hair. The third is that I think that I am old enough and responsible enough to start shaving.”

, After you give your reasons, your mother might have a response. Do not interrupt her.


Try to make eye contact and nod, to show that you are listening.
Take note of what she says, so that you can respond to it. You want to be able to convince her, not argue with her.

, If you have listened carefully to what she said to you, you should have a couple things to respond to.


If she thinks that you are too young, you can respond by saying,”Everyone starts shaving at different ages. This decision should be based on my maturity level.”
Try to emphasize the fact that you are the one making this decision. If you are submitting to peer pressure, or only want to shave your legs because people tell you that you should, shaving may not be a good idea.

, Your mother may just want you to ease into shaving. Be willing to meet her halfway.


Compromises might be shaving below the knee, using hair removal cream, or having her help you shave.
Suggesting compromises might be a good way to convince her. You can say, “What if we think of a compromise that can work for both of us?”

, Your mother may say no the first time around. Wait before asking her again.


After about a month or so, you can suggest a compromise again. Remind her that you were mature about her rejection of your request last time.
It may take more than one or two tries to get her to say yes. Stay mature and calm, and eventually she will agree that you are ready.

Pick a reputable pageant that you want to enter.,
Consider whether it might be a good idea to ask one parent first, then have them help you ""convince"" the other.,
Ask your mother/father politely if you can enter it, and make sure that you tell them if you can't enter, then you completely understand.

,
Come up with a list of pros and cons and be ready to present it to your parents.,
Come up with a way to raise the money to enter, buy the dress, and other clothing, if needed.,
Come up with a talent, and make sure your parents think it is worthwhile and amazing.,
(optional) See if you can get some of your close friends to do the same.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Be in a Beauty Pageant," Remember that it shouldn't be too expensive, and it shouldn't be too far away. Note that your parents might like it better if you chose a scholarship pageant rather than a glitz one.;
, If your mom used to be a cheerleader and loves shopping and makeup, you should probably ask her first. If your dad doesn't give much thought to ""girl activities"" and might say yes without even considering that a pageant is a big deal, you may want to ask him first.

,, This is useful and it also makes it looks like you have done your homework.


Try to have some pros other than ""I want to."" Suggested pros:

Activities show initiative and look good on college applications.
At a pageant, I could make new friends from different areas.
Engaging in competition and doing my best could enhance my self-esteem.
I would like to try something different, that I've never done before.


A good persuasive technique is to have an argument prepared against potential cons. For instance:

Some people think that pageants focus only on looks. However, the pageant I want to enter judges its contestants on many criteria.
Preparing for a pageant can be time-consuming. However, I plan to budget my time so that I can still excel in school, and can participate in my usual activities. (If you are in a lot of other activities, it might be helpful to have a chart or schedule detailing how you would be able to do this.)



, You could babysit or do odd jobs.

,


Make sure the talent is something you truly are good at. Singing is fun, but many people are not trained to sing at a competitive level. If you play an instrument, this could be a great way to use that skill, and to combine pageant preparation with another parent-approved activity. Otherwise, research what kinds of talents other pageant winners have used, and try out a few. Have a friend or family member help you assess what would be the best choice for you.

, This way, your parents can do a carpool, and they will be happy.


Beware: This might make it look like the pageant is just a trendy thing to do, and competing against your friends might not work out so well. Some parents would feel comforted if other families are participating in the same activity, while others would question your motive for entering the pageant. Think about how your family would react.

Wear other stuff that you once bugged your mom to buy.,
Build your own style.,
Know what you want ahead of time.,
Know exactly why you want stuff.,
Admit it if something’s “too” this or that.,
Tell your mom what you don't like.,
Offer your mom choices.",How to Convince Your Mom to Buy Clothes You Like1," Prove to her that you’re going to get a lot of use out of the clothing you want now by showing her that you still wear clothes that you wanted really badly in the past–even if you hate them now. If you can’t stand being seen in them, save them for the weekend and family functions, when you’re less likely to see schoolmates.;
, Feel free to take fashion cues from your friends (it’s perfectly normal for you and your friends to influence each other),but stop short of wanting something just because that’s what they’re wearing these days.The more you follow your friends’ lead, the less likely your mom will buy the clothes you pick out if she doesn’t like them, just because she doesn’t think your fashion choices are your own. Dress the way you want to dress and convince your mom that she won’t have to buy you a whole new wardrobe the next time your friends switch theirs.


If you’re adopting a certain style, start small. Say you’re Goth; your mom might refuse to buy you really ornate outfits right away because she thinks this is just going to be a “phase” for you. Choose simple ways to dress Goth in the beginning. Stick to black jeans, black shirts, black jackets, etc. Prove to her over time that this is more than just a phase. Convince her that more elaborate clothing won’t be money wasted.

, Convince your mom that this isn’t just an impulse buy. Go to stores on your own or ask your mom to take you so you can just look at stuff. Try clothes on and see what you like. Then tell your mom you’ll think it over before asking her to buy anything. Show her that this is something you really want and not just a passing fancy.

, Ask yourself why you like these clothes in the first place. Based on your answers, come up with clear reasons why it’s important for you to have them. Use these reasons to convince your mom. Show her that you’re putting actual thought into this, like an adult.For example, if she argues that these clothes are too “old” for you, tell her that you’re only growing older; mention things like job- or college-interviews as reasons why you need to look more mature. Or, if you’re talking about clothes for sports, show her why these clothes are better than others;if they’ll last longer or prevent injury, point that out to her.

, Think of why your mom might object to something before you show it to her.If the clothes you want really are too expensive, revealing, or outrageous, agree with your mom when she says so. She might still say no in the end, but she’ll probably put more thought into it if you show her that you have, too–which means she might end up saying yes.

, Stop your mom from trying to force some other piece of clothing on you as a substitute. Explain to her exactly why you don’t like it, whether it’s the material, the cut, the fit, or whatever.Let her know what you’re definitely not looking for and why so she knows what not to suggest.

, For every item that you’re shopping for, find a bunch of stuff you like; if you’re only looking to buy one shirt, pull several off the rack. Show them all to her. Let her choose from your selection. Make her feel like she’s still the one in control by giving her the final say.


Improve your chances of getting what you want by including things that you know she won’t buy. Want a bikini that’s a little revealing? Add an even skimpier bikini to your pile. Want something that costs more than she’d like? Find stuff that costs even more than that so what you really want seems cheap in comparison.

Watch for sales.,
Pitch in.,
Consider it a present.,
Promise not to wear it all the time.,
Beware of brand names.,
Agree to grow into it.,
Make up for the price.",How to Convince Your Mom to Buy Clothes You Like2," Check the store’s website. Go through circulars that come in the mail or with newspapers. Keep an eye out for the clothes you want, as well as the brand.


Also ask your mom to become a rewards member at the store. This way she may get an even deeper discount when your clothes come on sale.
Be patient. If the clothing you want is for summer or winter, wait until the end of the season for the store’s clearance sale. You may have to wait until next summer or winter to wear it, but if you really love it, that shouldn’t matter.

, Help your mom pay for the item.If you have a job, contribute your own money. If you receive an allowance, give her money that you’ve saved or tell her she can take the money out of future allowances.


If you don’t have any money of your own, offer to work for it. Volunteer to do extra chores around the house or anything else to make your mom’s life easier.Pick chores that she knows you hate; that will show her how badly you want those clothes!

, Think back: have you already asked your mom to get you something for your birthday or any gift-giving holiday like Christmas or Hanukkah? If you have, ask yourself which you’d rather have more: this piece of clothing or that other thing. If you’d rather have the clothes, tell your mom that you’d be happier with this if she hasn’t already bought the other item. If you haven’t asked for anything yet, tell your mom that this would be perfect.

, The more you wear clothes, the quicker they’ll wear out, so don’t plan on wearing it every other day. Tell your mom that it’ll just be for special events: school pictures, holidays, dates, etc. Assure her that it won’t be in constant risk of being ruined by some jerk at school who likes to spray people with ketchup bottles.

, Don't ask your mom to buy you something just because it was made by So-and-So.Remember that your mom can probably think of a dozen different brands that came into fashion and then went straight back out of it, whether they were Members Only jackets or Starter jackets. Ask yourself if you'd still like these clothes if they were from a no-name brand. Think of why you like it and share that with her.

, Your mom probably doesn’t want to spend a whole lot of money on one piece of clothing if you’re still growing. Tell her that you’re fine with buying a larger size. Prove to her that you really do like this piece by showing her that you’re willing to wait before you can actually wear it.


If you still have a whole lot of growth spurts ahead of you, think of any younger siblings or cousins who could wear it as a hand-me-down. Convince your mom that it’ll continue to be used even after you outgrow it.
Since it’s hard to predict how your body will change, be careful with what clothing you choose. Try on sizes that fit you now for a sense of how a larger size will fit you later on. Don't buy anything too form-fitting, since it might not fit your form so well in the future.

, If you’re out shopping for a lot of clothes all at once, count this one piece of clothing as your “big buy.” Then think of ways to keep your mom from spending too much money on other stuff. Show her that you know she has to stick to a budget and that you’re trying to find ways to help her do that.


When you’re looking at other clothes, check the price. If you can find something like it that costs less, go with that.
Think of what clothes you already own. Do you still like them? Do they still fit? If you’re still happy with them, tell your mom that you don’t need to buy five or six new shirts just because it’s a new school year. Settle for three or four.
Offer to go to a thrift store to shop for the rest. Yes, some people act snotty about buying secondhand clothes, but don’t let that stop you! You can find a lot of cool stuff there that you won’t find anywhere else, which means there’s less chance of everyone at school wearing the exact same thing as you. Plus, lots of people donate clothes they’ve never even worn.

Be good.,
Wait for the right time to ask for stuff.,
Be grateful when you ask.,
Give your mom time to think.,
Be mature.",How to Convince Your Mom to Buy Clothes You Like3," Do your chores, finish your homework, and keep your grades up in school. Show your mom that you’re responsible. Do what she expects you to do without having to be told. Then go the extra mile and help around the house with things she didn’t even ask you to do. Prove to her that you’re mature and deserve to be taken seriously when you ask for things., If your mom already seems stressed out, wait for another time. Catch her in a good mood, when she’s relaxed and more willing to actually consider what you want. Don’t blow your chance by asking her for stuff when she’s already grumpy about something else., Make your mom feel like she’s appreciated and not just an ATM. Show her that you’re thankful for what she’s already done for you before asking her for anything more. If she’s already bought you something special recently, or if you know she has a big bill to pay or something like that, let her know that you think about these things. Don’t just say, “Hey, Mom, can you get me this?” Instead, ask her if she has a minute. If she does, tell her that you know she has bills to pay, or you know she already bought you that other special thing, but if it’s possible, could she maybe also get you this?, Before you ask for something, tell her that she doesn’t have to answer right away. Let her know what you’d like from her, and then ask her to think it over, for as long as she needs. Don’t demand an instant answer; if you do, she’s more likely to say “no” right away, even if she isn’t sure why, just because she doesn’t have time to think it through., If your mom says no, nod your head and say okay. Remember: you could still convince her to change her mind later, but she’ll be less likely to if you throw a tantrum now. Instead, respect her decision. Show her that you take her seriously. This way she’ll take you more seriously, too, so when you ask her again later, she’ll really think about it instead of just repeating “no.”"

Earn money.,
Be helpful.,
Decide which bag you want.,
Research!,
Ask your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Designer Bag," Offer to do chores in exchange for earning some money which you can put towards the cost of designer bags and other things you would like to have.;
, Offer to help around the house in many ways. Don't always expect to be paid. This will help you show yourself to be responsible and deserving.

, Look online for inspiration. But bear it mind; if this is your first designer bag, you shouldn't start with Louis Vuitton ($500 for a small bag) unless your parents are rich, or if you insist on saving up. Rather for the average person, it's recommended starting with Dooney & Bourke or Coach. ($100-200 for a small bag) Now that you have a designer in mind, choose what kind of bag you want. Considering this is your first bag, it is suggested that you stick to the classics/signature styles

, Choosing where you will possibly buy a bag is fairly simple if you want to pay full price at an actual retailer. But to save some money, you could go to other places as well! You could always buy it at an outlet, which will carry real bags for less. At an outlet, they most likely will not have newer bags. Rather, they will have last years bags as well as classics. Another option is eBay. In preparation to ask your parents, you want to show them proof that you have looked into this! Perhaps print out a picture of the bag you want and find out prices at different places. You could even do a PowerPoint presentation, if you really want to impress them!

, When confronting your parents about your desire to buy a designer bag, be as calm, polite, and mature as possible. Show them all of the research you diligently worked on, and maturely explain why you want a designer bag. Show them the prices, and think of occasions where they could buy you one. The possibilities are endless! If they said yes, that's awesome! Skip to the tips. If they said no? Don't give up hope yet, try offering to save up! If you get motivated, you will have your bag in no time! If it turns out that they won't even let you save up and will absolutely not let you have one under any circumstance, you're out of luck. You could always find some good quality knock offs though!

Try again in the future.",How to Convince Your Mom to Get Your Ears Pierced," If your mom sees that you're knowledgeable about how to care for pierced ears, she may be more comfortable with the idea. Read up on aftercare for pierced ears. Show your mom you will care for your pierced ears and will not end up with an infection from the procedure.Tell your mom you will get gold earrings, as these are less likely to cause infection than metal varieties.
Let your mom know you will clean your earlobes each day for 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure.
Tell your mom you will wash your hands first, apply rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial ointment onto a cotton swab, and gently wash your ears.
Also, let your mom know you'll rotate each earring after cleaning to prevent the holes from closing up around the earring, holding it in place.;
, If your mom is more laid back, something like, ""I just think they'll look nice"" may be reason enough for her. However, many parents will have reservations about pierced ears. Try to think of a reason you want pierced ears that will appeal to your mom.Talk about your own self confidence. You could say something like, ""I would feel like I could express myself with earrings. I could wear earrings to show my personality, which could help me feel more confident."" You could also try something like, ""I know all the female guests at cousin April's wedding will be wearing a specific type of earring. I thought it would be a nice treat for her if I could participate in that too.""
Avoid reasons like, ""Everyone else is doing it,"" as your mom is unlikely to be swayed by this.
Whatever your reason, make sure it's sincere. Don't say you feel earrings will build your self confidence if they won't, for example. You want to be honest with your mom, as this shows maturity. If you appear mature, your mom is more likely to say, ""Yes.""

, Do you have a friend with pierced ears? If so, you could ask him or her how to convince your mom. Your friend likely had this same conversation, and may be able to offer special insight on how to get the answer you want.


Choose a friend with parents with somewhat similar values to yours. If you ask a friend with considerably more laid back parents, for example, the discussion may not have been as difficult for your friend.

, Before going into the conversation, think about what you'll say. Spend a lot of time considering what you want out of the conversation. This will help things stay on track when you talk to your mom.On the surface, you want to get permission to get your ears pierced. However, think of other, deeper wants in this conversation.
You want to be able to grow up a little, and make your own decisions. You want your mom to trust that you're responsible.
You should also go into the conversation wanting to listen to your mom's side. Remember, a conversation is a two way street. You should be prepared to listen to your mom's perspective, even if it's not something you want to hear.

, Before the conversation, figure out when your mom is usually free. Also, think about where you would feel most comfortable talking. If you have a lot of siblings, for example, you may not want to talk in living room where your brothers usually play video games. You may, instead, want to talk in your bedroom, where there are less distractions.Figure out a time when your mom is home and not busy. For example, maybe she usually has free time on Wednesday night just after dinner.
Be a little flexible, however, as schedules are subject to change. Think of several times that you could potentially approach your mom.
When you find the right time, you can start the conversation with something simple. Say something like, ""Mom, can I ask you about something?"", If you want your mom to trust you, she needs to believe what you say. Tell her sincerely why you want earrings. Also, be direct about this. Avoid beating around the bush and, instead, just make your case without hesitation.State outright what you want to talk about. Say something like, ""Mom, I really want to get my ears pierced and I was hoping to get your permission.""
From there, give an honest reason as to why you want your ears pierced. For instance, ""I just think it would look really nice, and it would be a great way to expand my style and express myself more. I think I would feel a little better about myself if I could pick out earrings that show who I am.""

, You do not want to dominate the conversation This will make you look argumentative and, therefore, immature. If you want your mom to listen, strive to hear her side too. Even if she's saying something you don't like, take the time to listen before you respond.Your mom may have a lot of reasons for not wanting you to get your ears pierced. She may think you're too young. She may worry it's too expensive. Whatever her reason, try to listen.
Tell her you understand. You want your mom to feel like you heard what she was saying. You can respond with something simple like, ""I understand that you think I'm a little young for this.""

, You can let your mom know why you disagree with her, or push for some kind of compromise. However, you should avoid outright complaining. Do not whine, beg, or argue with your mom if she says, ""No"" or expresses hesitance. This is unlikely to get her to agree.For example, don't say something like, ""Of course I'm old enough! All the girls in school have their ears pierced. Sarah's mom let her do it. Please!""
Instead, offer a mature response. Try saying, ""I get that you think I'm a little young for this, but a lot of girls my age do have their ears pierced. My friend Sarah's been pretty good at caring for her piercings, and I've been reading up on how to care for mine. I do think I could be responsible about it, even though I'm a little young.""

, Your mom may be hesitant to let you get your ears pierced, especially if she's stricter. However, the two of you may be able to compromise. If your mom says no for now, talk to her about a possible compromise.If she has not provided it, ask your mom why she's saying, ""No."" Once you figure out the reason, try to think of a reasonable compromise.
For example, say your mom is worried about cost. In this case, you could offer to pay for half the costs of the piercings with money from your paper route. If you mom is worried you're too young, see if she'd be willing to agree to let you get your ears pierced after your next birthday.

, If you're unable to compromise, accept no for an answer for the time being. If you maturely accept you mom's decision, this will reflect well on you. In the future, your mom may be inclined to let you have a bit more freedom regarding your personal choices.


You can end the conversation by saying something like, ""I understand. You don't want me to get them pierced right now, and that's fine. Thank you for listening anyway.""
You should always leave these kinds of discussions on a good note. This will leave you and your mom feeling positive about what transpired.

, If it's a no for now, there's not much you can do. However, wait a few months and raise the issue again. If you've been responsible and respectful, your mom may have changed her decision.Ask just as respectfully the first time as you did the second time. Again, do not be surprised if the answer is still, ""No."" Be willing to accept this.

Ask them to think it over.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get Clear Braces," These aren't exactly facts, these are about how clear braces make you feel. You could write about:


Fear of being made fun of. IE being called ""brace face"".
How you would feel about the way you look with clear braces vs metal braces.;
, Your feelings only make up half the argument, and researching clear braces shows maturity and only proves how much you want them. Be sure to look up things like:


Maintenance of clear braces vs metal braces.
The costs compared to metal braces.
Durability.
Effectiveness.

, After research, some issues may come up, such as cost, that could turn you away from clear braces. Make sure it is what you really want.

, You've got the facts and you've made the decision. Now you must organize it so your parents know exactly what you're talking about.

, It is usually best to talk to them face to face. However, some parents aren't the listening type. If you know your parents won't listen to you, consider writing a well-written letter to show that you mean what you've decided.

, It is important that they are in a good mood, even if you are just giving them a letter. If they are in a bad mood, they will most likely not read it at all.

, You don't want to launch into saying, ""I want clear braces."" You could start off by saying, ""I have something important I want to talk to you about,"" and then continue with, ""it's about my teeth.""


To those writing a letter: it's the same thing. Don't begin with ""I want and here's why"", gradually lean into your desire for clear braces and then transition into your feelings and the facts.

, You should already know what you're saying, so the conversation will go smoothly.

, They may not be ready to say yes or no right away, so leave the question open for them to think about. If you have done well, they will most likely say yes.

Give them time to get used to the idea of a new haircut.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Get a Haircut," Before you talk to your parents, it’s best to have an idea in mind. Look through magazines, books, and style websites to find ideas. Do your research on what styles look good for your hair and face type so you can explain to your parents why the hairstyle you want is a good idea.


Get advice from a stylist and friends as well to help you make a decision since they might know what will look best on you. You may also look up different cuts and styles online, searching for shorter hairstyles if you are looking to cut your hair short or longer hairstyles if you are looking for a new style for your longer hair.
There are also websites that let you upload a picture and virtually try out a hairstyle. You may “try on” a few styles using the website and print them off. You could then show your parents these images to convince them you will look good with certain hairstyles.;
, You should also research positive role models that happen to also have haircuts that you are into. Though you can use celebrities as role models, you should also look for other role models that have accomplished great things or have contributed profoundly to the world in some way. Your parents may be more likely to be okay with the haircut if you can show that you will end up emulating a positive role model.


For example, maybe you find the female pilot Amelia Earhart to be a positive role model. You may then consider cutting your hair into a short cut, similar to her haircut in photographs. Or, maybe you admire Robert Plant, the lead singer of Led Zeppelin, and want to go for a long haired look.

, You want to make sure you’re ready for a big change and more specifically, you want to make sure your parents will say yes. A drastic hair cut could be a shock for your parents to agree to. For example, instead of asking to shave your head, ask to get an undercut or look into bangs. Think about small changes to your hair you can make first, as your parents may be more open to small adjustments rather than a big change or a major haircut.If you think you can handle a drastic hairstyle, think about it for at least a week to get used to the idea. This will ensure you can argue for the drastic haircut with passion and enthusiasm when it comes time to convince your parents.

, A haircut is a big life decision, even if does eventually grow out. It’s best to decide on a haircut when you’re not overly stressed from school, work, relationships, or life in general. A haircut is a big life change and it’s best not to combine that with other big life changes.Cutting your hair can be therapeutic in the moment, but you might regret it later. Take some time to really plan out your new style.

, If your hair is long enough, you can cut off your hair and donate it to a charity that will use it to make wigs for cancer patients or people with other hair-related medical issues. Instead of just getting your haircut to improve your image, you can help other people out as well.Most donation organizations require at least 10 inches of hair.
Check the guidelines for donating your hair. Some places require you to go to a stylist and send your hair in a clean, neat ponytail.

, As long as your hair isn’t buzzed and super short, you can still have fun with it without getting a haircut. Try playing with hair gel or mousse to spike your hair or test out different types of braids. You can change your look without going to a salon.

, You don’t want to bombard your parents with a brand new idea. Ask them when it’s a good time to discuss getting a new kind of haircut. When you sit down, come prepared with your research and argument for a new hairstyle.Being respectful of your parents’ time will show maturity. They’ll see that you can handle talking about a big decision and therefore are mature enough to make one as well.
Make sure they’re in a good mood when you talk to them so that they’re more likely to say yes.
When you talk to them, stay calm and don’t beg or whine. Doing so will undermine your maturity in their eyes.

, As you explain why you want a particular style, make sure you have examples on hand to show your parents. Pull up pictures from the internet or library book or show them pictures of friends and celebrities with the style you want. That way, they won’t have to imagine the haircut on their own.Have some backup styles available if they say no to your first idea.
Your backup styles can be similar to your original idea. That way, if your parents veto one idea, you still have some very similar options.

, Your parents may share some concerns about you getting a haircut and you should listen to their concerns with respect. Your parents may have rigid expectations about haircuts that appropriate for your gender. For example, your parents may not be okay with boys having long hair or girls having short hair. Your parents may also be concerned that you are too young to get a “grown up” hair cut and may not be ready to give up control of your appearance.


You should be willing to listen to your parents concerns and then respond to them politely. You may remind your parents that just because you are a certain gender, you should not have to be limited to only certain haircuts or certain hairstyles. You may tell your parents, “Gender is a construct and I don’t think it is fair to limit my haircut options because I am a boy or a girl.”
You may also tell your parents that you are old enough to get a haircut that you want and that they are going to have to trust your judgement on your appearance eventually. You may tell them, “I’m growing up and I think I should be able to decide how my hair is cut and styled. I think I can handle the responsibility of making my own decisions about my appearance.”

, Your parents might be worried that you won’t take care of your hair after it’s cut. Reassure them by explaining that you are aware of how to maintain the style, what kind of styling products you’ll need, and how long it will take to style in the morning.Taking care of the hair you already have will also prove to your parents that you can be responsible and maintain your appearance on your own.
If you need a haircut to get rid of split ends of broken hair, show your parents so that they understand why you need a haircut.
You might need tools like a straightener, blow dryer, or curling iron to style your new haircut. Be upfront with your parents about needing to purchase these tools or get access to these tools in some way.

, A normal trim isn’t usually expensive, but a full hair appointment with washing, styling, and drying can cost a lot more. Let your parents know you’re willing to help pay for this service either in full or in part.


Save your money to help pay for the cut. It may be more expensive than you realize.
Add-ons like highlights and dyeing your hair a different color will raise the price as well.

, If this is the first time you’ve decided to make your own decisions about your hair, your parents may need to acclimate to the idea. Don’t pressure them incessantly to make a decision. Bugging will only annoy them.


Settle for accessories if they won’t budge. You can accent your hair with hats, bows, bandanas, or clips to shake things up a bit.
If they still haven’t said yes, ask them again a few weeks later when it’s time for another haircut.

, Steer your parents into reasonable discussions. Discussions are far preferable to battles, especially those in which you can get your parents on your side in solving a complex need or social problem. For girls, mom can be a big supporter here or a big roadblock.

, Honest communication about what you want trumps sneaking around in spades. You may get what you want in the short run by going around your parents' back, but in the long run you will hurt the relationship.

, Tankinis and halters are perfect for hot weather, at the beach, visiting at a friends house and when lying out. Getting approval for them as Mall wear when you are 11 or 12 is asking for trouble. On any new wardrobe that you think might be ""pushing it a little"" let them get used to seeing you in it in secure situations before asking for more. This is a world in which bad things can happen, they do want to protect you and frankly, they are not ready to become grandparents yet. These are very, very strong motivations to keep you dressed like an Amish girl if they could.

, Situations are important, it depends where you wear clothes. If you are just wearing these items to your friends house, then tell them that the only person who will see you will be your friend.

, If you want to wear a tankini at the beach or at a pool, they might be happier if you wore surf shorts or boy shorts instead of bikini bottoms, or if you wore a sarong.

, Show her all the different kinds of tops and tankinis that you want to wear, and let her choose which one she would prefer you wearing! This will make mom a lot happier!

, Just as you know how to push all their buttons and make them upset, the reverse is true. Open communication is the only way to avoid knowing what the real obstacles to your goals are.

, Find out what's really at the heart of your parent's objections, then work on that.

Respect her answer.",How to Ask Your Mom if You Can Wear Makeup2," Your mom may say that you are too young for makeup or that you do not need to wear makeup. Agree with her, and then tell her that you only want to wear a little bit of makeup. Tell her that you do not want to wear a full face of makeup just a little lip gloss, mascara, or eye shadow.You may say, “You’re right Mom. I’m too young to wear a ton of makeup every day.

How about I only wear makeup for special occasions?”

Remember that you are not alone.,
Visualize another brave moment.",How to Ask for a Bra1," You will want to approach someone who you trust and who has the power to help you. This may be a parent, guardian, relative, or family friend. Choose a person who you know will keep your personal information private. The person that you ask will also need to have the money to purchase a bra for you or the ability to take you out shopping.


If you are uncertain about who to ask, it may help to write down a quick list of potential people. Then, try to assess the pros and cons of approaching each person on your list. For example, next to “Dad” you might write, “I trust him the most,” but, “I’m not sure he’d be comfortable talking about this.”;
, Sit in front of a mirror and walk through a mock conversation in which you ask for a bra. You can do both sides of the dialogue. Or, you can get a trusted friend to practice with you. This will better prepare you to accept counterarguments and to stay calm.

, Don’t pick a time when the person is particularly rushed or stressed. They will be less likely to listen to your request and give you a positive answer. Instead, find a time when they are relaxed and in a good mood. If you are talking with a parent, perhaps after dinner would be a good idea.

, To have their undivided attention, it is best if you talk with them when no one else is around. This will also ensure that whatever you have to say will stay private. Maybe mention something when you are both in the car. Or, perhaps try to get their attention right before you head to bed., If you are not quite ready to have a full conversation, you could briefly mention your request a few times over the course of a couple of weeks. Perhaps talk about how you will need some new clothing items for school? Or, you could talk about how a friend of yours just got her first bra. Keep it casual to see how your listener will react.


You might say, “I’ve been thinking that I might need some new sports clothes for gym class.” Then, you can bring up the idea of getting a sports bra and a regular one too.

, Many women have been exactly where you are and they were probably nervous too. This is a very common occurrence and can actually be an exciting time if you see it as another entry point into your teen years. If you are asking another woman for a bra, such as your mom, you might ask her about her first bra shopping experience., If your nerves seem to get the best of you, take a few minutes and think about a time when you were afraid and pushed through your fears. Tell yourself, “I did it then and I can do it now.” Just keep repeating this until you get up the courage to ask."

It is also a good idea to talk with them when your schedule is relatively open, in case they want to head out shopping right away., If the person asks why you need a bra, you might want to talk about the activities that you are involved in that require a great deal of movement. This means that you are not only asking for a bra for personal reasons, but for health ones as well.


For example, you could tell them about how you play basketball and how you need more chest support as you are running around the court.

, If you’ve noticed that many of your friends have recently gotten bras, you might mention this as well. However, just be sure to reassure the person you’re asking that you are not giving in to peer pressure, you actually need a bra. But, putting everything into context as part of puberty may make this transition easier for all involved.


You might say, “All of my friends are currently wearing bras and, from talking with them, I think that it is a good time for me to start doing it as well.”

, This is a good way to break the ice too. Ask if they would like to go shopping with you and then head to a department store. Then, browse around the racks like usual, but make your way to the lingerie and undergarments section.Looking through the bra offerings of a large store can be a bit overwhelming, so before you go it is a good idea to hop online and browse through the various styles and sizes available.

, If this is the case, you may want to ask again after a few days have passed. Or, you can save up some money and see if you can purchase one on your own.Try to be conservative in what you ask for initially. Don’t request an elaborate or expensive push-up bra. Instead, keep your requests fairly minimal.

, If you are simply too nervous to talk, then compose a quick letter to your parent or guardian in which you ask them to help you select and purchase a bra. Keep the letter brief and to-the-point. State your request in a polite way and then explain your reasoning. Make sure to tell them whether you would prefer a written or verbal response.


For example, you might write, “I think I need a bra because my chest frequently hurts when we play sports in school. I think that I could use the additional support that a bra would provide.”

Start with a training or sports bra.,
Buy one on your own.,
Get measured by a professional.,
Check the final fit.,
Consider buying multiples.",How to Ask for a Bra3," Sports bras are a smart first choice because they are easy to shop for and are comfortable as well. They will also offer support for your breasts without being constricting. A training bra is similar to a sports bra in that it is generally made from a breathable cotton-blend fabric and offers comfortable support. However, if you are a larger bust size you may need the support of a traditional, underwire bra.If you are not sure that you want a bra quite yet, then you may want to consider buying a few camisole tops. These are light shirts made out of soft fabrics, such as cotton, that have bra support built in., If you feel overwhelmed by the whole process of asking and then shopping, you may just want to go online with your own money and purchase a bra for yourself. Of course, you’ll want to make sure that making this purchase solo will not upset anyone, including your parents. But, you can take your own measurements and then test out at least one option without any pressure., Most stores have bra fitters on staff and they will help you by measuring both your bust and band size. Don’t be nervous or embarrassed about allowing them to measure you as they do this for a living and are used to women of all shapes and sizes. They will then help you to select a handful of bras that fit your body and budget., After you have a bra in your hand in the store, try it on in the dressing room and take some time determining how well it fits. You want a bra that does not squeeze you in an uncomfortable way. You will also want to watch to make sure that the straps are not cutting into your shoulders or back., You should probably buy a handful of bras, somewhere between four to six, when you decide to start wearing them daily. This will allow you to wash them after wearing and will keep the bras in good condition. Don’t feel as if you need to buy all of these at once, you can add to your undergarment wardrobe over time."

Talk about getting a new phone.,
Work to find solutions.,
Offer to put your own money toward your new phone.,
Be persistent without being rude.,
Build a convincing argument.,
Choose your moment wisely.,
Ask in good weather and after meals.,
Get your foot in the door with a small request.,
Make a deal with your parents.,
Wait for a holiday or birthday.,
Summarize what your parents say.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a New Phone," Sometimes, starting the conversation can lead you to a solution. Be polite when you tell you're parents that you are interested in getting a new phone, and really listen to what they have to say. If you can respond to your parents reasons and excuses for not getting you a new phone in a convincing way, they'll be more likely to shell out for your brand new mobile device. You might ask:


""What can I do to earn a new phone?""
""Are there any other chores I can help with to prove I'm ready for a new phone?"";
, Stay calm throughout your talk with your parents about your phone situation and keep your cool if you hear a ""no"" in response. This is an opportunity for you to show your maturity and to earn points with your parents. Instead of getting upset or frustrated, ask your parents:""What can I do to change your mind?""
""What can I do to prove to you that I need a new phone?""

, This can be tricky, especially if you're too young to work. If you have birthday money saved up, you can offer to put that toward getting a new phone, or you can offer to do more housework in exchange for an allowance.Offer your services as a babysitter to friends and family who have children that are younger than you who need supervision.
You might be able to earn money around your neighborhood doing seasonal chores, like mowing lawns in summer or shoveling snow in winter.

, When you want something badly, sometimes it's all you can think about. However, asking again and again can irritate your parents, making them less willing to get you a phone.Instead of asking the same question repeatedly, ask in a roundabout way that highlights your recent effort. You might say, for example:


""How does the kitchen look? I've been trying to help out by doing dishes. I thought that maybe if I helped out around the house more, we could talk again about getting me a new phone.""
""I know you've been busy with work lately, so I vacuumed the house for you. Is there anything else I can help with? I was thinking that if I contributed more, I might be able to get a new phone.""

, Your parents will be more likely to buy you a new phone if they agree with your reasoning.Your reasoning will be influenced by your personal situation, so you'll have decide which arguments will work best for you. Some you might want to consider include:


Safety features, like improved GPS
Poor reception due to an outdated model
Earning money to buy your own phone will teach you responsibility
Unreliability, like your phone turning on and off randomly or messages arriving late to your phone

, Times when your parents are busy, flustered, or angry are likely to result in a ""no"" to your phone request. Encourage a good mood in your parents before you ask, by being extra polite and doing any chores you might have before they ask. To improve your chances of a yes before you ask for your new phone, you also might:Turn on your parents' favorite music
Talk about an experience where you both had fun
Do an activity your parents find enjoyable

, Generally speaking, people are more agreeable after they eat, and this might put your parents in a more favorable mood when you ask for your new phone.Weather can also make your parents more or less agreeable. Sunny days with clear skies will improve your odds of getting the phone you desire., Your parents will be more likely to agree to your request for a new phone if you get them to first agree to a few small, related requests.If your parents use the excuse that a new phone would cost more money, ask if you could pick up more chores or household responsibilities to earn a little extra money. Then ask if you can put that money toward a new phone.

, If your parents are open to you doing extra work around the house or some other task to earn your phone, stay on top of your extra chores without being asked. This will show your parents that you are taking your agreement seriously, which will result in your parents taking it seriously as well., While your parents might normally be unwilling to pay the cost of a new phone, a special day, like a gift giving holiday, can be the ideal excuse to splurge on a present. During this time, be clear with your parents. Let them know that you'd rather have a phone than toys or gifts you might not use., Listen to what your parents have to say carefully, and then when it's your turn to speak, put what they said in your own words. By showing that you hear and respect what they are saying, you will improve your chances of getting your new phone.An example like this might look like:



You: Mom, so if I'm hearing you right, you don't think a new phone is worth the cost and you're worried that I'll drop it like my last phone. I hear what you're saying, but I have some ideas...

"
"
Keep track of your current phone and other gadgets.,
Take care of all of your expensive belongings.,
Stay on top of your chores.,
Keep (or get) your grades up.,
Consider getting a tutor.,
Consider getting a job.,
Spend your money responsibly.,
Make and stick to, a budget.,
Research the costs.,
Prove that you are responsible.,
Ask to sit down with your parents.,
Explain how you can use the iPhone to stay organized.,
Explain how you will use the iPhone for homework.,
Let your parents know that you will be careful when you're online or texting.,
Promise your parents that you won't sleep with your iPhone.,
Promise to go easy with texting.,
Be willing to let your parents ""spy"" on you.,
Let your parents know how grateful you will be.Once you've made your pitch, try something like the following: “Mom and Dad, I know that I'm asking for a lot and that I'm asking you to trust me.,
Give your parents time to think it over.,
Be prepared for rejection.,
If so, you can suggest giving it a trial-run, and be willing to give the phone up if you don't keep all of your promises.,
Respect their final decision.,
Keep your word.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You an iPhone," If you have a tendency to lose or break your expensive belongings, your parents probably won't be eager to ""waste"" more money on an expensive iPhone. You need to devote several weeks or even months to turning things around before you make your request.If you already have a phone, keep careful track of it. If you are constantly losing it, your parents will remember that when you ask them to upgrade you to a more expensive model.;
, Take care of your other electronic devices too, such as your gaming systems, iPods, tablets, and/or computer. Keep them clean, organized, and well-protected. For example, always carry your laptop in its protective sleeve, never eat or drink around it, etc.


You should also be careful with your jewelry, watches, and other expensive accessories. If you recently lost the pricey earrings you received for Christmas, for example, your parents may take that as evidence that you shouldn't be trusted with something else (like an iPhone!).

, Your parents will notice if you have been doing your chores regularly without them having to nag you. This will go a long way when it comes time for you to convince them that you deserve an iPhone.


By completing your chores quickly and without complaint—and perhaps even by being willing to do more chores—you are showing your parents that you take your responsibilities seriously and that you care about helping out.

, While an iPhone can be a helpful tool for school (more on that later), your parents may be worried that it will distract you from your studies. Before you talk to your parents about getting an iPhone, take a careful, honest look at your grades.


If they are weak, then you should take the rest of the term (or an additional term) to bring them up into an acceptable range. Meet with your instructors to get feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and to make a plan about how to get your grades up.

, You may be able to get free tutoring through your school, but even if you (or your parents) have to pay for it, it will be money well-spent:


You'll be able to do better at school and will be showing your parents that you take your education seriously.

, As part of your strategy to convince your parents to get you an iPhone, you may want to help pay for it.You'll, of course, need money of your own to be able to do this.


So long as your parents are ok with it, consider finding a part-time job after school or on weekends. Scope out local grocery stores, shops, and/or restaurants to see if they have any openings.
Advertise your services as a tutor, babysitter, or lawn-care worker, or start your own business making and selling crafts, or selling baked goods.

, Once you have a flow of cash coming in, you may be very tempted to spend it on fun things, such as new clothes, video games, or nights out at the movies. While there's nothing wrong with treating yourself to some luxuries if you can afford it, you have a larger goal in sight.


Whether your money comes from your own work or from an allowance or gifts, you need to show your parents that you are able to save and budget your money.

, Take the time to draw up a budget which outlines your weekly/monthly income, and which lists your regular expenses. Then, be very careful about sticking to your budget.


This may mean that you will have to turn down an occasional invitation to go out for pizza with friends, but keep your eye on the prize.
By following a budget, you are developing discipline and focus. You will soon be in a better position to be able to show your parents that you can afford to help out with the costs of having an iPhone and data plan.

, Before you meet with your parents, do some research on your own about the current costs of either buying or upgrading to an iPhone. Be sure to find out what carrier your family uses and what your current plan is, and then go online to research the costs.


It may be possible that you can get the phone itself at very little cost, or perhaps even for free, depending upon your family's current plan and rewards program.Even so, your parents may have to pay an additional $40 a month to add a new smartphone to a shared data plan, which will amount to almost $500 more a year.While the cost could be lower, the point is that you need to do your best to learn what the current costs are and how much of a financial burden the addition of an iPhone will add to your family's monthly expenses.

, You have been working hard to become more responsible with your time, money, and belongings: good for you! Hopefully, your parents have noticed, but now is the time to show them your evidence.


Gather copies of your recent report cards or graded exams and assignments.
You may also want to collect your pay stubs and a copy of your current bank balance.
Be sure to include a copy of your budget which includes the amount you'll be able to contribute to the phone.
Place all of these documents in a folder, which will be part of your presentation to your parents.

, It's important that you choose the right time and place to have this conversation with your parents. You want to convince them of your seriousness, and you want to up your chances of getting a positive answer.Instead of ambushing your parents at the end of a long work day, try the following: “Mom and Dad, I've been researching all of the advantages of having an iPhone, and I think I'm now mature and responsible enough to have one. I've prepared a proposal I'd like to go over with you. Can we talk about it sometime this weekend?”
They may be wondering who this new, mature person is, which is a good sign for you!

, Once your parents have agreed to sit down with you, you'll want to explain to them how useful it can be. One of the most useful features of this smartphone is its built-in organizational tools, such as its calendar feature.


Explain how you can use this to keep track of your school, work, and extra-curricular activities, and also explain how your parents can send you appointment information which will then appear in your phone's calendar. , The iPhone is essentially a portable computer with easy access to internet resources; having one is like having immediate access to the best libraries, teachers, and references.Explain to your parents all of the useful features you'll have at your fingertips with an iPhone, such as free dictionary and encyclopedia apps, and easy access to your class websites.
It may help to have a list of these educational apps ready to show your parents. You can also have a page to the app store pulled up on your laptop/computer, or you may even be able to borrow a good friend's iPhone to use during your demonstration.

, Your parents may be aware of studies which report alarming statistics, such a recent one which indicates that as many as 1 in 3 young people had sent a nude picture of him/herself to someone else, and that more than half had been asked to do so. That same study also suggested that kids who sext may be more sexually active.Let your parents know that you won't use your phone to sext or to take sexual pictures of yourself, and promise them that you'll let them know if anyone else makes you uncomfortable or makes sexual advances towards you. Take may be the most convincing thing for your parents to get it.

, Your parents may also be worried that you'll become “hooked” to your iPhone, and will stay up late surfing the web and responding to texts.


Studies have suggested that sleeping with your phone near you can interfere with your sleep, and may possibly be linked to depression.Agree to turn your phone off at night and leave it in a separate room. While the iPhone does have a built-in alarm, you can get by with an old-fashioned clock.

, Even if your plan will come with unlimited texting, your parents may be worried that you'll spend too much time glued to your phone, sending and responding to texts from friends.


This can make you less connected to your family, and could possibly hurt your communication skills. Let your parents know that you are willing to put down the phone during dinner and when you are all hanging out together, and let them know that you won't text when it's time to study.

, Your parents will probably be more willing to let you have an iPhone if you are open to them using the parental control features.With these, your parents can see how much time you spend on your phone, and keep track of the sites you visit, among other things.
In fact, your parents may even feel comfortable giving you more freedom once they know that they can use GPS and tracking features to know where you are and who you are with.

, If you're willing to give me a chance, I won't let you down, and I'll be super grateful.”

, Your parents may want or need to time to think things over and discuss it together privately, and demanding an immediate answer won't help your case.Let them know you are willing to wait for their answer: “Thanks for hearing me out. Do you guys need time to talk about this together?”

, You've made your very best case for why you can be trusted with an iPhone, and of course, your hopes are high. Your parents may say “No,” though.


Even though you have your reasons for having an iPhone, your parents surely have their own reasons for saying no right now. It's fine for you to ask them to share their reasons with you, and if they are willing to do so, you might be able to address their concerns and change their minds., For this to work, you have to accept it if you need it to be taken away.

, If your parents reject all of your suggestions, ask them if they'd be willing to reconsider it down the road, and then leave it at that.


You'll have better luck getting a “yes” in a few months if you can keep from nagging or pouting while you wait.

, If your parents come back with a positive response—congratulations! You now need to live up to all of the promises you made.


For example, if you promised to turn off your phone at 9 pm every night, then do it! Don't think that your parents won't know or won't care if you sometimes check it at 10 or 11 after they've gone to bed.

What programs will I use? How much storage space do I need? With these needs in mind, compare prices on laptops with the features you want.Try looking at the refurbished or used laptops that brands and retailers sell for very reduced prices.Create your own comparison chart of prices and features of several possible laptops, or find and print one from online to show your parents that you’ve given this a lot of thought and research.;
, Consider what you can do in exchange for your parents buying you a laptop. Promise good grades on your next report card, a certain amount of chores per week or month, or another goal you know your parents would like to see you achieve.


Try coming up with a specific goal that you can stick with and achieve. When you talk to your parents, you can say, “I’ll get a better grade in English next semester,” or something that you know could use improvement and that you think you can achieve., Think of all the ways that a laptop would make your life easier or more successful. When the time comes to talk to your parents, point out to them your practical reasons to have one, as well as the benefits of a laptop over a desktop, like portability, convenience, and that it doesn’t take up space.


For school, think of how you could use a laptop to take notes (if allowed), to bring to study groups or tutoring, or to access online libraries and other reference resources. If you’re off to college in the near future, you can point out to your parents that you will need a laptop for notes, research, and to make video calls home!Some students actually do better in school with laptops if they have a very slow handwriting speed or other difficulty taking notes.

Make sure to explain why you want one, what you’re willing to do to get it, and how much you would appreciate their help in buying it.

I know I don’t have enough to pay for all of it right now, and I was hoping you could help me out and give me your permission to get one. I really appreciate the things you’ve bought or helped me buy in the past, and I think this will be something that’s useful to me and worth the money.""

, Offer your parents the research and reasoning you’ve written out. Give them time to look it over and discuss any questions or comments they have about it.


If you’ve created a contract or agreement, you can have them make edits or additions and tell them you can all sign it when you’re in agreement, to make it official.

, Listen carefully to the reasons they might have for hesitating or being unwilling to buy you a laptop. Avoid reacting with anger, whining, or impatience, because they will be even less likely to agree or even talk about it with you.

, Show that you understand that a laptop is an expensive investment, and you’re willing to pay for part of it, if you have the money, or pay them back for all or part of it over time. Use money from an allowance or job, or discuss other ways that you could earn money and pay your parents back if possible.

Consider giving in to them setting parental controls on the laptop or other measures they feel they need to take.


You might agree to only use the laptop in your living room while at home, only use it for schoolwork and internet instead of games, or another similar compromise.
Also discuss any consequences there would or should be for losing or damaging a laptop. You could offer to pay for a durable case or cover to ensure it doesn’t get broken, or even chip in on insurance for it if your parents want to help you look into that option.

, After laying out your whole argument and discussing options with your parents, give them time to consider it. Wait patiently for them if they need more time to think it over or do their own research on the best laptops and prices.

Come back to me once you’ve had time to think it over.”If your parents do say no, accept their answer and don’t fight it. Show your maturity and let the subject drop for now.

If your parents are worried about money, then they are likely to say that they can’t afford a new phone.
If you play a lot of video games, then your parents may worry that you’ll download too many gaming apps.
If your older sibling got caught talking to someone they weren’t supposed to, then your parents may worry that you’ll do the same.;
, You need to counter your parents’ reasons why you shouldn’t get a phone, so find an argument against each of the reasons you just listed.


Show your parents that the phone won’t cost as much as they think, or explain to them how you will help pay for it.
Ask your friends for free gaming apps, or be prepared to promise your parents that you won’t download any games. If it’s the time you spend gaming that your parents are worried about, then promise to cut back on video games if you get the phone.
Promise to let your parents periodically check who you are texting or messaging.

, You’re more likely to convince your parents if you have a strong case, so plan to show them that your new phone is a necessity by brainstorming all the reasons why you need one.


A phone would allow you to call your parents if you’re in trouble or to contact emergency services if you’re in danger.
Remind them that kids your age often encounter peer pressure, so having an easy way to contact them would allow you to have an “out” in such situations.
If you miss school, you could ask your friend for their notes and the assignments.

, Your parents need to know that you can take care of the phone, so think of how you’ve shown them that you are responsible in the past.Remember to do your homework everyday.
Do all of your chores without your parents asking.
Take care of your clothes, backpack, and video games.
Responsibly spend your lunch money, and save any money you receive as a gift.

, Present the phone as an ongoing reward that you will have to continue to earn. For example, your parents could require you to keep your grades up, do extra chores, or help pay for the plan., Ask your parents when they are relaxed and in a good mood. If they are busy, rushed, or having a hard day, wait to ask. Don’t interrupt your parents if they’re already talking to someone, whether it’s on the phone or face-to-face.If your parents are busy with an activity, it’s okay to let them know that you want to talk to them when they have a free moment. Say, “Hey, mom. I see that you’re making dinner right now, but if you have time tonight I’d like to talk about something.”
Consider writing a letter to request the phone.

, Be polite and sensible throughout the discussion. If you whine, argue, or storm off, then your parents will see that you aren’t mature enough for a phone.

, You can appeal to their emotions in several ways, including their concern for your safety, your need for independence, and your need for social acceptance.If you go out of town for a sport or activity, tell your parents that the phone will allow you to stay in contact with them while you’re gone.
Tell them a story about a kid who was in danger and needed to call someone. For example, say, “Remember last month when a stranger stopped that girl two streets down? She used her cell phone to call 9-1-1 and got help.”
Explain how not having a phone has negatively affected you socially.

, Show your parents that getting you a phone makes the most sense for your family. Incorporate the responses you prepared for their potential reasons against the phone.For example, if your parents pick you up from practice, tell them that you could call when it’s time to pick you up.
Use your planned responses. Say, “I know that you’re worried that I’ll play on my phone during dinner, but I promise to leave it in my bedroom the whole time we’re eating.”

, Print out a news article about why kids your age should have phones. Choose a credible news source that your parents will believe.Try a parenting blog that says you should get a kid a phone at your age or younger than you are.
Avoid posts written by other kids.

, Explain to your parents that you will do more chores in exchange for getting a phone, and explain how you can use the phone to do more work for school., Your parents are more likely to say yes if you agree to their rules for using the phone and allow them to check up on what you’re using it for.Suggest ways that they can check your phone to ensure that you’ve followed their rules. You may even suggest a phone tracking app so that they can track your location.
If your parents say that you're not allowed to do something like texting friends, don't get upset. Over time, they will allow you to if you show you’re mature and responsible.

, Don’t be concerned about the type of phone or its features. Offer to let them select a pre-paid plan or cheaper phone model for your first phone.

, If you have saved some of your allowance or gift money, offer to use it to buy the phone. You could also offer to forgo your allowance to help pay the phone bill or to contribute money that you earn from a job, babysitting, or mowing yards., If they say no, don’t protest or plead with them. Show that you are mature by listening to what they say without reacting.Stay calm, and take a deep breath before you respond.
Avoid arguments. Arguing with your parents won’t change their minds; instead, they’ll likely become more resistant to the idea of you getting a phone.
Understand their response. If your parents say no, remember that they have a good reason. They have your best interest in mind, or may just not be able to add the expense of a phone right now.

, Whether you get a yes or a no, you need to ask your parents a few clarifying questions to know what you need to do next.If they say yes, ask them for their rules and expectations. Say, “I’m so excited about getting my new phone! How can I prove to you guys that you’re making a good decision?”
If they say no, ask them what you can do to show them that you’re ready for a phone. Say, “What can I do to show you that I’m responsible enough for a phone?”

, If your parents say yes, then talk to them about when you can go phone shopping. If they say no, take steps to show your parents that you are responsible and reconsider how you can show them that you need a phone.If they say no, remember that you can ask again, so try not to get upset. Instead, think about what you can do now to help yourself be successful the next time you ask.
Remember, when you are asking your parents for the phone, never disturb them by again and again asking to buy the phone. They wont be satisfied with your behaviour.

Let the matter rest.,
Use your new phone judiciously.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Smartphone," Yes, of course you’re hoping that your parents will pay for your phone, but two things:


If you offer to pay at least part of the cost, you’ll be showing your parents that you take the situation seriously and it will make them more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt.
If your parents say no, you can continue saving your money and approach them later, offering to cover even more of the cost to show your commitment.;
, In addition to making good argumentative points, you should show your parents that you’re responsible enough to merit a smartphone.Take care of your current possessions. Keep what you do have, whether it’s a laptop, tablet, or flip phone, in good shape. Protect it, don’t drop it, don’t lose it, and let your parents see how well you’re taking care of it.
Act responsibly by attending to your assigned chores, or, if you don’t have specific chores assigned to you, pay attention to what needs to be done around the house and do it without being asked. Take out the trash, set the trash cans out on trash day and bring them back in afterward, change and wash your sheets, clean the dog poop out of the yard, wash the dishes in the sink, straighten up the living room, etc.
The more you demonstrate responsible behavior, the more likely your parents will be to see you as responsible enough for a smartphone.

, Show your parents that you’re focused enough and doing well enough in school to handle a smartphone.


If it seems like you’re barely getting through your classes as it is, they’re unlikely to want to give you anything to additionally distract you.
For the weeks leading up to when you’ll ask your parents, work on doing all your homework, getting As on tests and quizzes, etc.

, Carefully select the right time to approach your parents for this conversation.Choose a time when they’re calm and not stressed or distracted.
Don’t pounce on them right when they get home from somewhere--and especially don’t approach them as soon as they’re home from work.
Don’t try to open the topic when other people are around. You don’t want potentially jealous siblings in the room, nor do you want to approach your parents if their friends or relatives are around (they’re more likely to be stressed or distracted)., First and foremost, you need to have the right attitude when approaching your parents with this request.Open the conversation calmly and maturely with something like, “Do you guys have a few minutes? There’s something very important I’d like to talk to you about.”
Lead into the discussion with a demonstration that you appreciate the things they’ve already given you and the amount of time and energy they put into helping you on a daily basis. You might say something like, “I really appreciate how much time and effort you put into helping me with my homework and making dinner . And I’m really thankful for the bike you gave me for Christmas because it’s really helping me to get around .”

, Before asking the question, preface it with something like “You don’t have to say yes or no right now” to let them know that you’re willing to give them time to think it over.


Taking away the pressure of an immediate response will help your parents listen to what you have to say without immediately making up their minds; when parents have to immediately decide something, the answer is often no., When you’re ready to pose the question itself, do so politely but also sincerely--that is, don’t be obviously obsequious or saccharine. It will only make your parents suspicious of you and your true motives.Form the question so that you’re opening a dialog rather than dropping a bombshell. You might, for example, say something like “I’d like to talk with you about my getting a smartphone.”

, Showing your parents you care enough and are responsible enough to save money to put towards the phone may help convince them you’re ready for one.maybe even offer to pay most of the cost.


Explain to your parents that you specifically went out of your way to save this money so that you could take responsibility for part of the cost of the phone.
Explain further that you’ll also be invested in the phone, and will thus have a vested interest in taking care of it and not losing it.

, What are smartphones for if not for organization? Well, a lot of things, but you don’t need to mention that part.


Your smartphone will allow you to keep all of your events in one calendar, and--most importantly--it’s a calendar you can share with them so they can see what you’ve got going on.
A smartphone’s calendar will help you schedule long-term school projects, thus helping you better manage your time and do better in school.
Because you can sync your calendar to your parents’, they can input and set up reminders for important things they need you to remember, like dentist and doctor appointments.

, With a smartphone, you always have a comprehensive, worldwide map right in your hand, plus a list of emergency contacts and a GPS tracking system.


If you’re ever driving somewhere, you phone can guide you and even help you avoid hazards.
If you’re walking, your phone can prevent you from getting lost in unfamiliar places.
Talk about how a smartphone will help you stay in touch with them at all times because they not only allow you to text or call your parents whenever you need to, they also have GPS abilities that can allow your parents to know where you are.
A number of tracking apps allow you and your family members to keep track of each other, which can be particularly helpful for parents who tend to worry frequently about your whereabouts.

, Smartphones are perfect for getting work done anytime, any place.


More and more school assignments require internet research, and with a smartphone, you can do your work while waiting for the bus, in between classes, etc.There are all kinds of great study- and productivity-enhancing apps available to download to help you with everything from note-taking to brainstorming to task management., If you did the groundwork of keeping or getting your grades up, now’s the time to let it work for you.


Don’t just tell or promise your parents that you’ll do well in school if you have a smartphone. Instead, have physical evidence to back you up--a report card, some exams you aced, a recent project or paper, etc.
Explain that not only will a smartphone help you in school now, it will help you continue to excel.

, A smartphone will eliminate the need to have and carry around multiple devices for email, movies, music, and books.


Instead of having separate devices for all of your work and entertainment needs, you can carry just one smartphone. So your parents will have fewer devices to buy and you’ll have fewer gadgets to lose or break.

, It’s not uncommon for parents to worry about what their kids can access on the internet, particularly if the internet lives in their pocket. So try to head these concerns off at the past.


If they have reservations about what you can access with your smartphone or about how much you might use your smartphone, tell them not to worry. Remind them that they can set parental controls on the phone to put their mind at ease.Your parents can set controls via your cellular carrier that include limits on the number of texts and calls you can make, as well as the amount of purchases you can make and the amount of data you can use per month.
Your parents can also set specific controls using your smartphone’s operating system, including setting up safe search on your phone’s browser and on YouTube.
Finally, there are a number of smartphone apps designed specifically to enable additional parental controls on the phone., Many parents have reservations about their kids not knowing the right and wrong things to do with a smartphone, so help reassure them.


Remind them of how it will help you learn money-management. Not only will you be demonstrating financial responsibility if you offer to pay part of the cost, you can also continue to hone your financial skills with the number of helpful tools and apps available on a smartphone.
Certain apps will allow you to draw up a budget and then help you to follow it while others allow your parents to set up a list of chores and a monetary amount for you to receive upon completing them.Talk about your knowledge of responsible phone use: describe your understanding that you shouldn’t--and won’t--send inappropriate text messages or images and tell them you understand that certain kinds of apps will be inappropriate and will let them have final say on what you have on your phone.
If you really want to show them how serious you are, tell them that you and they can write up an agreement which you can all sign outlining what you will and won’t do with your phone.

, This is important--don’t blow your current or future chances of getting a smartphone by over-reacting one way or another.


If they say no, accept the answer calmly and patiently. Don’t whine, yell, rant, or plead. If you stay calm and measured, there are a few more steps you can take (see below) to help your cause. Ask them why they’re making that decision (and work on those things if they’re under your control, like doing better in school, getting along with your siblings, etc.)
If they say yes, thank them calmly for hearing you out and for trusting in your responsibility. Don't launch into a victory dance or start jumping up and down on the couch--it may very well make them reconsider their decision.

, More and more phones being produced are smartphones, and quite soon smartphones will dominate the market to the point that non-smartphones will be increasingly rare.


So remind them that they’re really delaying the inevitable--it will give them something to think about.
But do not remind them of this fact in a whining or self-pitying way--you need to be mature and thoughtful if you want this to work.

, Don’t continually come after them if they said no.


Hounding your parents about the issue is likely to both annoy them (thus hurting your cause) and show them that maybe you really aren’t mature enough for a smartphone (really hurting your cause).
Letting the issue rest will also give your parents additional time to think and to consider your arguments. With time, they may come to agree more with your point of view.
You can bring the issue up again in several weeks or months. Wait until you have something new and substantial to add to your argument--a straight-A report card, a month’s worth of perfect chores, etc.

, If and when you get a smartphone, use it responsibly.


Don’t go over your data, text, or call limits.
Don’t spend all your time glued to your phone. Pay attention and be present with your friends and family.
Don’t pull out your phone at the dinner table or at family gatherings.
Don’t set up obnoxious ringtones or sound effects--you want to be able to keep your new phone, right?

Accept a ""No"" for now.",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Computer or Laptop," Your parents are unlikely to buy you an expensive laptop, especially if you've never had a laptop before. Before asking your parents for a laptop, do some research. Find some affordable laptops with good reviews. You can read reviews online or in magazines about computers and electronics. If your parents see you've made a plan, they may be more likely to say ""Yes"" to your request.Many of the more expensive laptops cost over $1,000, but you can find a lot of suitable laptops for under $500. Think about your needs. Pick a laptop you can use for things your parents would approve of, like schoolwork. You can, for example, look for a laptop with built in word processing features.
Try to find a laptop that's durable. Your parents may feel it would be a bad idea to buy you a laptop as you may break it. Look for laptops with a reputation for withstanding a lot of damage.
Find a laptop that does not require a lot of maintenance. Your parents won't want to buy you something that will be breaking down a lot.;
, You want your parents to see how a laptop can help you. They're unlikely to invest a lot of money in something you'll just use recreationally. Find reasons your laptop can help you be more responsible.Jot down the academic benefits of a laptop. You can talk about how a laptop can help you prepare for school. You can show your parents software and games that help you learn subjects like math, English, and science.
See if there are any apps you can find that help you maintain a schedule. Maybe there's a to-do list app that could help you keep track of your homework, for example.

, Your parents may have reservations about getting you a laptop. They may worry that it will distract from school or have safety concerns. Think of ways you can counter these concerns when asking for your laptop.Your parents may worry about you spending too much time in front of a screen, which can cause problems with eyesight and posture. Your parents may also worry you'll become inactive if you have a laptop. You can tell them you'd be willing to only use the laptop for a set time each day.
You can also make sure you know how to use the laptop correctly. Promise your parents you'll keep proper posture when using your laptop. You should also promise to look away from the screen every 20 minutes when using the computer, which is healthier for your eyes.
Also, let them know you'd be happy to let them install security software and parental controls to make sure you're using the laptop safely.

, Your parents will be more willing to give in to a request if they think you've earned it. As you prepare to ask your parents, work on showing how responsible you are. A high level of maturity and personal responsibility will reflect well on you when making the request.Find small ways to show you're responsible. Clean your dishes after dinner without being asked. Do a small household chore for one of your parents.
If you show that you embrace responsibility, this will make you look mature. This can reflect highly on you when you ask for a laptop.

, Once you feel your case is ready, find a time to talk. You want to make sure you pick the right time to stop your parents to ask. A time when one or both of your parents are stressed is not a good time.Think about when your family has free time throughout the day. If Tuesday nights are always packed, do not ask then. However, maybe your parents usually have downtime Wednesdays shortly after dinner. This may be a good time to ask.
Try to eliminate distractions when asking. Wait until the television is turned off and neither one of your parents are busy with electronic devices like cellphones.

, If you're nervous, practicing can help. Stand in front of a mirror and rehearse what you plan to say to your parents. Restate your case several times until you can easily sum up why you want a laptop. You may be nervous during the actual conversation, so rehearsing beforehand can help.

, Beginning the discussion is simple. While you may be nervous going in, a few quick words can start the conversation. For example, say something like, ""Mom, Dad, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have a minute?"", Asking directly will show you're mature, and help the discussion progress effectively. Get to the point right away, and provide the details you gathered that help make your case.Start off the conversation introducing what you want. For example, ""I would really like a laptop or computer of my own.""
From there, state your case. Bring up the benefits of a laptop. For instance, ""I think it could help with schoolwork. Sometimes, I have papers to write, but Sam is using the computer for her homework. My own laptop would just make that easier.""
Remember to address any potential concerns. For example, ""I know you might worry about me being locked in my room all day, but I would be happy to limit my computer time to a few hours each day if you want.""

, If you come off as entitled, this may make your parents more likely to say ""No."" When asking, make sure to show your parents appreciation. You want them to feel valued when you ask them for a laptop.Express how much you appreciate what your parents do. You can say something like, ""I know how hard you guys work to afford everything I have. I really appreciate that, and I know a laptop is not cheap.""
This way, you'll sound mature and grateful. Your parents will know that you've really thought a lot about why you need a laptop and are not just asking on a whim. You understand how much these items cost.

, Your parents may hesitate. They may have certain concerns that they need addressed before agreeing to a purchase. Instead of getting hostile, remain calm and listen.Your parents probably have a reason for saying ""No"" or for expressing uncertainty. Try to understand this reason. Your parents will appreciate knowing their voices have been heard in the conversation.
You can try briefly summarizing what your parents said to make it clear you understood. For example, ""I understand you're worried about my physical health. You don't want me sitting indoors all day wasting time online.""

, You never want to steer the conversation into an unproductive direction. Do not argue with your parents or complain. This will only make your parents less likely to listen to you. If you feel the conversation is not getting anywhere, end the conversation and do something to blow off steam. Go for a walk, for example, instead of blowing up at your parents., If your parents say ""No"" right away, see if you can offer something in return for the laptop. There may be a deal your parents are willing to strike. This way, you can eventually earn the laptop.For example, maybe your parents are concerned with your grades in a particular course. You could offer to bring up your math grade in exchange for a new laptop.
Your parents may also be worried about money. Try offering to put in some money of your own from an after school job in exchange for a new laptop.

, You do not want to be argumentative or confrontational with your parents. However, it can help to know why they're saying, ""No."" This way, you can potentially address any issues.Ask politely. Do not say something like, ""This is so unfair! Why can't I have a laptop?""
Instead, try something like, ""I understand you don't want me to have a laptop. Can you tell me the reason why?""

, Offer a compromise in as mature a manner possible. If you present a clear, concrete compromise, your parents may be able to meet you halfway.Make the terms clear. Do not say, ""If you let me have a laptop, I won't use it that often."" Instead, go for specific timeframes. For example, ""How about if I have a laptop, I will only use it for 2 hours a day and I'll make a point of turning it off an hour before bed.""
You can also suggest appropriate punishments in the event you break the conditions of the compromise. For example, ""You can take the laptop away for a week if I use it for more than two hours in one day.""

, Even if you ask calmly and maturely, your parents may still say, ""No."" A laptop is expensive and your parents may have many concerns regarding you using one. In the event you get a ""No"" for an answer now, accept as much. Say something like, ""Thank you for listening anyway. I appreciate that.""You can try asking again in a few months. If your parents see you're mature enough to gracefully accept a ""No,"" they may reconsider in the future.

Own your reasons for wanting a bra.,
State your feelings.,
Practice what you will say.",How to Ask Your Mom for a Bra1," Write down two to three valid reasons for wanting a bra. And try to make your reasons personal.

Just remember that your mom was a girl who needed a bra once, too.For example, perhaps you play sports and you realize that a bra will provide you with the support you need.
If you are developing and it's becoming noticeable, say ""I need support and coverage so that I don't show more than I want. People keep staring at me and I think it's because they can see I'm not wearing a bra.""
Try to avoid using the ""everyone else is doing it"" reason; parents don't usually see this as a valid reason.;
, It is natural to feel nervous or embarrassed about discussing sensitive topics, like wearing a bra, with your mom. Perhaps you are afraid your mom will misunderstand you, reject your request, or punish you for asking. But don’t let these feelings prevent you from talking with your mom. Instead, translate your feelings into words when you approach your mom about the topic.For example, “I feel a little embarrassed talking about this, but I need to ask you something mom,” or ""Mom, can I ask you something personal? I wanted to know at what age you started wearing a bra because I think it is time for me to get one. I hope you understand.""

, Write down three or four different ways of asking your mom for a bra. Say them out loud and see which one feels the most natural. Once you have nailed down what you would like to say, rehearse it out loud or in front of the mirror until the words come out naturally.For example, you could say, “Mom, I need to ask you something. It is not anything bad, but it is a little embarrassing. I don’t know if you have noticed, but my body has been going through some changes lately. I think it is time for me to wear a bra. I think a bra would help me feel more comfortable and secure about my body.”

, You want a Mac. Show your parents you love Apple and not Windows PC or Microsoft.

, Have a friend bring a Mac (recommended) or another Apple product over to show you and your parents. Act fascinated around it to show your parents.

Start by asking nicely.,
Stay calm and show patience.,
Discuss the age limit.,
Tell them the positive effects of video games.,
Mention friends that have the game.,
Offer to pay for it.,
Address violence.,
Compare to R-rated movies.",How to Ask Your Parents for a Mature Video Game1," Simply be kind, clear, and polite when you ask for the game. Say, “Mom, Dad, can I please have this game? It’s really important to me.” You can point out that you haven’t asked for a game in awhile or you have a birthday or other occasion coming up if that’s true.


Talk through what makes them concerned. Ask your parents what elements of the rating they are hesitant about, which are usually listed as intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content, and/or strong language. Whatever they mention, provide reasoning and reassurance for why playing the game doesn’t influence you to copy those things in real life.








Say, ""If you see me acting more violent than you can take away the game."" Or, ""Sex is optional and if you see me doing it you can take away the game.""
For drugs say, ""In health class they teach us the affects of drugs and why not to take them.""
If the strong language bothers them, for example, you can say, “Look, if you hear me not being kind using those words, you can take away the game."";
, Avoid getting in arguments and getting frustrated with your parents if they say no. Come back to them in a week or so with a calm and respectful demeanor to present a new angle for why you should have the game. Display that you care enough about the game that you can be patient and respectful when asking for it.

, If you’re 17 years old or older, you are definitely of an age to purchase the game for yourself, but if you are younger than 17, point out to your parents that the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) classifies the Mature rating as “generally suitable” for 17 and up, but there is no legal requirement for selling this game to people under 17., Let your parents know that there are positive things about playing video games that they may not know about. Refer to studies that show that video game play can strengthen problem-solving skills and prevent anxiety. You can tell them that first-person shooter games, which are generally more violent, are also shown to improve spatial reasoning, navigation, memory, and perception., Tell your parents about friends you know of that have the game you want, and even suggest that your parents talk to theirs about why they agreed to let their child have the game.

, Reassure your parents that you will pay for the game with your own money from an allowance, job, or savings.

, Ask your parents if they are concerned about the potential violence in the video game, because a major concern of many parents is that playing violent video games will lead to having more violent tendencies in real life. Do some research to find any of a number of studies that show that violent video games don’t make a person more violent and show it to them.You can say, “The violence really doesn’t affect me. I don’t get in fights in school or anything. But if the violence in this game starts to bother me, I’ll tell you or I’ll stop playing it.”

, If you’ve been allowed to watch any R-rated movies in the past, point out to your parents that an R rating has the same “suggested” age limit of 17 that the M rating for games has. Pick some examples of movies that might have similar themes to the game you want to buy to illustrate that you’re mature enough to handle them.

Arrange a time to talk.,
Ask while you are out shopping.,
Write a note or send a text.",How to Ask Your Mom for a Bra2," Try to avoid bringing up the topic when your mom is busy. If she is busy, she is less likely to listen to and hear what you have to say. Instead, give her a heads up by arranging a time to talk. This way your mom knows that you need to talk to her about something important, and she can give you her full attention.You can say, for example, “Hey mom, I need to talk to you about something important. When would be a good time talk?”
People are usually more open after eating a meal, so bringing up the topic after dinner may work as well.

, If you are uncomfortable asking your mom directly, then you can try suggesting the idea of wearing a bra. Arrange a time to go shopping with your mom. When you are approaching the bra department or store in the mall, ask if you two can go in together to check it out. Once you are in the store, ask your mom, “Do you think it is time for me to wear I bra? I kind of feel like it is time.”As you approach the store you could also say, “Mom can we take a look in the bra section? I kind of think it is time for me to start wearing a bra.”

, If you are afraid that your mom will be harsh or overly critical, or you just cannot get over your embarrassment, then try this strategy. Write a note detailing why you think you need a bra. Give her the note when she is not busy. Tell her to read the note, think about it and come talk to you afterwards.Alternatively, you could write the note and then read it to her out loud while you are alone together; for example, while you are both alone in the car or on a walk.

Remain calm.,
Suggest an alternative.,
Talk to another trusted adult.",How to Ask Your Mom for a Bra3," If your mom doesn’t agree with you or tells you no, try not to argue, yell or whine. Instead, remain calm and keep your tone of voice friendly and understanding. Then ask your mom why now is not the right time.For example, “When do you think the right time is?” or “When did you get your first bra?”

, Do this if you are uncomfortable not wearing a bra, but your mom still says no. Suggest getting a training bra, sports bra or a camisole with a built-in bra to wear in the meantime. After wearing these for a few months, bring up the topic again.For example, “I have been wearing my training bra for six months. I think I am ready to wear a bra now.

, Do this if your mom simply will not listen or does not understand that a bra will help you feel more comfortable about your body. Talk about the issue with a trusted relative, counselor or teacher. They may be able to offer you some advice on how to approach the topic with your mom.You could also ask them to discuss the topic with your mom for you.

Set a time limit.,
Exchange for good grades.,
Exchange for chores.,
Set restrictions.,
Rent it until they approve.,
Play in a central location.,
Allow parental controls.",How to Ask Your Parents for a Mature Video Game2," Discuss and agree on an amount of time per day or week that you won’t go over when playing the game, or any video game, if your parents are concerned about how the content affects you based on how much you play. Let them know that if you get the game, you’ll stick to this time limit. Show them that you can play games in moderation.

, Promise all A’s or B’s on your next report card, or a similar goal for your grades, if they will get you the game.

, Agree on certain chores you will do every week or month in exchange for being able to get the game. You can say, “I’ll take out the trash and load the dishwasher every day, and vacuum every week, if I can have the game,” or something similar that you and your parents can agree on.

, Tell them you will not play on school nights, you will not play until you finish ALL your homework, and you will keep your grades up.

, Rent the game from a library, video store, Redbox, or invite a friend over who has the game. Tell your parents they can watch you play the game for a certain amount of time. If they are okay with what they see, they let you buy it; if they’re not okay with it, you will agree on a time when you can rent it and ask them again.


You can also show them screenshots of the game online; they might be convinced by them alone.

, Discuss and agree with your parents on a location of the house that you will always play the game if they let you get it. Letting them keep an eye on you in exchange for getting the game can be worth it, because they will likely stop paying attention after a time and let you play in peace.

, Let your parents know they can use whatever parental controls are available on the device you play on, as long as you can have the game. They may be able to restrict access to the internet, the ability to make purchases, or even control how long you play and what friends you play with.Consider that it could be worth it to sacrifice a small amount of your freedom in order to get the game you want. You might also impress your parents by being upfront about these controls rather than them having to do it behind your back.

Appreciate your parents for the iPod.",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You an iPod," Have they been nagging you about cleaning your room or taking out the trash? If you want that iPod, it's time you begin doing what they ask. Your parents will be more likely to want to give you good gifts when you've been a star student and stellar help around the house.


When they ask you to do something, complete the task efficiently and effectively.
Do it when they first ask you, and don’t allow the request to become nagging or an explosive argument.
Be proactive in your actions. Think about what your parents would want you to do before they even ask.;
, Set high expectations for yourself. If you’re getting Cs and Ds, try to get As and Bs instead. Being a model student at school can help you be seen as the model child at home.


If you’re on a sports team or club, do your best to join the leadership of the team or organization.
Do your homework on time, and review your notes every day. You may also want to join a study group or create good study habits to allow you to do better on your assignments., This will show your parents that you’re responsible and deserve good gifts (like an iPod).


Clean up after yourself, and keep your room tidy.
Make sure you do the dishes, vacuum and mop the house frequently.
Offer to cook breakfast on a weekend.
Take the trash out before your parents ask you to.

, Be respectful of their time. Don't be rude and talk back to them. Treat them as you would like to be treated.


Parents can be tired and frustrated after a long day of work. Respect their space, and allow them to relax.
Always remember that when your parents have something to say, they are usually speaking for your benefit.
Be kind to your brothers and sisters as well.

, If your parents see you throwing your laptop, cellphone, or belongings all over the house, they may not be willing to buy you an expensive iPod.

Don't throw your book bag or items on the ground. Place things down gently.
Don't slam the fridge door or drop any kitchen glasses frequently. Appearing clumsy may deter your parents from wanting to buy you a breakable item.

Try asking on their day off, or some time when they seem relaxed and comfortable - like after you've helped them do the dishes after dinner.
Don't ask right after your parents come home from work. They may feel tired and a bit burnt out from all their responsibilities.
Ask when you're one on one with your parent. Don't ask when you're around friends or family as it may be uncomfortable for them to answer.
Make sure you're being a responsible child before asking.

, Screaming or crying won't get you the iPod. Be reasonable in your approach. Be mature and know that a ""no"" is a possible answer.


Ask in an appreciative tone by stating something like, ""Thanks for the wonderful dinner, mom. I was wondering if you had some time to talk about me getting an iPod?""
Avoid raising your voice or getting frustrated.

, Explain that it would come in handy for the long car ride, the airport, or to kill time.

, Be reasonable. Leverage something that’s important or meaningful for them.


Prove to them that you’ll ace the next test or join the sports team if they buy you an iPod.
Offer to walk the dog or take out the trash for the month if they’ll purchase you the iPod.Don’t expect them to buy you the iPod if you don’t hold your end of the deal.

Save the money you get from birthday gifts and holidays.
Consider getting a job by asking around the neighborhood or looking online.

, Often times, used or refurbished products can be less expensive and won't break the bank. Consider asking for an iPod that still plays music but doesn't have the flash of the most current model.

You can find used or refurbished iPods online and in stores as well.

, Ask for the gift for a special occasion.


Try asking a month before your birthday or a holiday that includes gift-giving.
Ask around Black Friday, gray Thursday, cyber Monday, and super Saturday, so money won't be a problem.

, Don't expect them to buy you a $150-$300 item the first time you ask them for it. You might have to wait until your parent's next bonus or the holiday season. Understand that it will take some work on your end to convince your parents for an iPod.


Accept your parent's response, no matter what.
Be okay with the answer, whether yes or no, and find another time to ask.
Don't argue back with them. Accept whatever answer they give you in that moment, and plan for the next time you'll ask.
If they say they'll purchase it for you next month, don't nag them and ask for it now.

Write a 'User Agreement' and give it to your parents.,
Set up a chat session with your parents.,
Wait for the decision.,
Accept their decision.,
Keep up your end of the agreement.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Needed Electronic," First, before you go to your parents and attempt the puppy eyes, there's a cleaner and more convincing way to do this. Think about your parent's jobs or thoughts about this so that you can address their likely concerns and rebuttals.;
, For example:


Get good grades
Take care of the stuff you already have
Don't be rude
Complete/ask for extra chores after the regulars are completed, and so on.

, Cover all the things that would be of benefit to you with such a device and how you'd take good care of it and pay for repairs or updates, if needed.


Show important key factors like ""I could call or text you if school or dance gets out early,"" or ""I could study or school without cutting off a computer when you need it,"" depending on the wanted electronic.

, Your 'User Agreement' should include:


How long you will be on your device
What you will download
What you won't do
What you will do
Whether you would be willing to share it with your siblings, if you have any.
If you'll allow them to restrict anything.

, Sit them down and present your research work to help them understand why it's important you get it.


Tell your parents what device you want to get.
Give your parents the price and location of the exact device you want to get.

, By the end of your presentation, your parents will probably start talking and come to a decision. Give them time to talk about it, whether its two days, weeks, or minutes, have patience before they decide. Sometimes if you're in a bigger family, then everyone could vote on if you should have the device/gadget/electronics. You could tell your parents to give it to you if you have better grades for a while, or if your becoming more mature or independent when your usually not. Only so many ideas of ways you can still get the device, if they disagree.


Don't constantly talk about it to your parents. They might get annoyed.

, They are wise, and will probably do what's best for you. They might let you have the electronics for a certain amount of time each day, or maybe you get it, but share it with a sibling. Try being happy that you even get to have it, because sometimes you don't get anything, no matter how much you wanted/needed it. Eventually you'd get the electronics when your old enough, it just depends on the occasion, on why you might not have the device.

, If you get one, keep to your 'User Agreement'.

Introduce the idea of the 3DS.,
Explain how buying the 3DS would make you happy.,
Explain the social reasons for wanting the 3DS.",How to Ask Your Parents for a Nintendo 3DS1," If you are worried that your parents won’t take your request for the 3DS seriously, convince them by sitting them down and showing them that you are serious about your desire for the game. Prearranging a time to talk will show your parents that you really want the gaming system and aren’t just asking them on a whim.Say something like, “Mom, Dad, there’s something I want to ask you guys. Are you free anytime today so we can talk about it?”;
, After you and your parents have sat down, tell them that you want the 3DS. Since your parents may not know what this is, tell them about the gaming system. List what you would use it for and even show them a picture of one online.Say something like, “I wanted to talk to you because I was wondering if I could get a Nintendo 3DS. A 3DS is basically a small, portable gaming console. I would play games like Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda on it.”
If your parents aren’t up to date with current technology, it’s a good idea to give them some idea of what the device is and how you will use it. This makes it seem more familiar, and may make them more willing to get it for you.

, Above all, your parents want you to be happy and healthy. If you can convince them that the console will add to your happiness, you’re on the way to convincing them to get it for you. Emphasize how this game is not just a fad or a whim, but something that you’ve wanted for a while and will get a lot of use out of in the years to come.Say something like, “Playing the 3DS is so much fun. My friend Claire let me play hers and ever since then I’ve been wanting to get one of my own. It’s a great way to pass the time on long car rides or when you’re at the doctor’s office.”

, You may also be socially motivated to get the 3DS. Maybe all your friends have it, and you feel left out as the only one who doesn’t. Explain to your parents that not only are you missing out on fun, but not having the game is also difficult for you socially.Say something like, “It’s been hard hanging out with Bobby and Lawrence and my other friends since they all have the 3DS and I don’t. I think getting one will make things a lot easier for me socially.”
Your parents don’t want to be in the way of your social life. Try to explain to them why buying you one would positively affect your social life.

, One concern your parents may have is the price of the gaming console. If your parents seem concerned, let them know the price, which is $100-200 depending on the model. Also tell them how much the games cost that you want to play on the 3DS.If your parents didn’t know what the 3DS was, they may have expected that it was much more expensive. Putting the price on the table is an important part of asking for the game, regardless of whether the cost is something they were worried about.

, Many parents worry that games are a bad influence on children and make them desensitized to violence. Explain to your parents the most popular games on the 3DS are not violent in nature because the device is marketed toward younger people. This should make them feel better about the content that you will be exposed to by having the console., Your parents may be worried that you will use all your time to play games and will lose focus on your schoolwork. Let them know that this is not true, and promise that you will keep your focus on your school, extracurricular activities, and anything else they may feel is essential to your education and wellbeing,

, If you have brothers or sisters, your parents may worry that they will be jealous of your new 3DS. If this is a concern, let your parents know that you are willing to share the console with your siblings, as long as they don’t delete your game.

, Your parents will want to have some control over your gaming habits. They want to know that if they need you to do something like set the table or do your chores, you will listen to them and get off the game.Tell your parents that you understand the fact that they want some say in your gaming, and assure them that you will respect their authority if they ever need you to stop playing for any reason.
Talking about your parents’ role in your game playing habits sets the stage for compromising with your parents, which you will need to do if they aren’t completely convinced that you should get the console.

Do more things around the house.,
Agree to parental controls.,
Agree to play on a schedule.,
Wait to get the game.,
Don’t sulk if they say no.",How to Ask Your Parents for a Nintendo 3DS3," If money is the primary concern, offer to pay for part of the 3DS. You can do this by saving up your allowance, holding an event like a garage sale or bake sale, or by saving up money from work if you’re old enough to get a job. Pitching in for the 3DS will take some of the financial burden off your parents and also show that you are serious about getting the game.


You can also offer to buy a used console and games to save money., If your parents agree to buy you the 3DS, they may want good behavior in return. Keep up your grades, help them around the house, and try not to complain too much about doing your chores. This compromise will make everyone happy.If you want to take it a step further, you can even write down all the chores you are willing to do in exchange for the 3DS. You can ask your parents if there is anything that they would like to add.

, Your parents may want more control of the content that you will be able to access through your Nintendo 3DS. If this is something that is pivotal in your parents’ decision, tell them about the parental controls that they can set up for you.These controls monitor what games you can play based on ratings and also can control your Internet usage.
You can also just agree to play whichever games your parents think are suitable for someone of your age.

, If your parents are primarily concerned about the amount of time you will spend playing the 3DS, suggest that you could play on a schedule. This would give your parents some control over how you use your device and how you spend your time in general.For instance, you could agree to only play the 3DS on weekends, or only after you have done all of your homework for the day.

, If your parents don’t often make extravagant purchases, suggest that they could give you the 3DS as a birthday or Christmas present. This makes money less of an issue and gives them some time to warm up to the idea of the console.


Since special occasions like Christmas, Hannukah or your birthday are some of the only times that you receive gifts, they may be more willing to give you something that you really want, even if they have their reservations about it.

, If your parents still refuse to get you the game no matter what compromises you suggest, don’t fight with them or sulk. Try to bear your disappointment with dignity. You never know, your parents may just need some time to warm up to the idea of getting the 3DS. If you act rude or angry, they are likely to not change their minds about getting you the console."

Reflect on what you're asking for.,
Plan the talk.,
Make the pitch to your parents.,
Be mature throughout the discussion.,
Mind your body language.,
Discuss the positive outcomes of your request.,
Stand your ground.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You Something1," You should know what your parents usually say yes or no to. Compare your request to things your parents have gotten you in the past. Does your current request seem larger than what you usually ask for? Take a look at your financial means and decide how long it would take you to pay for it yourself. Also consider if your request is something you want or something you really need.


Decide if what you want is worth fighting for. A lot of material belongings in childhood and teenage years are passing trends.
Do you want what you want to be able to show it off to other people at school? Do you want this because you think it will be fun and help you personally and mentally?
Answering these questions can help you while you talk to your parents.;
, Pick a time when you know your parents are in a good mood, such as a pay-day or when they feel proud of something they've done. If you choose a bad time, you may frustrate them even more and it will be less likely to get what you want. You could also consider talking to one parent over the other. It helps to have small talks everyday with your parents to keep conversation open.

, Start with a little small talk about how they are doing. Try to bring up the item in an organic manner. For example: if you are trying to get a new dress, begin talking about how old all of your current dresses are. Then you could transition into talking about getting a new dress that fits you better.


If you want something like a videogame, you could start by explaining the game’s premise and how exciting it is.If applicable, explain to your parents how getting the item will benefit them as well as it benefits you.

, Always show your parents that you're a mature kid with good behavior. Don't yell, demand, or argue with them if they seem doubtful at first. Explain calmly what you want and the steps you're willing to take to earn it.The more polite and reasonable you are, the more likely your parents will listen to you.


One way to ensure that you stay well mannered is by taking deep breaths before discussing the matter.
You should also try to go into the discussion knowing that your parents will probably say “no.” This way you won’t lose your cool if they say “no.”

, Don't fold your arms, or slouch. Stand up straight or sit up straight in a chair, and try to smile when appropriate. Even if your parents only pick it up subconsciously, this stance is reassuring and improves your chances of persuading your parents.

, Explain how this is something that may have a positive side or may even help you learn more. Don’t lie to your parents and say that the new Call of Duty contains history lessons.


If you’re asking for the an iPhone, explain how you can facetime with your parents or download educational apps. Explain how your parents will be able to reach you easier., Be firm in a positive way but don't overdo it by being obnoxious. Don't yell, cry, slam doors, sulk, stomp, or complain about their decision.Negotiation will always get you farther than a nasty rebuttal. Tell them you are willing to work for it, and make sure you are sincere. Parents can usually tell when you don't plan to work, so if you aren't prepared to do your part, don't make any promises.


Keep a cheerful demeanor when you're talking to them. You shouldn’t act as though your desire is imperative to your health. You parents aren’t stupid and deserve some respect. Show them a lighthearted attitude.

Make a deal.,
Consider paying for part of it yourself.,
Present the request as a gift.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You Something2," Consider what your parents like or would like to be done around the house. Maybe your dad dreads cleaning the house on the weekends, or your mom cleans out the cat’s litter box every other day. Offer to do something they do often around the house for a month or two. If you do a satisfactory job after the first month, your parents have to get you what you want.


Many parents want their kids to succeed in school. If there is a subject you are bad at, offer to improve your grades. Getting an after school tutor will show your parents your dedication.

, Most likely, your parents will appreciate that you offered to pay for a portion of it. This will also show your parents how dedicated you are to getting this item.


If your parents ask you to pay for half of it, do not back out of your offer. Stick to your word and pay the share you promised.

, Ask for what you want as a gift such as an early birthday or holiday gift. Parents are more likely to help you get what you want for one of these reasons. Choose whatever event is closest.


Consider what your parents usually get you for holidays, and do not ask too much for the circumstance. Your parents might find it insulting if you ask for an Xbox for Valentine’s Day.

Be on your best behavior to show you deserve it.,
Stay focused on your goal.,
Be creative with your request.,
Act mature throughout the process.,
Do something nice for your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You Something3," Consistently do your homework, do all your chores, and take your studies seriously to get the best grades you can. Do anything your parents ask of you without complaining, and have a good attitude. It may sound like a lot of work, but keep in mind what you're trying to get in return.

, Keep a mental picture of what you want in your head. Don't lose sight of the prize: it’s the thing that keeps you going.If you do something impressive, like receive good grades on your report card, then take the opportunity to ask.


Don’t ask for less important things. If you are set on getting the new Pokemon game, don’t ask for other games until you get what you want.

, For example, if you want a car, draw the car you want on a poster, or find a poster of the car and hang it up on a wall in a commonly visited area. Whenever you pass by it, draw attention to it by commenting on it. If your parents have a sense of humor, this can be very effective. You could even make the effort to put together an entertaining PowerPoint presentation that they might enjoy, or a short comic strip.


Consider if your parents are the creative types that would enjoy this type of pitch.
Even if your parents deny your request, you will have set up a lighthearted environment.

, Never beg for what you want. If you constantly ask, argue, or fight for whatever it is you want, your parents will be less than eager to help you get it. Whenever talking about the item you want, keep an ear open for what your parents have to say. Take their doubts about the item seriously.A good way to appeal to your parents is by using their language. If your dad tends to explain things with his hands, try explaining your reasoning with your hands.

, Get something for them that they have always wanted. For example, if your mom wants a special perfume, get it for her. Tell them you paid for it all by yourself. Parents love it when kids work hard for something. They will notice that you have your own money and that you can handle responsibility. When they're in a great mood, mention to them what you would like to have.


Don't bring up what you want at the same time that you give them your gift or you could come across as manipulative.
You don’t have to buy them anything. Do something around the house without them asking you. For example: mow the lawn or do the laundry without anyone asking you.

What if I do the dishes for a week?
What if I promise to play with it only in my room so I don’t get in your way?

, She may try to put off buying the toy in hopes that you will give up. Find a reason why it is best to buy the toy right away. Make it seem like the perfect opportunity.Find a coupon or a store that has the toy on sale for a limited time.
If there are only a few toys left at the store, make sure you don’t miss out on getting one before they are gone.

Thank your mom for the toys she has already bought for you.,
Practice sharing your toys with your siblings and friends.,
Do things you know will make your mother happy.",How to Get Your Mom to Buy You the Toy You Want3," If she feels like you really appreciate her buying you toys, she will be more likely to get you another one. Make sure you mean it when you tell her “thank you” so she believes you.Do this on a regular basis for several days instead of thanking her for everything all at once.

, Be responsible and kind with the toys you already have. Show your mom that you will be nice and allow others to use your toy so it benefits everyone if she buys it for you.She wants to know that you will keep playing with the toy once she buys it, so it doesn't seem like a waste of money.

Evaluate your financial situation honestly.,
Determine the cost.,
Draw up a plan.,
Offer to pay your part.,
Explain the benefits.,
Use persuasive language.,
Use your parents' values to your advantage.,
Research a variety of cars.",How to Talk Your Parents Into Buying You a Car1," Do not let your desire or wishful thinking cloud your knowledge of fact and fiction.If your family cannot afford the cost of a new car, asking to have it bought for you might be a waste of your time.


Look for signs indicating money is tight. Have your parents been talking about expenses more frequently? Do you rarely go out to eat? Have your favorite brands been replaced with knock-offs? These can all be signs that your parents don't have money to spare for a car.;
, Not only will your car cost money to purchase, it will also cost money for you to upkeep. Go online and search for car insurance quotes. You can also make inquiries at a local dealership about the frequency and average cost of oil changes. Pay attention to local gas stations, track the average cost of gas, and then estimate that cost by multiplying the average cost per gallon by the amount of gallons you expect to use in a week. This will impress your parents with your preparation and research.


Divide your total expenses by week, month, and year. This will assist you in making an effective plan.

, Now that you've figured out your financial situation and have done enough research to know how much your car will cost, you can start planning.How can you contribute to car payments, insurance, and upkeep? Some ideas that might persuade your parents:


Working a part time job.
Doing chores in exchange for an allowance.
Making a car maintenance schedule.

, This gesture might be required even if your family is financially well-off. Making regular payments and affording the weekly cost of gas are responsibilities that will ultimately fall on you in the future.


Your parents want you to be prepared to handle these tasks on your own. You can show that you're ready to take responsibility by working for your car., Driving children between points A and B can be time consuming, but having your own car would help with that! You will no longer need your parents to drive you to extracurricular activities like band practice or film club. You can also volunteer to run errands like:


Picking up groceries.
Retrieving dry cleaning.
Taking a sibling to and from after school activities.

, There are many techniques that you could use, and a quick Internet search will put a more extensive list at your fingertips, but studies have shown that acknowledging your parents freedom of choice in the matter could drastically improve your chances.Comparisons, like metaphors and analogies, will also give you an edge.

""You and dad have the final say. I know that I'm going to need your help, and if you don't think now's the right time, I'll keep working on my end until it's possible.""
""Remember how you told me about how you used to drive to your first job in that broken down car? I keep thinking of that, and how I could start my own job if I had a car of my own.""
""We live in a rural area, and not having a car is like living on an island without a boat! I want to get out there and experience the world, and I think the only reasonable option is a car.""

, People are more likely to consider something valid if there is already the belief that it is important.

Educational and professional opportunities you can achieve with a car will be appealing topics to your parents for this reason. An example might look like:

""Mom, dad, I know how important my education is to you. But I know it's hard for you both to work and take me to my study group on Tuesday and Thursday. A car is a big expense, but I'm willing to work for it, and I think it'll help with college next year, too.""

, There's nothing wrong with aiming for your favorite make and model, but be aware that you might need to moderate your tastes for your first car.Cars that are too fast or have poor safety features might strike your parents as reckless choices for your first vehicle.


Choose a range of vehicles spanning from trendy to sensible, from expensive to affordable, and ask your parents what they think.

, There are plenty of small chores you can do yourself to prove to your parents that you are ready for a car. Choose tasks that make their lives easier, or chores that are obvious at a glance, like washing dishes or laundry., Take extra care to accomplish the tasks you have promised in a reasonable time. Ignoring these can indicate a lack of respect for the agreement you've made with your parents, which might translate into your parents thinking you will not respect a car.

, When you want something so much, it can be difficult for you to exercise restraint. Annoying your parents with request after request can upset your parents and potentially prevent you from getting the help you need to purchase your car., Parents worry that, in the event of an emergency, like a flat tire, you will not be ready. Begin making small car related purchases. Let your parents know that you are accumulating the things you'll need as a car owner. Items to consider:


Emergency jack
Tire-iron
Tire pressure gauge

Be calm and do not make demands.,
Go above and beyond the ordinary.,
Pick your field of battle.,
Create a need.,
Make a new car the responsible choice.",How to Talk Your Parents Into Buying You a Car3," Oftentimes, parents have specific arguments that they believe are proof of your lack of responsibility. It might be your messy room, or it might be fighting with a sibling. In any case, figure out what pushes your parents' buttons and address those issues.


Ask: ""What can I do to show you I'm ready for a car? What can I do to make this happen?""

, A car is a major expense that your parents will likely have to decide on together. By asking both your parents, you show that you are aware that this is a major request and that you want to proceed honestly and openly. This can be a major asset, as it will promote honesty and openness in your parents as well.

""Mom, dad, I've been thinking a lot about a car lately. I know that it's a big expense, but it's looking more and more like I'm going to need one sooner than later. What do you think? How should I start preparing? Do you think you'll be able to help me with the cost?""

, You might notice that your parents are happiest in the morning, or maybe they are most agreeable on the weekend after work. Take note of the time of day your parents seem in the best mood, and use this time to ask respectfully about your car.

, Eating together helps promote social bonding which will make your parents more agreeable.You can further improve your chances by setting and clearing the table, as small acts of kindness can have powerful positive impact.

, Try to answer with specific solutions.

Specific solutions will make your responses easier for your parents to imagine, which can contribute to them saying, ""Yes."" Some questions to consider:

Parent: I'm worried about how you'll pay for insurance. We can help with the car, but we can't afford both that and the insurance.
Child: I've already put in applications at restaurants nearby. I was thinking I could work there part time before I get my car to save money for insurance, and then when I get my car I can drive to work to pay my bills.
Parent: We're concerned about you driving in snow.
Child: I found an affordable option for winter tires that have a high safety rating. If I saved up for those tires before winter and promise to only drive when I feel safe, would that make you feel better?

, Try to engage your parents as an adult. You can do this by being reasonable, by not manipulating the conversation, and by not reacting aggressively. By doing this, your parents are more likely to treat you as an adult, which will give your words more weight.

If you feel attacked or desperate, slow your breathing to calm yourself.It has been proven that re-framing your perspective can sustain your calmness when negotiating.Re-frame negative emotions with a positive approach. You can think of fear as a kind of anticipation, or frustration as desire.

, By doing more than is necessary, your parents will see that you are willing to do extra work for the sake of your car. Seeing your willingness to go the extra mile might make them more willing to help pay for your car.

, There's a time and a place for everything. Take stock of your surroundings before asking the big question. Do your parents look angry, busy, or overwhelmed? Are many people trying to get your parents' attention? Better save your question for another time.

, Join events, clubs, and extracurricular activities that require transport. The extra work of having to drive you around might make your parents more favorable to the prospect of getting you a car.

, One of the greatest worries parents have is safety.By making a new car your safest option, you will also make it more reasonable in the minds of your parents.


Mention you're considering buying a motorcycle and its unsafe reputation might win your parents over to the idea of buying a car.
Argue that you don't feel safe walking home late at night, if applicable.

Ask your parents why they won’t buy fast food.,

Note their reasons.,
Remember their points.,
Focus on your health.,
Research value menus.,
Think about how much you value time with friends.,
Talk to your parents again.,
Refute their reasons.,
Tell them how often you’d like to eat fast food.,
Ask them to get fast food as a treat.,
Tell them you’ll pay for it yourself.,
Make an exercise plan, and show your parents.,
Enjoy your fast food treat.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Buy Fast Food," Communication is the key to any good relationship, especially with your parents. Ask directly: “Why won't you buy me fast food?” and you’re likely to get a direct response.;
, Chances are high that your parents won't deal with disrespect or confrontational behavior. Calling names, yelling or being visibly frustrated will only make the conversation harder. No matter how frustrated you feel, keep it civil., For each one of the reasons that your parents give you as to why they won’t buy fast food, make a mental note. You’ll be able to refute these points with a little bit of research. Keep their reasons in mind and mentally file them away for later.

, There are many reasons why your parents might be unwilling to by fast food: it might be too expensive, or they might be worried about your health. You might want to go get fast food with your friends, but your parents may disapprove. You’ll need to do a little research on what to say to get your parents to change their minds. Refuting their points directly will be the best way to change their outlook., If your parents are concerned with your health and use this as their reason, there's plenty of research you can use to change their mind. Learning about nutrition and reading menus can help. You can also opt for healthier fast food places that offer better choices.


Look at menus. Most fast food places have begun to roll out healthier menus, and you may be able to convince your parents to buy you some of the healthier options, like the lower calorie Fresca menu at Taco bell or some healthier sides at McDonalds.Learn about nutrition. The more you know about nutrition and the needs of your body, the you'll understand about how fast food can affect your diet. Know that as long as you aren’t eating more calories than you need every day, you won’t gain weight, even if you only eat fast food., If you want to eat fast food, but money is the main reason your parents don’t want to buy it, research prices at your favorite chains. Many offer dollar menus or other value menus that can be reasonably priced.


Keep an eye on deals. Often, fast food chains will offer deals that drop the prices of meals substantially. Restaurants often advertise on the radio or TV, so watch for two-for-one deals, coupons, or limited-time-offers that might make a meal more affordable., If going out to restaurants helps you fit in with your friends, think about how to explain this to your parents. Spending time with your friends is important, and helps you bond, even if it's just over cheeseburgers. Think about ways to explain how hanging out is important to you and your friend group, and how it helps you stay in touch with kids your age.

, Bring your research with you, or memorize what you’re going to say. Remember the specific points that they brought up earlier, and prepare your well thought out responses.

, Whether it's price, nutrition, or some other reason keeping your parents from buying fast food, present your corresponding evidence. No matter their reason, bring a solid argument that presents a positive viewpoint.

, Moderation will be key in saving money and staying healthy while eating fast food. Tell your parents how often you’d like to go out: once a month, once a week, or more. Be specific. The more specific you are about your expectations, the more you can talk to them about budget per week.

, If your parents are having a hard time changing their mind, ask them if fast food can be your reward for an achievement. They'll have a harder time saying no if they know you're willing to work hard for your treat.

, If money is your parents' concern, offer to pay for the meals. If you have an allowance or an after school job, this won’t be too much of a problem. Offering to buy the fast food may help persuade your parents, as they won't have to worry about the expense. If you don’t have enough money to pay for the whole meal, offer to match funds instead, paying half., Make an exercise plan that will offset the caloric intake of fast food. Schedule jogging or cycling sessions, or consider joining a sport at school. Show your parents the plan, and let them know how your physical activity will offset any of the bad foods that you might eat. , If you follow through and state your case reasonably, you’re bound to persuade your parents to buy you some fast food. Enjoy and know how much hard work you put into changing their minds. Make sure to thank them for getting you your fast food!

Wait for the right moment.,

Look up retail prices.,
Offer to do more chores as a trade.,
Pay for half of what you want.,

Be happy with what you have.",How to Get What You Want from Your Parents," Take note of your parents’ moods. They may be angry with you for misbehavior, frustrated with problems at work, or sad about the troubles of a friend or their partner. If they are upset in any way, now is not the time to ask for a gift or trip anywhere. Wait until they seem happy and relaxed to ask them for anything; this will increase the likelihood you get it.


Even if they are happy, if you recently got in trouble, it would be smart to wait at least a few days, or until any tension or awkwardness has faded between you.
Don’t ask when your parents are extremely busy. Imagine someone asking you to go to the store and pick them up some almond milk, while you’re in the middle of doing a huge school project. Their request would seem selfish and frustrating.;
, Smile. Make eye contact. Don't fold your arms. This kind of body language helps create a more friendly environment that will increase the likelihood you get what you want.


Smiling let’s your parents know that even though you want something, you are still relaxed. This will make you seem more approachable and help your parents relax themselves.
Stand or sit with your legs wide. Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Avoid crossing your arms. All of this shows confidence, comfort, and openness.
Nod when your parents are talking. Keep your head up and make regular, confident eye contact, but don’t stare. This will let your parents know that you are listening and confident.

, Imagine someone coming up to you and saying, “Gimme the gift I asked for already!” Most likely you will feel unappreciated and maybe insulted. You want to show your parents that the gifts you receive are valued and you appreciate the work they do to earn money and get you what you want.


Try opening your request like this, “Mom, you work really hard to support us and treat us to the things we like. I’m really grateful for that, thank you.”
This isn’t a trick to fool them. Don’t fake or force gratitude. Be sincere and it will go a long way in your conversation.

, Making general comments in front of your parent(s) like, “Man, the Samsung Galaxy s6 looks really awesome! It’s got all these advanced features…” won’t guarantee anything. It’s possible your parents won’t get the hint. Or they’ll get it and not say anything. Either way, you don’t get what you want. Be direct with what you want.An example of direct communicating is like this, “Dad, I want to go on a trip to Florida so I can learn to surf by the beach.” Having a more proactive purpose is also helpful. Consider this example, “Mom, I really want to get a laptop so I can spend more time writing and learning to build websites so I can prepare for college.”

, Don’t approach your parents expecting an immediate yes or no. Instead say something like this, “Mom, I’m going to ask you something but I don’t want an answer really quickly. Please think about it for awhile first.” This will give your parents time to consider whether they are willing to buy this gift or take you where you want to go.


Using this strategy shows patience, because you are willing to wait a day or more to get a reply. This could impress your parents and lead to a better outcome for you.

, If they say no, ask them why. But don’t ask them in a pleading or whining way. Be calm, ask them if there’s a reason and then see what you can do about it. This way you are not just being annoying, but mature instead. It is reasonable to have a conversation about why we do anything, so long as you ask, speak, and listen with respect.


Once you understand why they said no – for example, “you don’t help around the house,” or “your grades are too low” – ask them how you could do better. Follow through and try to improve your behavior.
Being calm and reasonable might actually impress your parents and help you get what you want in the long run.

, Think about what you want and why. Is it an object or an experience? Once you know what it is, ask yourself the following questions. They will prepare you for the conversation ahead: Why do you want this? Why should your parents get it for you? If you can't think of a good answer, then don't ask your parents yet. If you don't know why you want something, they’re less likely to give it to you.


To know what is a ""good"" reason to your parents, look at what they value. Depending on differences in culture and family this could be many things. Helping with family business and caring for siblings may impress some parents, whereas efforts in school and extracurricular activities may convince other parents more effectively. Figure out when they have praised and appreciated your actions; these are ""good"" reasons to get you what you want. It's also possible that some parents will be more impressed by logical arguments.
Prepare a few good reasons why you want or need this item/trip/experience. It will show your parents you aren’t just acting on impulse or cravings, and have given thought before coming to them. Some ""good"" examples may be that it will help you progress in school, prepare you for adulthood, or help you grow as a person. Other ""good"" answers may be that it will feed your imagination, bring you relief from the challenges in your life, or benefit the entire family and/or community.
Reasons that focus on self-centered, or irrational wants will be less convincing. For example don’t say, “because my friend has one.” Parents will often take this to mean you are just following fads, want to be like others, and won’t really value the gift. Other not so ""good"" reasons are that you ""just want it,"" that you “deserve it,” or that you “need to have it.” Also, complaining that they are mean parents if they don't get it for you is also unlikely to work.

, Check eBay, Amazon, and other used goods vendors for lower prices. If it is an experience, look for cheap travel options, as well as inexpensive places to stay. When you go to your parents and present all this information, they will know you care not just about what you want, but also about their resources.


Work out how long it would take you to save up half of the cost, as well as the entire cost. If your parents are willing to split it, these numbers will come in handy during your conversation.
If you feel certain it's something you won't get, try to accept that possibility. If you succeed, you'll feel much more appreciative. If you end up being right, it will help you let go of any hard feelings towards your parents.

, If your parents say no, it may be because they don’t think you have earned what you desire. Meet this head on and offer to work for what you want. They will likely respect you showing dedication and effort. Even if they don’t agree to the deal, follow through with your suggestion anyway. It’s possible over time it will impress them and you’ll get what you want in the long run. It’s all about showing them you are growing into a responsible person.Examples of work you could offer to do are doing laundry, cleaning kitchens and bathrooms, sweeping/vacuuming floors, taking care of pets, mowing the lawn, pressure washing outdoor surfaces, and organizing cluttered spaces.

, It’s possible your parents just don’t have enough free money to buy what you want. Or maybe they have the money, but just don’t feel comfortable buying you something (or paying for a trip) because it is so expensive. Offering to help pay will show them you’re invested and willing to work for what you want.


Get a part time job to earn money. If you are too young to work legally, ask your parents if you can earn money doing small jobs for them.
Save any money you earn until you have enough to pay for half of what you want (or to pay for gas on a trip somewhere). Come to your parents once you have all you need. Showing them you can plan, work, and save on your own may convince them.

, Alongside doing chores, this may be one of the best options for improving your parents’ attitude towards getting you a gift or taking you somewhere you want. Is there a specific topic you have trouble with in school? Tell your parents you’re going to try harder to understand that subject. Follow through by studying and improving your grades. Show your parents the results.


Ultimately, your parents want you to succeed in life, grow smarter, and set yourself up to thrive as an adult. Raising your grades is solid proof you’re making an effort to do just that.
See if you can make a deal with them that for each class you raise one grade level, you will get a certain gift. Or if it is an expensive gift/trip, for each class you raise a grade, they will pay for another portion of the cost.

, Parents are often frustrated because they feel their children don’t listen to them. They wonder why they have to ask many times for children to act.Instead, be obedient as long as their requests are reasonable. Take a shower when they ask, clean up your room when they say. Follow their lead and they will feel respected. As you meet their wants and needs, over time this will make them more likely to fulfill yours.


As you figure out all of the things your parents want you to do on a regular basis, start doing them before they ask. Set the table once dinner is almost ready, vacuum the house, or mow the lawn. Acting without having to be told is even more impressive and appreciated.
This is a “long game” approach. If you follow this step consistently, your parents may begin to appreciate and respect your efforts more. This will benefit you any time you want something from them.

, This is similar to doing chores but the key difference here is that you don’t want to act like they are awful duties you just do because you have to. Instead, offer willingly to take charge of small tasks around the house that normally your parents would do. This is another long-term strategy to show your parents that you want to give back to your family and help it grow and sustain itself.It also shows you do not resent your responsibilities.


Acting this way is considered more grown-up and will earn your parents’ respect. Ultimately it will contribute to getting what you want with less resistance.
Any housework your parents normally do that they wouldn't ask you to do is a possible choice. Make sure you feel capable and know how to safely perform any chores before asking to take them on.
Typical chores like cleaning, caring for pets, and mowing lawns are also good choices. The key here is an attitude of willingly contributing to the family’s greater good.

, Just like you, your parents have many needs. The more they are met, the more likely they will be open to giving you what you want. Take time to understand what they need and give it to them in any way you can.


Parents need to know that their children are safe, and not in danger when they can’t be there with them.Act responsibly when you’re in front of them. Chose responsible, trustworthy friends so they do not worry as much.
Parents want to feel respected, and heard. Don’t insult them or call them names. When they are upset with you, listen to what they are saying and try to understand.
Parents need their children to know who they are. It takes most kids until they are grown to see their parents as people. Take time to ask about their lives. Not only will it make them more likely to give you what you want, but it will help build an open, communicative relationship.

, Another way to say this is, “make them look good.”There is no one way to raise kids, and parents sometimes feel insecure or judged about how well they are doing. Help them feel like they’re doing a good job by behaving in public. Be friendly and polite around their friends or the parents of your friends.


Engage in conversation with their friends, answer all the questions they ask you, and try to be as interested as possible.
Show respect and politeness to your elders (not just the elderly, but all people who are older than you).

, Even if you feel it’s unfair and you deserve what you’re asking for, resist the temptation to protest. It’s okay to ask questions in a calm, mature manner, but grumbling and whining will confirm to your parents that they shouldn’t get you what you want. It looks like you feel entitled to what you want, and this kind of attitude can upset your parents.


This step applies to all your interactions with your parents. If you complain, yell, or flip out, you’ll get the same in return. It’s more likely your parents will get defensive and see you as misbehaving., Take stock of all the things your parents have already provided for you. Spend time enjoying all the gifts and experiences you’ve already had, instead of enjoying them for a moment and then tossing them aside. Appreciating what you already have will make you happier in the long run and also show your parents that their gifts are not wasted on an ungrateful child.

Accept a ""No"" for now, if necessary.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Buy a Nice Diary," If you want any expensive item, including a diary, you want you show your parents you're mature. Your parents are more likely to trust you with nice things if you've proven your'e responsible. For a few weeks before asking your parents, work on showcasing your maturity.Keep up with things like schoolwork and household chores. Work on completing your homework after school. Do not argue when your parents ask you to do something around the house.
Do a little extra here and there. For example, do the dishes for your dad after dinner without being asked.;
, Before going into the conversation, think about the potential reasons you may get ""no"" as an answer. Think about how you could combat those reasons. Try to find a way to truly make your parents see the dairy is important to you.Your parents may worry about money. They may not want you to spend a lot of money on something they worry you won't take care of or use. Try to think of what you could say to this. For example, ""I know it's a lot of money, but I earned it with my paper route and I promise I'll take good care of the diary.""
Your parents may have other concerns. They may, for example, worry about you writing negative things in the diary, or using it to keep secrets from them. You could say something like, ""I want to be able to vent somewhere on occasion, but I promise I'll share anything important in my life with you guys.""

, Before the talk, try to figure out how you can express what you need and feel. You want your parents to understand why you want the diary. Make sure you think of a few good reasons the diary would fulfill certain needs. Really figure out why you feel you need this diary.There could be a lot of reasons the diary feels important to you. You could feel slightly overwhelmed emotionally, and want space to vent. You could feel a little crowded in your home, and want a space for your own privacy.
Instead of talking about the diary in and of itself, emphasize your feelings. Identify how you feel and think of a way to express this to a parent. For example, ""Dad, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but our house is crowded. Sometimes, I feel like I have no space for myself. I think a diary would give me a creative outlet to work through my feelings.""

, You want to pick a time to talk that's relatively stress free. Pay attention to your schedule, as well as your parents' schedules. Choose a time when everyone is usually relaxed and not busy.For example, maybe the weekdays are stressful. Both your parents work full time, and you participate in a lot of extracurriculars that take up weeknights.
Instead of talking on a Tuesday in this scenario, you could talk on a Saturday afternoon. Maybe your parents are usually relaxed on Saturdays. You could bring up the diary shortly after breakfast then.

, There is no sense beating around the bush when asking your parents for something. You want to make sure your parents fully understand where you're coming from. Even if you feel nervous, be direct when beginning the conversation.Make it clear you want to discuss something going into the conversation. For example, say something like, ""Mom, Dad, I wanted to ask you something.""
From there, state what you want outright. For example, ""I saw a really nice diary that I wanted to buy. It's a little expensive, but I've saved up for awhile now, and I would really appreciate it if you would let me make this purchase.""

, If you come off as entitled or demanding, your parents will likely get frustrated. When asking their permission, try to do so with gratitude. Find ways to thank your parents and praise them while making the request. Let them know you still respect their authority over you, even though you're trying to make some of your own spending decisions.For example, say something like, ""I really appreciate how you guys teach me the value of money. I like that you try to guide me towards sound spending decisions. Thank you for that.""
Showing your parents some gratitude may make them more likely to want to give in to you. Even in moments where you feel frustrated, try to proceed with gratitude instead of making demands.

, Your parents may have hesitations about allowing you to purchase a diary. They may feel a cheaper diary should be sufficient, and not want you to waste your money. You should strive to actually hear their concerns. Your parents may make a good point that you could consider.Do not interrupt if your parents express hesitance. Simply stay quiet and listen to their concerns. Avoid arguing or talking over them.
If you can understand, say so. Your parents may be more likely to say ""Yes"" if they can see you're mature enough to view the situation from their point of view. For example, you could say something like, ""I understand why you think $30 is a lot for a diary. I think that's a valid concern.""

, Blowing up at your parents will not get you anywhere. Even if the conversation is not going the way you wanted, stay calm. Take deep breaths if you feel your temper rising. Getting angry will make your parents much less likely to hear you out.If you're having trouble understanding your parents perspective, it's appropriate to ask. Just make sure you ask respectfully.For example, don't say, ""Why won't you let me buy it? It's my money!"" Instead, say something like, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I'm hearing you. Could you please explain again why you don't think this is a good purchasing decision? I would really appreciate that.""

, Complaining or being argumentative will shut down the discussion. Even if your parents are frustrating you, do not argue or whine if they say ""No."" Instead, remain calm and see if you can reach a compromise.It's always appropriate to put the conversation on pause if you get frustrated. You can say something like, ""I'm sorry - I'm getting angry. Can we talk later?"" Then, do something to calm down. Go for a walk or run, and revisit the topic later.

, If your parents initially say ""No,"" see if there's something you can do to earn the dairy. You can, for example, offer to bring up your grades, do extra chores around the house, or work on spending more time with your parents.Be specific when making an offer. Do not just say, ""I'll get good grades this term."" Instead, say something like, ""I can try to bring up my math grade from a B-minus to a B-plus. Can you agree to let me get the diary if I meet that goal?""

, A compromise may be necessary. If your parents are averse to a pricey, fancy diary, see if you can meet them in the middle.Maybe you could see if they'd let you get a different diary. Instead of spending $30 on the diary you wanted, maybe you can find a nice diary for around $15.

, Even if you try your best to ask maturely, your parents may still stay ""No."" If this is the case, accept the answer. Your parents are more likely to change their minds in the future if they see you're able to maturely accept their rules. Say something like, ""Thanks for listening anyway,"" and then end the conversation.You can revisit the issue in a few months. Your parents may change their minds, especially if you show you can maturely handle them saying ""No.""

That's the sort of reasoning that toddlers use - how many times have you heard a five-year-old scream, ""but I want it!"" during a temper tantrum? Instead, be smart. Describe the thing you want as something that will help you in some way - will it help you study? Will it help you do better in sports? Tell your parents how it will help you achieve something beneficial. Frequently bring this point up in your conversations.



Let's use an example: Kim is 13 and she wants a tablet computer because she wants to be able to play games, listen to music, and share pictures with her friends. However, last week, Kim's parents scolded her for goofing off too much and neglecting her homework. When she goes to her parents to ask for the tablet, she should focus on the wide variety of free educational apps available for her desired model of tablet, not on its recreational potential.;
, Your parents may be unwilling to buy you the item you're craving simply because you may use it to do something beneficial. Sweeten the deal! Offer to do something for your parents if they'll buy you what you want. Say you'll rake the yard or take out the trash for a month, for instance. You should have a good idea of the things your parents like - for starters, most like it when you take on new chores and devote more time to your studies or a wholesome hobby (like sports, band, drama, etc.)


When haggling with your folks, start with a low offer. Instead of saying you'll walk the dog every day for two months, say you'll do it for a week. They'll probably make you go higher - this is OK. If you end up having to walk the dog for a month, you're still better off than if you'd started with your two month offer.

Example: Kim's parents don't respond well to Kim's attempts to justify a tablet purpose. Kim's next move is to offer to do all the gardening in the yard. She says she'll do it for two weeks - her folks might make her do more, but she's comfortable with anything below a month and a half.

, If you're feeling really bold, don't be afraid to give your parents an ultimatum. Tell them that if they buy you what you want, you'll hit some mark of achievement (for instance, straight A's (no B's) on your next report card.) This is risky - you're basically betting that you'll be able to deliver on a promise after you get what you want. This is a good choice for parents who are especially forgetful (or forgiving) and a bad choice for parents who are likely to find a direct challenge to be cocky or disrespectful.


If you can, incorporate the thing you want into your challenge. If you want a new pair of running shoes, for instance, tell your parents that you'll wear them when you run the half marathon next month.

Example: Kim has told her parents that she wants a smartphone because it will help her academically. She backs her claim up by saying that, using the tablet's educational apps to help her study, she'll get an A on her next math test.

, Know your desired product ( and any similar alternatives) like the back of your hand. The more your know about your product, the more serious you'll seem to your parents. Be prepared to mention specific alternatives to your desired product (especially if they're cheaper.)


Shop around online or at local stores to get a sense of the range of prices for your item. You want to be able to give your parents the lowest possible price for this product, including any rebates, store discounts, etc.

Example: When Kim approaches her parents about the tablet she wants, she'll give the lowest price she could find on the internet, which takes into account a special offer that requires you to sign up for email ads from the vendor. She'll also be ready to bring up a cheaper, competing product if her parents refuse.

, If you aren't making progress by explaining how the product helps you, you may find success by focusing on why you deserve it. Have you been especially good? Have you recently had to do something difficult? Tell your parents, for instance, that you've been through ""so much"" this year and the item is the perfect thing to help you relax.



Example: Kim just had to spend a weekend at the home of an obnoxious aunt who loves to pinch her cheeks. When she asks her parents about the tablet she wants, she's ready to describe, in painful detail, how awful it was.

, Stubborn parents might be swayed if you show them you're really serious with a well-worded letter. Use as formal of tone as possible, paying special attention to your spelling and grammar. Describe to your parents the item's many advantages, how it will help you grow as a person, and why you deserve it.

, Your parents have peers and friends, just like you! They're influenced by these peoples' words and opinions like you're influenced by your own friends. If you get a chance, tell one about this item, describing how useful it will be to you and how much you deserve it. If you're lucky s/he might tell your parents about it, possibly providing the final ""push"" to make your folks cave.



Example: Kim has a doting uncle who thinks she's just the cutest. At the next family gathering, she'll be sure to mention to him how much she wishes she had a tablet to help with her homework.

, You can't always get what you want! If your parents simply won't budge, be ready to accept a lesser offer. You may need to go halfsies (or more) on the cost with your parents. You may even have to accept a cheaper or less exciting product. Take whatever you can get - it's better than nothing!



Example: Kim's parents finally give in - they offer to buy her the tablet on the condition that she pay back half of its cost with extra chores. Kim wisely takes the offer - refusing now will make it seem like she doesn't really value the tablet's homework-helping potential.

, In the presence of one or both of your parents, mention the thing you want very casually without giving any indication that you're desperate for it. Use only one or two sentences, describing it merely as ""cool"" or ""neat.""Subtly judge your parent's reaction. does s/he seem to notice? Did his or her ears perk up? Your parent may have just gotten a good birthday gift idea!



Example: Jason has his eye on a flashy new pair of basketball shoes. At dinner, while his family's discussing a recent Lakers game, he works a tiny hint into the conversation by saying: ""Did you see that slam dunk by Kobe? Must have been those cool Jordans.""

, If Christmas, Hanukkah, or another gift-giving holiday is right around the corner, don't wear out your good will with your parents by begging for a gift just yet. Instead, take advantage of the holiday season! Before a gift-giving event, a parent will naturally look and listen for things they can give as a gift - it's sometimes in the back of their mind for months. It's usually OK to politely mention a gift idea to your parents (or to give major hints) before the holidays.


Don't ask for too many things - by focusing on one thing that you really want, you increase the chances you'll get it.

Example: Christmas is coming up and Jason still wants his new shoes. The next time he's shooting hoops with his dad, he might say something fairly obvious, like: ""Man, I'm having trouble keeping up with you. It's these worn-out old shoes, I think. If only I had those new Jordans!""

, The more your parents happen to ""stumble across"" the item that you want, the more they're likely to take your hints! Leave magazines open to advertisements for your product. If your family shares a computer, leave ads for the item ""accidentally"" open when you let someone else use it. If your family has a DVR, cue your parents' favorite shows up to ads for the product. Do whatever you can to make sure your parents don't go a day without seeing or hearing about the thing your heart's set on!


Some parents can be pretty oblivious. For best results, use lots of repetition.

Example: Jason's family shares a computer. Every time Jason's done using the computer, he's sure to leave it open to an online retailer's page for the new shoes he wants.

, If your parent is especially oblivious, it can help to make sure they actually see the product in person. Contrive a reason to go to the store - for instance, maybe you need to go to the local department store to buy pencils or paper for school. While you're there, walk by your product in the store. Pretend to be surprised by it while expressing how cool you think it is. If you're lucky, your parent might open the possibility for buying it in the future with a short acknowledgement like ""Maybe for your birthday.""



Example: It's back-to-school season and Jason needs a new backpack. He knows that the shoe store at the local mall is right next to the backpack store. As he walks by the front display with his mom, he stops and says ""Whoa! Look at those shoes. Those are really cool! They even have the awesome Velcro strap like the pros use!"" His mom replies, ""Well, basketball season is in a few months. We'll pick these up then."" Success!

, Parents are more likely to buy things for children who do what they're supposed to - children who study hard, behave politely, and do their chores without complaining. Give your parents reasons to reward you! Don't talk back to your mom, even when she's totally annoying. Offer to help your dad cook dinner. Go outside when you're asked (without complaining.) Do whatever you can to show your parents that you're ready for the responsibility of having this new item you want.

, Parents love it when their children behave like adults. Show them that you're mature with your behavior. Be polite to everyone you meet, even if they're annoying or stupid. Always look for ways to help people. Pursue new hobbies with relish. Basically, try to be as pleasant and hard-working as possible. Many adults aren't even this mature - if you are, you'll seem especially worthy.


One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to throw a tantrum if your parents won't give you what you want (if you do it in public, even worse!) Handling refusals with politeness and dignity is an important part of being an adult. Don't beg, fuss, or make a scene if you don't get your way.

, When adults want something, they usually have to buy it themselves. If you really, truly want something, a good way to show you're serious about getting it is to start saving money. Working to earn and save money at a young age is a tremendous sign of maturity. When they see you're serious, your parents may offer to help you buy the thing you want by covering part of its cost. If not, keep saving - if you put away a little money every week, resisting the urge to spend it on small pleasures (like candy and toys), you'll probably be surprised how quickly it builds up!


Make sure your parents know you're saving money for this item. You can tell them directly or give them a visual reminder - for instance, a jar in the kitchen that you slowly fill with change.

Consider your track record.,
Have a good reason.,
Show that you're doing your part.,
Come up with a reasonable sum.,
Plan how you'll pay it back.",How to Ask Your Parents For Money1," Do you lean on your parents for a lot of different favors, or are you mostly independent? You parents may be more likely to give you what you want if you have a track record of being pretty self sufficient. If you've already asked for money several times, you constantly borrow their car, and you don't help out much around the house, they may not be in the mood to give you the cash.


If you feel your track record is a little shaky, make an effort to improve it before you ask. If you live at home, you could cook them dinner, wash their car, and do other chores around the house.
If you don't live at home, find other ways to brighten their days from afar. Be responsive when they call and let them into your life. You don't want to call them out of the blue for the first time in months just to ask for money.;
, If your reason is well thought out and concrete, your parents will be more responsive. Think about exactly what you need the money for, and why. Get ready to make a case for yourself that will have your parents feeling happy to loan you the money.


For example, let's say you want the money for a new computer. Your parents will be more likely to give you money to buy it if you tell them it will help you excel at your new job or do better in school, rather than just saying you want a computer.
If you need the money for a basic necessity, like paying rent or buying food, be honest about why you're in this situation. Your situation will probably tug on your parents' heartstrings and they'll be likely to help you.

, You might get further if you come up with a way to pay for at least part of what you need. Save up as much as you can toward the total sum you need, so you can ask your parents to help you pay for the rest. They'll see that you're working hard to pay what you can and might be more likely to help you out.

, Research the price of what you need and come up with an accurate number you can share with your parents. Be sure you're able to account for the total amount of money you're asking for, so your parents won't feel you're taking advantage of them. If you're straightforward and honest, they may even throw in a little extra., If you're asking for a loan, not a gift, your parents will be more likely to loan you the money if you have an established plan for paying them back. Calculate the amount of time it will take you to save up the money so you can give them a projected due date. Whether it's a month from now or a year from now, your parents will want to know.You could offer to set up a payment plan and pay your parents back in installments. That way you won't have to pay everything at once, and it might feel easier to get the money back to them on time.
If you don't plan to pay them back, don't tell them you're going to. It's better to be honest about your intentions. If you ever find yourself in need of money again, you'll want your parents to remember that you paid them back last time.

"
"
Have a polite conversation.,
Lay out your plan.,
Make sure they can afford it.,
Accept their stipulations.,
Say thank you.",How to Ask Your Parents For Money2," Arrange a time to sit down with your parents and ask for the money. You want your parents to know that you aren't taking this situation lightly, and you'd only be asking if you really needed it. You'll come across as more serious and sincere if you set up a time beforehand, rather than having a quick phone call or just casually asking for the money in passing.

, Depending on how large a sum you're asking for, you might want to bring some paperwork to your discussion with your parents. Show them how you calculated the exact amount that you need. Indicate how much you've been able to save to pay for the item, then ask for the remaining amount.


If you're asking for money for a specific item, find it online and print out the price.
If you'd like extra money you can use as a cushion, be up front about that. Tell them that if they give you a certain amount now, you'll be able to get on your feet and won't have to ask again.
If you're going to pay them back, you might want to provide a printed installment plan or schedule they can keep. This shows that you're serious about making good on your promise.

, You probably have a fairly good picture of what your parents' finances are like. Still, it's better not to assume they can give or even loan you a large amount of money. Ask them if they feel comfortable with the amount you're asking for. They may tell you they simply can't afford it, or that they'd be able to give you a partial amount.

, Asking for money is a big favor, and your parents are entitled to making a few stipulations. They may say that they'll give you just a part of what you're asking for, or perhaps they'll say they can loan you the money if you pay it back within a short time. Your first inclination might be to get upset or angry that they didn't give you what you wanted with no strings attached. However, if you really want or need the money, you'll have to accept what comes with it.It's possible that your parents will decline to give you the money. If that's the case, see if there's anything you can do to make them feel better about giving it to you. Is there a chore or job you could do in exchange for the money? See if you can make repairs, do the grocery shopping, or help out in some other way.
If they still won't budge, don't beg. Instead, try to find another way to get the money. If you show your parents you're resourceful, they may even decide to help you out.

, If your parents decide to give you the money, it's in your best interest to tell them thanks. If you're over eighteen, your parents are no longer obligated to support you financially, so the money they hand over is a gift. If you want to go above and beyond, you could even write them a thank-you note. Your attitude will make them feel more willing to help you out in the future.

"
"
Pay them back if you said you would.,
Think about ways to avoid this situation in the future.,
See about finding another source of money next time.",How to Ask Your Parents For Money3," Once the money is in your pocket, you'll feel relief that you can pay for what you need. But don't forget to start saving money so you can pay your parents back if that was part of the bargain you struck with them. Keeping up your end will make your parents feel better about having loaned you money. In addition, you'll feel better when you are no longer beholden to them.

, While there's nothing wrong with asking your parents for money, it's not a situation you want to be in forever. Your parents need to save for retirement, and you need to feel independent and financially secure in your own right. Even if your parents say yes every time, take steps toward earning enough money to meet your own needs, so asking for money doesn't become a habit., Think about how it felt to ask your parents for money. Was it a positive or negative experience? If it was positive, you're lucky; you've got very supportive parents. However, in some cases there are drawbacks to asking parents for money. While parents might say yes when you ask, they may also cause you to feel guilty or childish for asking. Asking family members for money can be emotionally loaded. If you ever need extra money again, consider these other options:


If you're in school, see if you can take an on-campus job or get an emergency loan from the financial aid office.
If you have a job, see if you can get an advance on your paycheck to cover emergency bills.
If you're having trouble paying loans, meet with your bank to work out a sustainable payment plan based on your income.

By training in the sport, you will know how to use the backyard trampoline appropriately.You could tell your parents: “I really want to learn the sport of trampolining. There are classes where you can learn all kinds of rebounding skills. Can I enroll in trampolining classes?”
Find classes in your neighborhood. Many cities have trampolining gyms with classes on learning to jump. Since trampolining is also a gymnastic sport in the Olympics, you can also see if your local gymnastics academy has trampoline and tumbling classes.Look into trampoline and tumbling classes at your local gymnastics academy. There are four Olympic events in trampolining and tumbling, including individual and synchronized trampoline, power tumbling, and double mini trampoline.See if your local academy has classes in any of these disciplines.

, Tell them that trampolining will help you with a variety of physical skills that you can use in other sports and in life. For instance, you will develop your balance and further soft skills like persistence. Learning to balance in the air can help with other sports like ski jumping and swimming dives.

It makes me feel less worried about things and more grounded.""

, Don't pick one that is too big. Choose one that will fit in your yard and has good safety features., You should acknowledge the risks of trampolining. Injuries are common when you jump together on a trampoline or land wrong while jumping. Injuries are also common from failed flips and somersaults.You and your parents should be aware of these dangers.You could tell your parents: “I know there are dangers. There are risks in any sport. Trampolining is no exception. I realize I could hurt myself but I plan to take every precaution to jump safely. I don’t plan on doing any somersaults and I plan to use a safety net.”
Common injuries that you may experience include broken arms and legs from contact with the side rail, concussions, lacerations, and abdominal injuries from the side rail., Talk about all the different features the trampoline may have, like a big net or softer sides.


If your parent asks about how you will avoid falling and hurting yourself, you can say: “I will only jump by myself and in the middle of the trampoline. If I make a mistake and jump too far to one side, the trampoline has a big safety net that will prevent me from falling on the ground.”

, You should propose a safety plan for the home trampoline. Write down a complete list of safety precautions that you will follow when using the trampoline. Ask your parents for approval and recommendations.Tell your parents you will only jump on the trampoline when an adult is present.Tell your parents you will not allow more than one person at a time on the trampoline.Three quarters of trampoline injuries occur when multiple people are jumping at once.Tell your parents you will not do any gymnastic exercise on the trampoline.Avoid somersaults and flips. Somersaults and flips that go wrong are often the cause of cervical spine injuries.Make a rule that there will be no jumping when the trampoline is wet. , One aspect of safety is simply installing the trampoline in a location that is free of obstacles. Another part of safety is making sure the trampoline is properly installed.


Discuss the need to keep any ladders and chairs away from the trampoline. Locate the trampoline in a clear area without any hazards. The location should have a soft, absorbing ground such as grass with good topsoil. Never put a trampoline on concrete.
Create a safe fall zone at least 8 feet around the perimeter of the trampoline.Install high trampoline safety nets. These keep you from falling outside of the trampoline zone.
Locate the trampoline away from buildings and trees. You don’t want to hit a building while you are jumping.
Do not use the trampoline without the shock absorbing safety pads on its springs and hooks."

Set the boundaries of your relationship.,
Remember the advantages of being long distance.,
Prepare yourself to say goodbye.,
Tell your parents.,
Proceed with caution if you met the person online.,
Talk often.,
Do things together.,
Send gifts to each other.,
Plan your next meeting.,
Be honest about your values.,
Learn to manage your time.,
Talk about your relationship with your friends.,
Think about your goals.",How to Stay in a Long Distance Relationship When You're a Teenager," Make sure you both know what you want the relationship to be. If you are together somewhere, say in high school before going off to college, or meeting at summer camp, this is important to do before you separate. Both of you need to be clear to avoid jealousy and confusion.You need to decide if you are going to be an exclusive relationship. It doesn’t have to be, as long as you are both okay letting one another date other people.
Figure out if you think the relationship will go somewhere. If so, you’ll want to think about when you two will be able to be together. As a teenager, that can feel like a long time away, but if you don't have some idea of when the distance might end, it will be much more difficult to stay together.;
, Being long distance doesn’t have to always be terrible. The separation can give both of you an opportunity to learn about each other, and yourselves, while still having someone to talk to during difficult times.You’ll be able to communicate better. Distance forces you to actually talk regularly, to learn more about the things you share, and where you are different. You can’t avoid talking about your life, your dreams, and your concerns when talking is the only thing you have for long stretches.
This is an opportunity to spend time with your friends and family, and do things you enjoy. Your new boyfriend or girlfriend probably won’t like all the things you do. With the distance, you’ll be able to do them without feeling guilty about not spending time with him or her.
It can be helpful to write down these advantages. That can help you make your thoughts clear, and give yourself something to read when you feel down about being apart.

, Not for the end of the relationship, but for each time you separate again. Remember that every time you see one another, it will end, and you’ll have to say go back to your separate, distant places. While this is always a sad moment, it can be easier if you remind yourself that it is coming.It isn’t good for your emotional health if saying goodbye causes you to completely break down every time. You’ll need to decide if the relationship is really important enough to go through that regularly.

, One of the toughest things about being a teenager is knowing that your parents still have so much control over your life. That being said, they should know about your relationship, as they set the rules about dating that you need to follow.They might also be supportive and helpful, and even be able to help you find ways to stay in touch and even get together.


Your parents may disapprove, but that is not a reason to not tell them. Instead, try to show them how mature you are by doing it the right way. Be clear about what you want from them, such as advice or support. Make sure you are open and honest about why you want this relationship. Most important of all, if they disapprove, stay calm and try to understand why by asking questions., You and your special someone will want to see each other, but if you met online, maybe through a message board or social networking site, that person may not be what they seem. Make sure you verify who that person is before you start any kind of relationship.


There are a few things you can do easily to make sure the other person is who she says she is. Ask others on the site, or any mutual friends to make sure the other person is real. If she sends you a photo, run it through a reverse search engine like TinEye or Google images.Never give out personal information like a phone number or address until you are confident you know who the other person is. Even then, be very careful who you share that information with.Be aware of other signs of grooming, like requests for private conversations, offers of money or other gifts, and asking for information about your home or family. If you have never met the other person before, this can be the sign of more trouble, and you should alert the site’s monitors and your parents.This step is really important if you meet someone online. There are too many con artists out there that use the internet to scam or harm others. Make sure you don’t get caught up with someone you don’t really know.

, There are a number of ways you can communicate across long distances these days. Cell phones, computers, and other technology mean you don’t need to be in the same place to have a conversation. Make sure you work out a schedule to communicate regularly.


It doesn’t need to be everyday, or even necessarily at a set time. As long as you both make an effort to communicate, things will work out. Just don’t let finding a time to talk prevent either of you from doing things on your own.Make sure the technology works for both of you. Cell phone and texting conversations won’t work as well if she lives in an area that doesn’t have a strong signal. Likewise, if he has an old computer without a webcam, you probably can’t Skype.
Think about the time difference. If you live in different time zones, remember how that affects your conversations. Nobody wants to be woken up at 5:00 AM just to chat.
Think about how your connections work. Are you always calling him? Is she the only one who initiates conversation? If only one of you is doing the work of staying in touch, that’s not a good sign. Make sure you are both making an effort to keep in touch., This sounds hard given you are in different places, but it is important to building your relationship. This way, you’ll always have something in common, and have something to talk online or over the phone. When you do things together, you’ll feel closer to each other, no matter how far apart you are. Some good ideas for fun things to do together include:Watch the same TV show while talking on the phone so you can talk about it as it’s happening.
Learning a new skill together, like a new language or playing a sport. Keep one another updated on your progress, and share tips to get better.
If you are both gamers, playing together online can be a fun activity. Make sure you both understand each other’s competitive nature, as you don’t want any hurt feelings by playing the wrong way.

, These shouldn’t be big gifts, just little reminders that you remember and care. You probably don’t have a lot of money as a teenager, so don’t blow it on a big and expensive gift. Even a simple hand-written letter can go a long way.


A small reminder of the place you met is always nice, and can remind you both of the good times you had when you were together. A picture of you two with a nice note can bring up some nice memories.You’ll want to pay attention to each other’s likes and dislikes to make sure you send something the other person will enjoy. This includes knowing about any food allergies if you want to send some treats.

, Even though there are advantages to spending time in different places, you should want face-to-face time. Make sure you both put effort into finding a time to meet in person.The details of your meetings will depend on how far apart you are. If you live in the same state, it might be easy to meet every other weekend. That’s much harder if you live in different parts of the country, or the world. Make sure both of you know how often you will meet and who will do the travelling.
Saving money for a trip can become a fun game. Make sure you know how much it will cost, and track your savings. Just remember that every time you save a little money, you are that much closer to seeing your sweetie again.

, The point of a relationship is not to change yourself for another person, but to let the other person love you for who you are. This can be tough as a teenager, as you will be faced with strong pressure to change who you are, which can be easy to do when you aren’t really sure yourself. If something is important to you, let your partner know. If she really cares, she’ll support you or learn to live with it., While your relationship is certainly very special to you, don’t let it be the only thing in your life. Make time to hang out with your friends and try new things. Don’t always skip out on things because you are trying to make time for a phone call. If your relationship is really important, your boyfriend will understand.Remember that this means letting your significant other have their own life too. You can’t expect him to listen to you going out all the time, then get jealous if he does the same thing.

, Make sure your friends know that you are in a relationship. Mentioning from time to time about what your boyfriend is up to, and what you think about it, can be enough. You would talk about your relationship if you two were in the same place. Why would this be different?


This also helps you remember your significant other, and can keep him in your thoughts even when you aren’t talking to him.Your friends may also notice if things aren’t going well in your relationship, like your tone changes when you talk about him, or you just don’t mention him as often. They may notice trouble before you do, and can help you resolve it.

, As a teenager, relationships can be tough because you don’t always know what you want out of them. Your goals might even change as you go through the relationship, and decide certain things you want or don’t want from it.Make sure your significant other knows when things have changed. It is only fair that both of you are on the same page. Otherwise, it can be a nasty surprise if you spring it on him when you meet again after a long time apart.

Give yourself time to prepare.You’re about to have a hard conversation that could easily turn into a fight if you’re not careful.,
Brainstorm a list of reasons why you want what you want.,
Detail the reasons you believe you deserve it.,
Sweeten the pot with a bribe.,
Predict and answer her concerns.,
Choose the right time.Timing is everything when it comes to having a big conversation.,
Provide her with all the information she needs to know.,
Ask her for her honest reason for why she’s resisting.Sometimes, parents just give “parent” answers instead of real ones.,
Ask her to set her own conditions.By making a request, then asking her to change the rules and limits of what you asked for, you’re showing her that you respect her authority.,
Ask for a delayed response if she says ""no"" at first.,
Pick your battles.,
Stay as calm as possible.If it looks like your mom is going to say no, you might feel the telltale signs of anger and frustration: your skin starts feeling hot, your heart beats faster, your voice starts getting higher and louder.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Don’t interrupt her.,
Use attentive body language.To persuade your mother, you want to use every tool in your kit, and nonverbal communication is a very effective tool when it comes to persuading someone.,
Be honest with her.Every time you get caught lying to your mother, you make it that much harder to win her over the next time you need to persuade her of something.",How to Persuade Your Mom," To stop that from happening, you should put a lot of thought into how you’re going to argue with her without fighting. Don’t be impulsive! Think ahead of time and give yourself enough time to put together a proposal that will have good odds of winning her over.


If the thing you’re asking for has a deadline — tickets for a concert or permission to go to a party, for example — start planning well ahead of time.
You also want to have the conversation where you ask for permission ahead of the deadline, just in case the first answer is ""no."" The first answer isn't always the final answer — with some time, you may be able to change her mind. But you need enough time to do it.;
, The most obvious answer, obviously, is just “Because I do!” but that’s not enough to convince your mom. Think of the positive benefits you would receive beyond just happiness.


For example, this might be the only time in the past five years that your favorite band has come to your city. If you don’t see them this time, you may have missed your chance for several years down the line.
It may be an important bonding experience for you and your friends. It would make you feel lonely and sad if you were the only member of your circle of friends who wasn't allowed to attend a birthday party.
Can you frame thing the you want as a learning experience? For example, ""Driving to school on my own will teach me self-sufficiency. I'll have to wake up and get ready on time by myself, without you having to push me along.""

, Your mom is probably dealing with problems every day that you never even know about — work, bills, carpools, meals, cleaning, and dealing with her children’s needs. When she hears one more request, she might be tempted to just say “no” because she already has so much on her plate. To prevent that, tell her all the things you’ve been working on yourself. Why do you deserve this thing that you’re asking for? Some examples might include:


You’ve kept up good grades for a long time, or maybe you’ve worked hard to raise a low grade in a class you’d been struggling in.
You do your chores every day without complaining.
You haven’t asked for any favors in a long time.

, Parents bribe their kids all the time to get them to behave — from allowance to trips to the zoo.Why not use that same strategy with her? After telling her why you want the thing you’re asking for and why you think you deserve it, you should be able to move on to what you will offer her as a trade. Some examples might include:


Watching younger siblings for two weekend nights so your parents can have some time to themselves for date nights.
Taking on extra chores around the house. Be specific and think about what she'd be most grateful for. If you know that vacuuming hurts her back, offer to take that off her hands.
If she hates cleaning the cat’s litter box, tell her you'll do that from now on.
If the thing you’re asking for costs money, offer to pay for as much of it as you can afford.
Cleaning any or all of your home
Doing yard work
Cleaning and/or washing the car
Cooking meals
Washing dishes
Taking out the trash and/or recycling
Doing laundry
The important thing to remember is that the more specific you are, the more believable your promise is. Promising to “be good” is too vague to sound convincing, and she won’t believe you’ll follow through. However, giving her clear, detailed promises will make a world of difference.

, Put yourself in your mother’s shoes: what do you think are going to be her reasons for saying no? Even if you think her reasons are unfair, by listing them and brainstorming ways to work around them, you improve your chances of getting what you want. This will probably involve compromise on your part, so be prepared to give up a little bit of what you want. For example:


She won’t like that there will be members of the opposite gender at a party; tell her that she can come chaperone if she wants.
She’s too tired to take you to the amusement park this weekend; tell her you will take care of all her responsibilities the night before so she can relax and get a good night’s sleep. This includes laundry, cooking, cleaning — everything she might do.
She’s worried that if she lets you start driving yourself around town, you’ll lie about where you are; tell her you’ll call her from your friend’s home phone or from the business line of wherever you’re going so she can verify with caller ID that you’re where you said you’d be.

, If you start asking things of your mother when she’s busy concentrating on something else, or when she’s in a bad mood after a long day of work, you’re probably not going to have much success.


Watch her carefully, looking for a time when she is relaxing and in a good mood, but doesn’t look like she needs that time to herself desperately.
Try not to catch her during the “me-time” she needs to unwind at the end of the day, but don’t catch her in the middle of a busy day, either. Find a perfect middle ground, where she’s relaxed and in a good mood.

, You know you're asking for something she doesn't want to give you. Give her all the information she’ll need to set her mind at ease about her hesitations. For example:


If you’re asking for a smartphone, explain that she can set controls on how much of her money you can spend in the app store, or whether you can spend any money at all.
If you’re asking to go to a party, tell her where it will be held, who will be there, and which adults will be chaperoning. Give her the adults’ phone numbers so she can speak to them for herself; talking to other adults can put parents’ minds at ease.
If you’re asking for permission to date someone, tell her all about the boy/girl you like. Tell her you want her to meet them before she makes a decision about whether or not you can date.

, We’ve all heard it: “Because I said so.” The vague “no” is much harder to argue with than a specific “no” because comes from a place of authority: I am your mother and you have to obey me. You can't argue with that! However, if she gives you the actual details being her reasoning, you can argue against her logical argument more easily.


Keep a curious tone, not a defensive one. There’s a big difference between screaming “WHY?” at your mother and asking “But can you please just explain to me what problems you have with this, specifically? I just want to understand. And maybe there’s something I can do to make you feel better about it.”
Be open-minded while she speaks. Your mother has a lot of life experience and loves you very much, so she’s probably just doing what she thinks is best for you. You don’t have to agree with her opinions, but you have to respect that she has them.

, She’ll appreciate that you know she’s reasonable and just wants what’s best for you.


“What would you like me to do to earn this privilege?”
You’ve already brainstormed some bribes. If they don’t work, then this open-ended strategy, which hands control over to her, might get you closer to your goal.
Be open and eager to compromise.

, Even if your mother says “no” off the bat, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the end of the conversation. Instead of crying or losing your temper, show her how mature you are instead.


“Okay, Mom, you’re saying no right now. If that’s your final answer, I’ll respect it, but can I ask you to wait one week and come back to your decision? If I behave well enough for the next week, maybe I can convince you to change your mind.”
“I’m not asking you to change your mind. I’m just asking you to keep an open mind and see how hard I can work to earn this privilege.”

, If you’ve asked for something that you want, but it’s not a huge deal if you don’t get it, maybe you should just let it go if your mother says no. If you make a big deal out of every request, your mom will get tired of arguing with you over time, and just start saying no to everything.


Be smart about whether or not this is important enough to keep bugging her about. Save your big arguments for things that really matter.
If going to the movies with your friends this weekend isn’t a huge priority, maybe you want to save your big fight for a much more significant privilege, like getting your own cell phone or learning how to drive.

,


Even though you’re allowed to feel how you feel, you should know that part of winning an argument involves learning to control your emotions.
Work on keeping your voice normal and level — if you notice yourself getting louder or the pitch of your voice getting higher, take calming breaths to work out that tension you feel in your throat when you get upset.
Balance your logical argument and your feelings. The discussion should be more about the argument you brainstormed in the previous section than how you’re feeling in the current moment.
If you worry that you’re going to lose your temper or cry, show your maturity by asking your mom if you can take a break until you calm down.
You might say, “Mom, I think I’m getting too worked up about this, and I’m not going to help my case by crying or yelling. But I do want to keep talking about this. I just need a break to regroup. Can we do that, please?”

, Words can have a huge effect in how your argument comes across to your mother. There’s a big difference between “you never let me do what I want” and “it would make me so happy and grateful if you let me do this.” Some language you can keep in mind includes:


'Please may I...'
'Could I please...'
'It would be really great if I could...'
'It would really help me with ______ if I could...'
'I would really appreciate...'

, In any argument, no matter how respectful and civil it is, you'll probably feel the urge to keep making your case, even when she's talking. This is very disrespectful, and suggests you think you deserve more time to speak than she does.Remember that in any conversation with your mother, she's the one with the power. If you rub her the wrong way, your chances of getting whatever you want are basically zero.
Control the urge to speak over her, even if you have great points to make.
Wait until she’s finished her line of thought. Don’t just sit through it, but actually listen to it and absorb what she’s saying.
The more you listen, the better you’ll be able to argue directly against her points. This is more effective than just making your case blindly from your own point of view.
To further prove to her how seriously you’re taking her point of view, use “connecting words” like “ok,” “yeah,” “uh huh,” and so on while your mother's talking to showing that you’re actively paying attention to what she’s saying.,


Maintain eye contact — it shows her that you’re paying close attention, not letting your attention drift like you have better places to be.
Uncross your arms and legs. Many people think crossed arms and legs as a sign that you're closed off or distant. You want to show your mother that you are open to what she has to say.
Nod your head when she’s making her points. Just like the “connecting” words, this shows that you’re following her.

, Keep the long game in mind — be upfront and honest with her about everything, even if you think she won’t like it. You already anticipated her concerns and planned out responses to them when you were brainstorming for this conversation. If you did a good job of that, you’ll have nothing to hide.


Note that you may not get what you want every single time by being honest. However, if you get caught lying, you’ll find that your mom becomes harder and harder to persuade, and she’ll be suspicious even when she has nothing to worry about.

Take note of the store and what the ""item of heaven"" is.,
Be as good and helping as you can be.,
After about a few weeks, explain to your parent(s) about the thing you want.,
You could ask your parents something like this: ""Mama/daddy, do you have enough money for this?"",
Try waiting.,
Tell your mum that you would share the item with your siblings or if you are an only child, try to show your parents as much as possible so that they can understand why you want something that costs this much and then they might end up wanting to use it also.

,
Be good, and don't cause trouble!,
Pretend you don't want it anymore (after a while of doing the other steps) then ask for it...",How to Convince Your Mother to Get You Something You Really Want," If you want to work for something and you forget what it was, well, that would be awful.;
, The more you are good and helpful, the better positive feedback you will get from your parent(s) when you ask. It might not work.

, Tell them you have been working for it for a while, and you think you've been a responsible person and deserve a nice reward. If you're lucky, They will agree and probably will buy it for you.


Or if you have a short time you could beg and beg and drive them mad then they might get it for you ,but it's a bit risky.You might get grounded!

, ""No, wait until I get paid"" And then a few days after they get paid, ask them this: ""Can you get me this? I know that you might say no but I just want to let you know I love you any way."" Sweet talking most likely will work. Make them think you can understand their life and all the difficulties. The answer might turn into a yes. Or you could show your parents your report card and they could get you it(only if it's a good report card).

, People say that patience gets rewards. Just remember parent(s) are easy.

,, Do dishes for your mum or give the dog a bath! Whatever you do, be good!

, If ""no"" is the answer, keep on trying!

If you believe that your girlfriend is Ms.,
Be honest.,
Communicate.,
Respect her through listening and show her how much you care for her.

,
Work out your problems.,
If she makes you really angry or has said something that could tempt her behavior, show that you are hurt.,
Always try to make her feel like she's special.,
Never, under any circumstances, make your Facebook status about another girl.,
Have a life outside of hers, otherwise you'll get clingy which only pushes her away, even if she is Ms.,
If you haven´t spent a lot of time with her lately, but there's a game or a movie you want to go alone or with your friends, ask her if she doesn't mind.",How to Not Lose Your Girlfriend," Right, then she should be your number one life priority: you should care for her as you care for yourself. If your girlfriend is indeed Ms. Right, she'll do the same for you.;
, Do all that you ever can to never lie to your girl, and if you do, own up to it immediately. If you truly love someone, you cannot hide a lie; you will feel terribly guilty, and when (not if) she finds out, everything you have ever told her is called into question---even ""I love you.""

, You have to respect her thoughts, always listen to what she says. Listen to her, girls don't like it when guys don't listen.

,, In real relationships saying sorry is the first step of many. It will not solve the problem alone-you need to talk to solve it, but it will help open the doors of communication.

, She should respect you and understand your emotions and not act irrational.

, Women love to feel special.

, some girls get jealous others might assume that you are cheating.

, Right. But never do whatever you like or whenever you like and forget the fact that your relationship also needs time.

, The lack of time you spend together just makes her feel like if you don´t even care anymore. After all if you don't show to her that her opinion is important to you, that she is important and you're willing to spend time with her no matter what, how do you expect her to fill loved and respected? And if you haven´t had time or opportunity to be together, tell her how special she is to you, how much you miss her, and try to make plans even though there is still one week missing. That will only show her how much you want to be with her. On the other hand, if she tries to make plans and you can´t, make sure that she understands why you can´t and realize that even if she wants it or not she will be sad, she misses you, so why not let her know that you feel the same and that you love her?

Then, when you are ready to ask for a car, reemphasize that you really appreciate all the things they do for you. Don’t act as if you are entitled to a car; this can make them angry.


When your parents give you things, say thank you and act excited. Considering getting them a thank you card or making a nice homemade present whenever they get you something. Clean the whole house after they get you something big. This will encourage them to buy you more things, including a car, in the future.
If you seem entitled and say things like “my friend John has a car,” parents will get upset that you expect to have a car.

After you get the car, you’ll have new expenses, like gas., If you and your parents co-sign on the car loan, you will be able to take out a loan in your name.

Say something like “This will be a good opportunity to prove that I am financially responsible and to increase my credit score.Emphasize that if you don’t start building your credit history it will be harder to buy a house in the future.

, A driving agreement is a promise to follow certain safe behaviors on the road. Before asking them about the car, draw up the agreement. Offer to sign it if they buy you a car. You can include in the agreement promises like:


”I will not drive under the influence of drugs and alcohol.”
”I will not use the phone while driving.”
”I will not eat while driving.”
”I will never drive faster the speed limit.”
”I will not drive in rain or snow.
”I will not drive after 9 pm.”, Present your parents with some of your research about cars. Show them that you have put real thought into buying a car and want to help give them the necessary information. But make it clear that it is their choice and you are just trying to help them.Consider presenting information about cars in a PowerPoint or letter to keep all your information organized and make you look responsible.
Consider, for example, presenting a list of reasonably prized cars. Research how much the insurance and gas is likely to cost and include this in the presentation.

, Don’t seem upset, instead emphasize that you want to learn how to do better. Try to figure out if the issue is money or trust. If they say that they aren’t mature enough, ask them for some advice about how you could improve.Don’t be aggressive or whinny. Say something like “Could you explain what I could do to make you feel better about buying me a car?”

, Once you figure out why your parents said “no,” spend some time changing their minds. Stop any behaviors that they said proved that you were immature. Do more around the house to win their favor. If the reason they gave was money, spend some time researching cheaper cars. Try to save up some more money from work.

, Give yourself some time to prove your parents wrong. When your parents seem happy again, ask them if you are acting more mature now. Tell them how much more money you have raised or about the cheaper car you have found. If they sound approving, ask them again if they are ready to buy you a car.

You don’t have to call it “date night” if that sounds too cheesy, but you should make a goal to spend some quality time together without anyone else around at least one night a week.


You can do this same thing during date night, such as cooking dinner together and then going to the movies, or spice it up and do something new every time. If you’re staying in, maintain a romantic atmosphere by lighting some candles and playing some soft music.
Whatever you do, make sure you have time to really talk during your special time together. You won’t be able to talk much if you’re just going to a loud concert together.
Learn to say no to others during “date night.” Your girlfriends may be begging you to come out to the bars, but if you’ve scheduled a date night, tell them you can’t make it and make plans for next week. Things will break down if “date night” is the thing you’re always willing to give up.
You should always look nice, tell each other how much you love each other, and compliment each other throughout the night.;
, You don’t have to plug this into your calendar, and hopefully you won’t have to, but you should make a conscious effort to make love at least one a week, no matter how tired you feel after work, or how much you have going on that week.


Making love is a way to maintain your intimacy and to grow closer to your partner.
You should also spend some time just cuddling and kissing each other, so you don’t feel like you’re just checking “sex” off of your to-do list.

, Though your schedules may get crazy, you need to make a concerted effort to talk to each other every day, no matter how much work you have to do. You can set aside time to talk during dinner, or to talk over the phone if your loved one is away.


Make a habit of knowing what your loved one’s day was like. Though you don’t have to bore each other with every little detail of your lives, you should become comfortable with each other’s routines.
If you’re spending a week apart, set aside at least fifteen minutes a day to catch up and to remind your loved one how much you love and miss him.
When you do talk, there should be no distractions. You’re not really talking if you’re also watching the game or checking your phones.

, Honesty is the key to any long-lasting relationship. To keep your relationship strong, you should be able to be open and honest with your special someone. You should be able to share your most intimate thoughts and feelings with your loved one, or you’re not really communicating.


Don’t be afraid to tell your loved one if he disappointed you. Being honest about your feelings will help you work through the problem, and is far better than being passive aggressive if you’re upset about something.
Share your feelings with your loved one. If you’re really upset about something that happened at work or something your mother said, then don’t keep it all inside.
Know when not to say something. Though honesty is almost always the best policy, you don’t have to share every little feeling with your loved one. For example, if you don’t like his new shirt or think one of his new friends is kind of annoying, you may want to keep it to yourself.
Time your honesty. If you want to open up about something important, make sure you do it when your loved one has time to talk and is relatively unstressed. Your news will be better received if he has time to listen.

, In any strong relationship, being happy should be more important than being right. If you want your relationship to last, then you should learn how to make decisions with your loved one, and to find a way for both of you to be happy with the decisions, or to take turns giving in to each other. Here’s how to do it:


When you’re making a decision, have your loved one rate how important it is to him on a scale of 1 to 10, and then state how important it is to you. Then talk about why it’s so important to both of you, and what you can do to make it matter less.
Be thoughtful. When the two of you are making a decision, take the time to discuss the pros and cons and what you can do to meet halfway.
Take turns giving in on small decisions. If you picked the restaurant for date night, let your girl pick the movie.
Make sure both people are compromising. It’s not a compromise if your girl is always giving in to what you want in the end because you’re more persistent.

, This is an important point. If you want to be in a long-lasting relationship, then you absolutely have to learn how to say you’re sorry from time to time. When it comes to a relationship, admitting you’re sorry is much more important than being stubborn.


Learn to apologize if you’ve done something wrong. It may take you some time to realize that you made a mistake, but once you do, say that you’re sorry for what you’ve done.
Make sure you mean it. Be sincere and make eye contact. It won’t mean anything if you’re just saying you’re sorry because you have to.
Learn to accept your loved one’s apology. If he truly means it, then you should stop sticking to your guns, accept the apology, and move on.

, Don’t ever forget to say “I love you” and take your feelings for granted. You should tell your loved one that you love him every single day—multiple times a day, if you can. Remember that there’s a difference between “love you” and “I love you”—you should really mean it when you say it.


Always compliment your loved one. Tell her how great she looks in her new dress or how much you love her smile.
Always thank your loved one. Don’t take his/her favors and kind actions for granted.
Always tell your loved one how special he/she is. Don’t ever forget to make him feel unique.

, A relationship is like a shark—if it doesn’t move forward, it dies. You should find ways of keeping your relationship fresh so your love doesn’t become just a part of your routine. One way of doing this is to find new interests that you can pursue together, so you have something to be excited about as well as a shared passion.


Take a weekly dance class together. This will give you some great exercise and will increase your passion for each other.
Find a new hobby together. Try taking a painting or ceramics class, or find a new love for sailing.
Take a class together. Try learning a new language or taking a history class together.
Train for a race together. This is a great way to get closer, whether you’re training for a 5K or a marathon.
Do anything out of your comfort zones. Try hiking, mountain biking, or even ice skating. Doing something completely unfamiliar will bring you closer together.

, If you want to maintain a healthy relationship, then you have to maintain a healthy sex life. Though your lovemaking may not be what it was in the beginning after five years together, you should still try new things in the bedroom so you’re still excited about making love with your partner and that everything you do still feels like an adventure.


Make love in new positions. Don’t do the same old thing you’ve been doing, even if it works. You can even look up new positions together, which will be great for foreplay.
Make love in new places. Don’t always go for the bedroom—try the couch, the kitchen table, or even check in to a hotel in the middle of the day.
Try going to a sex store to pick up some kinky items to bring into bed.

, Though a vacation isn’t a good long-term solution to any relationship problems, taking a trip together can help take you out of your same old perspective and appreciate your love in a new way. Plus, planning a trip together will give you something new to look forward to.


Plan the trip you’ve always wanted to take. If you’ve both been talking about going to Paris together for the last seven years and you have the funds for it, it’s time to make your dreams a reality.
Take a short day trip. Even driving an hour out to spend a day in the woods or the beach can make your relationship feel fresher.
Take a second honeymoon. If you’re already married and had a honeymoon, take another honeymoon to commemorate your love.

, Chances are that along with chemistry, you met your partner at a time that was conducive to your union. You may have been young with a strong sex drive, on a holiday, or shared a strong emotional experience together. This is an example of a positive contextual influence that improved your relationship.

, Accept the fact that negative contextual influences are unavoidable. When a person goes through a stressful period, a period of ill health, professional failure, or has other sources of anxiety then he or she could act in a way that is not consistent with the behavior of the person you know and love.

, If your partner is unsympathetic with you in a testing time, such as just following labor, being fired at work, or after a death in the family, then consider that it maybe not be him or her, but the situation that produces those words. Treat contextual influences like the weather. There is nothing you can do about them, other than to tolerate them.

, Forget and forgive a person's behavior in difficult times. The human mind naturally favors negative experiences over positive ones. Grudges for what your partner said carelessly add up over time, and are are a sure way of making a relationship sour. Differentiating contextual behavior from personal behavior is an art that can help create healthy, lifelong relationships.

Play together.,
Maintain some individual passions and friends.,
Find solo joy.,
Show appreciation and support for your mate.,
Spice it up in the romance department.,
Commit at your own pace.",How to Make Your Relationship Work1," Develop mutual interests with your partner to help your relationship grow or stay strong. It's important to have common interests other than your love for each other. At first, passion may be enough to keep your love going, but once your relationship matures, it's important to share common interests or activities so that your relationship stays fresh.You should work on sharing hobbies, whether you bake desserts together, go hiking together, or find a good book that you can both read.
Have a couple culture project. You can decide to watch at least one movie together a week, or have your own mini-book club. That way, you can motivate yourself to learn new things and keep your conversations interesting.;
, Healthy relationships are secure enough so that each of you can get some space every now and then. While it’s important to share passions, you should still have something that’s just yours whether it’s a weekly spa visit or a poker night with your friends.


It's just as important to spend the night with your sweetie hanging out with friends as it is to have some alone time regularly. Balancing time apart with time together promotes interdependence. Both of you absolutely need it in order to maintain your own interests, as well as to realize how grateful you are when your partner is around., Don’t count on your partner to bring you happiness. Just as you should make sure to have your own hobbies, you should also be sure that you are happy on your own. So many people enter relationships hoping that their mates will make them happy. This is an unrealistic expectation, and only causes the relationship to suffer.


Whatever makes you happy, be sure you are doing that for you and not expecting your partner to bring you happiness. Set objective goals and take action daily to reach them. Build a strong support network outside of your relationship. Do work that adds meaning to your life., Even if you think your love is rock solid, never take your loved one for granted. No matter how busy your days are, make time away from computers, phones, and televisions to catch up on each other’s days.


Compliment your significant other at least once a day. For bonus points, find something new to say every time!Don’t come to expect your partner’s good deeds. Tell your date or partner “thanks” when they show up with flowers. Showing appreciation reinforces positive behaviors., Be sure to add interest to your love life with exciting dates and love-making. It’s easy to fall into a rut and think you’re no longer attracted to your partner merely because the two of you never do anything new.


Schedule weekly date nights where you spend time together one-on-one. These don’t have to be ostentatious—go to a movie, have a candlelight dinner in your home, or feed the ducks at the local pond.Check in with your partner often to make sure they are content in the romance department. You might start by sharing your own feelings like “Our date last week was really fun! It was nice to be with you in a different way. What did you think about it?”, The biggest mistake you can make is putting your foot on the gas to catch up with all the speeding cars around you—you just may end up crashing. Let your relationship develop in its own time without trying to hurry up to some far-off finish line.


Just because your best friend shacked up with her boyfriend of three weeks doesn't mean that you and your beau have to go apartment hunting ASAP.
On the other hand, be wary if your partner delays making a commitment. It’s important to have a dialogue to ensure both of you have the same goals for the relationship. Ask, “Could we talk about where we see our relationship going?” to spark a conversation.

It doesn't always have to be public (PDA), but get used to the idea, because she wants other people to see how much you love her, so don't be afraid to kiss her or hold her hand in public.


Tell her she's beautiful and always make eye contact. Eye contact shows you mean what you say. When you look away, it will make her question your authenticity, so make eye contact at all times. You have to show her that you mean what you said. If you're really sincere when you tell her how beautiful she is to you, you're going to go a long way.

Also, tell her that she drives you crazy, and that she's the prettiest girl you've ever laid eyes on. Tell her that you've never met anyone like her.
Compliment her on her looks, but also on her accomplishments, talents and abilities. If she's a great poker player, tell her she's smart. If she's a good listener, tell her she's great with other people.

;
, Make sure you mean it. If you're not ready to go there yet, that's fine. But, be sure to switch that ""I love you"" for a really good ""You know how special you are to me?"" or a ""I like you so much; I'm a really lucky guy.""


Simple is best. Stick with ""I love you,"" or ""You make me so happy,"" or ""I'm really lucky to have you."" Don't be so poetic that you go overboard.
These statements make her feel good, and they make her self-confidence soar. Remember, when her self-confidence is high, you benefit. Be steady with your signs of love or affection, enough so that she doesn't forget how much you mean to her, but not so much that the power of the words gets watered down.

, Even the slightest touch can make a woman feel special. Make sure it's a respectful and gentle touch, and not one that's overly sexual or suggestive.


Hold her hand, give her a hug, rub her back, or gently touch her face. These gestures will all make her feel protected and loved! Love her like you would want to be loved.
There's a time and a place for foreplay, but you're not doing yourself any favors if you go there when she's not ready. Make sure she's totally comfortable before you start exploring your sexual relationship. Sex does not define a relationship. If you both agree to hold off, show her you adore her by pleasing her in other ways ie; deep passionate kisses on her mouth or small pecks all over her body. Women love knowing that their man adores their body and all of it.

, Put her needs in front of yours. This does not mean that you are weak. It just means that, most of the time, you're willing to bend for her, even if it was not something you wanted to do.


If you believe she is ""Ms. Right,"" then make her your number one priority! They say that love is selfless; you're going to have to prove it to her.
If you're with your friends, never ignore her and start talking with your friends or walk off with them as if she's not there. How would you feel if she did this to you? Invisible, right? Keep close to her or glance at her every so often just to let her know you know she's still there and offer a genuine smile.

Listen to her. One of the biggest complaints women have about men is that they don't listen. Even if you're not particularly interested in what she's saying, listen, then acknowledge that you were listening. Let her know that you are the one that she can talk to about anything.
Every woman loves a bit of alone-time with her partner. Book a whole day for the two of you to be alone. Watch a movie, massage her back, snuggle and be intimate. Put other thoughts out of your head and focus completely on her. You'll notice more of a connection when you do this, and that's what you want. Try to schedule a bit of alone-time with her at least every month or so.

, Treating your girl with dignity means treating her the way that you would want to be treated. Don't swear at her, manipulate her, use her for your own benefit, or shoot down her ideas. Making her as happy as possible is a goal, so it's not going to happen overnight. But work toward it slowly, and try as hard as you can, even if you don't succeed.


Always stand up for her no matter what. Sticking up for her shows her that you are on her side, and that you're willing to take a public stand for her, which isn't easy.
At the same time, don't put yourself in an impossible situation. If she's having an argument with her parents right in front of you, you probably don't want to take a stand and risk upsetting her parents (who might control a lot about her life). Stay out of family matters as much as possible, but give her backup when she asks for it.
Don't argue in public and cause a scene. This will humiliate her and you; she'll think twice about going out with you again. Stay calm when you have a fight, try as much as possible not to let your emotions take over, and treat her the way that you want to be treated. Keep your voice down, don't yell at her, and expect to apologize, even if you didn't do anything wrong. An apology goes a long way. Also, call her even if she hangs up. Nothing tells a woman ""I want this to work"" than a simple phone call.

, Being open and communicative makes her feel like you want her in your life. Being intimate isn't just about getting to know her body; it's also about sharing the things that happen to you, and going through them together.


On the same note, listen to her advice, even if you don't agree. Force yourself to listen and to see her reasoning. Keep an open ear and an open mind. She'll reward you with all of her love.
Even if you don't have much to say, let her in on what you're thinking. If you're the strong, silent type, she may misinterpret your feelings for her. Let her know what you're thinking so that she doesn't get the wrong idea.

, Just make sure that the roles aren't reversed. She goes through a lot to look nice for you, and do sweet things for you, so try to pay for majority of things when you get the chance. This isn't about the money. It's about showing her that you care enough to treat her on occasion. It doesn't have to be all the time, and don't be flashy about it or act like it's a big deal. Letting her know your money is hers as well and vice versa says a lot to her. When she pays for occasional dates for you, it is her way of saying I care about your finances and want to care for you as well. Don't take those moves for granted, be appreciative.

, Every girl wants a guy with a sense of romance. Girls like to pretend (deep down inside, mostly; sometimes very literally) that they are stars of their own fairy tale, and they want to be treated like it. Show your girl that you care about her by putting a little effort into your romance.



Write her love notes. Notes don't have to be long, mushy and poetic if you're not the type. Quick and silly ones will do just fine. Try to make them cute (girls love things that are ""cute,"" like a drawing) as a way to show her that you care. Write the notes on actual paper, too. Also, a card once in a while will do. Write in your words how you feel.
Don't email or text her this. Emails tell her you're lazy and not willing to put in extra time for her. Be a man, put some effort into it, and write her a good, old-fashioned letter.
Tell her that you're lucky that you found her. Tell her that she makes you want to treat yourself better. Tell her that from the moment you first saw her, you knew she was special. This is a great way to be romantic.

, The small things matter the most. Be a gentleman. Hold doors open for her. Thinking of her means putting yourself in her shoes sometimes and wondering what you can give her or do for her.


Ask her if she's cold when it's cold out; have a jacket or a sweater handy so you can give it to her.
When she isn't feeling well, or she's sick, bring her some soup, hot tea or flowers. Hold her hand at the movies or when you're walking. Get her something just because.
Small things like a single flower, a magazine you know she likes, a bag of her favorite candy or a chocolate bar will go a long way. Show her that you're thinking about her.

, Being romantic is all about taking what you know about her and showing her how much these things mean to you.


How does she like her eggs cooked? What is her favorite flower? What about perfume? What does she enjoy doing when it comes to dates? What are her favorite books, and her favorite songs?
Remember what she likes to eat and cook it for her. Or remember what kinds of flowers make her feel womanly, and send them to her. Or remember what songs make her want to dance, laugh, and cry, and make a mix for her.

, This is a big deal with women. Birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones are all opportunities to show her how special she is to you. Keep an agenda or a calendar with all these dates.


When it's her birthday, bring her a present (chocolates, gift certificates, shoes all work great) and send her some flowers. Don't forget to write her a card, being funny and romantic about how she's getting older but that, to you, she'll always be as young as the day when you first saw her.
When it's your anniversary, book something special for you both to let her know how much you appreciate and love her. Make a scrapbook where you keep all the ticket stubs of the places you've gone together, and jot down your memories of the dates.
Send her a Facebook video message where you tell her how important she is to you, and how you'll never forget the first date you two went on.

Remember that women want to be spoiled on these occasions. Flowers at her door, dinner together in a nice place — these things show that you care. Remember that it isn't about the money, but the thought behind the action that counts.



, Women are maternal creatures: they love taking care of things. That's why she cooks you great meals, or packs your backpack, or worries when you don't call after you've gone home. Take advantage of her nature and show her that you appreciate her effort, and let her know that you care back.


Remember that women have been raised around stories that end in ladies finding the ""Perfect Man,"" becoming a Princess and living happily ever after. It's ingrained into their subconscious that they must find a man who is perfect in every way. While this is basically impossible, you want to try to be that prince for her.
Girls want to feel special. Girls want to be able to brag to their girlfriends about how great you are; they want to know that you're as invested in the relationship as they are; they want to picture themselves being the luckiest girl in the world. Be the kind of guy that gives her these things.

The more you make her feel like it's her specifically that you love, and not just any old girlfriend, the more special she'll feel.
So, don't say ""I love curves on women"" if you want to compliment her; instead, say ""I love how your curves show off your beautiful body.""
Likewise, don't compliment her feminine assets as much as the things that are truly unique about her. Something like ""I never realized until now how your eyes look exactly like sapphires,"" is a lot more endearing than something about her chest.



, We all know that men and women think and behave differently. It's important to know why, because it will help you do some of the things she expects you to do.


Understand that she doesn't think she's being clingy. Being around, worrying about your safety — these things are a natural part of being a woman, and therefore part of who she is. Learn to love that aspect of her.

Think of it as a good thing: Women are only inclined to be ""clingy"" if they genuinely love and care about you a great deal. If she has stopped doing these things, there may be something wrong!
If you need a little break from her, tell her in a sweet, loving way: ""You know I love spending time with you. But I haven't seen my boys in a while, and I was hoping to catch a movie with them this weekend. Do you mind if I go?""


It's not all about sex for her. Guys have a much different sexual drive than girls. For girls, it's not about the sex itself, but rather about the intimacy or closeness that she shares with you. If she thinks that all you want from her is sex, she's probably not going to give it to you. If she believes that she's all you want, then eventually she'll give all of herself to you.

, Girls love guys who are really confident in who they are. Remember, you don't have to be Brad Pitt or LeBron James to be confident. Being confident is all about knowing who you are, knowing what you like and dislike, and being calm and collected.


Pay attention to what you look like. Shower or bathe yourself regularly, and put on clean, nice-looking clothes. Girls don't need you to look like a male model, but they want other girls to take notice of what a catch you are, and how well you take care of yourself.

Learn to crack a joke. A joke is a great way of projecting your inner confidence. Studies show that men with a sense of humor are very desirable as mates.So, practice jokes, learn which parts of you are funny, and don't be afraid to make fun of yourself. A man with a good sense of humor screams confidence.

Never lie. How would you feel if she started lying to you? Lying is a trust issue, and trust for girls is huge. Give her the same trust she gives you.

The problem with lying is that one lie produces more lies. You usually don't just tell one lie; you get caught in a web of lies. And then it's just simple math: The more lies you tell, the sooner you're going to get caught.
Be confident enough not to lie. If you stop being embarrassed about things, you won't have to lie about them. Even if they are embarrassing, don't let them get to you. Your confidence will grow by the second.

Get the guy/girl.,
Don't be ""clingy.,
Don't be obsessive!",How to Make a Middle School Relationship Last," It may take some time to find the right person, or to even get in a relationship, so always keep your eyes open for people. And don't ever think you can't go out with someone younger or someone older. Your lover doesn't have to be in the same grade as you for it to be a good relationship. It is actually good to have a relationship with someone in a different grade, it gives you both space away from each other, which evens out the relationship. Anyway, find a person who you really do like, and would want to be with for a while, and flirt, spend time with them, etc, until you finally go out! (Make sure they are as interested in you as you are to them! But sometimes it's not always the case; sometimes you have to work up to getting that far into each other together. It takes time, and you want to take things slow.);
,( If you truly like each other then you probably won't mind)"" Don't text, IM, call, or talk to them all the time. Everyone needs their space and time alone. They will dump you if you talk to them all the time! So keep your distance, and let them always have time to hang out with their friends. It would be good if you got to know their friends, too.

, They will dump you! Don't go off saying I'm Mr. Something or go off saying she's Mrs. Something that can weird them out and push them away. Also don't write their name everywhere on your body it's okay to write their name on your hand and it's okay to doodle their name. Just don't make it as if they're all you are thinking about; you need to focus on school, but not ignore your boyfriend/girlfriend. If you have a Myspace or Facebook account, don't put all over your profile: ""I love my boyfriend!"" or ""I love my girlfriend!"" and don't put their picture everywhere.

Share your thoughts and feelings openly.,
Be an active listener.,
Demonstrate honesty and trustworthiness.,
Communicate your personal boundaries.",How to Make Your Relationship Work2," If something is bothering you, it's important to let your loved one know so you can tackle the problem together. On the flip side, your communication shouldn’t exclusively revolve around discussing issues. Spend time sharing your opinions, ideas, and dreams, too.Set aside time daily to chat with your significant other. Pick the right place and time to talk, somewhere free of distractions.
If discussing an issue, stick to “I” or “we” statements. These minimize any fault-finding and allow you to take ownership of your feelings.

, The healthiest relationships are undermined when partners listen to respond rather than listening to understand. When your partner is talking, make them feel like they are the most important person in the universe. Turn to face them. Make eye contact. Nod or encourage them to continue.Use a few techniques to become a better listener. One helpful technique is paraphrasing, which involves retelling your partner what they said to be sure you got the right message. It may sound like, “So, it sounds like you’re saying…”
Because you and your partner have an emotional relationship, it’s also good to attend to their feelings when communicating. Validate their emotional experience by saying something to the effect of “I can see that you’re hurt.”

, Although the truth is sometimes painful to hear, the only way to preserve trust and integrity in your relationship is by being honest. Admit it when you’re wrong. Apologize when you make a mistake. Your partner will appreciate your truthfulness and see you as more trustworthy., Personal boundaries define the line where your partner ends and you begin. Even though the two of you are close, you will still have different needs, wants, and limitations. Each of you should take time figuring out what your boundaries are, and then communicate them to your partner.


Share your boundaries in a calm and polite manner. For example, you might say, “I have been thinking about my personal boundaries and I wanted to share them with you…”
Boundaries can be any principles you want to live by. These may include making sure your partner respects your privacy, allows you time to yourself, and acknowledges your values and spiritual beliefs."

Be okay with conflict, but choose your battles carefully.,
Pause before saying something you’ll regret.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Check-in regularly to catch small issues before they blow up.,
Accept your partner’s differences.,
Look forward.,
Seek couples counseling.",How to Make Your Relationship Work3," Many couples have a tendency to sweep problems under the rug because they fear conflict. In truth, conflict is a normal and necessary aspect that allows a relationship to grow. You and your partner are going to have disagreements. That’s fine. However, your entire relationship shouldn’t be marked by arguments.A healthy relationship should involve primarily positive interactions. If either partner is always complaining or nagging, your relationship could be in jeopardy. Know when to lay off on the nitpicking.
Approach your partner with issues that compromise your values or the health of the relationship. Ask yourself, “Will this matter in a month, a year, or five years?” If not, let it slide.

, Follow the 48-hour rule when resolving conflict. Anger can corrode communication and lead to words being exchanged that you later wish you had kept to yourself. Take time apart to cool off before rehashing an argument.When you feel angry, give yourself a day or two before discussing the problem with your partner. Use the time to care for yourself emotionally. Spend time with friends (without venting about your partner). Journal. It may even help to jot down your thoughts about the disagreement.When you’re feeling calm, bring up the issue in a courteous tone. Again, use “I” statements like “I was really disappointed that you flaked on my performance the other night. It was a big deal to me. And I’d hoped you’d be there.”

, You shouldn’t be keeping score of wins and losses because if your partner loses, so does the relationship. Don’t develop a need to be right or always get your way. Learn the art of compromise. Stand up for what you believe in, but within reason.


When you and your partner are on different sides of an issue, decide who cares about the issue the most. If it’s not that important to you and your values aren’t violated, be willing to give in for the sake of your relationship.
Always remember that it's important that both people are willing to make a sacrifice. If you find yourself always giving in to your loved one's needs, big or small, it's time to have a talk., If you want to avoid having big serious talks all the time, remember that if something small ticks you off, you can tell your significant other without making a big deal about it. That way, you can avoid being passive-aggressive or having built up tension.Choose a time when you both are free to sit down each week and discuss the health of your relationship. It might be a good idea to jot down some feedback, both positive and negative.
For example, you might compliment your partner and offer some constructive criticism. Say, “It was so thoughtful of you to pick my mom up from the airport on Monday. Thanks again for that. I did want to point out that you’re still having problems getting your chores done. Is there something I can do to help you improve in that area?

, The worst thing you can do is view your partner through a distorted lens. Acknowledge and accept who they really are rather than your idea of them. Respect their unique background and experiences as different than your own. Keeping in mind that you have different histories and therefore different perspective can go a long way towards resolving conflict.Also, give them the benefit of the doubt always. It’s easy once you’ve known someone for a while to start assuming what they did or didn’t do. Avoid this tactic and give your partner the liberty to evolve with time like anyone else.

, In order to make your relationship work, you have to drop old hurts and let the past stay in the past. Whether you are hung up on your partner’s past relationships or dwelling on old arguments, this type of behavior can lead to a split. Once an issue has been resolved, take down the rearview mirror and don’t bring it up again., You and your partner may have trouble getting over disagreements. Conflict resolution is a learned skill; it doesn’t come naturally. If communication and conflict resolution are shortcomings in your relationship, have the courage to get help.


Professional counseling may be just what the two of you need to build healthier communication patterns and make your relationship work."

Allow him be the muscle.,
Let him be your bodyguard.,
Appeal to his desire to be a leader.Avoid planning every aspect of your lives without including him.,
Consult his expertise.,
Make him feel attractive.",How to Make a Guy Feel Manly1," When heavy lifting needs to be done or a stubborn jar lid won’t open, ask your fella for help. Bolster his self-confidence by demonstrating that you think of him as physically adept. Compliment his strength when he pulls off a feat. Admire his muscles, even if he isn’t the most strapping guy ever (or even as strong as you).If he seems like he is a little down and could use an ego boost, ask him for help even if you could accomplish the task on your own.
Be careful not to overdo it to the point of making him feel like he is little more than a 24-hour laborer.;
, Indulge his instinct to shield you from danger. Ask him to investigate that strange bump in the night rather than do it yourself, or allow him to stand between you and that shifty-looking character on the sidewalk. Apply the same technique even when the danger isn’t real, such as grabbing his hand or burying your face into his shoulder when you watch a scary movie.Show him that you think of him as your protector by giving him a home-defense tool for his birthday or a holiday, like a knife, Mac light, or a slingshot with ball bearings.

, When decisions need to be made, either make them a joint project, split them evenly between yourselves, or use a combo of the two techniques. When a decision is yours to make, ask him for his input so that he at least feels heard, even if you end up deciding on a different course of action.Definitely include him on decisions that are potentially life-altering for the both of you, such as changing jobs or spending significant sums of shared money.
Make him feel influential by involving him in small decisions too, like grocery shopping or planning routes when you both go driving.For your own well-being (as well as his), don’t cede decision-making entirely to him.

, Refer to him about subjects in which he is well versed. Make him feel like an authority. Even if he isn’t the absolute authority on a particular subject, ask for his help in areas where he has experience. If his self-esteem needs a little shot in the arm, play dumb about topics that he really enjoys so he can display his knowledge.Appeal to his know-how for tasks that need to be done. These could be projects in which he could assist you directly (like at-home projects such as painting, carpentry, or fixing the car) or other endeavors where his advice would be helpful (like planning a trip to a city or country that he is familiar with).
Ask for explanations about his hobbies or interests, whether it's about the official rules of basketball or who the heck the Dominion is in Star Trek.

, Compliment his looks. Emphasize those aspects that make him feel manly. Ogle him with your eyes when you find him particularly striking. Boost his ego even more by pointing out when others do the same.Don’t limit your compliments to generalities, like “You look great.” Specify how that three-piece tailored suits makes him look like “a man to be dealt with,” or how his stubble makes him look “so rough and tumble.”
Back your compliments up with body language.Whistle in admiration. Pause to eye him from head to toe and back again. Bite your bottom lip as you eat him up with your eyes.

If he feels trapped then he may lose feelings for you, leave you or cheat on you. If you want him to be crazy about you, give him the space to appreciate you properly.;
, Guys love sex as much as you do and they love it when you initiate it. Many men feel that they need to ""perform"" during lovemaking or ""earn"" the right to sex from their other half and this can put them off and cause stress within the relationship. By taking that pressure off of him every now and then, you can keep him interested and satisfied.

, Taking an interest any of their leisure activities is a good move, however joining them in gaming can be an especially positive move if they are a bit too used to gaming alone. He'll appreciate the company, and may find you sexier as a result.

, Your boyfriend is yours, if they're faithful then that won't change with occasionally roaming eyes. Couples can have a lot of fun checking out people together, so long as it goes no further.

, Those sexy curves, or chiseled abs are a real turn on for your boyfriend so try not to lose them. Of course, we can all be forgiven for piling on the pounds while we're in a relationship but let's try to avoid our BMI going too far north.

, Stress is a sure-fire way to destroy a relationship so try to avoid it as much as possible. Relationships are always going to be stressful sometimes, but try to separate these periods with a lot of laughs, fun and excitement.

Take care of yourself both physically and emotionally—don’t rely on your boyfriend to do it.",How to Keep a Boyfriend," This applies to everything from emotional to physical needs. Don’t assume your boyfriend knows what you want or what you need—it’s an unrealistic and unproductive expectation that will lead to unfounded disappointments and resentment.


Expecting your partner to know instinctively what you want is one of the most common and preventable sources of tension in a relationship. If you want your boyfriend to be involved, you first have to communicate your feelings and needs to him honestly.;
, Instead, just ask. Just as you wouldn’t want to have to read his mind, don’t wait for him to read yours (because he probably can’t).


When asking your boyfriend about his thoughts or feelings, try to be as respectful and patient as possible. Don’t be confrontational or accusatory, as it will only make your partner more likely to clam up.

, Get in the habit of having intimate conversations where you open up to each other and have room to be a little bit vulnerable.


Open up about your goals and dreams.
Talk about your past, both good and bad.
Share things that have meaning for you—maybe a song, a book, a souvenir, etc.

,


For example, rather than asking, “how was your day?” ask a more specific question that’s likely to elicit a more engaged response, like “what was the best part of your day?” or “what made you smile?”
This is particularly important when discussing your needs. Don’t be vague, be specific. Rather than say, “I wish you listened to me more,” say, “I’d really like for you to ask me about my day.” The more specific you are, the more likely you are to get positive results.

, Make it a regular practice to sit down with each other and talk about things that are and aren’t working.


Establish ahead of time that this will be an open but also a respectful and caring conversation. If something isn’t working for one of you, agree not to accuse or blame the other person but to instead explain your feelings and offer gentle suggestions for change or compromise.

, Physical touch—kissing, cuddling, holding hands, embracing, and having sex (if it’s sexual relationship)—is important to the intimacy of a relationship.


It’s quite common to begin to lose physical intimacy after the initial infatuation phase wears off, which makes it that much more important to pay careful attention it, particularly after you’ve been dating for a while., Quite often, partners will have different ways of expressing physical intimacy, and it’s important that you’re both aware of and attentive to what the other needs.

, Knowing what your boyfriend likes—and vice versa—will help both of you feel intimately connected.

, Agree to communicate openly and honestly with each other about physical intimacy and to respect the other’s wishes if the other person says no.

, Be mutually engaged in the physical aspect of the relationship.

, Know, though, that you aren’t obligated to like all of them. Find friends of his that you can get along with and spend some time hanging out as part of his friend circle—and ask him to reciprocate as well.


If you dislike some of his friends, don’t ask him to give up those friendships unless you have strong reason to be concerned (destructive or abusive behavior, etc.). If you dislike ‘’’ all ‘’’ of his friends, you’ll need to sit down and have an honest conversation about how to compromise.
Also talk about allowing each other to hang out with your own friends separately. Maintaining strong friendships while in a relationship is both important and healthy for both of you.

,


Do your best to make your actions show that you love and value your boyfriend and want the relationship to work. Ask for the same if you feel you aren’t receiving it.
Don’t play games and don’t be emotionally manipulative. Be honest and straightforward with your feelings. Ask that he do the same.
Forgive him and yourself for honest mistakes.
Give him the benefit of the doubt. When an issue comes up, don’t go automatically with your worst suspicions. If, for example, your boyfriend shows up late, don’t immediately assume he’s cheating or doesn’t respect you or wants to hurt you. Instead, ask him honestly why he was late, and, if you have no other reason to be distrustful, accept his reasons. Of course, if he has a pattern of poor behavior and you have legitimate reasons for doubt, don’t dismiss them and do talk to him about it.

, It should go without saying, but never cheat on or try to emotionally manipulate your partner.


If you find yourself so attracted to another person that you absolutely need to be with them, discuss alternate relationship possibilities with your boyfriend or end your relationship with him first.
If you find your attention just generally wandering or find yourself wanting to make him jealous, have an honest heart-to-heart with yourself and then with him about what you aren’t getting from the relationship.

, Recognize and respect that you are—and should remain—two unique individuals. Don’t try to take up space in every aspect of his life, and don’t allow him to take up all the space in yours. Respect and admire each other’s independence.

, Being in a relationship doesn’t mean you have to share all the same hobbies, tastes, and friends—in fact, it’s probably a bad idea. Respect each other’s differences and give each other time to pursue your own individual interests.

, Talk to him about how much and what kind of individual time you both need.


Remember that your needs may be different and be willing to talk about it and compromise if necessary.
Be sure you both understand what you want from your time apart, and be particularly sure you both understand what that time apart means to the other person. Don’t let yourself start to feel that “alone time” means “he doesn’t want to be around me” when, to him, it may mean something quite different—it will only lead to unnecessary hurt and misunderstanding.

, It’s a natural part of human relationships, and it doesn’t have to be destructive. If you can learn to fight constructively, conflict can even strengthen a relationship., As hard as it can be to stay level-headed when emotions are high, remember that how you react will determine whether the disagreement will help or hurt the relationship.

, Call a time-out for a mutually agreed-upon amount of time and come back together when you’ve had time to calm down. Taking a time-out allows emotions to defuse and allows both of you to step back and recognize what you’re truly upset about. Sometimes it isn’t what you think in the heat of the moment.

, Often when we fight, we only allow ourselves to react to immediate events and deal with surface emotions (annoyance, anger, etc.). But in most cases what we’re angry or annoyed about isn’t—or isn’t only—the immediate circumstances but what’s beneath them: fear, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, hurt, etc.


Look beyond your annoyance in the moment to find what’s really fuelling that feeling—a past hurt or an underlying fear, for example—and try to recognize what you’re really upset about. Once you recognize the real issue, communicate that honestly to your partner.

, You don’t have to agree about everything, and it can be good practice to respectfully agree to disagree.


Remember the difference between important and unimportant differences: disagreeing about which restaurant has the best hamburgers is okay; disagreeing about, for example, how to communicate respect is an issue that needs discussion.

, Don’t make insincere or dismissive apologies like, “I’m sorry that’s what you think happened” or “I’m sorry you didn’t understand me.” Instead, be genuine and empathetic; you might say something like, “I’m sorry I hurt you. I didn’t mean to, and I’m going to try not to hurt you again.”

, Give your partner your full attention and be an active listener (see How to Actively Listen). And ask him to do the same.


To keep the emotional intimacy of your relationship healthy, you both need to be sincerely present for and engaged with each other.

, When your boyfriend comes to you to vent or share his feelings, recognize that he’s showing you that he appreciates that you’re there for him and is making himself emotionally vulnerable. Honor that gesture of intimacy and listen actively and with care.

, Don’t try to force him to meet a precise set of requirements in exactly the way you want. Be open to who he is and learn how you can support each other in your own ways; don’t try to force each other to be something you’re not.


As much as you might want to believe that your partner should perfectly meet all your expectations in exactly the way you want him to, it really isn’t in the nature of how human beings—or human relationships—work.

, It’s healthy to let him know your needs and desires and to expect him to make an effort to meet them. But it isn’t realistic or healthy to expect him to become a different person.

, Don’t look for a boyfriend or a relationship to make you feel wanted or valued—it’s a recipe for disaster.


The more confident you are in yourself, the more compelling you’ll be to your boyfriend and to other people in general. Humans are quite good at sensing when people are insecure or inauthentic, and it tends to be a universal detractor.

, It will inevitably leave you unsatisfied because no one else can truly make you feel valued—that’s something only you can do.


If you place a significant amount of your self-worth in a relationship, you’re entrusting your value to something that isn’t about you—relationships are about two people learning to be, yes, in a relationship with each other. It not only doesn’t make sense to see a relationship as a reflection of your own worth, it will ultimately backfire and leave you irrationally dependent on another person for your sense of self.

, Though he can and hopefully will provide supplemental love and support, he can’t—and shouldn’t—carry the weight of all your physical and emotional needs.Set aside time to physically take care of yourself, whether that means taking a bath, going to the gym, learning self-defense, playing with your dog, playing a sport, etc. When you’re physically well, you’ll be more naturally confident and independent, a highly attractive attribute in anyone, and particularly in a partner.
Make time to emotionally take care of yourself. Check in with yourself and how you’re feeling, independent of your boyfriend. If you’re not maintaining your own emotional health, it will very quickly begin to negatively impact your relationship.

Share his manly deeds with others.,
Avoid subverting him in front of people.,
Accentuate your femininity.,
Make him feel like a man in bed.",How to Make a Guy Feel Manly2," Reinforce his masculine image by spotlighting it in conversation with your friends and family. Boast about his accomplishments. Praise his knowledge, skills, and contributions. Refer others to his expertise so that he feels valued.Be careful to stop short of overkill so that you don't embarrass him or make it seem too much like a campaign. Raise the topic when appropriate, rather than forcing it. Mention his achievements offhandedly, as if they were a given.

, Don’t call attention to his weaknesses in the presence of others. Even if he displays a good sense of humor about his shortcomings when the two of you are alone, appreciate that he may be more sensitive when you are in public. Preserve his sense of self-respect. Resist the urge to correct him needlessly.If he makes a mistake that is inconsequential, leave it unmentioned. For example, let it go if he gets a minor plot point wrong when describing a movie.
If it is consequential but doesn’t need to be addressed immediately, wait until you are alone to bring it up. Don't embarrass him by calling him out for, say, being twenty minutes late in meeting you and your party at a restaurant. If his frequent tardiness is an issue, bring it up later, when he will be more receptive.
If it does need to be addressed this minute, do so gently. Let's say he gives someone the wrong street directions. Ask him, “Wouldn’t that take them to Maple Street instead of Elm Street?” instead of saying, “That would take them to Maple Street, dummy.”

, Highlight his masculinity by bringing your girliness to the fore. Add feminine touches to your daily appearance. Make his manly features more stark in contrast. At the same time, boost his pride in having such a striking lady in his life.Make a point of going all-out for date nights and special occasions. Style your hair. Apply makeup. Wear jewelry, dresses, and chic shoes.
Use small touches on a day-to-day basis. Opt for pink sneakers instead of black. Wear pj’s dotted with hearts instead of regular old sweatpants. Treat yourself to some nice underwear and save the more basic stuff for laundry day.
If you gravitate toward more gender-neutral colors (like black) or apparel (such as jeans), pick clothing that has a distinctly feminine cut to compensate.

, Subtly alter your routine so that your gender roles are more pronounced during sex. Appeal to his desire to lead and dominate on occasion. Resist the urge to switch positions or move on to new acts just because you feel the whim. Instead, grant him the occasional romp where he gets to direct the course of action.Stoke his ego even more by allowing yourself to lose your self-control, too. Gasp, grunt, groan, and/or curse like a sailor, whichever comes naturally.
Encourage him with body language and exclamations when he is doing something right. Build his self-confidence and make it more likely that you'll be just as satisfied on nights when he's in control.
Surprise him by wearing some distinctly feminine lingerie. Ask him to dress up in turn with his best suit.
Suggest roleplaying scenarios with stark gender roles, like plumber/housewife or jock/cheerleader.

Respect his tunnel vision.,
Allow him space.,
Support his efforts and dreams.",How to Make a Guy Feel Manly3," Understand that men are wired to focus on one thing at a time. Appreciate the likelihood that he will likely some difficulty in leaping from one topic to the next if there is no obvious segue between them.Rather than fault him for it, adapt your approach when you ask him to juggle more than one thing at a time. Communicate effectively while preserving his self-esteem.


If you approach him while he is working on something, ask him when he plans on taking a break so you can talk to him then. This way his focus will be on your conversation, rather than the task at hand.
If you request that he accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, allow him to come up with his own schedule (or work together to arrive at one that works for both of you). This way he should be better able to apply his singular focus to each task in turn.
Rather than ask him to engage in a whole bunch of new activities at once (like, say, ballroom dancing on Friday night, bowling on Saturday night, and kayaking on Sunday), suggest trying them as a series, one after the other (learning to dance this winter, bowling in the spring, and kayaking next summer).

, Resist the urge to feel offended if he wants to spend some time away from you on a regular basis. Understand that, at some level, men tend to evaluate all of their relationships as a contest for power. Expect them to look forward to disengaging from this mindset at the end of their school- or work-day.Establish a routine that allows him some time by himself, if only a half-hour. If the demands at home do not allow this on a daily basis, grant him some free time on the weekends to recharge.
If you live together, cede some physical space to him as well. Allow him to control the decor and functionality of at least one room to make it his. Failing that, designate a portion of one or more rooms to call his own.

, Expect him to take his life’s direction to heart, either positively or negatively. Understand that, even if he thoroughly enjoys your relationship, he may still feel depressed if his personal ambitions suffer from it. Be aware that this failure to succeed in other areas of life may lead him to believe that he is unworthy toward you, even if you consider him to be a godsend.Thank him through words and actions for his contributions to your life. Show him that you recognize any sacrifices that he has made on your behalf. Validate his time spent at a job or in a city that he doesn’t particularly like so that he thinks of it as a challenge met rather than a sign of failure.Be open to making sacrifices of your own in turn. If he proposes making a change in his life in order to achieve some relevance, hear him out, even if it means facing other changes that you would rather do without. Weigh the long-term benefits of his improved sense of self versus any short-term setbacks, such as reduced pay or less time spent together.

There are so many girls who are basically throwing themselves away at guys by acting promiscuously in their manner of dress, their style of speech, not to mention socially and sexually compromising themselves in order to get a boyfriend.,

Guys like ""shiny"" things, and that doesn't necessarily mean they like the girls wearing micro-miniskirts and 5-inch stiletto heels.",How to Know What Mature Boys Look for in Girls," Respect yourself and you will still stand out — but in a much more flattering way.;
, If you try to act really wise by talking about serious subjects, a guy will notice if you actually don't know anything about it, and you'll look fake and wanna-be. However, really knowing something by reading the paper or watching the news can help your mature and intelligent image. Boys are more about the looks, older guys also appreciate a little wisdom!

, Greet people you know when you see them, including adults and authority figures (parents, teachers, etc.). You'd be surprised about how good you will feel afterwards.

, People love to see smiling faces. The sense of happiness is key.

, Focus on the good things in your life. Strive to make each day positive.

, This adaptability will be seen as a positive asset.

, Do not act dumb, no matter how cute and attractive you think it is. No matter what or whom you are attracted to, don't hide your intellect for a certain guy's attentions.

, This should go without saying for a positive image, but still... Just do it.

, Guys like creativity and honesty. That is all shown when you're being yourself.

, Smoking, drinking, drug use, stealing, profanity - those are all turnoffs. Drinking a lot even when at the appropriate age limit still can show insecurity and immaturity.

, Be able to manage your time for yourself, but allow for some flexibility to spend time with others.

, Stay true to your opinions and values, but also be respectful of the opinions of others. (If a guy doesn't respect a woman who is not a pushover, then he isn't very nice now, is he? At the same time, if a guy wants to do nice things for you, don't automatically assume that letting him help you will automatically undermine your independence.)

, Just because a guy is making a sexual move on you, doesn't mean he thinks you're easy or immediately wants sex with you. Most often when a guy starts making more serious moves, he is just trying to figure out how far you'll let him go. With respectable guys, all you have to say is no, and they are more than happy to abide by that. But they don't know how far they can go — or how far you want them to go — so they test to see. A guy can be more contented with a girl who knows her boundaries than with a girl who just isn't sure or needs more time to think about the situation. Just tell him that whatever he's going for will come with time, and he should respect that. (If not, forget him and move on. There are other guys out there who will respect that.)

, A little self-deprecating honesty is refreshing, but if you think those things are wrong with you and your body, he'll eventually start to agree. Be honest, but don't put yourself down in doing so.

, It means that they want to be around someone who has a ""glow"" or unique charm about her.

Talk to her and explore her personality.,
Be patient.,
Be there when she needs it.,
Be romantic with her.,
Do the small things.,
Love her for who she is and what her beliefs are because those are unlikely to change anytime soon.",How to Make a Girl Feel Special," Girls love compliments, and no wonder: They tell her that you really care, and they make her feel good about herself. Compliment her on both her looks and her personality, and she'll feel like she's the whole package in your eyes. Try not to tell her she's ""fit"" or ""hot,"" however, because that sounds plain and generic. Don't over-compliment a girl, either, because you might alarm her, or give the impression that you want something from her in return for your kindness.


Tell her that she's ""beautiful,"" ""pretty,"" or ""gorgeous"" instead. These words are a lot more heartfelt, and they have a little extra emotion behind them.
Compliment aspects of her personality, too. Girls want to feel pretty on the outside and the inside. Sincere compliments about her personality let her understand that you like her for who she is deep down inside:

""Every time we're alone, you remind me of how fun it is to just do nothing together.""
""You are as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside.""
""You make me want to be a better person every single day.""
""When I look at you, I know what it's like to feel completely safe and comfortable around someone.""

;
, It's a good idea to have a few basic compliments to give your girl every once in a while, but it's also a good idea to take something totally unique about her and let her know that you love it, or at least appreciate it.


Maybe you're mesmerized by her eyes. Tell her what her eyes remind you of: ""I love the way your shirt brings out the color of your eyes; it's such a contrast.""
Perhaps you love the way her hair frames her facial features: ""Your hair is so soft and silky; it really is a perfect match for your eyes and your lips.""
What if you get tingly inside when she laughs? ""Your giggle is about as cute as it can get. It puts me in such a great mood.""
Finally, maybe say something about her generosity. Many women are naturally born to be motherly and nurturing; if you say something about her kindness or generosity, it should hit home: ""You've taught me what it means to be kind and what it feels to be looked after. I hope I can do the same for you.""

, Giving a girl the right compliment when she expects it is great, but giving her the right compliment when it's unexpected is even better. Pick a time when you two are together to think about what you love/respect/admire about her and let her know out of the blue.


When she's not expecting it, wrap your arm around her, squeeze her gently, kiss her cheek, neck, or forehead, and tell her something heartfelt about how she makes you feel. Look her in the eyes when you deliver the compliment. She'll melt like an ice-cube in an inferno.
Tell her that she's your first priority and that you would do whatever it takes to keep her happy when she needs it. Don't just say it; be prepared to do it! Girls won't respect you if you say one thing and do another.
Send her text messages like or call her unexpectedly. This will let her know that she is on your mind. Spread it out so that each call or text is a heart-warming surprise, not so much that she comes to expect it. Texts you can send her out of the blue:

""I miss you; was just thinking about you...""
""You really got me loving what we have together.""
""Just stopping by to say 'Hi.' I wish I could be kissing you right now.""



, Spend time with her at the park, come with her when she goes shopping, take her to the beach....There are lots of places you can take her to make her feel comfortable and loved.


Do fun and exciting things together. This has two benefits: First, it will show her that you want her to be involved in your life's journeys; second, the adventure will help you bond together by releasing a chemical (called 'oxytocin') that's responsible for feelings of love.

Show that you care by taking part in the things that she loves doing. Going to see a chick flick, even if you think it will be boring, will tell her that you care about her needs, and not just your own. Even if you don't enjoy doing it, try to make it look like you're into it. It's best to be honest that you do not enjoy the movie but you are still willing to watch it with her to show you will be there for her; she'll appreciate the effort and love you've shown her.
If she wants to go clothes shopping, ask her if she would like to have you join her! If she lets you, help her find something to suit her best! Girls tend to have a hard time picking clothes to go with. Whether she's looking for a dress for fancy outings or nice weather, a swimsuit to go swimming in or for the beach, shorts or a skirt for casual wear, or anything else, assist her in finding something that you think fits her well, whether it blends with other pieces or if it reminds her of something that she likes. For example, ""Of the dresses here, I think this yellow one fits you perfectly, because yellow is your favorite color and it goes along well with this sunhat."" Or ""I think this light blue bikini makes a great fit for you, as it's the same color as the bright skies, which I know makes you happy."" It can serve for something for her to remember you by as well since you helped her pick it out.
For that matter, even if you might not be wild about her wearing revealing clothing such as short shorts, skirts, or midriff baring tops, it's best you go along with it. This goes back to the bit on telling her that you care about what she wants. She might also like wearing them because she feels proud of her body and isn't afraid to show herself off.

, Do not save affection for only private moments; show the rest of the world how you feel about her. She'll feel like she makes you a lucky guy, which you are. Kiss her cheek or massage her hand when you are in public. Hold her close when introducing her to one of you friends.


If she uses social media a lot, show your relationship publicly through social media. Post photos of the two of you, tag her at places, change your relationship status. Show her you are publicly committed to the relationship and that you are proud to show her off. However, if she is a very private person, this may make her uncomfortable.
Don't be afraid to introduce her as your girlfriend if she is. She might be a little put off if you just introduce her using her name. If you haven't made it clear whether you two are boyfriend and girlfriend, stick to introducing her by name.
Don't let go of her hand when another boy or girl walks by. She'll think that you're embarrassed to be with her, or that you're trying to impress another girl. If you're holding hands, wait for a good moment to break contact. When another girl is around, make sure your girl feels as if she's the only one.
For her birthday or your anniversary, do something nice for her in public. Get or bake a cake for her birthday, or give her a card for your anniversary. Do one public thing for her and one private.

, Digging deeper and getting to know her likes and dislikes is a huge step in making her feel special. Lots of guys never bother to get really close to a girl because they're only interested in having a physical relationship. Don't be the guy who doesn't know very much about his girlfriend or forgets what she likes and dislikes.


Ask her about her hobbies and find out what she's passionate about. Everyone is passionate about something, even if it's buried deep down inside. Find out what she loves to do more than anything else. Figure out what she likes about it. Try to understand it and be interested in it.
Ask lots of questions. Ask her about her childhood, her parents and siblings, her goals, her fears and desires, along with her likes and dislikes. The more you know about her, the better you can comfort her when she's down, inspire her when she's stuck, or calm her when she's stressed.
Practice listening. Don't tune her out. No matter what she has to say, listen, analyze with her, and offer an informed opinion if you have one. If you don't have an opinion, you can tell her that, saying that you're there for her when she needs to think things through.

, On occasion, she may cause you to think What am I doing, this is crazy?! This is definitely not normal. Well, you're getting used to a new normal, and it's going to force you to be patient. She'll thank you for it.


If she is late or forgets something, wait patiently for her. Try to be understanding. Don't make her feel guilty, especially if the first word she says is ""Sorry."" Who knows — one day, the tables could be turned and she might be waiting for you.
Let her win the argument. Sometimes, it's best to just let her win the argument. Stand up for yourself and what you believe in, but learn when to back down and let her win. You'll get more in the long run.
Listen to her criticisms. No one wants to feel criticized, but you're going to have to compromise if you want to succeed in relationships. So take what she says to heart, try to change whatever is fixable, and show her that you're in it for the long run.

, If your princess turns into a damsel in distress, you're going to need to be by her side during her time of need. Whether it's a sliver in her toe, a schoolyard bully, or a serious illness in the family, stick by her side to show her that one of your biggest goals is making sure she's safe and secure.


If she's sad, ask her how you can make it better. Don't just sit there and say ""I'm sorry,"" staring blankly at the wall. Girls want guys who can make them happy when they are down, who can cheer them up with a little bit of humor when the going gets tough. Try your best to liven up her spirits.
Stand up for her when she needs it. If she gets insulted, called ugly, or otherwise threatened, be there to protect her. Tell the offender that you'd never let her sit there and take negative remarks like that. Don't start a fight, but don't let other people push you or your girlfriend around.
No matter what is happening in your lives, be by her side. Comfort her that you are there to support her in every moment. Girls want the security of knowing that if something does happen, she won't have to worry about you jumping ship. Reassure her you're there to stay.

, You may not think you're the romantic type, but you should know a little bit about how to be romantic if you want to go the extra mile. Romance, for girls, should be like the movies: Everything should be slightly over the top (but not cheesy), a reminder of the effort that you'll go to in order to make her feel special.


Find out what her favorite flower is and send her a bunch. If you're at the grocery store together, ask her casually what kind of flowers look good, and then take note. Remember that different flowers ""mean"" different things: While red roses mean love and romance, white roses mean friendship.
Surprise her with a date. The mere fact that you went out of your way to arrange a surprise date is often enough. Your date doesn't have to be elaborate. Tell her to meet you somewhere or pick her up yourself. Pretend you're doing something boring, like chores, and then surprise her with the date — like a movie, a cooking class, a picnic somewhere remote. She might jump into your arms or look you lovingly in the eyes.
Make something for her. It's a good idea to give her signs of your love, like cards, or jewelry, or flowers. But what if you want to take your signs of affection to the next level? You should definitely make her something with your own hands. The more personal it is, and the more energy you put into it, the better.

Make her a relationship journal. Buy a nice, blank journal. Write about when you first met her, all the first dates, and how she made you feel. Include pictures and other mementos, like movie stubs. Tell her that you want to take turns writing in the journal.
Make her a collage of all the mementos you saved from the relationship. Save brochures, tickets, stubs, receipts, and pictures that mean something to both of you. Tape or glue them to a nice poster board and give it to her.
Make her a video of yourself. It doesn't need to be fancy — a Facebook video will do. Tell her how she makes you feel; what you love about her; what you were thinking when you first met her. Set all of this to music and send it to her.
Do something for her parents. Maybe her mom needs help organizing a silent auction. Volunteer to be a busboy, or help out with ticket sales. Your girlfriend will be overjoyed that you're getting to know her family and you'd do something selfless for them.



, Going the extra mile doesn't have to mean some grand, romantic gesture we see in the movies or hear about in stories. Often, the really small things mean just as much, provided you do them with feeling.



Sing romantic songs to her, even if your voice is horrible. Have a song that's yours. Even if you butcher it, the singing can be an opportunity for both of you to laugh. It's sure to be a win-win situation regardless!
Take lots of pictures with her. She'll find it heartwarming to look at you standing next to her with the both of you smiling. It also makes for a nice keepsake to make her know you'll remember her and the fun you shared. And don't be afraid to kiss her on her cheek or forehead for a picture! She might find that even more touching to look back on.
Find ways to send or leave little notes and symbols of endearment that will remind her of fun times you have shared together. A simple, handwritten note goes a long way.

, It's the easiest thing to say and the hardest thing to do, but it's true: Love her for who she is, despite her failures, because she loves you in the same way too.


Forgive her. So she makes a mistake? So what? Everyone makes mistakes, but it's the way they bounce back from their mistakes that show you who they really are. If she apologizes, is honest and genuinely sorry, try to forgive her. Chances are she'll go the same for you.

Respect her. Don't talk down to her, manipulate her, or say bad things when she isn't around. Treat her like a gentleman should treat a lady. Be respectful of her time, her effort, her beliefs. You'll earn her trust very quickly.
Get along with her friends, even if you don't like them. Her friends play an important part in her life; she wants them to get along with you, and you to get along with them.
Make an effort with her family. Her family is most likely the core of her happiness. If she has a great relationship with her family, try to respectfully become a part of that community when they let you in.

Work on the relationship each day.,
Know when to spend time apart.,
Have mutual interests.,
Learn what she likes during intimacy.",How to Maintain Your Relationship with Your Girlfriend1," It’s usually the little things that show your partner you appreciate her. Attempt to do something each day that shows her you care. Making dinner, leaving a nice note, buying flowers, or telling her you appreciate what she does will make her feel special and show that you really appreciate it.


Going to a couple’s counselor or workshop once a year or so is also a good way to keep your relationship healthy. You may not think you need it, but you may be surprised how much closer it brings you. Additionally, reading a relationship book together can also help you to maintain your relationship.;
, The saying “absence makes the heart grow fonder” is true, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. Having a day or two to yourself each week helps you to better appreciate one another, and gives you a chance to miss each other. It also gives you an opportunity to reconnect with yourself and become a better partner.


A good rule of thumb for alone time is to take a day for yourself between every couple of days you spend together., Nothing forges a stronger bond between you and your partner like shared passions. If you spend your leisure time always doing separate activities, your relationship may suffer. Even if you and your girlfriend are like night and day, try to find at least one interest that connects you and do it together often.


Try to plan a standing weekly date with your girlfriend doing something you both enjoy. Of course, this may translate to binge-watching House of Cards on Netflix. If that works for you, that's cool. But try to do something outside the house sometimes, if possible.
For instance, you might work out together in the gym, go for a hike on weekends, visit local art galleries or museums, read the same book, or join a couple’s social group., A physical connection is huge in relationships. So is taking the time to learn each other’s likes and dislikes when it comes to being intimate. Paying attention and trying to please her shows that you care and want to make her happy.Notice what your girlfriend responds to and do more of that. You might also ask, “What kinds of things turn you on?” or something of that nature.
Establish enthusiastic consent with your girlfriend by asking ""Do you like that?"" or ""Is this okay?"" If she responds favorably, keep it coming. If she says no, or seems ambivalent, stop.
Have an attitude of acceptance and communication when it comes to sexual activity. Openly share what you like and don't like, and encourage her to do the same.

Talk to each other whenever you can.,
Plan on spending time with each other at least once a week.,
Value your time together.",How to Maintain a Relationship over the Summer," Communication is the key to any relationship, and it's no different during the summer. Talk to him or her about once a day (maybe more, maybe less, depending on your regular routine) to make sure that you stay as close as possible.


Call, email, or instant message; just stay in touch. It doesn't really matter what method you use as long as you consistently share things and stay on the same page.






Talk about what's going on your life. This will help the other person feel like they're a part of your life, even if you don't get to see them every day. Talk about what you did that day and what you are going to do the next time you see each other. Talk about friends, family, the past and upcoming school year, and be sure to ask a lot of questions if you want to keep the conversation going.






If you're feeling romantic, write a letter. A letter takes more time and energy to write than an email or text, so it's a sign that you're willing to put in that extra energy for that person. Letters don't have to be long to be effective. Share an interesting thing that happened to you, or just talk about how the other person makes you feel. You'll be sure to get a lot of points for a well-written letter.





;
, It's important to maintain a physical relationship with one another if possible, so decide on what you want to do together and do it. The more you see each other in the flesh, the better.


Beach or water activities scream summer. When you think about long, hot summer days, you think about...the beach! Share the beach or the pool with your boyfriend or girlfriend. If you're not comfortable being completely alone yet, invite your friends along for the ride. Anytime you can see that special someone in a bathing suit, that's a plus.






Movies are also popular during the summer, so take advantage of them. Go see a matinee on the cheap, and be choosy about the movie you watch: action, comedy, and horror are the best date movies, but decide on a movie you both want to watch so that neither of you falls asleep or has a bad time. If your city has an outdoor movie theatre or drive-in, definitely take advantage of it!






If you plan on going over to his or her house, be respectful of the house rules, and most importantly, the parents. Remember, if the parents like you, you'll probably get invited over more often. If the parents dislike you, you probably won't get invited over, and there might even be pressure to end the relationship. If you're a guy, say ""ma'am"" and ""sir,"" even if it sounds weird, clean up after yourself, offer to help with any chores, and be nice to any siblings. Getting the parents on your side will help you see your boyfriend or girlfriend that much more during the summer.







, You're in this relationship for a reason: the other person makes you feel good, makes you want to be a better person, makes you happy to be alive. Well, act like it! Be happy when you're with your significant other, and take advantage of every second you have.


Tell your significant other how they make you feel. It doesn't need to be cheesy. Just be honest, and listen to your emotions. Something as simple as ""I'm lucky to have you,"" or ""I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but with you"" gives them a little bit of feedback about how you feel and opens the door to being more intimate with one another.






Celebrate important dates or anniversaries. If you've been together for a while, celebrate that three-month anniversary when it comes up. It'll tell the other person you paid attention, and will signal that you're happy to still be together. It doesn't need to be anything fancy, as long as the other person knows why you're doing it.






Don't be afraid to go out on a limb. So she's never gone to a concert before, or he's never been to the zoo. Well, the summer is the perfect opportunity to go out on a limb and do things you've never done before. Doing fun, exciting, adventurous things will help strengthen your bond together. If you need a parent to go along with you, don't worry about it; it can still be fun if you have the right mindset.

Talk about what you need.,
Know when to listen.,
Give your support.,
Avoid using hurtful words.",How to Maintain Your Relationship with Your Girlfriend2," You may be afraid to vocalize what you want from your girlfriend. As a result, you can become resentful when she doesn’t fulfill your needs. Take the guesswork out by simply talking to her about your desires and encourage her to do the same.


State your needs using non-defensive ""I"" statements, like ""I need you to trust me. I feel like you don't respect my privacy. I would appreciate it if you didn't go through my phone."", Especially in arguments, it’s important to listen to what your girlfriend has to say. Let her speak her mind before you jump in. Showing this type of respect is important in a relationship, and shows her you care about how she thinks and feels.


This isn’t to say you shouldn’t defend yourself. But allow her to get her feelings off of her chest before you state your point. Your sign of respect might encourage her to do the same for you., Blunt is best when it comes to sharing how you feel about your girlfriend. Let her know that you are very happy to be her partner. Tell her daily how much she means to you and don’t forget to compliment her.


Encourage her to reach her dreams and do what you can to support her while she is. Applaud her successes, and bolster her confidence when she is struggling.
Be present at important events and occasions to cheer her on., Try not to say something hurtful that you will regret. It may be difficult for you not to, especially when you are extremely angry. Just remember, fighting is normal and healthy in relationships. Name-calling and using degrading words, however, are not.


Walk away from the argument if you feel you are about to say something hurtful. Simply tell her you need to take a break for a moment and go cool down. Doing so could help to keep your relationship intact."
"
Realize that you can’t change her, and you shouldn’t want to.,
Examine your expectations.,
Ask yourself if the compromises are fair.",How to Maintain Your Relationship with Your Girlfriend3," You are with your girlfriend because your list of “likes” about her is longer than your list of “dislikes.” If you want to make the relationship work, however, you’ll need to accept those dislikes. This could mean a lot of compromise on your part.


However, this doesn’t mean you should let go of your non-negotiables. Simply try to come up with an agreement that you can both live with. For instance, she may have her nose in her smart phone all night while you just want to spend quality time. Suggest that you set a designated time aside—for instance, one hour—where you both turn off your phones., You may have gone into the relationship thinking it was going to be your way or the highway. Or, you may have had other unrealistic expectations of how things were going to be. You’ll need to assess which is more important: trying to obtain these potentially far-fetched ideals, or compromising to something that works for the both of you., Determine if the compromise you are asking of or are asked by your girlfriend is actually fair. Some compromises are more like demands and can ruin a relationship. If you believe the compromise you are asked to do is unfair, let her know. You shouldn’t have to give up what makes you you, and vice versa.


The only compromises that you should ask of your girlfriend and she should ask of you are ones that make you better and grow as a couple. Compromises that make you feel bad about yourself and negatively affect your life are typically unfair to ask of one another."
"
Embrace her quiet.,
See her shyness as a compliment.,
Take your time building the relationship.,
Plan dates that involve quieter settings.,
Slowly introduce her to your friends and family.,
Expect the shyness to reappear periodically.",How to Have a Relationship with a Shy Girl1," Shy people are often quiet people, especially in the beginning of a new relationship. Don’t worry if she doesn’t seem bubbly or talkative all the time.Many shy people are also naturally introverted, which means they enjoy quiet in general.
They don’t have to talk, be entertained, or have music blasting in order to enjoy your company. They simply like being with you!;
, Chances are, she REALLY likes you, but shy people often have a hard time expressing those feelings right away.


Being in a relationship can be a big, hard step for a shy or introverted person who usually prefers to be alone, so take the quiet and her company as huge compliments!

, Shyness goes away once the shy or introverted person feels more comfortable and open around you. Depending on how much time you spend together, this can take a few weeks or a few months, so just be patient.


The more time you spend together, the faster her shyness will go away and she will have an easier time talking to you.
People who are shy, quiet, or introverted also need alone time and tend to be independent, so be sure to give her space if and when she needs it., Even after she gets to know you and feel more open with you, your shy girl will probably still feel shy in new, busy environments. She probably won’t enjoy a big party every weekend or want to spend the summer at big music festivals with thousands of people in attendance.Try planning several intimate dates that involve just the two of you, like a picnic in a quiet park, a candlelight dinner at home, a trip to a museum, or a walk on a beach.
You don’t always have to skip out on crowded, action-packed events, just try not to overwhelm her with them all the time.

, If you really like this girl, there’s a good chance you’ll want to introduce her to your loved ones as quickly as possible, and they’ll be anxious to meet her, too. However, for a shy person, meeting family and friends can be scary.She’ll have a much easier time with your family and friends once she’s had plenty of time to spend with just you.
When the time is right, introduce her to your family and friends in small doses. Begin with a quiet dinner with your parents. Then maybe a beach day with one or two of your closest friends. Expand from there.
Shy people struggle less in social environments when there are less people to focus on at any given time.
If you feel unsure about timing, just ask her directly if she feels ready to start meeting your loved ones.

, As your relationship progresses and you reach big milestones, like moving in together, getting engaged, or even getting married, she may get shy all over again because the situation will feel new to her.For example, if you’ve just moved in together, she might close the bathroom door to shower or brush her teeth, she might listen to music through her headphones, or go outside to talk to her mom.
This shyness will only last while she adjusts to the new situation. It won’t last forever.
Don’t take her renewed shyness personally. Moving forward with you means she’s committed.

, This is a great way to enjoy time with your partner without having to worry about misdirected aggression or disappointment.Put a fresh spin on a date you've had before, or try something entirely new. Some activities you can do together:


Laser tag. Join your partner on same team and beat your opponents.
Dance class. You don't have to only tap your feet when you hear a catchy beat. A dance class is a great place to learn some moves with your partner.
Ghost tour. Find a spooky and exciting ghost tour through a ""haunted"" location. Make sure your partner doesn't mind being scared before you go.
Shared art. Take turns with your partner drawing or working in another medium, like painting a picture or molding pottery. Why not have fun while you make a memento of your great day?

Cooking class. Even a novice in the kitchen can benefit from a little cooking savvy. You can take recipes from this class and make them together with your partner in the future.
Dinner theater. These frequently interactive murder-mystery dinner shows can add a dash of excitement to your mealtime plans.

Scavenger hunt. You can make your own, no problem, but if you're excited to explore a new place with your partner, you might want to try geocaching.
Fort building. Pillows are the perfect building block for a palace worthy of your partner. Follow up with dinner on the inside and enjoy your secluded hideout.
Local safari. Come up with a route for you and your partner to travel and a list of ""game"" you can find along the way. Use your cell phones and take pictures of the ""game"" on your list. You might choose animals, features of your city, or even vehicles. Choose the ones you like best after.

Example safari list: blue jay, maple tree, statue of a man with a book, local art museum, restaurant you want/don't want to visit, yellow flower, purebred dog, stained glass, cat in a window



, Awe-inspiring activities can enhance your relationship, inspire creativity, and help you be more appreciative of your partner.Some date ideas that might inspire awe in you and your partner are:

Bungee jumping
Volunteering at a community garden
Cloud watching
Visiting a local natural feature, like a waterfall, mountain, or large body of water

Stop at a park for a pre-arranged surprise picnic
Get a surprise couples massage before the main even
Take flowers beforehand to your chosen restaurant
Slip a romantic note or card in your partner's book, notebook, backpack, or someplace they will notice before your date

, You might disagree with your partner when they tell you how much they love your black shirt, but this is your chance to show you've been listening.You can choose clothing your partner likes to put them in an extra good mood.


Gifts that you've received from a partner, like a bracelet, fragrance, or charm, will likely be appreciated during the date.
Think about color coordinating. Matching your partner's attire shows that you thought ahead about how you will look together, which can make your partner feel special. Colors also have an effect on mood.Some colors you might want to consider, and their associations, are:

Red: love, romance, warmth, comfort, excitement, intensity
Orange: happy, energetic, enthusiasm, stimulation
Yellow: happiness, laughter, optimism
Green: cool, healthy, harmony, calmness, tranquility
Blue: focused, serene, loyalty, Deadlines and looming projects can create stress and make it difficult for you to have fun during your date.If you can't finish your work ahead of time, plan a work schedule for after your day together. This can help you put your worry on hold, and then you can give your significant other your full attention., There's always the chance that something could go wrong, but with a little effort, you can prevent big problems.If your date requires tickets or takes reservations, calling ahead can save you a wasted trip out. Ask yourself what you might need for your special day ahead of time. Some important questions to keep in mind might be:


Do I have enough money?
Do I have transportation?
Is today a holiday?
Is today our anniversary or my partner's birthday?

, Focus is a way you can indicate to your partner that they are a priority.When you check your phone frequently you can accidentally make your partner feel unimportant.


Turn your phone to silent while on your date.
Let your friends know ahead of time that you have plans and will be unavailable.

, It's important to respect your partner's limits. If your significant other doesn't like public displays of affection, you might want want to save embraces and hand-holding for behind closed doors. But even a 20 second hug encourages bonding, trust, and generosity between you and your partner.Exchanging massages has the same effect.Take a class together on couples' massage and learn how to help each other relax.

, You can signal trust in your partner and have deeper impacting conversations by being vulnerable.It can be easy for you and your partner to fall into routine conversation. If you feel uncomfortable being vulnerable, try starting by sharing something small, like confessing a movie that's a guilty pleasure or a dessert you can't turn down.


Make it a point to ask questions to show you're engaged.
Paraphrase what your partner says in your own words to help remember what is said and gain a more complete understanding., Even if you lose your ticket to the show, you can still have a good time with your partner. When things go wrong, accept that sometimes these things happen and remind yourself this is your special day to share with each other.An attitude of acceptance can make it easier for you to overcome negative situations."
"
Have honest and open conversations.,
Practice active listening.,
Pay attention to the nonverbal communication you both share.,
Don't get personal when you get angry.,
Don't yell or scream when you have fights.,
Follow other fair fighting rules.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Girlfriend1," Talking to your girlfriend face-to-face is an excellent way to gain a better understanding of her. Sometimes you can't pick up on things like voice intonation or sarcasm through text message, and you can't look at her body language when you're talking to her over the phone. Set some time aside to speak with her openly and honestly about anything. It could be small-talk about how your day went, or it can be deeper and more meaningful conversations about what makes you both happy.You can start the conversation by saying something like, ""Hey I wanted to talk to you about where we are going in the relationship. Do you have time right now?""
Talking about things that you feel vulnerable about will encourage your girlfriend to do the same. This can bring you both closer together.For example, you could talk about your first childhood memories, a favorite family traditions, worst fears, or lifelong dreams.;
, Active listening engages both people deeper in a conversation and will make your girlfriend appreciate you more. To practice active listening, concentrate on what she is saying without interrupting. Do not judge her or criticize her if she tells you something embarrassing, because it could prevent her from telling you things in the future. Paraphrase things that she says and ask specific questions about what she is talking about. Try to give advice that helps her and is in her best interests if she seems like she wants it.To paraphrase, say something like ""So what you're saying is that she was acting immature.""
Sometimes people just want someone to talk to and not to receive advice or judgment. Wait for her to ask you for your opinion before trying to help.

, Talking to someone is not the only form of communication that exists in a relationship. Nonverbal communication is also incredibly important. If you pay attention to your girlfriend's body language, you'll be able to determine how they feel at the moment. Crossed arms may mean they feel defensive or closed off and may mean that they aren't interested in what you have to say, or the subject matter is hard to talk about.Once you can evaluate your girlfriend's body language, you can notice when she's feeling uncomfortable or angry.
If your girlfriend doesn't say anything, but she's exhibiting negative body language, ask her if something is wrong.
Make sure that you aren't giving off any negative signals with the way your body is positioned.

, There's a tendency for some people to bring up negative times from the past or to intentionally hurt their girlfriend's feelings during an argument. Stay on track when you're communicating with your girlfriend and avoid being critical of things that have already happened. Do not intentionally hurt their feelings because it can create a negative atmosphere for the relationship and it can become emotionally abusive.


Work on deescalating conflict within your relationship before it gets out of hand or jumps to a different, unrelated issue.

, Managing your anger during a disagreement or argument is an important part of maintaining a healthy relationship. Avoid escalating confrontations and avoid yelling at her. When people are aggressive, they tend to get defensive responses from their significant others. If your girlfriend is the one yelling or screaming, do not match her energy. Keep your voice civil and try to bring the conversation down. Escalating the anger during a disagreement could make a conversation spiral out of control and can damage the relationship over the long run.


When someone shouts or screams at you, your limbic system is engaged and will affect your amygdala which houses emotional responses in your brain.When you notice yourself beginning to get angry, take a break from the conversation and walk away.
You can say something like ""I'm super angry right now, and I just need to get some fresh air. I'm going to take a walk and then we can talk about this when I get home.""

, Sometimes a fight is unavoidable. When this happens, then best thing to do is to engage in the argument in a civil manner. Along with not yelling or screaming at each other, some things to avoid to ensure a fair fight include:Degrading language or name calling.
Casting blame.
Using physical force.
Threatening divorce.
Making assumptions or judgments about your spouse.
Bringing up past issues or piling on lots of complaints at once.
Interrupting your partner or talking over them.

"
Encourage her to be herself around you.,
Explore her interests with her.,
Ask her what she’s thinking and feeling, and ask her often.,
Learn her preferred methods of communication.",How to Have a Relationship with a Shy Girl2," Shy people can be hard to get to know, especially in the beginning. Introverts value their privacy and don’t always realize just how private and shy they come across. Assure her that you admire who she is and want to get to know her at her own pace.


Stating this out loud will make her directly aware of your desire to get to know her, which will give her the assurance and encouragement she needs to open up to you.

, One of the best ways to get to know a shy or introverted person is spending time with them in their own environment because they feel most at ease there.


If she rides horses, ask if you join her at the barn one day. If she loves books, take her to a bookstore and go browsing together. If she enjoys hiking, ask her to take you on her favorite trail.
Being in a familiar environment with someone new helps shy people feel more comfortable socializing, opening up, and showing off their private side.
Experiencing her interests and hobbies with her also helps you get to know more about her and her life better without her having to try to talk or explain it, which can be hard for a shy or introverted person to do., Sometimes shy or introverted people need time to process thoughts, feelings, and events. Always allow her the time to think and process, but don’t be afraid to ask her what she thinks or feels if she leaves you confused or wondering.


Shy people often have trouble speaking up or initiating a conversation when it comes to stating their thoughts or feelings. By asking directly about them, you give her an easy way to open up.

, Shy and introverted people often prefer to communicate by text, social media messaging, or email in between dates because it’s less obtrusive and direct. Phone calls, Facetime, Skype, and unexpected visits can be really hard for them to engage in, at least in the beginning.You can ask if she has a way of communication that works best for her or try a few different ways on your own and see what puts her most at ease.
Try sending letters to each other for an old fashioned, romantic twist on communication.

Establish trust in the relationship.,
Be yourself.,
Talk as much as you please.,
Share your feelings without adding pressure for reciprocation.,
Expose her to your hobbies and interests over time.,
Explore new environments together.",How to Have a Relationship with a Shy Girl3," Help your shy girl feel secure by letting her know you are serious about a relationship and will be loyal to her. Contrary to what most people think, shyness usually isn't due to a lack of confidence. Many shy people and introverts are quite independent, and they will steer clear of superficial or fickle relationships to maximize their alone time.If a shy or introverted girl knows she can trust you, she will be more inclined to pursue a relationship with you. The sooner you make your intentions about the relationship known, the more comfortable and secure you will make her feel.
If you can promise her a genuine, meaningful, honest relationship, she will want to put forth the time, effort, and attention in getting to know you and nurturing your bond together.

, Just because she is quiet and shy, it doesn’t mean you have to be. Even if she doesn’t verbally express it, she is just as excited to get to know you as you are to get to know her. Don’t feel like you have to hold back or match her quiet or shy demeanor.Shy and introverted people are highly observant and sensitive (in a good way), so the more open you are with her, the easier time she’ll have getting to know you and shaking off her shyness.

, Don’t be afraid of the quiet, but if you feel like talking, talk as much as you like. Shy and introverted people appreciate someone else carrying the conversation when they don’t have as much to say. Plus, they are great listeners, so never hesitate to share what’s on your mind., Even though it can be hard for shy or introverted people to share their feelings in the beginning, it doesn’t mean that you can’t share yours.


In fact, knowing how you feel first will help her sort out her thoughts and feelings faster and help her communicate better, when she’s ready.
Just be sure to express your feelings without expecting her to immediately respond. This can be a hard thing to do, but she’ll appreciate you for it.

, If you enjoy rock concerts or weekly happy hour with your workmates at the bar down the street, don’t opt out just because you know her to be shy or introverted. Even though she’s shy, it doesn’t mean she won’t want to try to experience your world, so always feel free to invite her to social events and be there by her side when she accepts.
She’ll have an easier time getting used to a new environment and adapting to your world if you stick close to her, show her the ropes, and offer support if she needs it.

, If you’ve always wanted to skydive or take a road trip across the United States, take her with you and share the new experience together.Shy and introverted people appreciate intense one-on-one time with the people they care about, and new experiences free of old distractions and acquaintances will help you both bond and learn more about each other.

Do kind things for her.,
Compliment her.,
Work as a team.,
Love and care for yourself.,
Gain her trust by being honest.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Girlfriend2," There's a difference between going outside of your means to provide gifts because you think that's what is expected, and doing kind things because you want to make your girlfriend happy. Doing nice things for your girlfriend doesn't always entail buying things either. It could be something as simple as taking out the trash for her, cleaning the dishes, or picking a flower on the side of the street to bring home for her. Keep her in mind as you go about your day and think of ways to make her have a happier and easier day.


If you have limited money, don't make purchases for her and stress yourself out. Instead, think of free ways that you can show your appreciation.
Some things you can do include, buying her flowers, cleaning her house, getting her tickets to a show she wanted to see, or sending her a nice text message.

, While you don't need to constantly shower her with compliments, giving her at least one a day can make her feel better throughout the day. Make sure that the compliment is genuine and that you really mean it. Take time to notice different things like the outfit she picked out, the way she does her makeup or an accessory that she's picked out. Compliments also don't have to be purely physical. You can also compliment her on progress at her job, getting good grades at school, or if you've noticed personal growth.


You can say something like, ""I really like the way you did your hair today.""
To compliment her growth you can say something like, ""I noticed that physics doesn't seem hard for you anymore. It's really awesome you've been able to improve this much.""

, It's okay to want to win. However, relationships are more about working with one another on a team rather than competing against one another. Think of your success as joint success and use it to motivate one another to reach your true potential. Instead of thinking of how you will personally benefit, think about how it will affect both of your lives as a whole.While self-preservation and advancement are important to many people, realize that you're uncaring and unkind when you do things that will hurt the other person and benefit yourself.
Motivate your girlfriend to do great things. Do not try to stifle her or prevent her from achieving her goals.
Working as a team takes two people. If your girlfriend is unable to care about your dreams and aspirations, it may be time to find a new girlfriend.

, Before you can be in a strong and meaningful relationship with your girlfriend, you need to make sure that you are taking care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat correctly, and take time for yourself. If you find yourself feeling resentful, overextended, or defensive, there's a good chance that you aren't taking care of yourself as much as you should. Take a step back and don't be afraid to say no to your girlfriend. If she truly cares about you, then she will understand that you are overwhelmed and need time to take care of yourself.


If you routinely take care of other people's needs above your own, you may be exhibiting codependent behavior.You can say something like, ""I really like you and think you're wonderful, but I need time to get my business straight. It's been a while since I've taken time out for myself so I just need to get some things done for myself right now.""

, Do not agree to things that you know won't happen or don't have a good likelihood of happening. Broken promises can severely hurt a relationship. More severe actions like being unfaithful can end a relationship, while other things like white lies could severely strain one. To avoid this, be honest and upfront, even if you think it will make you look bad.For instance, if you are going to be late, give her a call and let her know what is holding you up.
If you did something you aren't proud of or feel a certain way, it's best to let your girlfriend know sooner rather than later.
If she doesn't trust you for previous actions, make a concerted effort to show her that it was a mistake and that you've changed.

"
"
Be willing to compromise.,
Be the emotional support that she needs.,
Acknowledge and talk about the tough times.,
See a relationship counselor if your relationship needs help.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Girlfriend3," Being hard headed and stuck in your ways can jeopardize the happiness in a relationship. Instead of sticking to your guns, be willing to hear the other person out. Think of what they are asking you to do and whether it will have a negative or positive influence on your life. Many times our partners just want what's best for us, so getting mad at them for wanting something to change for the better is not the right way to feel.There are certain things that you shouldn't compromise on, like your physical or emotional needs.Do not compromise your moral values for your girlfriend or you may end up resenting her.
Work on compromise as a team so that you both can be happy.

, When a situation is difficult, it's likely that your girlfriend is going to need more emotional support than she normally does. When she does need help or support, make sure that you are the person that's there for her. Instead of getting angry at her and making her feel even worse, make sure that you're supportive and understanding. Make sure that you offer to listen to her, and do not judge her. Try to make her feel better throughout the day by doing kind things.If your girlfriend has done something that you don't approve of, instead of berating or criticizing her, try to understand why she did it in the first place.
Supporting her does not mean enabling her to do self-destructive behavior.

, The first step in getting through the tough times is acknowledging that they exist. Do not ignore or minimize serious issues in your relationship if they are there. Sit down and have a hard conversation with your girlfriend about how things have been and your willingness to work on them.You may not like to talk about emotions, but it's important that you do for the good of the relationship.
You can say something like, ""I've noticed that ever since your Granny died that you've been pretty depressed. I'll always be here to talk, just let me know if you want to.""
If you've been open, honest, and nonjudgmental, there's a good likelihood that you'll be the first person that your girlfriend will turn to when things get tough.
Even if you think something is insignificant, remember to try to understand your girlfriend's perspective.

, If your relationship has reached the point where you both can't get along, it may be time to seek professional assistance. Relationship counselors will be able to look at your relationship objectively and give you the tools and techniques that are required to rebuild it. Search online for psychologists or therapists that specialize in relationships and give them a call to make an appointment.If you think the relationship is worth saving, you may need to go to counseling to break down emotional and social barriers.
Before you see a counselor, try being a nicer, more loving and open partner.

Buy the right bra.,
Find a sexy swimsuit.,
Stuff your bra.,
Dress for your body type.,
Use make-up.",How to Enlarge Breasts1," Your bra is one of the most important items you wear each day. It can make the rest of your outfit look stunning, or ill-fitting. The reason a bra is called a ""foundation garment"" is that it creates the base for your outfit. Make sure you choose the bra that is right for you. Try several different styles, and pay attention to cup size and rib cage measurement. Wearing a properly fitting bra can make your chest look fantastic--and larger!Consult an expert. The best way to find your best fit is to have a proper bra fitting. You can go to any large department store or specialty lingerie boutique to have this done. The fitter will take your measurements and make recommendations. Don't be afraid to ask to try several different styles!
Maintain your undergarments. Take care of your bras, and they will take care of you. When the straps lose their elasticity or the hooks start bending, it is time to replace that bra.;
, Buying swimwear is a dreaded activity for many women. Even though it's not fun, it is important. The right swimsuit can mean the difference between your breasts looking flat or fantastic. Swimsuit shopping is usually best done in person, and you should try many different styles. To make sure your breasts are enhanced, choose a suit that offers support and even some padding.Choose a halter top for an extra lift. These versatile swimsuits are usually adjustable, so you can tighten to your liking. This can give you the flattering boost you are looking for.
Another option is to look for a swimsuit that has ruffles on the top. This can help to make your breasts look larger.

, This is a tried and true method for a lot of women. It can be effective for everyone from pre-teens to adults. An easy method is to wear a double-bra. It works just like it sounds--layer one strapless bra over a strapped one. It's easy, and the results are very effective. You can also choose to just wear one bra, and stuff it to create the illusion of fullness. Your best bet? Socks. They are versatile, and every woman already owns some.


You can experiment with materials other than socks. Just make sure to use common sense. For instance, you'll want to stay away from tissue or toilet paper. When you sweat, that material could become very messy very quickly.You can also wear a padded pushup bra. There are bras available that will make your breasts appear a full cup size larger.

, Understanding your body type can help you choose clothes that will flatter your body, including your chest. Many women looking to make their breasts appear larger are known as ""rectangles"". This means that you are pretty straight up and down, and don't have as many curves (top and bottom) as women with other body types. If you fit into this category, you will want to adhere to certain style guidelines.Make sure to stick to items that are structured at the top, which will provide added definition to your chest.
Feminine tops are also a great idea. Embellishments like ruffles can give the illusion of more curves.

, Cosmetics are an excellent way to create the illusion of larger cleavage. Try applying a bronzing powder between your breasts and a lighter powder on the tops. Check the mirror to see if you like the results. Adjust as necessary, experimenting with blending and more or less make-up."

Don't be predictable or treat your girl as predictable, but read her emotions and make nice surprises.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend Happy," Open doors for her, offer her your jacket, pull her chair out for her and stand up when she enters the room. She'll love these little gestures. When you take her on dates, never make her pay or split the bill. Girls love it when a guy takes care of the dinner bill like it's no big deal. But don't force her to be helped if she doesn't like it.;
, Tell her she is beautiful, especially when she least expects it. Girls can spend a lot of effort trying to look nice, and it will make her happy that you noticed.


Make your compliments meaningful and truthful. Instead of ""Your hair is pretty,"" try ""I really like the way you did your hair tonight! It looks so soft and beautiful."" Use different expressions, that show that you are thoughtful.
Don't be ashamed to compliment her or show her affection in front of others. Real men aren't ashamed to show the world they've found a good woman, and your girl will love you for that. People talk publicly about the things they value. She will instantly feel like a priority if you are confident enough to show the world how you feel about her. Hold her hand in the mall or throw your arm around her at the movies, whenever she feels comfortable with it. Make a hint or ask her if you have doubts.

, After you've been together for a while, you can easily fall into a pattern of forgetting to make her feel special. Some guys also deliberately ignore their girlfriends as a way of getting back at them or as a way of punishing them.


Let her know you're thinking about her. For example, send her a text when you're thinking about her. Just be sure not to text anything you might not want her friends or family to read. Try texting her ""good morning"" with a short encouragement as often as possible. A girl loves to know she's the first thing on her boyfriend's mind when he starts his day.
Never ignore her as a way of being manipulative. You'll hurt her immensely, and if you ignore her often enough, she may dump you. Don't leave her waiting for you to call or talk to her. If you're having a problem, speak up. After an argument, wait for some hours or a day to cool down the heated emotions, that the longing for one another is stronger than the anger, and there is a good chance to make it up. Be ready to ask for forgiveness even if you feel she should do it first, but keep your own integrity too. In an argument, both sides usually cause hurt, and each one has the right to have feelings. If you wait many days, she can feel dumped and cut off her emotions.

, Surprise her with flowers or notes, if she likes such things. Whisk her away for an unplanned romantic dinner, day or weekend.


Take her somewhere new. Many girls will get bored if you take them to the same place time after time (unless it's a special place for the both of you) so mix it up a little. You should enjoy the variety of new places with her because you'll create new conversation topics and memories together.
Make sure you plan anything on a free night/day/weekend when you know she has things to do. Ask her about her schedule in a casual way so that she doesn't know you're planning something. Have a Plan B also, if she cannot be part of your plan in a way that gives her pleasure. E.g. if bathing is involved, you may need to know which part of the month it is for her, or she may reject it.
If you can, surprise her with a love song or a short poem. Or if you find one that really talks about your feelings, send it or a link to it for her to share.

, Unless she specifies that you don't need to call her back, you need to be responsive when your girlfriend calls you. Let her know she's on your mind even though you are not with her in person. Girls can get insecure when ignored. A confident girl is a happy girl, and a happy girl is good to her boyfriend.

, Even a small gift, like her favorite candy bar, goes a long way. Listen when she tells you about things she wants, and surprise her from time to time by getting her something special. But don't try to ""buy her"" with luxury.


Don't buy gifts at the last minute. Invest some time, and put some thought into it. What does she like? Music? Scarves? Delicate bracelets? A special perfume? Does she have any collections? Does she have a wish list somewhere you can buy from? Has she mentioned wanting anything lately? Perhaps you could ask your mom or her best friend for advice. Remembering what she appreciates is more important than the price tag.
Never forget important holidays or anniversaries that matter to both of you. Listen to hints she may be dropping about what she wants. Thoughtful gifts will show her you care. Bring her to the mall and pay attention to what she points out.
Get her something she can wear every day to remind her how much you care about her. A locket with a picture of you inside can be an awesome idea.
If she gets you a gift for a holiday and you don't get her one in return, she's probably going to be bummed (even if she doesn't admit it). If this has happened in the past, make sure it doesn't happen again, and make up for doing it with a few surprise gifts.
A gift can reflect how you regard her, and how much you appreciate her. That you are ready to make sacrifices for her. Also a very personal touch is often appreciated, like if you make a custom design item, doing it yourself if you are talented.
Avoid repeating gifts, unless it has a special significance, like on a day of remembrance. Also, if she finds out that you gave the same thing to another girlfriend, she can dislike the gift.

, Use humor in a natural way. You don't have to tell corny jokes at every opportunity unless she likes that sort of thing. Know what kind of humor she likes. When she's upset, try to cheer her up with some humor. If she laughs at something, try to understand and share the laughter. Show that you like her jokes and funny remarks.

, Remember that your girlfriend is not your ""property."" Be mindful of her opinions and desires, even if they differ from your own. Don't make her feel stupid just because she doesn't agree with you about everything. Being with a copy of oneself is very boring, and minor disagreements give better perspective on things in life. One may win a discussion but lose her affection instead.

, A woman that sees that her man cannot keep his word, regards him not safe enough for a serious relationship. If you are hindered to keep a promise, warn about it in time, and make up for it afterwards, so she sees that you are a trustworthy man. A broken promise is often seen as the same as a lie. Asking for forgiveness is better than a lame blaming of circumstances. With time she will feel your real priorities.
Show responsibility with studies, work and money. That signals that you possibly also could take responsibility for a family in the future. An irresponsible man can easily be seen as ridiculous and not a stable partner.

, If you have female friends that you would like your girlfriend to befriend or if you want her to trust you in your friendships with other women, never compliment your female friends' physical attributes.


If you have something positive to say about a female friend, say something about her personality, as in, that she is warm, friendly or creative. Or when it is really obvious: smart, famous, sporty etc. Whatever you do, don't lead in with, ""My friend is coming to town and I really want you to meet her. You'll really like her. She's gorgeous! All of my friends can't keep their eyes off her - when she's around, conversation stops because all the guys just keep staring at her!""
Understand that your girlfriend may be suspicious of your female friends at first. Always uplift your girlfriend so that knows that she is the only one in the world that you have eyes for. Your friendships with your female friends will be accepted much more smoothly if you follow this step. Avoid much contact with female friends that have no stable relationship, but possibly mention that she could be a good partner to someone else. Talk about the female friend mentioning her boyfriend/husband too.

, Major lies will drive a wedge of suspicion and mistrust between you and your girlfriend that you may never be able to fix. You may throw away a whole relationship with just one act of mistrust.


Show her you're trustworthy by your actions. Conversations you have with other women should never border the line of being flirtatious or intimate. She needs to know that she can trust you in speech and conduct even in the little things. If you have a hard time with this one, maybe you aren't ready for a relationship and should instead question why you feel the need to flirt with other women in the first place. Regard other women as humans only, not potential partners.
When you are in a relationship, never tell her that another woman is prettier than she is. If she asks you whether another girl is more attractive than she is, then your default answer should always be a resounding ""NO!""
Never talk about how you find some celebrity really gorgeous. Doing this will only make her feel bad about herself, and she will resent you for it. When you do feel the need to comment on the beauty of someone like Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson, always remind your girlfriend that, in your eyes, she is more attractive.

, Open up to her in a way that you don't do for most people. When you show her that you trust her, she's more likely to trust you back. Keep her secrets when she does the same for you. You can show your girlfriend a side of you that you don't normally share with your buddies. Don't tell others about private things that could upset her if she would find out about it - protect her dignity.

, When you’re in a relationship, make sure that you say so on your Facebook account. Be proud of her so that she'll feel confident in you. Show before your family and good friends that you are serious about her, that she will not fear that you might be seeing other girls.


If someone hits on you online, tell your girlfriend right away. If you keep a secret from her, and if she is already insecure, then hiding your secret will make her insecurity worse.
Avoid communicating with other girls over e-mail, text or social networks without letting your girlfriend know what you're doing. If you're flirting with someone else via text message and your girlfriend discovers your texts, then she's going to be furious. Invite her to take an immediate look at your mailbox if she has doubts. You must make sure even for yourself that you have chosen her, leaving all others girls aside, or she will probably feel it.

, If someone is teasing her, take her side. Girls need to know that their men have their backs at all times, it is an age-old need. How would you feel if she took her friends' or your friends' side over yours? Let her know she can depend on you to stick up for her. In the long run, it is often the man needing the most support in life, so it is wise to show your readiness to ""take any bullet for her"". A man's bright career is easily ruined if his woman doesn't support him.

, If her friends and family don't like you, then they may eventually convince her that you're not good for her. Always act like a gentleman around her friends and family so that they'll encourage her to keep going out with you. You may not like them as much as she does, but you should make an effort to be nice because you care about her. Remember the names and some details about people important to her.

, Never make her feel like you'd rather be with your friends than be with her. At the same time, you need to have friendships with other people besides your girlfriend. Show that you have happiness and a social life also not all depending on her, that you are strong enough to be her support. Just make sure you strike a balance.

, Keep in mind that she could leave you, so you'd better work hard at keeping her happy so that you can keep her as your girlfriend. Make sure that she feels that she loses something great, if she would lose you. If you want to keep her, it's time to start treating her like a gentleman should. Don't expect a great girl to be available again...


Don't put your hobbies, video games, YouTube, music or other things you like before her. Never listen to music with headphones on when she's sitting there next to you, even if one earbud is out. If you have a duty of work or studies that disturbs, explain why and for how long.
When she goes on a date with you, she doesn't go there so that you can play games on your iPhone and text your buddies. If you do things like that, she'll think you're rude and that you don't want to spend time with her, as any other person would think. After all, you can do that stuff as much as you'd like when she's not around. If she thinks you spend much time with less serious things, she can assume that you will not work hard for a good income later, but be a financial burden to her instead.

, Don't smother your girlfriend. You want her to be excited each time she sees or hears from you. If you smother her, she may become overwhelmed, which could ruin a good relationship. There is time for everything, and if one feels that time for studies, work, hobbies or sleep is wasted for little things, it can become a reason of strain instead of joy. Help each other to be efficient, to spend relaxed quality time together whenever possible.

, If she mentions something you do that bothers her, change your behavior gladly.


Girls will only take so much hurt in a relationship. If you are constantly hurting her, then you're going to lose her. Some girls can and will take some low blows from their boyfriends, but in time, she will realize that she can find someone who will treat her like she wants to be treated. Also, if you hurt her badly, she will tell her friends about it.
You shouldn't change who you are, but when it comes to minor issues, relationships require compromise from both ends. She should be willing to do the same for you. Both should be equally content at the end of the day, but sometimes you must take the first step. If it feels one-sided and one doesn't feel happy at the end, then there is no base for a relationship.

,


A woman may feel belittled if the man does too much, and doesn't give her the space to be in the leading position at times, like paying for a meal, or helping the man. Some women will feel humiliated if they cannot invite at every second or third date, especially in cultures with improved gender equality. If they have an income, they also may want to show ability not to be a free rider, needing a man for their own welfare. It should all be about love, not mere benefits. Balance in all, with certain mutuality, gives chances for a healthy relationship. Attention to the other's emotions is more important than rigid gender roles.

,


Each person has a unique set of love languages, things that can touch their heart that they feel loved and cherished, while other expressions perhaps don't excite at all. The most common are probably: kind affirming words (not pure flattering), time priority, actions of service, gifts, physical touch, really understanding the other, remembering details once told, and showing no regard to obvious faults. E.g. a flower can for a lady mean as much as a home-cooked meal means to a typical man, and as little vice versa. Explain your own love language too, that she will not feel bad if she does things with a kind intention that don't make you excited.
Kind massage is however a trump card, few people dislike it - if the situation is appropriate - perhaps starting with the feet is less intimidating, and a pure gesture of thoughtfulness without erotic associations.
Girls know that guys can ""show love"" in order to get sex, and will feel used and cheap if that is perceived. If she feels disrespected once, it can create fear in her heart, that it will happen again. Never think that ""sex"" is at all the same as ""making love"" to a woman - make sure it will be for HER. Show love to make her feel fulfilled, and sooner or later she cannot resist, but wants to show love in her own way, which a guy really understands...

Learn as much as you can about her mom.,
Coordinate an outfit meant to impress.,
Come bearing gifts.,
Perfect your language and demeanor.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Mom to Like You1," Take mental notes whenever your girlfriend mentions things that her mom might like or be interested in. Listen to her stories and the things that matter to her about her mom – these might be things that matter to her mom as well.Be prepared to ask questions of her life motivations, like what led her to a certain profession or what made her take the leap to move to a different city. Does she vacation somewhere for a solo travel journey every summer? Take mental notes of details your girlfriend reveals about that to delve more into those topics with questions later.Bringing subject matters up based on things you’ve heard your girlfriend say is a great indicator of your level of care and attention to detail in regards to the mother.;
, First impressions mean a lot to most people because you’ll never be able to make a second one, so the first one has to count. Even if keeping it casual in sweatpants or Jordan’s is your preference, wear something fancier when you meet her mom for the first time.When coming up with an outfit, think business casual. It’s a happy medium between too formal and too informal. If you’re a guy, wear jeans, a button up, a blazer, and some nice dress shoes. If you’re a girl, you can wear a nice jumpsuit or a dress – skip the jeans. And don’t forget to go heavy on ironing.
Make sure your grooming habits are on par with your styling. If you’re a guy, make an appointment to visit the barber, shave or trim your facial hair, spritz on some cologne. If you’re a girl, make an appointment with the salon, touch up your roots, get a trim, wear a nice fragrance, or wear some makeup if that’s your thing. Looking put together is another way to exude that you’re together in other areas of your life as well.

, It’s never wise to go to someone else’s home empty handed, and doubly so when first meeting the parent(s). Ask your girlfriend for gift ideas that she thinks her mother might like, or keep it classic by purchasing a bouquet of flowers. If you go that route, bring some flowers for your girlfriend as well, so she’s not empty-handed and knows you’re thinking of her too., Prepare to make a lot of eye contact, to smile sincerely and with warmth, and to address her mom as “Ms.” Or “Mrs.” If you aren’t accustomed to it, practice saying “yes ma’am” and “no ma’am” as signs of respect for her mother.If her household isn’t one that puts a heavy weight on formalities, adapt accordingly, but always begin with the formal. If her mom insists on you calling her by her first name, then you can scale back. You always want to err on the side of being too polite than not polite enough.
Practice having overall confidence in yourself to possess the demeanor that’s closest to the real you when you’re in her mother’s presence. When you’re sure of yourself, it gives others room to be sure about you too.

Determine the grade of your inverted nipples.,
Identify the cause.,
Decide on a treatment method.",How to Get Rid of Inverted Nipples1," Take off your shirt and stand in front of a mirror. Holding your breast at the edge of the areola (the dark area of skin surrounding the nipple) between your thumb and forefinger, press inwards about an inch behind your nipple. Be firm but gentle. Depending on the nipple's response, you can assess the grade of inversion.Grade 1: The nipple protracts easily when you apply light pressure to the areola. When pressure is released, the nipple maintains its projection, rather than retracting immediately. Grade 1 inverted nipples are unlikely to interfere with breastfeeding, though you still may have cosmetic concerns. There is little to no fibrosis (excess connective tissue) in Grade 1 inverted nipples.
Grade 2: The nipple protracts when pressure is applied, though not very easily, and retracts as soon as pressure is released. Grade 2 inversions are more likely to complicate breastfeeding. There is often a moderate degree of fibrosis, with mild retraction of the lactiferous or milk ducts.
Grade 3: The nipple is retracted and does not respond to manipulation; it cannot be pulled out. This is the most serious form of inversion, with a significant amount of fibrosis and retracted milk ducts. You may also experience rashes or infections if you have Grade 3 inversion, and breastfeeding may be impossible.Test both nipples, since they may not both be inverted.;
, If you have had inverted nipples since childhood or puberty, your nipples are unlikely to be indicate an underlying problem. If they have changed recently, especially if you are over 50, they could indicate an illness or infection. Cancer and other serious conditions like inflammation or infection can occasionally cause inverted nipples.If you are over 50 and your areola appears distorted and your nipple appears flatter than normal, or has become inverted, get screened for breast cancer immediately.
Women over 50 are at risk for developing Paget's disease of the breast.
Pink discharge and crusting, thickening, flaking, or scaling of the skin of the nipple and areola can also be symptoms of breast cancer.See a doctor if you have dirty white, greenish, or black discharge from your nipple. Tenderness, redness, or a thickening around your nipples may be a sign of mammary duct ecstasia.
Perimenopausal women are especially at risk for mammary duct ecstasia.
If you develop a painful lump that oozes pus when pushed or cut, and if you have fever, you may have a type of infection called subareolar breast abscess.
Most nipple infections happen during lactation, but subareolar breast abscesses appear in women who are not lactating.
If your nipples have been recently pierced and have become inverted, ask your doctor to check you for subareolar breast abscess., The treatment method depends on the grade of your inversion, the cause of your inversion, and whether you are planning to breastfeed. If you have signs of breast cancer, infection, or mammary duct ecstasia, visit your doctor immediately.If you have Grade 1 inversion, it's likely that manual methods can help loosen the fibrous tissue and allow the nipple to protract more easily.
If you have Grade 2 or 3 inversion, it may be a good idea to consult a doctor for your treatment plan. In some cases, non-invasive methods may be adequate, while plastic surgery may be a better option in others.
If you are pregnant or nursing, be guided by your doctor, nurse or lactation consultant.

Exercise.,
Take hormones.,
Grow up.,
Gain weight.",How to Enlarge Breasts2," It's no myth that certain exercises can make your breasts look perkier--and therefore, bigger. Hit the gym and do some moves that target your problem area. For example, you can do multiple exercises with a light set of weights. Try weighted cross-punches and chest presses.If you are having trouble, don't be afraid to ask the staff at your gym for advice--that's what they're there for.
To make this more enjoyable, grab a friend and do your work-outs together.

, Hormone therapy is not for everyone, but it can be really helpful for those who have (or are recovering from) a medical condition. Breast tissue is very sensitive and can be very responsive to changes in your hormone levels. Often, these changes result in growth.


Ask your doctor if a medication that adjusts your hormone levels is right for you. One of the most common pills is the prescription birth control pill, which has a common side effect of breast growth.

, For many women, having larger breasts goes hand in hand with growing older. Some women develop more slowly or at a later rate than others. Your age can play a large role in the size of your breasts. Breasts develop during puberty and again during a woman's childbearing years. To have larger breasts, sometimes the best course is just to be patient and let nature take its course., In addition to being composed of breast tissue, breasts are also made up of fat tissue. Therefore, when you gain weight, you typically gain it in your breasts. If you are unhappy with your chest size, ask yourself how you feel about the rest of your shape. Is it possible that you are too thin? A healthy diet and exercise regimen can help you achieve the body shape that you want."

Do your research.,
Decide what is right for you.,
Know the risks.,
Think about the recovery process.,
Weigh the pros and cons.",How to Enlarge Breasts3," It is possible that breast implants are a great option for you. The procedure can be very effective, and is often the choice that those recovering from breast cancer or other illnesses make. As with any surgery, make sure that you understand the procedure.


Find a doctor with a great reputation and schedule a consultation. Before your appointment, make a list of questions to ask.
Read up on the procedure. If you know someone who has openly had breast augmentation, ask them if they would mind giving you some advice.

, Once you understand your options, think about which is right for you. Do you want silicon or saline implants? How large would you like your breasts to be? Ask yourself these questions, and make sure that you feel comfortable with your own answers. Envision the results and try to imagine how surgery would impact your life.

, Any medical procedure is bound to have risks. In addition to the general problems that can arise any time you are under anesthesia, make sure that you know the potential problems that can arise with breast implants.For example, ask what will happen if they rupture. It is also important to ask about the possibility of infection and side-effects such as scar tissue. You should also consider whether or not you plan to (or want to try) breastfeeding at any point in the future. Some women are unable to breastfeed after surgery, so this is definitely something important you want to discuss with your doctor.
Also, keep in mind that you will have to get the implants replaced about once every 10 years.

, Having surgery to increase your breast size is not a simple procedure. When doing your research, make sure to take into account the recovery process. You'll want to make sure you are prepared to take time off from work or school and many of your daily activities.


Talk to your friends and relatives to make sure that you will have a support system to help you out while you recover. You won't be able to lift things for a while--even a bag of groceries might be too much.
Recovery is something to ask your doctor about. Make sure to have that talk before you commit to surgery.

, You are the only one who can decide if surgery is right for you. Make a list weighing the positives and the benefits of taking this step. Are you doing it for yourself, and not another person? Are you physically and emotionally ready to undergo an operation? Ask yourself these, and many other, questions. Don't rush yourself. Think carefully about taking this step and what you hope to gain.

Know where the lymph nodes are located.,
Hold your first 3 fingers together.,
Press your fingers against your forearm.,
Place your fingers in your armpit and slide them down a few inches.,
Press in gently.,
Check the lymph nodes on your neck and collarbone.,
Move your fingers to the crease where your thigh meets your pelvis.",How to Check Lymph Nodes1," You have the highest concentration of lymph nodes in your neck, around your collarbone, in your armpits, and in your groin.


Lymph nodes are present in groups, and are about the size of a pea or bean.






Lymph nodes located in the groin are also called inguinal lymph nodes.





;
, You'll use the pads of your fingers to lightly press the different surface areas of your body where lymph nodes are located.

, This will give you a sense of what a normal, unswollen area of your body feels like.

, Your lymph nodes in this area are located toward the bottom of your armpit, near the rib cage.

, Do you notice anything that feels out of place, or different from how it felt when you pressed your forearm? You should feel the rib cage and the muscle and fat underneath the skin. If you feel a lump accompanied by tenderness, you may have a swollen lymph node.


Repeat this exercise under your other armpit using your opposite hand.
Swollen lymph nodes are often the size of a pea or kidney bean., Use the first 3 fingers of each hand to circle behind your ears, down each side of your neck and under your jaw line.

Engage in conversation with her mom.,
Tone down how you show affection.,
Talk about yourself.,
Show consideration by offering your help.,
Thank her for her hospitality.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Mom to Like You2," Don’t shy away from interacting or initiating conversations with her mom. It might seem like the logical thing to do is to talk to your girlfriend more since you know her, but it is actually isolating to the person you’re trying to get to know, which in this case is her mom. Speak to her mom directly and ask her things about herself.Expound on things that you’ve learned about her through conversations with your girlfriend. Don’t forget to ask about what inspired her career, where she likes to go for travel, etc. Ask her what your girlfriend was like as a child. It’s a great conversation starter to break any initial tension.
If you find yourself in the middle of awkward silence, ask basic getting-to-know-you questions like how long she’s been married, interests, or hobbies.Be genuinely interested in what she has to say.
Resist the temptation to use conversation lulls as a window to mess with your phone. Texting, looking at your phone, playing a game, checking updates in different apps – all of these are considered rude practices in social gatherings., While a quick peck on the lips or occasional hand hold is not enough to alert the PDA police, as a sign of respect, it’s best to keep PDA to a bare minimum. Touch the small of her back affectionately or whisper something in her ear – but do not touch one another inappropriately, even if you think no one may be looking. It’s another form of respect.When trying to find the line between what’s too much PDA and what’s just enough, consider the things that make you considerate: open doors for her, pull out her chair for her, fix her plate for her, etc.
If you are coming from out of town and are staying over at her mom’s house, continue to err on the side of respect and oblige to requests to stay in separate rooms or at a hotel if it’s asked of you.However, succumb to requests that her mother might have if she wants you to stay at the house and allows you to stay in the room with your girlfriend. Let the mother set the tone for how you are to regard your girlfriend in intimate circumstances under her roof.

, Even though your girlfriend is bringing you to meet her mom, this interaction is about you as well since it’s for the two of you trying to get to know each other. Talk to her about yourself so she can get a better idea of who the man her daughter is in love with is.Talk about what you like to do, what you’re interested in doing, your ambitions, your career, your goals, etc.Show her that you make a suitable match for her daughter by giving her confidence in you.
Include your girlfriend in your conversation as well. Talk about how the two of you met, what you love about her, what the two of you like doing together for fun. Seeing your apparent love for her daughter will be very encouraging in how she feels about you., If you know that her mom has been cooking all day, preparing for the two of you to visit, offer to help out in any way possible. Take out the trash if it’s full, ask if you can help with the dishes, help her make dinner, or help her set up for dinner. Hosts and hostesses tend to say “no”, but the thought will stick out in her mind and she will appreciate you for it., Meeting her mom might have gone seamlessly or it might have been a disaster, either way, it’s important to be polite and compliment her mom for having you that day or night. At the end of the night, say “Thank you, I had a wonderful time. Hope to do it again sometime soon.” This keeps the door open for future plans and for you to be kept in mind for any social gatherings her mom might host later."

Treat her daughter with respect.,
Reach out to your girlfriend’s mom.,
Appreciate her good attributes.,
Make it a point to visit her.,
Show her that her attitude will not make you go anywhere.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Mom to Like You3," Maintaining a good, healthy relationship with your girlfriend where you treat her well is important when trying to have a good relationship with her mom. When you make your girlfriend happy, it means that nothing but positive things will be said about you to her mom, which will help the mom get a better sense of how great of a choice you are for her daughter.Show your girlfriend how much you love her on a daily basis by giving her the attention she craves. Designate time to spend with your girlfriend at least once a week and talk to her in some form daily.
Tell her she’s beautiful and compliment her on positive attributes and successes. Let her know that you love her as often as possible through words and through actions.Keep in mind that it is the negative things that stick with people longer. If you do something unforgivable and it gets back to her mom through word of mouth, it will be hard to win back her mother’s affection. So treat her daughter right to live and lead a happy life.

, Making your girlfriend’s mom feel like her words of wisdom matter can help her grow to like you. Ask her for her opinion on things and show her that you respect her thoughts and ideas by giving them consideration. Ask for advice about her daughter or about your life in general to make her feel special and like her opinion and her knowledge matters., Whether you find her to be annoying or amenable, bear in mind that there are always good things that can be associated with people. As the younger person trying to enter her family, you have to be the one who is more flexible in your attitude, meaning you have to see the light at the end of the rainbow and appreciate that light. Show her you value her and encourage gentleness by being appreciative of the contributions she puts forth in you and your girlfriend’s lives., Show her she’s included in your life by making routine calls or routine visits to her home. You don’t have to visit her every week, but factoring face to face interactions in once every couple of weeks or so is a great way to show your consideration and that you’re thinking of her. If you don’t want to do lengthy visits, drop off a cup of her favorite coffee or mention that you’re on your way to run an errand and just wanted to peak your head in for a bit to check in on her.
If you feel like your efforts are being taken for granted, scale things back to a level that you’re comfortable with. Do things for the mother when your girlfriend makes requests specifically or make visits only when you and your girlfriend have plans to go there together. There’s no need to over exert yourself if your efforts are not proving to be fruitful.

, In all honesty, a parent not liking you or approving of you might cause a little strain in your relationship, especially if your girlfriend has a tight bond with her parent. But it can be overcome, even if the issues between you and her mother remain. Show her mom you two are a united front and aren’t going to back down just because she wants to be petty.


Continue to be respectful so that the girlfriend doesn’t feel like she has to make a choice between you and her mother. As long as she views the mother as a problem in the both of you guys’ dynamic, your relationship will survive.
Don’t feel pressured to feel that you have to keep a closed mouth if you feel disrespected by her mother. There is a way to confront someone older in a respectful matter. For example, say something like, “With all due respect, I don’t appreciate the way you speak about me to your daughter. I would appreciate it if you didn’t do that again.”

Roll your nipple between thumb and forefinger several times a day.",How to Get Rid of Inverted Nipples2," Place both thumbs on opposite sides of the nipple at the base. Gently pull the thumbs away from each other in opposite directions. Work both up and down and sideways.


Start with two repetitions per day, gradually building up to five.
This technique is thought to break down the adhesions at the base of the nipple that keep it inverted., Rolling, pulling, and sucking the nipple can all help encourage nipple protrusion. Don't force anything to the point of pain, though – remember: firm, but gentle., Pull on the nipple gently when it is erect to encourage it to stay so. Afterward, wet a towel with cold water and apply it to your nipples to stimulate them further."

Use breast shells.,
Use a breast pump.,
Use an inverted syringe.,
Use the Niplette.,
Use Supple Cups.",How to Get Rid of Inverted Nipples3," Breast shells are sold at maternity stores and online. They are soft, circular discs with a small hole in the middle that pushes the nipple forward.


Cup your breast inside the shield and position your nipple through the small hole.
Wear the breast shell under your shirt, undershirt or bra. You may need to have an extra layer of clothing to hide it adequately.
If you are preparing to nurse, wear the shell for 30 minutes prior to breastfeeding.The shell applies gentle pressure to your nipple to encourage it to stay erect. It can be used by men and women as a treatment for inverted nipples.
The breast shell may stimulate lactation in breastfeeding women. Nursing mothers should not wear them continuously for days on end. If you wear the shell during feedings, be sure to wash it in hot, soapy water afterwards, and dispose of any milk leaked into the shell during wearing. Monitor the area around your breast when using breast shells, as they may cause rashes., If you are pregnant or nursing, use your breast pump to evert the nipple tissue.


Place the phalange over your breast, ensuring your nipple is centered inside the hole. Phalanges come in different sizes, so be sure the phalange you're using covers your nipple.
Hold the phalange against your breast, ensuring a seal against your skin.
Holding the phalange or bottle in one hand, turn on the pump.
Pump at the highest comfortable strength.
Turn off the machine by holding both bottles against you with one arm and turning off the pump with another.If you are nursing, give the nipple to your baby once your nipple is erect.
Don’t pump extensively if you are nursing, since it will start the flow of milk from your nipple.
There are a variety of breast pumps on the market; high-quality electric pumps like those used at a maternity ward do the best job of pulling the nipple out without damaging surrounding tissue.
Breast pumps vary from one manufacturer to another. Talk to a nurse or lactation consultant about the best way to use the particular pump you're working with.

, Pull out your nipple using a clean, needleless 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) syringe (this size may vary depending on your nipple size).


Use clean, sharp scissors to cut off the end of the syringe where it reads ""0 mL"". (The side opposite to the plunger.)
Remove the plunger and reinsert it at the end you just cut off, pushing the plunger all the way in.
Place the uncut end over your nipple and draw out the plunger so that your nipple protracts.
Do not pull farther than is comfortable.
Before removing, push the plunger slightly back in to break the suction.
Once finished, disassemble all parts and wash with hot, soapy water.
If you prefer, there is a medical device called Evert-It, which is a modified syringe with a breast phalange. It works on the same principle described above.

, The Niplette is a device that elongates the milk ducts by pulling on the nipple for an extended period. This small, clear, plastic device is worn over the nipple and under clothing.


Apply a small amount of nipple ointment to the nipple and areola and the base of the Niplette.
Insert the syringe into the open end of the valve, pushing firmly.
Place the Avent Niplette over your nipple with one hand and pull the syringe with the other, creating suction. Don't pull too hard - this should not be painful!
Once the nipple has been pulled out, release the Niplette.
Grasp the valve and carefully remove the syringe from the valve. Do this carefully so that no air is re-injected, which would cause the device to fall off.
Wear your Niplette under your clothing. If you're wearing a tight top, you can conceal the Niplette with a specially designed protective cover.
Remove the Niplette by pushing the syringe into the valve to break the vacuum.
Start by wearing the Niplette for one hour per day. Gradually increase by one hour each day, working up to eight hours per day.
Do not wear the Niplette day and night!
Within three weeks you should see results, with the nipple filling the mould., Supple Cups sold online have been designed to help address flat, shy and inverted nipples, by drawing the nipple into the cup. Clinically proven, permanent correction has been observed in inverted nipple clinical trials, in as little as a few weeks.

Center the Supple Cup onto the nipple and squeeze the bottom of the Supple Cup as you gently press it onto the nipple. This creates a gentle vacuum, drawing the nipple into the Supple Cup.
For an improved seal, apply a small amount of nipple cream or butter – such as USP modified lanolin – on nipple and interior of the Supple Cup. If that still doesn’t work, you may want to try a different size.
New users typically wear Supple Cups for 15 minutes on the first day. If no pain or discomfort is experienced, one may advance the time each day, gradually increasing to four hours per day by the end of the first week.
Some are able to wear the Supple Cups under a bra without the Supple Cup being displaced or without discomfort. Alternatively, Breast Shells can be used in conjunction with Supple Cups to prevent a tight bra from flattening out the Supple Cups or from causing uncomfortable pressure or from being detached from the nipple.

After the operation, report any questions or concerns to your surgeon.,
Schedule a post-operative visit with your surgeon.",How to Get Rid of Inverted Nipples4," While it may be desirable to correct the issue non-surgically, for some people surgery is a good option.

Have a variety of bras for different outfits.,
Take care of your bras.",How to Enhance Breasts1," Many women are accidentally buying a bra size that's too small or too big. The wrong sized bra can cause your breasts to look smaller or misshapen. When you go shopping for a bra, be aware of the size you need.


Cup size is not necessarily the best measure of bra size. Cup size is correlated with band size. If you're an A-cup with a 34 inch band, you may be a B-cup with a 32 inch band. Learn your band size and then find a cup size from there.Go to a store that specializes in selling bras, lingerie, and other underwear. Ask for a fitting. A good saleswoman will be able to help find you a bra that's flattering on you.;
, Push-up and padded bras are two types of bra that are specially designed to enhance the size of your breasts. If you want to enhance the size of your breasts, consider investing in a push-up or padded bra.


Push-up bras are designed to lift the breasts up and push them closer together, creating the appearance of larger breasts. Push-up bras are sold at most department stores as well as stores that specialize in lingerie.
Padded bras contain extra foam padding in the cups, which makes breasts look rounder and fuller without creating extra cleavage.

, No bra is universally flattering. A low-cut dress might benefit from your breasts looking perkier, but a t-shirt might be better worn if your breasts are softer and flatter. Have a variety of different bras on hand in your closet and choose the right bra for the right outfit. This might mean doing some experimentation before going out., A good bra can be quite expensive. Therefore, you should work on taking care of the bras you have so they do not wear out too fast.


Always hand wash and air dry bras. Going through the washer and dryer can increase wear and tear.Never wear the same bra two days in a row. Letting a bra rest for a day allows the elastic to regain its strength."

, Women who are nursing have special dietary needs, and if you get pregnant while breastfeeding, you will need to adjust your diet even more to keep you, your child, and your unborn baby healthy. Your OB?GYN should be able to refer you to a registered dietician to discuss your specific dietary needs and how you can best get all of the vitamins and nutrients necessary to keep three people healthy.


Nursing women may lack important vitamins and minerals such as calcium or iron, and this can become more acute if you are breastfeeding and suffering from nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy. A registered dietician may help you overcome the nausea while ensuring that you get sufficient nutrients., As a pregnant and breastfeeding woman, you need to make sure you are eating the proper nutrients to sustain your milk supply and your pregnancy. By eating a healthy, well-balanced diet you can help ensure that you, your child, and your unborn baby get the necessary vitamins and minerals.


In addition to your regular calorie intake, you will need to factor in extra calories for nursing and sustaining your pregnancy. You will need up to 650 extra calories per day to produce sufficient milk, and 100 – 300 extra calories (depending on the trimester you are in) to support your unborn child.Eat healthy and nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins, including chicken or beef; fruits and vegetables, such as raspberries or broccoli; and dairy products like yogurt or cheese for calcium.Be careful when consuming seafood or fish. Limit your cooked fish intake to 8 – 12 oz. per week and your canned intake to 6 oz. per week.Avoid tuna steaks, swordfish, mackerel, shark or any other fish with high mercury levels.Try to avoid unhealthy calories such as those found in sweets and junk food.
You might want to avoid any foods that can cause digestive issues for you or your child, or unborn baby, including spicy foods, eggs, wheat, corn, or peanuts.If you are suffering from nausea or vomiting due to either morning sickness or a let-down in your milk supply and find it difficult to eat, consult your doctor or a registered dietician, who can help you find solutions to get proper nutrition., It’s important to make sure that you’re drinking plenty of liquids while pregnant and breastfeeding. Not only do you need enough liquid to avoid dehydration and support your pregnancy, but you also need it to produce milk.


You should drink at least 15 cups of water a day to stay hydrated, produce milk, and sustain your pregnancy.Water is the best choice for your needs, but you can also drink non-caffeinated tea, and juices. Clear, non-caffeinated soft drinks such as ginger ale may help with nausea.
You may consume coffee or caffeinated teas and soft drinks in limited quantities. The recommended level of caffeine that is safe is equal to less than 750ml of coffee.Consult with your doctor to make sure it’s safe to consume any of these beverages.

, It’s advisable to avoid all alcohol and tobacco while you’re pregnant and breastfeeding. Using these substances can be potentially harmful to you, your nursing child, and your unborn baby.


While the evidence about breastfeeding and alcohol is not well-defined, doctors know that alcohol passes freely into a mother’s milk.There is plenty of evidence about the risk of alcohol consumption for pregnant women, so avoid alcohol altogether while you’re pregnant and breastfeeding.Tobacco use can put both your nursing and unborn child at risk for conditions such as low-birth weight and respiratory diseases.If you smoke while pregnant and breastfeeding, speak to your doctor about possible treatment options to help you quit and keep your children healthy., Your body will need sufficient additional nutrients to support a pregnancy and milk production. Consider taking a prenatal vitamin to help you get additional nutrients you may need and not be getting through food.


During breastfeeding, the body is designed to put your child’s nutritional needs before yours.
It’s safe to continue taking prenatal vitamins if you’re breastfeeding and your doctor may recommend them to you to ensure you’re getting the nutrition you need.Try to get as many nutrients as possible from healthy and whole foods.

, Breastfeeding may not normally cause fatigue, but there is a chance you may feel more tired than usual if you are pregnant and breastfeeding.Making sure that you get plenty of rest will help ensure that you have the energy to nurse your child and sustain your pregnancy.


In addition to getting enough rest at night, set aside time during the day to rest if you can.
You could use nursing times as a chance to sit or lay down for a little extra rest.Unhealthy eating habits and physical discomforts may contribute to fatigue. Eating healthy foods will help you feel energized, and minimizing physical discomforts such as nausea or sore nipples may also alleviate some exhaustion., Two of the most common symptoms of pregnancy are breast tenderness and nipple soreness and nursing a child may heighten these sensations, especially if breastfeeding is already uncomfortable. Paying special attention to the care of your nipples can minimize discomfort.Avoid using soaps, creams or lotions on your nipples. These can irritate your nipples and increase soreness and also make nursing uncomfortable for your child.
Try massaging your breasts while bathing to aid circulation. Allow your nipples to air dry to help avoid discomfort.
Make sure your baby is latched on properly to prevent nipple cracking or soreness.
If you notice that your nipples are cracking, try coating the nipple in breast milk or water and allowing it to air dry.You can also use lanolin cream.
Warm compresses can also help sore nipples and breasts.You can also try distracting yourself from the pain by watching TV, listening to the radio, or reading a book while you nurse.If you have breast or nipple pain for more than a few days, see your doctor to rule out conditions such as engorgement, yeast infections (thrush), plugged milk ducts, or vasospasm, a condition that causes nipples to be very sensitive to cold temperatures., You may experience some special conditions if you’re nursing during a pregnancy, including a reduction and change in taste of your milk supply as well as uterine contractions. These are completely normal conditions and generally are no need for alarm, though you can consult a doctor or lactation specialist if you have any questions.Your milk supply may decrease during the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy, which is also called a let-down of milk. This make it difficult to continue breastfeeding, and may also make you feel nauseous and generally uncomfortable.The decrease in your milk supply will also make the taste of it change.This could make your child dislike your milk and force you to wean them.Breastfeeding releases the hormone oxytocin, which causes mild uterine contractions. These are completely normal and should not cause a miscarriage or preterm labor; however, if any vaginal bleeding occurs with the cramps or contractions you should contact your doctor.The intense nipple stimulation from breastfeeding while pregnant may cause sexual arousal while you’re nursing. These feelings, though complex and upsetting, are normal and have nothing to do with your child., Once you’ve given birth to your new baby, you may want to continue nursing your older child along with the newborn. This is referred to as tandem nursing and is a completely safe and normal thing to do.Don’t worry that your body won’t produce enough milk for both children, your breasts can adjust to the demands to produce more milk.You can safely nurse either child or both children as long as you wish.Nursing beyond the first year is sometimes called extended breastfeeding.

Increase your exercise.,
Quit or cut back on smoking.,
Cut back on alcohol.Alcohol is another substance that can be harmful for your body and can lead to an increased risk of breast cancer.,
Opt for breastfeeding.,
Get good sleep.,
Reduce your stress.,
Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet.It is uncertain in the medical research whether or not dietary choices play an important role in one's risk of developing breast cancer.",How to Decrease Your Breast Cancer Risk1," Getting at least four hours of aerobic exercise per week has been correlated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Aerobic exercise is anything that elevates your heart rate, such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or riding a bike.Exercise has the additional benefit of helping you to lose weight and/or maintain a healthy weight.
Being overweight is correlated to an increased risk of breast cancer. For this reason, exercising in order to stay at your ideal body weight can in turn reduce your risk.;
, Tobacco smoke contains over 70 known carcinogens, so if you want to reduce your risk of breast cancer (among other cancers, such as lung cancer), you will want to quit smoking if possible.If you are interested in quitting but unsure of how to do so, your family doctor can provide you with strategies as well as medications that can help to satisfy your craving for nicotine while avoiding cigarettes.There are some factors that increase your risk of cancer over which you have little or no control (such as genetics) — but smoking is something you can control. Make a choice to greatly reduce your risk by quitting smoking.
Speak to your doctor is this is of interest to you, because the health benefits are multiple, including reducing your risk of breast cancer.

, Consume alcohol only in moderation if you are wanting to reduce your risk.Women should have one or fewer servings of alcohol daily. Men should have two or fewer drinks daily.
One serving of alcohol is 12 oz of beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz spirits.

, Breastfeeding (for at least six months) has been correlated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, not to mention the numerous benefits it provides for your baby. If you have a newborn or are considering becoming pregnant, think about breastfeeding.Breastfeeding for a year or longer may further decrease your risk of breast cancer.Giving birth to your first child before age 35 will decrease your chances of developing breast cancer later in life. If you have your first child after age 35, however, you may in fact increase your risk of breast cancer.Having more children can also be a protective factor against breast cancer due to the beneficial hormonal effects of being pregnant.

, Interestingly enough, people who work night shifts have been shown to have an elevated risk of breast cancer. This is hypothesized to be due to disturbances in their levels of melatonin, a hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle., Reducing the stress in your life also has numerous health benefits which could all contribute to improving your overall health and reducing your risk of breast cancer. We live in a world where doing and accomplishing more can be thought of as an asset; however, make sure you also have enough time to rest and recharge, so that you do not suffer the potential health consequences of working around the clock., There is no conclusive evidence on this yet; however, eating a healthy and well-balanced diet is always in your best interest and good for your health, so there is no harm in prioritizing this area of life.

Strengthen the muscles in your chest with weight lifting.,
Wear a well-fitted sports bra during exercise.",How to Avoid Having Sagging Breasts as a Young Woman1," It will make you look and feel good by controlling your weight and giving you a trim waist to help emphasize the perkiness of your breasts.Aerobic exercise like jogging, walking, or swimming will help keep your waist small. Try to do 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.
Aerobic exercise will also release endorphins which will relax you, lift your mood, and make you feel better about yourself.;
, While your breasts themselves do not have muscles in them, toning the underlying muscles might still help them resist the pull of gravity. Try to do weight training at least twice a week.Strengthen your pectoral, shoulder, and triceps muscles with chest presses. Lie on your back on the floor with a weight in each hand. Your elbows should be touching the floor with your forearms straight up in the air. Push the weights straight up until your arms are extended. Lower back to the starting position. Repeat.Build your biceps with biceps curls. Stand straight and hold a weight in your hand with your palm facing up. Bend your elbow and bring the weight towards your shoulder. Bring it down and repeat.Do push-ups to strengthen the muscles in your arms, chest and back. Lie on your stomach on the floor with your palms on the floor next to your shoulders. Prop yourself up on your toes. Extend your arms and lift your body off the floor, keeping your back straight and your abs pulled in to protect your spine. Your arms should be fully extended. Gently let yourself down and repeat. If you cannot do a pushup from your toes, start by bending your knees when you go up, rather than keeping your legs straight.

, During exercise your breasts may bounce between 4 and 15 cm. This strains connective tissue that attaches your breasts to your chest and the skin that covers your breast tissue. A properly fitted sports bra can hold your breasts in place, reduce the bouncing, and prevent the skin and ligaments from stretching. A sports bra fits properly when:The underwire does not move around when you run and jump. But it shouldn’t be so tight that it restricts your breathing or hurts. This is where most of the support comes from.
The cups should be fitted around the breasts with no areas where your breasts are spilling out. The material should also not be loose. You should completely fill the cups.
The shoulder straps should not slip off your arms when you move nor press painfully into your skin.
The band band should be even all the way around the body. No part of the band should be higher or lower than the rest of the band.
If the bra has an underwire, it should be underneath the breast without pressing on the breast tissue.

Improve your posture.",How to Enhance Breasts2," Building your chest muscles can make breasts look firmer, perkier, and bigger. Many women, even highly physically active women, neglect working their pectoral muscles. Engage in exercises that focus on your chest in order to enhance your breast size.Push-ups. Lie face-down on the floor and place your palms flat on the ground underneath your shoulders. Push yourself up into a plank position, keeping your spine straight. Lower yourself back towards the floor, without letting your stomach touch the ground. Try to work your way up to 15 repetitions.

Chest presses. Lie flat on an exercise bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Start with your elbows bent, so your arms are at a 90 degree angle from your body and the dumbbells are at shoulder level, parallel to the ground. Push the dumbbells straight up until their sides touch, then lower them back to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 reps.
Dumbbell flyes. Lie on the floor with a dumbbell in each hand. Extend your arms out to the sides, in line with the shoulders. Bring your arms in towards each other (as if you were giving someone a big bear hug) until the the weights touch, then lower your arms back towards the floor. Do 3 sets of 10 reps.If you have the time and money, consider talking to a trainer at a gym. A trainer will be able to expose you to a variety of exercises that focus on the strengthening the chest., A firm, toned core can help your stomach and hips look slimmer. This can make your breasts look larger by comparison. Try to do exercises that focus on building your core 3 to 4 days a week.

Stay away from phony products.,
Learn about breast augmentation.,
Talk to your doctor about the drawbacks of breast augmentation.,
Prepare for your surgery and recovery.,
Consider a breast lift.",How to Enhance Breasts3," Many natural breast enhancement products, such as breast creams and dietary supplements, have little effect on changing your breasts and may actually be harmful. Many medications interact poorly with such products and no medical research exists that indicates they work., Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure in which breast size is increased by the insertion of breast implants. Breast augmentation is usually performed by a plastic surgeon. There are a variety of reasons for augmentation, from simply desiring larger or firmer breasts to reconstructing breasts after losing them to medical conditions such as cancer., While many women are happy after a breast augmentation surgery, keep in mind it carries some risks. Learn about the negative aspects of breast augmentation surgery before deciding if it's the right choice for you.


As with any surgery, there's a risk of complication. Scarring, infection, breast pain, and changes in breast sensation can occur.Breast augmentation is expensive and is generally not covered by insurance. Getting mammograms after surgery can be complicated as you'll need specialized machinery.Breast implants do not last a lifetime. They do not prevent sagging of breasts with age. Weight loss or weight gain can affect the appearance of your breasts even with implants., If you decide breast augmentation is right for you, you need to prepare for the surgery. There is also a recovery period afterwards.


Your doctor will go over how you should care for yourself in the weeks leading up to the surgery. Your pre-surgical routine depends on your age, lifestyle, and overall health.During healing, your breasts will be sensitive and there may be some leaking or scarring. You may have to wear a compression bandage, which will need to be changed regularly. Avoid strenuous activity for at least two weeks after the procedure., If increasing your breast size seems too intense, a skilled cosmetic surgeon can enhance the appearance of your breasts by making them perkier and more shapely. A breast lift removes excess, stretched out skin, reshapes breast tissue, and raises the nipples to change the appearance of your breasts.There are a variety of types of breast lifts ranging in intensity. You can talk to a cosmetic surgeon about what type of lift would best suit your needs.A breast lift is an outpatient procedure performed with general or local anesthesia. It takes about 1 to 2 hours to perform. Your breasts will be bandaged directly after the procedure and you can expect to experience some soreness in the weeks after the surgery."

Consider the dose and duration of your hormone therapy.,
Avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation.,
Obtain regular mammograms.,
Perform breast self-exams.,
Be extra cautious if you have an increased genetic risk.If you have inherited a genetic mutation (such as a BRCA mutation) that predisposes you to breast cancer, speak to your doctor about the best screening and preventative strategies for you.",How to Decrease Your Breast Cancer Risk2," If you are taking hormone therapy either for birth control (such as birth control pills) or for menopausal reasons (to help cope with the symptoms of menopause), speak to your doctor about the pros and cons of such treatment. The disadvantage is that hormone treatment, if continued for a number of years, can slightly increase your risk of breast cancer. It is not a huge risk, but it is present nonetheless, so hormone therapy should be used with caution.On the other hand, women who use continuous hormone pills for 10 years or more substantially decrease there lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, which you are much more likely to die from than breast cancer.
Speak to your doctor about your specific situation, and they can provide you with guidance as to how best to move forward.

, Radiation from medical imaging tests, such as CT scans, may increase your risk. Although it is sometimes needed to diagnose emergency medical conditions, or to treat certain conditions that require such imaging to be done, avoid it if at all possible in order to decrease your chance of developing cancer (either breast cancer or another form of cancer)., Screening is a key part of prevention, so if you are seeking to diminish your risk of breast cancer it is important to follow through with all the recommended screening tests at the frequencies suggested by your doctor. In general, women over the age of 50 are eligible for a mammogram every two years (which is a specialized type of x-ray for the breasts)., You can also ask your doctor about how to perform a breast self-exam if you are unsure of how to do so. The purpose of a breast self-exam is to notice any unusual lumps or bumps you feel in your breasts, so that you can have these examined by a doctor to rule out the possibility of breast cancer (or to detect it early if it is cancer)., You may be eligible for screening at a younger age. Some women even opt for prophylactic surgery, where they have their breasts removed (and then possibly reconstructed with plastic surgery), in order to ensure that they do not develop breast cancer.If you have a family history of breast cancer (especially in first-degree relatives) i, ask your doctor about screening for genetic mutations that may increase your risk.
If you have a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, your doctor can provide you with further information about your risk, as well as options for you to decrease your risk of developing breast cancer.
Keep in mind that women with no family history of breast cancer can still develop the disease, so all women need to take breast cancer screening seriously.

Preserve the youth and elasticity of your skin by not smoking.,
Protect your breasts from skin damage.,
Keep the skin on your breasts smooth, supple, and young looking with simple care techniques.,
Keep your skin hydrated by applying moisturizer daily.",How to Avoid Having Sagging Breasts as a Young Woman2," Nicotine constricts the blood vessels in your skin causing it to get less oxygen and nutrients. Other chemicals in cigarettes harm the collagen and elastin in your skin making it weaker and less stretchy. This causes wrinkling and sagging.As the skin of your breasts loses elasticity, your breasts will sag even if you are still young.
If you already smoke, quitting will still help. Many resources are available to help you quit, including support groups, hotlines, and nicotine replacement therapies., Low V-neck shirts are cool and sexy during the hot summer months, but they also expose the skin above your breasts to harmful ultraviolet radiation. UV rays damage the collagen and elastin which are vital to the skin’s connective tissues. This makes the skin less supple and prone to sagging.Apply sunscreen when you will be outside for long periods of time, even if it is cloudy. Clouds do not prevent you from being exposed to UV rays.
Avoid dark tans. While tanning might help protect you against sunburns, your skin is still absorbing UV rays and sustaining damage.

, Sweat and dirt may collect on an around your breasts. You can care for your skin by:Removing dirt and sweat either by showering or washing quickly with a warm wash cloth. Not only will this feel good, but it will remove oil, dead skin cells, and debris and prevent you from getting pimples on your breasts.
Use a mild cleanser or plain water that won’t strip the natural oils from your skin.

, Use a non-oily moisturizer that won’t clog your pores and will let your skin breathe.


Always moisturize after a shower. Keeping your skin soft and supple will prevent skin damage and help it heal quickly.
If you are outside a lot, look for moisturizers with sunscreen in them. If you live in a very sunny place or near the equator, it may be possible to get burned through light layers of clothing.

Keep your skin resilient by eating enough protein.,
Give yourself the energy to exercise regularly by eating complex carbohydrates.,
Keep your youth by eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.,
Avoid putting on and losing weight too quickly.,
Don’t be afraid to breastfeed your baby.",How to Avoid Having Sagging Breasts as a Young Woman3," Your body uses protein to heal, and this includes damage to the skin, connective tissues, and muscles which help your breasts resist gravity.The average adult should eat two to three portions of a protein-rich food per day. This can be meat, milk, fish, eggs, soy, beans, legumes, or nuts.
Lean meats and low fat dairy products are good because they won't simultaneously increase your fat intake.

, Complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and provide you with energy for a longer period of time than simple sugars do.Excellent sources of complex carbohydrates are beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, potatoes, corn, green peas, parsnips, and whole-grain breads.
Simple sugars should be avoided and are found in candies, pastries, cake, soda, cookies, and table sugar.
Carbohydrates should make up approximately half of the calories you consume each day.

, This will provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to keep your breast tissues young and healthy looking.Adults should consume four servings of fruit and five servings of vegetables each day.
Tasty options for getting your servings of fruits include berries, cucumber, apples, grapes, cherries, papaya, bananas, and more. Vegetables include broccoli, beets, carrots, celery, lettuce, spinach, cauliflower and potatoes.
If you think you are not getting what you need, vitamin and mineral supplements are widely available over-the-counter at drug and grocery stores. If you believe you have deficiencies, first talk to your doctor, and then if they recommend it, try adding particular supplements or multivitamins which contain lots of different vitamins and minerals.

, Most women will gain and lose weight from their breasts as well as other body areas. Such rapid changes can cause your skin to stretch as you gain weight faster than your body can handle. Similarly, when you lose weight too quickly, you can wind up with excess saggy skin.If you plan to gain or lose weight, see a nutritionist so you can plan to do it slowly and steadily to prevent your skin from stretching.
Avoid becoming overweight. As you do, your breasts will become larger increasing their weight and making them more likely to sag over time.
Avoid yo-yo dieting. Major weight fluctuations — going from very heavy to much lighter and then back to your original weight — is another way your skin can stretch out. Try to lose weight by losing 1 to 2 lbs. per week (cutting about 500 calories from your daily calorie intake), and make lifestyle changes to keep the weight off. Fad diets may cause you to lose weight rapidly, but it rarely stays off.

, Not breastfeeding won’t prevent the sagging that comes with pregnancy. Your breasts sag as they get larger and heavier during pregnancy. This stretches the ligaments, leaving lasting sagging.This sagging will happen regardless of whether you breastfeed and breastfeeding will not make it worse.

Become familiar with how your breasts feel.,
Know the warning signs.,
Set an appointment and keep calm.,
Learn about the different types of breast lumps.",How to Deal With a Newly Detected Breast Lump1," You might not spend the time checking yourself out each month because cancer doesn't run in your family, you are young, you feel healthy, or maybe you tend to put things off. However, you may want to familiarize yourself with how healthy breasts normally feel.Do this right after a period because this is when natural breast lumps will be at their smallest.


The upper breast tissue either feels long and thick or uneven and rounded.
The lower breast feels smoother.
Some random spots feel slightly bumpy normally; just be aware of changes each month.;
, Different symptoms will alert you to a possible problem. Being familiar with each of them is something that you should add to your to-do-list! Educating ourselves is the best defense when it comes our health.Be aware that some tenderness or lumpiness can occur around the time of your period. If it doesn't go away by your next cycle, be concerned.If your breasts get red, become irritated, or the skin is flaky, you might want to see a doctor.If your nipple looks like it is flipped inside out (unless it usually looks this way), make an appointment.If your nipples produce any red, brown, yellow, or clear fluids, it's time for a check-up., It is integral that you do not delay seeking a physician's advice if you notice a change in or around your breasts. It is always better to be informed. Avoid thinking about the worse case scenario at this point, though.Make your appointment as soon as possible. The longer that you wait, the worse off you will be if the tumor or other symptom is a sign of cancer.
Talk to friends and co-workers. Ask other women if they've ever had a similar experience and ask about the outcome. Hearing some positive stories will stop you from completely losing it.
Panicking just gets your cortisol levels going. An uptake in cortisol is going to make you crave sugary, fatty, no-good-for-you foods. Drink some chamomile tea and calm down, as you need to stay healthy.

, It might be scary when you find a lump or other abnormality. Don't freak out, though! It is more than likely that your lump is not cancerous, but you must receive confirmation of that from a doctor.Some lumps are just cysts. Cysts, which are filled with fluid, occur due to hormonal changes and it is common for women to experience them at some point in their lives.Other lumps might just be benign tumors. These are the result of tissue that has simply formed too quickly and is a bit abnormal as a result.You might be experiencing mastitis. This is an infection and the primary cause is breastfeeding. It can easily be treated with antibiotics."

Contact your doctor.",How to Do a Breast Self Exam," Some women like to perform regular breast self-exams. Regular examinations allow you to detect changes that you may not have otherwise noticed, which can help you detect any cancer; however, self-exam should never take the place of mammograms, since these are considered a more accurate test.


When you do an exam, you are looking for pre-cancerous lesions or early signs of cancer before it has spread. At this stage, you can treat it before it grows to be life-threatening, which lowers your risk of death from breast cancer. In addition to self-exams, professional screening involved a mammogram, which is a kind of x-ray specifically used on breasts that can show masses, calcifications, or other signs of cancer.No study has proven that breast self-exams decrease the risk of breast cancer death, which is why many experts do not recommend them. Because of this, many women choose not to do them, but they can still be helpful.;
, There are groups of individuals who are more at risk for breast cancer. There are genetic reason and events in your medical history that can put you more at risk. These include:A mutation in a breast cancer gene called BRCA
Previous history of breast cancer
A family history of breast cancer, especially at a younger age
Women who had radiation of the chest between 10 and 30 years of age

, Breast self-exams should begin as early as age 20. You should check your breasts once a month so you can note changes over time.In addition to breast self-exams, yearly mammogram screenings should begin no later than age 45, though you can start as early as age 40.


You can continue yearly mammograms starting at 55, or you can go down to once every two years.If you are a higher risk of breast cancer, you may begin screening at age 40. Your doctor may order you to get tested more frequently if you are more at risk of developing breast cancer.

, In addition to your monthly self-exams, your doctor should perform a breast exam at least once a year during your annual physical or gynecological check-up. Your doctor will first perform a visual inspection of both your breast and nipples. They will then do a physical examination of them similar to your self-exam, feeling all the breast tissue and the tissue under both of your arms.


They look for any puckering or changes of the skin around the breast, abnormal discharge or orientation of the nipple, or any lumps, which could signal underlying cancers., Sometimes, a self-exam will not be enough. If you are especially high-risk, such as an increased and long family history of the disease, your doctor may recommend a breast MRI. MRIs are more sensitive tests and show more detailed scans. However, they often lead to more false positives, which can lead to unneeded biopsies., If you are performing breast self-exams, try to do them once a month. The best time to do this is about one week after the end of your period. This is when your breasts are least tender and lumpy. During your period, your breasts can be lumpy because of hormone fluctuations.If you don’t have regular periods, do the self-exam on the same say every month.
If you don’t want to do it monthly, you can do an exam less often. It just depends on what you are comfortable with., One way to look for issues with your breasts is to look for changes in their appearance. Stand in front of a mirror without your shirt and bra. Place your hands on your hips. Press firmly down on your hips to engage the muscles, which will help you notice changes. Take note of any redness or scaling of the skin and nipples, any changes to the size, contour, or shape, and any dimpling or puckering to the area.


Check under your breasts as well. Turn side to side, lifting your breasts up so you can see underneath and on the side of them.
Also look under your arm, holding your arm only part of the way up. This will prevent the muscles in your underarm from contracting too much, which will distort your perception of the area., The best position to perform a physical self-exam is lying down. This is due to the way the breast tissue flattens out evenly over your chest, making the tissues easier to examine. Lie down on your bed or couch with your right arm lifted above your head.


Some experts suggest doing the examination while standing, or doing one standing in addition to lying down in order to make sure each layer of tissue is examined thoroughly. This can easily be done in or after a shower. You can choose which works best for you., Using your left hand, feel around your right breast. Start under your right armpit and press down gently but firmly at first. This will help you feel the first layer of tissue under your breast. Make small circles with your three middle fingers using the pads of your fingers, not your fingertips. Move your finger circles up and down the breast tissue, kind of like a pattern you make mowing a lawn, until you cover the whole breast and underarm area., Once you have moved over your whole breast, move in the same pattern again, making sure to press harder this time. This will reach further into your tissue and examine the under layers of tissue.It is normal to feel your ribs as you do this.

, Once you have finished cataloging the breasts, you need to check your nipples for any irregularities. Using light but firm pressure, squeeze your nipple between your thumb and forefinger. Note any lumps or if it expels any discharge., Once you have made your way across your entire right breast and nipple, repeat the procedure from start to finish on your left breast. Switch the arms behind your head and use your right hand to examine your left breast.


The same procedure can be used to perform an examination while standing., If you feel any lumps, feel for the texture of them. Abnormal lumps of concern tend to feel firm or gritty, have irregular edges, and can feel as if they are stuck to your chest. If you feel anything that feels like this, call you doctor for an appointment as soon as you can to have it checked.


Many people have a hard time knowing which lumps in a breast are normal and which ones aren’t. One purpose of regular breast self exams is to get an understanding of which lumps are normal and which are new. If you are having trouble figuring it out, ask your doctor to show you what is normal and what isn’t. Your doctor may have a model that demonstrates this in their office.
If the lump is small and doesn’t feel this way, you still should contact your doctor to make sure there is nothing wrong. There is no need to panic. Eight out of ten lumps are not cancerous."

You can also try social services or the department of health in your city.
Talk to someone at a hospital. Some states offer financial assistance to low-income people when it comes to health care. A hospital worker may help you learn about such programs.
There are also organizations dedicated to breast cancer education that provide resources.

, Most doctors have websites that highlight their degrees and expertise. If the site offers a video of the clinician, watch it to see if you like his or her vibe. Even though you’re in the early stages, you want to ensure that your doctor can diagnosis you accurately.Start with those in your network if you have health insurance. If you don’t, still look into the physicians that are available to you.
You can also check doctor’s ratings online. Remember that one or two low ratings aren’t a big deal, but shy away from those who hardly have any positive comments.
Asking friends, colleagues, and family members for referrals is a great way to feel more secure, too.

, The first step that your doctor will take is to conduct a thorough examination, similar to a regular physical. Go to the appointment with a positive outlook and remain calm.Your doctor will ask you many questions about your general health, specific symptoms, and whether or not cancer runs in the family.Then, your doctor will look at the skin on your breasts as well as the nipples to check for any warning signs.Finally, your doctor will press on your breasts and armpit area to check for other lumps or problems., Another method that doctors commonly use is to conduct one or several types of tests that involve taking a picture of your breasts. This type of procedure will help your doctor determine whether or not the lump is cancerous and what the next step should be.A common test is the mammogram. It is a type of x-ray specifically for the breast and will zone in on specific parts of the breast so that your doctor can take a closer look.Alternatively or in addition, you might need an ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves to produce information about your breast, specifically regarding whether or not a breast lump contains fluid.If diagnosing you poses challenges, your doctor might also suggest an MRI or ductogram, which involve the use of dye to emphasize the appearance of breast tissues for further scrutiny., During a biopsy, the doctor removes a tiny piece of tissue from your breast. This is a common procedure that is not incredibly evasive. The results will help shed more light on what is going on.Two options are core needle and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Different needles are used to withdraw tissue from your breast. Core needle allows your doctor to take a larger sample.The stereotactic method involves a needle too, but before using it, your specialist will also take more images of your breast.With a vacuum-assisted biopsy, your doctor will numb and cut your breast to take the tissue sample.Finally, during a surgical biopsy, the doctor actually removes part of the lump. You will be medicated so that you don’t experience pain."

Try not to be annoyed by having to go to these appointments. Instead, be thankful that you are cancer-free!During most of the visits, you will just chat with your doctor about how you are feeling. If you feel tired, have gained or lost weight, or experience pain, let your doctor know.Occasionally, the doctor or nurse will take blood from you or give you an x-ray to rule out presence of cancer in the body.Of course, you may need yearly mammograms depending on what the lump was, so that you can ensure that no new lumps have formed., All is not lost even if you don’t receive a favorable diagnosis. In this modern age, there are many types of treatments and many knowledgeable doctors out there. Don’t be too proud or shy to ask for needed help.Feel free to get a second opinion. If your doctor doesn’t seem super knowledgeable or you just want confirmation from an additional source, see someone else for peace of mind.Get help with your pathology report.

Have someone in the doctor’s office help you break down unfamiliar terms.Ask your doctor pertinent questions. If the lump is cancerous, find out what stage you’re at and how it might influence your health and longevity. Inquire about other tests that you might be subject to, and learn about any timelines in regards to making decisions and receiving care., If you experience mental or emotional anguish during or after the screenings or follow up appointments, know that many other women are going through the same thing.

Mammograms will miss 10% of breast cancers that can be detected clinically.Many mammogram facilities will allow a woman over the age of 40 to make an appointment without a referral or prescription from their doctor.Talk with the doctor about any breast symptoms or signs, like breast tenderness, nipple discharge, or new lumps found on self-examination; inform her of any hormone use. Tell the doctor about your medical history, specifically any personal and family history of breast cancer.Then, the doctor will perform a breast exam and look for any abnormalities.
Follow the doctor’s advice about what signs, symptoms, and medical history are best to share with the radiology technologist who will take the X-rays on the day of the mammogram.
Have the doctor address any questions or concerns you may have about your upcoming study.;
, The Food and Drug Administration ensures the facility meets specific baseline quality standards for equipment, personnel, and practices.Do an internet search to find a facility near you. There is a Mammography Facility Database on the FDA website.You can call a local medical clinic or your health department for suggestions.

, Women with breast implants can and should get regular mammograms. Breasts implants can obscure breast tissue and interfere with the visualization of abnormalities and delay the diagnosis of breast cancer.The technologist most likely will take additional X-rays to maximize visualization of all breast tissue. He may try to manipulate the implant to move it away from the breast tissue.Capsular contractures or scar tissue around breast implants can make breast compression by the machine too painful or impossible. There is a risk of rupture. Let the technologist know if you are having too much pain., The mammogram involves having your breast gradually compressed. A woman’s breasts become tender before and during her menstrual period. If you are premenopausal, still menstruating, it is best to have the study in the week after your menstrual period ends., You will take these films with you to the appointment. It is your responsibility to make sure the copies are at the facility on the day of your appointment.The X-ray images of your breast will be analyzed by a certified radiologist. This type of doctor is trained to evaluate X-rays like mammograms and to suggest a diagnosis based upon what he sees on the films. She compares your current films to your old films, looking for any new abnormalities or if a previous abnormality has changed in size or appearance. This comparison is an essential part of determining if anything seen on your mammogram is suggestive of breast cancer.Give your old facility enough time to make copies of the X-ray films. Mammograms can be X-ray films or digital images sent directly to a computer workstation.It is possible for digital images to be sent electronically, but you will need to ask.
If your previous mammograms were performed at the same facility, just let the radiology technologist know on the day of the appointment. She will inform the radiologist.

, Caffeine can cause breast tenderness. Consider abstaining for several days up to 2 weeks before your appointment., Compression of your breasts during the mammogram is necessary, but it can be painful. Take steps to minimize the discomfort you experience.


Fear of pain or anxiety about the procedure should not be a reason to not have a mammogram performed. If your anxiety is great, your doctor may administer an anti-anxiety medication prior to the exam.
You can take a medication like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), or aspirin to try to ease any discomfort.Do not take any medications without first consulting your doctor.
You can take a pain reliever after the study as well. If you take medication before the study, make sure the suggested time has elapsed before repeating the next dosing.
Compression of the breast tissue is not harmful. There are advantages to having the tissue spread out evenly. It allows better visualization of any abnormalities. The superior tissue penetration allows for less radiation use. Blurring of the images is decreased because the tissue is being held in place., Products, such as deodorants, antiperspirants, powders, lotions, creams, or perfumes can interfere with the quality of the X-ray images.Grooming products can have metallic particles or contain calcium, resulting in shadows on the X-ray. This could be mistaken for or hide abnormal breast tissue. Avoid undergoing additional testing or possibly losing the opportunity to have a breast cancer detected early.

, You will need to undress from the waist up and put on a gown that opens in the front. Changing your clothing will be easier if you only have to remove your shirt., Anything around the neck will interfere with obtaining clear X-ray images of your breasts. Do not risk having neck jewelry lost or stolen because you have to remove it.

, You must check in before the mammogram is performed. The process involves confirming your identity and your insurance information. You will sign some papers, as well.


Ask at what time and where in the facility you are expected. Plan your travel time so that you arrive early.

, The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends sharing your personal or family history of breast cancer and any breast signs and symptoms, like lumps or breast discharge. Consider previous mammograms to be a part of this history.The technologist can focus on any suspicious areas and communicate that to the radiologist if you tell him about specific breast signs and symptoms. The technologist also will pass on any information about your personal or family history of breast cancer.

, The mammogram will take about 30 minutes. You will need to stand and change positions during this time. The technologist will work around any physical limitations.


You will stand in front of the X- ray machine. The technologist will place the breast on a platform which is raised or lowered to match your height. Proper positioning of your arms, torso, and head is key to obtaining high-quality X-ray images. Finally, a clear plastic plate will gradually compress the breast. Once the breast is properly compressed, you will need to stand still and hold your breath. This process will be repeated on the other breast."

Breast pain is very common and very treatable, and getting a medical diagnosis early can help you relieve pain and/ or get proper treatment for underlying causes.You can see your regular doctor or visit an ob/gyn, who specializes in treating disorders such as tendinitis.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check your pain as well as feel for abnormalities in your breasts. She will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as what type of activities you do and what medications you take.Bromocriptine, an oral medication, may be prescribed., Ask your doctor to prescribe a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory cream or purchase an over the counter option at a local pharmacy. This can help relieve pain and reduce swelling associated with breast tenderness.Apply the cream directly to the area of your breasts on which you feel pain., Because birth control pills often contain hormones, they may contribute to breast pain. Consult with your doctor about adjust the type or dose of pill you take, which may help to relieve breast pain.Skipping the placebo, or pill-free, week, may also help manage breast tenderness.Switching your form of birth control to a non-drug method may also help.Make sure to consult your doctor before stopping your birth control pills or changing them.

, If you are using hormone therapy for menopause or another condition, talk to your doctor about reducing or stopping your dosage. This may help relieve breast pain and tenderness, but may also have other side effects.Speak to your doctor about reducing your medications, going off of them, or trying alternative hormonal treatments., These drugs are short-term solutions for extreme pain and may be a last resort for those women who do not respond to other therapies. Speak to your doctor and consider taking one of these medications to help manage your breast tenderness.


You need a prescription from your doctor for both Danazol and Tamoxifen.Be aware that both of these drugs can come with significant side effects including weight gain, acne, and voice changes., If your breast pain is causing you stress, think about undergoing relaxation therapy.

Don’t get too discouraged if boys don’t always respond positively. From a young age, boys are socialized to be more aggressive and even rudeso it may take more time for a boy to warm up to you. Remember that if boys are rude to you when you are just being friendly, it says a lot more about them than it does about you.;
, Boy-girl friendships are most likely to occur outside of schoolso take this as an opportunity to pursue something you like and hopefully find some new friends in the process!


Find an activity that you genuinely enjoy. For example, join an intramural soccer team if you like playing soccer, but don’t do it just to meet boys! Boys are everywhere and, though there is a stereotype that they're only interested in sports, they have a wide range of interests too. So join a movie club or volunteer at the local animal shelter. Chances are, there will be at least a couple boys there who are interested in the same thing and you’ll be able to bond over a genuine shared interest.

, See if any of your other girl friends are also interested in becoming friends with boys and invite them to do simple things, such as sitting together to eat lunch. After all, there’s no law saying that friend groups need to be divided by gender.


If your girl friends ask you why you want to be friends with boys, explain that you are looking for platonic friendships. After all, boys make up about half the human population, so you are all going to need to learn how to interact with them in a healthy and positive manner sooner or later!, It always takes time to get to know another person and form a real friendship. This is especially true of boys, because they are taught to talk and share less about their emotions and personal lives as an expression of their masculinity.Activities as simple as going to the park, watching TV, doing homework together, or hanging out with other friends are all great, low-pressure situations which will gradually develop the friendship.

, Girls tend to be more physically and verbally affectionate with one another while boys tend to show they care through less obvious means, such as doing favors for each other.


Though your instinct may be to give your boy friend a hug when you see him, a simple wave and “hi” should suffice. Show that you’re glad to have his friendship by giving small compliments or offering to help him with a class he’s struggling with.

, Though this may seem like a cliché, it’s important to always stay true to yourself. Otherwise, any friendships you do make will be based on a false persona and it won’t be a real friendship.


Be honest about who you are, such as your interests, likes and dislikes, how you spend your days, etc. Even if you are into more traditionally feminine things, such as baking or crafting, that doesn’t mean you will always be excluded from having friendships with boys. After all, you may even find a boy who is interested in the same activity!

, Whether you’re hanging out with one or multiple boys, it’s likely that the time you spend with boy friends will be very different from when you’re with your girl friends.Knowing and being open to this difference will help you and your new friends enjoy your time together.


Going with the flow can be a simple as letting go of expectations of what you will do with your guy friends. For example, if you’re invited over to a new boy friend’s place, don’t be surprised or annoyed if you spend the next few hours vegging out on the couch and watching sports.

, While girls tend to get together to talk or unwind together, many boys tend to get together for a specific activity, even if it’s just playing video games or scrimmaging basketball.Knowing the basics of at least a couple of these typically masculine activities will increase the likelihood of boys considering you to be “just one of the guys.” You may even discover a new, previously unexplored interest!


If you’re already an active person, try taking up a new sport. If you’re a more sedentary person, explore what the latest video games are to see if any of them grab your interest. Even just watching a sport or keeping up with a specific team will give you a lot to discuss with your new friends.

, Boys tend to bond over jokes and often even make of each other.Let them know if they’ve crossed a line, but also realize that joking at others’ expense is a common male activity.If you’re getting picked on but you know that you are actually friends with the boy, come up with some funny rebuttals.


For example, if your friend makes fun of your poor performance in something, you can laugh along to let them know you aren’t too sensitive. You can also poke at one of their weaknesses in a funny way. Just be sure to keep it lighthearted!

, Watching is one of the best ways to learn how to fit in. While it’s always going to be clear that you are different from boys, you can make this difference less noticeable by noticing how guys treat each other and imitating them.


With this step, just make sure you are not going overboard. You should still display your natural personality but you can pick up little gestures, such as fist bumps as greetings and common topics that boys discuss and use them yourself.

, Due to gender norms and the sometimes unhealthy social environments in schools, don’t be surprised if you find others being unsupportive of your friendship or actively teasing you about it.


If other kids accuse you of being in a romantic relationship or otherwise tease you about your friendship, practice some basic comebacks such as, “He’s a friend who happens to be a boy, so what?” If you don’t get worked up about it, eventually other kids will get tired of teasing you and leave you and your friend alone.

, You may find pressure to turn your friendship into a romantic relationship but stick to what you want.


Even adults may inadvertently pressure you by asking questions such as, “Is he cute?” Let them know that you are not interested in his physical attributes and emphasize that you are just friends.
One study has shown that boys and girls often have a hard time maintaining their relationships because they are pressured to make it romantic or sexual.If your boy friend starts pressuring you to turn the friendship into a relationship, make it clear that you are only interested in him platonically. If he stops being your friend after that, then he never was really your friend to begin with and you’ll find other people who won’t pressure you into something you don’t want.

, At the end of the day, you make your own decisions about who you want to spend time with and how you want to live your life. Keeping this in mind will help you develop a stronger sense of self and not be overly affected by other people’s opinions.

Increase your breast awareness.,
Understand that the issue of breast self-examination is a subject of debate.,
Know what to look for.,
Do a visual BSE.,
Do a manual BSE.",How to Check for Breast Cancer1," Get comfortable with your breasts and be aware of what their ""normal"" state is. ""Normal"" is unique for each woman, but get to know how your breasts generally look and feel. Establish a familiarity with them and their texture, contours, size, etc. You’ll be better able to recognize any changes and then communicate those changes to your physician. In addition, becoming more aware can help you feel empowered as you take an active role in your own health and well-being.Increasing breast awareness is one of the best things you can do for yourself if you are concerned about breast cancer. By becoming aware of what is normal for you, you'll be better able to assess when something is abnormal.Note that even things like breast asymmetry, where one breast is a slightly different size or in a slightly different position, are generally completely normal.You generally should only have cause for concern if things change from the way they usually are (for example, one breast grows significantly larger, etc.).
If you have a spouse or partner, make him or her part of the process of checking your breasts and becoming more aware of your breast tissue. This is especially important because your partner sees and touches your body from a different angle and may be able to see things that you cannot. Ask your partner to communicate any changes s/he may notice or feel.;
, In the past, a monthly breast self-examination (BSE) was recommended for all women. However, in 2009 the US Preventative Services Task Force recommended against teaching women to do consistent and formal self-examinations after several large research studies concluded that BSE didn't reduce mortality or increase the number of cancers found.Subsequent studies have confirmed that BSE is of no importance in detecting malignant lesions in the breasts.At present, the American Cancer Society and the US Preventative Services Task Force recommend that BSE should be done at your own discretion. These organizations also emphasize that the real key is to be aware of what is normal for your own breast tissue.
Part of the pushback against BSE is because it can lead to unnecessary testing (such as a biopsy), which can cause harm to the patient as well as a financial burden on the healthcare system. The problem is that BSE may draw attention to benign lesions, whereas mammograms can identify those malignant lesions that are real cause for concern and medical treatment.Be aware as well that a BSE should never be done in lieu of a physician's clinical examination or mammogram. At best, doing a BSE can help you become more aware of what is normal in your breasts and can help you assist your doctor in detecting changes., There are a number of signs that you should be aware of when visually or manually checking your breasts for cancer, including the following:



Changes in breast size or shape - Swelling from a tumor or infection can change the shape and size of the breast tissue. This often occurs only on one breast but in some cases can occur on both.Your breasts may also change size during certain times in your menstrual cycle, so having an idea of what is ""normal"" for you at any particular time of the month is helpful.

Discharge from the nipple - If you're not breastfeeding, there should be no discharge coming from the nipple. If there is discharge, especially without squeezing the nipple or breast tissue, talk to your physician.Swelling - There are aggressive and invasive types of breast cancer that may cause swelling in breast, collarbone or armpit. In some cases, the swelling occurs before you can feel a lump.Dimpling - Tumors or growths in the breast near the surface of the skin or nipple can cause a change in shape and look of the tissue, including dimpling or puckering of the skin (like the skin of an orange, also known as peau d'orange). Look as well for a newly inverted nipple, which is also a sign of a problem.(Some women have naturally inverted nipples, which are not a cause for concern; a change from your normal state is.)

Redness, warmth or itching - Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare but aggressive type of cancer that presents with symptoms similar to an infection in the breast: a warming sensation, itching or redness., You can do this whenever you like, although it's a good idea to do it after your period, when your breasts are less tender and swollen. Try to do it every month at around the same time. You can even mark down when you do the exam each month in your planner or journal to keep track of it.In front of a mirror, sit or stand without a shirt or bra on. Lift and lower your arms. Look for any changes to the size, shape, tenderness, and appearance of your breast tissue, using the above signs as your guide.
Then place your palms on your hips and flex your chest muscles. Look for any dimples, puckers or other abnormalities.

, Devote a set time each month to do a manual BSE. If you are still menstruating, the best time to do this is a few days after your period when your breasts are the least tender.You can do the examination lying down; in this position, the breast tissue is more spread out and thus thinner and easier to feel.Another alternative is in the shower, where the soap and water can help your fingers move more smoothly over your breast skin. You can also do both methods, in order to maximize the examination.Follow these steps:


Lie flat and place your right hand behind your head. Using the first three fingers of your left hand, palpate (feel) the breast tissue on your right breast. Be sure to use the pads of the fingers, not just the very tips. Feel for anything that feels hard and round.Start at your armpit area and work your way towards the center of each breast. Move across to the middle of your body until you only feel the sternum (breastbone).Use three different levels of pressure to feel the tissue: light pressure at the top for tissue just under the skin, medium pressure to check tissue in the middle of the breast, and deeper pressure to feel the tissue closest to the chest wall.Make sure to apply each pressure level to each area before moving on.Once you've done one breast, do the other. Put your left hand under your head and perform the same exam on your left breast.
Squeeze each nipple gently to check for discharge.Remember that your breast tissue extends to the area near your armpit. This area can also develop lumps or cancer, so it's important to check there as there during your manual BSE."

, If you are in school and are working with someone that is unpopular, be nice and listen to what they want to say.

, No one likes a show-off, especially if they do it all the time. If you want to brag about something, don't prolong it, and do it tastefully.

, There's nothing wrong with being shy. But lighten up a little. It'll be hard to attract friends if you're anti-social. Talk to new people. Meet the new kid in school. Introduce yourself to the person who sits behind you in math class. More people will want to be around you.

, The qualities and character you build from doing the above will shine through, and people will love someone that will smile during the hardest of times. Try not to frown, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile!

, Learn to listen. Be a friend. Don't gossip. When you're given a confidence, keep it. Be responsible. Own your actions. Keep your values. They are the only things you truly ever have. When you lose them, you lose everything.

, Not everyone will like you. A lot of people will act like they don't like you because they are afraid of what others will say. They are insecure. Deep down, they may not like you, but they respect you.

, If you don't, you won't be able to interact with your new friend that well."

Schedule annual ""well woman exams"".,
Get a clinical breast exam.,
Have the appearance of your breasts assessed.,
Undergo a physical examination.,
Stay calm and breathe.",How to Check for Breast Cancer2," These are yearly physical or pelvic exams with your gynecologist or family practitioner. You should see the doctor every year for a checkup, even if you are feeling fine. This is especially important as you age and your risk for developing certain cancers, including breast cancer, increases.


During the beginning of the exam, give your doctor an updated medical history. Breast cancer is often hereditary, so your breast exams will be even more important if there is a history of breast cancer in your family, particularly among a mother or sister.

, During your yearly physical or pelvic exam, your physician will do a manual check of your breasts for any suspicious lumps or other changes. If your doctor doesn't do this, ask for it. Physicians are trained in how to do a breast exam and will know what to look for and what should be cause for concern. This is why you should never try to replace this exam with your own self-examination.If you feel uncomfortable, you can ask for a nurse or family member to be present during the exam. If you’re a female patient seeing a male doctor, this is typically standard procedure.

, Your doctor will begin by checking the appearance of your breasts. You will be asked to raise your arms over your head and then hang them down by your sides while the doctor examines the size and shape of your breasts.


The doctor is not judging your breasts on any aesthetic qualities. She is only checking to see whether they are generally the same shape and size, or if there are any areas for concern.

, While you lie down on the examination table, your doctor will use the pads of her fingers to examine the entire breast area, including the armpits and collarbones. The exam should last for only for a few minutes., If you feel any anxiety, take a deep breath and remind yourself that this is a necessary part of maintaining and being proactive about your health.


Remind yourself as well that breast cancer has a higher success rate of being treated effectively when it is caught early and before it has spread to other organs, tissues, and the bones.
Remember that you can always ask any questions about why your doctor is performing certain motions or exams. If you feel stressed out or uncomfortable, talk with your doctor.

Schedule an annual mammogram when you turn 40.,
Understand what the procedure does.,
Prepare for your mammogram.,
Discuss your breasts with your doctor and the mammogram technician.,
Have the test.,
Wait for results.",How to Check for Breast Cancer3," The National Breast Cancer Foundation recommends a screening mammogram every one to two years for women aged 40 and older. If you have a personal or family history of breast cancer or you notice a lump during a self-exam, your doctor may want you to begin having screening mammograms before you are 40 years old.Screen mammography for women aged 75 and older depends on the woman’s overall health. If she has a number of health problems, she is not likely not to be a candidate for treatment were cancer in fact detected. Thus, you should talk to your doctor about screening if you are 75 or older.For women who know via genetic testing that they carry the breast cancer genetic mutation (BRCA1 and BRCA2), screening should begin at age 25 and may also involve an MRI of the breast tissue in addition to a mammogram., A mammogram is an low-radiation x-ray that allows doctors to see your breast tissue. A mammogram can often detect lumps in your breast tissue before you can feel them.Although the doctor may be looking for potential cancerous growth with a mammogram, the test can also detect calcifications, fibroadenomas and cysts in the breast tissue., Find out if there are any requirements before your mammogram. You should not wear deodorant, perfume or lotion on the day of your mammogram, as these can interfere with the test reading.Be sure to wear a loose top that will be easy for you to take off for the mammogram.
Read up on the procedure to help calm yourself if you feel anxious. The test may be slightly uncomfortable but is over within a matter of minutes.

, They will need to know if you have breast implants, or if you are currently menstruating., In the mammogram, your breast is placed on a platform and compressed with a paddle to even out the breast tissue, hold the tissue still during the x-ray, and allow for the use of a lower-energy x-ray.


You’ll feel pressure and may experience some discomfort during the mammogram, but this is just temporary.
A mammogram will be done on both breasts so the radiologist can compare both sides.

, If the potential for breast cancer shows up in your results, you might need have further imaging testing, such as a breast ultrasound to look for cysts or an MRI to evaluate and differentiate a suspicious lesion from a benign one.If the mammogram and MRI detect a tumor or growth, your doctor may recommend an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy to determine both the type of cell growth and the type of treatment needed to treat the cancer (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, etc.). In a biopsy, tissue is removed from the suspicious area of the breast and analyzed in a laboratory. Most breast tissue biopsies are outpatient procedures, and you won’t have to stay overnight in a hospital."
"
Be aware of the basic risk factors for breast cancer.,
Be aware that your lifestyle can affect your breast cancer risk.,
Know your personal and family medical history.,
Be aware that most women diagnosed with breast cancer have NO risk factors.",How to Check for Breast Cancer4," Although being a woman is the main risk factor developing breast cancer, there are also a number of other factors that increase the likelihood that you could develop breast cancer, including



Age: Risk increase with age. Most people who have breast cancer are over 45 years old. Once you reach the age of 50, your risk increases ten-fold for each decade beyond 50.

Menstruation: If you started menstruating before you were 12 years old, or entered menopause when you were older than 55, your risk is slightly increased. In both cases, the risk is higher because of the increased ovulation cycles.

Pregnancy: An early pregnancy or multiple pregnancies can both reduce your risk. Having no children or getting pregnant after the age of 40 increases your risk of developing breast cancer.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Current or previous use for more than 10 years can increase the risk for breast cancer.

, Obesity, smoking, alcohol use, and shift work are all risk factors for breast cancer.Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese. A BMI greater than 30 is considered a risk factor for developing breast cancer, since fat cells secrete estrogen, which feeds many breast cancers.
There is also some recent evidence that long-term heavy smoking correlates with a higher risk of breast cancer. The risk is especially high among certain groups of smokers, such as women who began smoking before they had their first child. Research is still being conducted to determine the exact relationship between smoking and breast cancer.
Alcohol has also been linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer. The risk increases the more you drink alcohol. Women who consume between two and five drinks every day have a 1.5x higher risk than women who don't drink.
Recent research has suggested that women who work night shifts (such as nurses) may have an increased risk of breast cancer due to changes in melatonin levels. Further research is needed, however, before these findings will be considered conclusive.

, There are also risk factors related specifically to you, your family history, and your genetics, including:Personal medical history: If you have had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, you are three to four times as likely to develop a new cancer in the same or opposite breast.

Family history: You are more likely to develop breast cancer if one or more close blood relatives in your family have had breast, ovarian, uterine or colon cancer. Your risk is doubled if you have a first-degree relative (sister, mother, daughter) with the disease. Having two first-degree relatives triples your risk.
Genes: Genetic defects found on BRCA1 and BRCA 2 can dramatically increase your risk of developing breast cancer. You can opt to find out if you have these genes by contacting a genome mapping service. In general, approximately 5-10% of cases are related to heredity.

, The majority of women don't exhibit any of the above and are no more or less likely to breast cancer than anyone else. As a result it is imperative that women practice the above guidelines regarding breast health and that they notify their primary care physicians if they notice any changes in their breast tissue."

First, the way you look is very important.,
Nails are also important.,
Smelling good.,
Skin.,
Dressing.,
Attitude.,
Friends.,
Be yourself.",How to Be a Popular Girl but Not Stuck Up," Sadly, looks are one of the first things people judge you on. So when at school your hair should be down with hairbands or clips in it. However, if you have a sports lesson that day, maybe try to put it up in a messy bun or ponytail. If you have short hair you are lucky because as long as you hair is clean you can pull off most styles. You should clean your hair every other day.;
, If you go to a private school, then you should avoid having bright coloured nails. Try a french manicure or just a clear polish. If you don't go to a private school you are lucky as you can wear any colour unless it is against the rules but try to stay away from neon colours. At weekends, wear all of your bright nail varnishes and polishes.

, The way you smell is very important. Nobody is going to want to hang around with someone who smells foul. Shower everyday, and use a nice smelling shower gel. I would recommend Soap and Glory, but never use any products tested on animals as these are easily detectable! Wash your hair every other day with nice smelling shampoos and conditioners.

, Think of Massie Block, is her skin red and spotty? No. It doesn't matter if you have acne, you can still have amazing skin. All you have to do is work a little harder for it. Go to your doctor and ask for a special cream for it and moisturize all over your body everyday. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend ""Burt's Bees"" as it makes your skin smooth, soft and it lasts a long time. If you have sensitive skin stay away from scented creams. If your skin is perfectly fine you can use any creams but again I would recommend ""Burt's Bees"" and use it all over your body everyday.

, If your school has uniform then find out what its rules are and see what you have to work with. Here are some ideas. Wear ballet pumps. If you wear a blazer add cute badges to it like flowers and bunny rabbits. Carry a girly bag, for example a pink bag with flowers and smiles. If you go to a school without a uniform, then wear whatever you feel comfortable in but try to make sure its as cute and girly as possible. Cher from Clueless wheres knee high socks with blazers and white shirts. The girls from mean girls wear mini skirts (try to avoid the very short ones though) and cute slogan t-shirts. Lastly Massie Block and her friends wear anything designer. try to follow their examples. If you can afford designer clothes, don't worry just try to find things that don't look cheap and tacky.

, Smile at people around you say hi to anyone you meet. That's the thing about the girls in movies. If they were real then people may envy their looks but a lot of gossip would go round about them too. Never start rumors because it the end your hurting someone and they will probably start one about you in return. Always act carefree as if nothing bothers you. If someone insults you then just laugh it off as it shows confidence and the person will be annoyed that there insult hasn't bothered you.

, Find good friends, if they are pretty and popular it helps but it isn't too important. Find friends that you an trust, have a laugh with and will be there for you when you need them. In return be there for them and surprise them once in a while with cute little things to show them how much you love them. Don't be boring and certainly make sure that you surprise them every once in a while. Host parties, sleepovers, days out and take plenty of photos to put on your Facebook or Myspace and put them around your room.

, Yes you have heard it a million times but nobody wants a faker. Be bubbly and stand up for your friends and what you believe in.

Meet up outside of school.",How to Make New Friends in High School," If you want to find new friends, you’ll need to start by finding new people to be friends with.


Clubs are a great option because they provide a structured environment for you to interact in and can expose you to people with whom you already have something in common.
Depending on your interests, you can consider joining a service-oriented club, a language club, a gaming club, a literary magazine, etc.;
, Being on a team provides built-in camaraderie and gives you frequent and structured opportunities to hang out with and talk to the same people.If you’re unsure of your sporting ability, try joining a recreational league. They’re more casual and less competitive. Also, recruiters may appreciate the fact that you have taken the initiative to learn a sport and then try out (if you want to make a team).
If you have some athletic ability, look for a team sport where that ability will be most appreciated. If you’re a good runner, for example, consider joining a soccer, lacrosse, or cross-country team.
If your skills are more academic than physical, join the debate team, Model UN, Scholars Club or similar. There is a whole new world you may be missing full of intelligent high schoolers.

, Electives are another excellent opportunity to collaborate with people who share a particular interest.


Electives like journalism, yearbook, and theater all offer the chance to get to know new people while collaborating to produce something tangible.
Many electives also involve staying after school, which may on the surface not seem that great, but staying after school with a group of people allows you to get to know each other in a more relaxed setting, away from the daily monotony of school, and to build camaraderie.

, Both working and volunteering are good for your resume and for your social group.


Volunteering can be a great way to meet people from different backgrounds and age groups. Look for local volunteering clubs on campus, or check out different volunteer organizations in your town.
Working will expose you to people you can talk to on a regular basis with minimal pressure, which can be ideal if you have a hard time approaching people. Look for a job where you’ll be working with and talking to a range of people and avoid jobs where you’ll often be isolated or on your own. Some schools have OJT (on job training) that happens during the school day.

, It may seem obvious, but social events are designed to be, well, social. If you're not an outgoing person, social events are a way to exercise your communication skills. It really helps, because people will approach you more when you are getting around different events.


Dances, parties, town events, and rallies can all offer you a chance to meet new people in a socially conducive setting.
If you’re shy, try to find another person or an acquaintance to bring with you. Often having a familiar face nearby can help you feel more at ease and less alone.

, Looking blank, preoccupied, or frustrated will not invite people to approach you. And if you want to make new friends, you want to be as approachable as possible.


Smile. Offering a friendly smile makes you seem more likeable, will put people more at ease, and will make them feel more comfortable engaging with you.
If you feel weird randomly smiling at strangers, you can instead consciously put in an effort to have an open, friendly expression on your face rather than a closed-off one.

, Approach people who are already acquaintances and try to develop the relationship further.


Look for opportunities to talk to your acquaintance and learn more about them and what they like. If things go well, invite them to do something with you outside of school, which will help you develop the acquaintanceship into a friendship.
Ask people you know to introduce you to other people. If you know someone who’s part of a different clique or involved in an activity you’re interested in, ask them to invite you along.

, There are various social meetup groups that are organized online and can expose you to a whole new set of people based on your shared interests.


Notice, though, that these are only helpful if they’re specifically oriented around actual, physical meetups.
Don’t try to make friends using only Facebook or Instagram. It’s not that nobody has ever made a friend on a social-media site, but those friendships tend not to go anywhere unless you physically hang out. And some people are put off if a stranger or a relative stranger approaches them online wanting to be friends.
Do, though, offer to connect with a new potential friend on social media. If you’re getting along well with someone, ask them to add you as a friend or follow you on Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

, Approaching someone at the wrong time can sabotage your chances before you really even get started.


Don’t try to start a conversation at an obviously bad time, like in the middle of a quiz or while the person is distracted by other things that seem to be commanding their attention.
Realize that some people don’t like talking in certain situations. Some people don’t enjoy talking while riding the bus or wiping the cafeteria tables. If they don’t seem to warm up to your attempts to engage them in conversation, let it go., The adage that people like to talk about themselves turns out to be largely true. And questions are also great icebreakers.


If you don’t know how to start a conversation with someone, begin with a question like, “What’s the homework?” or “Who are you taking for biology?”A good way to get closer to someone is to ask them questions about themselves.Ask questions about their hobbies, their family. their pets, etc. If they tell you about something they did or accomplished, ask them how they got into it and why.

, Key to getting to know someone is listening carefully to what they say.


Show that you’re giving them your full attention by holding eye contact, nodding your head, and pitching in small comments here and there to show you’re following the thread of the conversation.
As you ask the other person questions, listen carefully to their answers to find out what the person is most interested in or passionate about. If one topic doesn’t elicit much of a response from them, don’t keep asking more questions about it. Instead, move on to another topic. Once you find a topic the other person seems excited about or has more to say about, ask follow-up questions and pitch in your own thoughts to keep the conversation going.

, People feel more at ease when you mirror their body language--subtly. Don’t pantomime their every movement, just subtly adopt similar body postures.If they’re leaning forward, do the same. If they’re sitting with their legs crossed, cross yours.
If they’re showing negative or closed-off body language (arms crossed, legs crossed while standing, or hands in their pockets), don’t mirror the negative body language. Instead, take that as a cue that they’re not feeling at ease. Adopt an open body language (leaning forward if sitting, arms at your sides with palms out, shoulders back, and legs shoulder-width apart, with feet towards the other person if standing) and try to redirect the conversation to something that elicits a more positive response.

, When you’re nervous or tense, you make other people nervous or tense--which most people don’t like.


Don’t psych yourself out. Practice quieting the doubting voice in your head telling you “you look so awkward right now” or “they’re just going to laugh at you.” Realize that it’s only the voice of insecurity and it doesn’t have any actual merit.
Breathe. When you’re nervous you tend to hold your breath or take quick, shallow breaths, which perpetuates your nervousness. To calm yourself, take several full, deep breaths before approaching the person you want to talk to and remind yourself to keep taking deep, regular breaths throughout the conversation.

, Sharing too much about yourself too quickly can be off-putting.Don’t tell the other person your entire life story. Not only do they probably not care enough to listen to you talk all about yourself at this point, people tend to see people who overshare about themselves as having poor boundaries or being self-obsessed.
When first getting to know someone, keep the personal details fairly general. Don’t get into details that might make the conversation awkward, like your cousin’s stint in jail or your sister’s habit of eating paper towels.

, While getting to know someone new, it’s helpful to start off with structured activities that will take the pressure off of one-on-one conversation.Good ideas for structured activities include going to a movie, a play, or a sporting event. That way you’ll both have something to focus on and to talk about, and you won’t have to try to carry the entire conversation yourself.
Once you feel more comfortable, you can move on to some equally structured but more interactive activities like playing basketball, miniature golf, snowboarding, ice skating, or going to a museum.

, It takes time to make friends. Don’t try to rush it or force it, just be patient and persistent.


If you get the sense that a person just doesn’t want a new friend, or if they’re repeatedly giving you excuses why they can’t hang out, let it go. If you keep pressing, they may become hostile.
If getting to know someone doesn’t pan out, don’t give up. You’re not going to click with everyone you meet, and some people just don’t make good friends. If they don’t want to start a friendship, don’t take it personally; they may have any number of reasons for retreating that have nothing to do with you.If you seem to get shot down by every person you approach, though, reconsider how you’re presenting yourself. You may be coming on too strong or inadvertently saying offensive or off-putting things. Talk to a trusted family member about what you might do differently.

, Whether they agree or decline to hang out, don’t over-react one way or the other.If they agree to hang out, smile, say something positive, and move on. Seeming to be too eager or overly excited can make them distrustful or dubious of you.
If they decline your invitation, don’t freak out. Just calmly say something like, “That’s okay. It’s been fun talking to you” and leave it. Don’t get mad or act crushed. Just take it in stride.

, Don’t start beating yourself up or telling yourself you’ll never make friends.It’s okay if you feel somewhat hurt if someone doesn’t respond positively to your overtures. Recognize that it can hurt to feel rejected, but don’t fixate on that feeling. Acknowledge it and move on.
Remind yourself that you won’t be friends with everyone, and, more importantly, you likely don’t want to be friends with everyone. This person may have turned out to be a really crappy friend, and you may have actually just dodged a bullet.

, If your friend can trust you with a secret, don't spread it or tell anyone. Even if you think you can trust the person you are telling, don't take a chance on it. Your new friend would probably be very angry if they found out you'd been gossiping about them!


Wait a few weeks before you tell them one of your secrets; make sure you can trust them first. Observe and watch their actions, do they gossip about other people?

, Unless it's just something funny or everyone is talking about it, try not to gossip around your new friends just yet. After a month or so (when you fully trust them), you probably can begin to gossip. Just make sure you're not speaking poorly of others behind their backs.


At all costs, avoid talking about your friend behind his/her back. If they find out, then you're in a lot of trouble and you could be excluded from the group.

, Social media is a great way to make new friends at school. Find out a couple of your classmates' social media handles and add them. You can also find out their interests and maybe it will help you spark up some conversation.


Social media is also a great way to start up conversation. Take Instagram for an example; send a couple of Direct Messages and text your classmates. You may find out a few facts about them, their hobbies and interests. This will be great for starting up conversation in class.

, Invite a few classmates to hang out; you could do all sorts of fun things and even have a sleepover. This way, you will have the opportunity to spend a few hours together and create friendships.


Go places like a theme park or just the local park. It would be fun for the both of you.
Don't bore your friend. Make sure they enjoy themselves as much as you enjoy yourself.

Make sure they're all mature, friendly, nice people who also know how to have fun.;
, You don't want to have only ten people on your friends-list do you? Get out there and mingle! Since you're in high school, try joining extra-curricular clubs and visiting other forms at lunch. If you take a bus to and from school that's a great way to get to know people from other schools.

, Use your page regularly and take the opportunity to message people with it! Also, try to look at other peoples statuses (like, comment) so that they are more likely to look at what you're up to but do not become annoying!

, Chav-popular or classy-popular. Naturally this article is about being a teen socialite which means you want to be the latter. Despite that, some of you will fall into the trap.

, At this point it's about striking a balance.

, In most schools you are supposed to be getting a level six at year eight, so aim for a level seven. Put in the time to study, even if it means putting school first. As an adult, it will be far easier to become a real world-famous socialite if you are clever.

, It's there to highlight your best features and improve the ones you don't like, not to create new features or make you look like a clown!

, English fashion is very different to American or that of any other culture which is why it's so important to read this step - especially if you're not native to the UK. The main fashion is a long-thin cardigan, jeggings/leggings, a top and a small purse. Don't go along with that. Choose one of the key trends making it's way through the country and then do what you want with the rest of your outfit. But remember the whole time: Class not crass. This means not too much cleavage, stomachs shown rarely (i.e. loose tops with trousers and NOT skirts lest they be maxi skirts), no hotpants either!

, Since we're in the UK, unless you're in 6th form, your school will most likely have a uniform. Stick to this uniform and don't push the rules too much. Roll up your skirt a notch, but not so that everyone can see your knickers.

, The clue is in the name - Socialite. It's a good idea to buy yourself a diary to write down upcoming events. This is why it's so good to be friend-ish with a lot of people, you get invited to their parties. If nobody has invited you to an event, organize your own!

, It could be a celebrity, a book character, a person you know. Anybody. They have to be mature, law-abiding and classy. Somebody that embodies what you want to be. Don't become a complete copy of them, keep your own identity.

A girl may not be comfortable with a stranger walking up to her and starting a conversation out of the blue, but if she's seen you around and you've seen her around, that barrier falls. You're no longer scary. Are you in a few of her classes? Do you share a hobby? Great.


It's actually proven that humans like things the more they are exposed to them. It's the reason the same song gets played over and over on the radio and why commercials get repeated endlessly. So the more she's exposed to you, the more she'll be inclined to like you. In psychology, this is called the mere-exposure effect (in case you were curious).If you have to, put yourself in her line of fire. Does she always sit towards the left side of the classroom? Can she be found at a certain Starbucks on Wednesday afternoons? If you know where she'll be, be there once in a while. As long as you're not breathing down her neck, you're on the right track.;
, Okay, now that you both know who each other is and that you have a certain something in common, you've got to interact with her. It can be as simple as a passing remark about your teacher's ridiculous tie or a question about what time practice is next week. Don't be afraid to start off small -- after all, you've gotta start somewhere.


She's a girl. She's just a girl. There are billions of them on this planet. When you ask her a question or make a funny comment, you will not spontaneously light on fire and the world will not explode. If she's friend material, she'll be happy to respond. Most girls are no different from guys when it comes to conversation.
Don't come on too strong! Friendships develop over time and it can really make a girl uncomfortable if you start treating her like your best friend when you've only just met, especially if she's shy or socially awkward.

, Lots of people are shy when it comes to reaching out to others. She may love to have a new friend like you, but she might not make herself vulnerable and put it all out there on the line. Be bold and amp up the conversation. Ask her her opinions on things, questions about your classes/hobbies/mutual friends, and just keep the conversation going.


Take note of what she's wearing, carrying, or seems interested in. Be observant. Does she have wikiHow pulled up on her phone? Awesome -- you read this sweet article the other day on how to regain control of a spooked camel. What's her favorite article?

, The simplest way to become someone she wants to be around is to make her laugh. When she thinks of being around you, she thinks of having a good time -- bingo! You're in. Feel out her sense of humor and keep the good times rolling.


This is a way to also keep the situation light and fun. Making her laugh lets her know that you're just trying to have a good time, whether it's the middle of 5th period history that's a total drag or after a particularly intense practice that took all Thursday night. Brighten her day and she may want you around. However, don't just be the class clown all the time; that will make you look one-dimensional and, frankly, kind of boring after a week or so.

, Girls need to know that you respect them and value their companionship, even if you don't want to date her. So while you need to think of her as a normal person, refrain from being a dude's dude around her right away. Hold a door for her, cover her if she's short on change, text her if she's going through a tough time, tell her she looks nice before a big event -- the small stuff.


Be delicate with this. While a certain amount of flirting can be nice, it has to be within reason and done right. You don't want to mislead her! Just think of yourself as a gentleman around her.

, This step has absolutely nothing to do with making friends with girls and everything to do with just making friends. Do you have any friends that don't add something to your life? Probably not. So be of value to her. What ""value"" is depends on you. What are you good at? What do you know? Why should she want to keep you around? What makes you a good friend?


And yes, there are answers to all those questions. Maybe you're really smart, funny, or know lots of different people. Maybe you've traveled a lot or have an interesting hobby. Zero in on what makes you you and put that out there. If you're smart, help her with a class; if you're funny, keep her laughing; if you're well-connected, introduce her to some new people she might like. Make yourself valuable.

, Girls love compliments that are genuine. As long as you keep it clear that you're not hitting on her, she'll love the praise. Is she wearing an awesome Daft Punk shirt? Tell her! Did she do great at the volleyball game last night? Tell her! Everyone loves feeling good about themselves. Make her feel that way, too.


This is a touchy one. You do not want to tell her, ""Your eyes are like pools of moonlight that see into my soul."" Nor do you want to tell her, ""Ohmigod, you're so smart!"" when she just got a D on an exam. Your compliments have to be well-placed and genuine. Girls can tell when a compliment is forced and fake. Try turning things around and complimenting her in a subtle way.

, The iPod, the laptop, the books, the guitar, you know the drill. Both of you should feel it's okay to share treasured things with one another. Don't just suggest it out of nowhere or it might look like a technique. Wait until the opportunity presents itself.


Or, you know, create the opportunity. Did you miss a class the other day? Ask to borrow her notes. Does she have the 4th season of Archer? Aww, man, you gotta borrow that right now! The street runs both ways, for sure, but you can start it. When you ask to borrow things from her, it cues her that it's okay for her to borrow things from you.

, Since you're cracking jokes here, there, and everywhere, she's probably going to throw in a few, too. If they're not funny, let her know by changing the topic or slightly modifying what she said. Laughter will bond the two of you, even if the joke isn't Facebook status worthy.


Friends give each other a certain amount of crap. Even though she's a girl, there is still crap to be given! If she throws out a particularly bad joke, you're allowed to tease her a bit. This interaction somehow builds solidarity and as long as you're good-natured about it, she'll respond with a smile.

, She should know that she can count on you through thick and thin. You'll offer her a shoulder to cry on when her relationships go wrong. You'll drive her to the station in the middle of the night to get back to her family in the pouring rain. That you'll study with her for a really hard test. This doesn't have to be said -- after enough time, it'll be understood.


Girls get emotional. When she gets like this, it's important just to listen. She may not want an actual solution, regardless of how much she's complaining. Being there, listening to her, and telling her she can handle whatever she's going through is infinitely valuable on its own.

, If they want to date her, it's fine by you but you're always keeping an eye out for her. That'll keep them on the straight and narrow too. And that's what being a true friend is all about. After all, she's like your sister, but better (no fighting over the bathroom).


Let your girlfriend know she's your friend, period, too! Sometimes girls get a bit intimidated by other girls; if you approach this topic like it's no big deal, your lady should (hopefully) not have a problem. Heck, maybe the two of them will even hit it off!

, There's a school of thought that says guys and girls won't always be ""just friends."" At one point in time or another, either she'll have feelings for you or you'll have feelings for her. If this does happen (which it might), stay open about it. The absolute worst is living in a does-she-or-doesn't-she state of mind. Avoid this by being direct.


And because you're such good friends, you can do this! Hopefully she'll be direct with you, too. If you start to notice mixed signals and you think she might be developing feelings, let her know how much you appreciate her friendship. There are delicate ways you can tell her you're just friends without hurting her feelings. Nip the problem in the bud as soon as you can!

Seek out new and interesting experiences.,
Care about other people.,
Develop a talent.,
Try to be well-informed.,
Be humble.",How to Impress Someone1," Being a champion couch sitter and avid prime time TV watcher is not going to impress anyone. Seek out new experiences and, preferably, do things that other people do not normally do. Impressing someone requires doing something that makes an impression.

.

Care about what you do. If you try to achieve something you just could care less about, you are unlikely to succeed.
Be prepared for hard work. You will need to choose something that you care about enough to stick through difficulty. And there will be tough times--if it were easy, everyone would do it.
Do the right thing. Wanting to impress people is natural; we all want to stand out. But be sure what you are doing to impress others is not hurting yourself or other people. Trying to impress people with your shoplifting is a dangerous path, so is trying to impress others by taking reckless dares.
Aim high, but start small. Mastering a skill, or achieving a goal requires a number of steps to get there. Start with small, manageable changes to get there. Too big a leap and you might think what you are doing is impossible. For example, if you are trying to lose weight, start with cutting out soda and taking a 10 minute walk for a week.;
, It is very easy to get overly self-centered, trying to impress others in order to feel good about yourself. And it is natural to want attention and feel important. However, you want to do so in a way that is healthy and positive.

It is OK to work hard to shine, but you are a worthy person just the way you are. Even if you never impress anyone with your artwork, that does not make you any less of a person.
Find like-minded people. If you want to achieve something, it helps to have a community of people who have similar interests and goals. This is also a great way to build friendships.
You will not impress everyone all the time. Especially when starting out, you may not be impressive at all. And some people may not care what you do. That does not mean you will not succeed.







, Everyone is born with a set of gifts, and you can hone skills you already have with a little work. You can try new things and develop the skills you have always wanted to have.

Talent only gets you so far. Yes, some people have phenomenal abilities that are seemingly effortless, such as child prodigies. However, without learning, persistence, interest, dedication, and optimism, talent is pretty useless.
Stop making excuses like ""I'm not that kind of person"" or ""I'm not talented enough to try ____"": just go out there and try.
No one is good at things on the first go and really interesting skills take time to learn but learning them at all will impress most people.
A dumb or ridiculous talent can be a wonderful thing, if you handle it right.A funny trick is a great ice-breaker at parties, for example, even if it is good for little else.






For example, drawing is a good example of a talent which some people naturally figure out. But it is a skill that can be taught and actually does not require any kind of innate temperament or skill.

Learning to play the piano is also relatively easy and doesn’t take a lot of money to get started. Buy a cheap, used keyboard and start teaching yourself using our guide and some Youtube videos.

Try learning origami. This is a relatively simple skill to start learning but it looks very impressive very quickly. It also means that you’ll always have a cheap gift to give someone in a pinch.

, Stay up to date on the important news and political developments in order to be aware and ready to go when people start discussing those topics. You'll be able to chime in and join the conversation or even fill people in on aspects that they didn't know or understand.This will impress them.


Being well informed is useful because it doesn't require you to be super smart. Reading the newspaper and trying to understand politics doesn't require being a genius. But your knowledge and information can help other people make smart decisions in addition to putting you in a favorable light.
Just remember to always be curious and skeptical. Always question everything. People make mistakes and it's possible that what you have read or believed in the past has since turned out to be wrong.

, Of course, as you do all of these awesome things to impress people, you have to remember to be humble. Don’t brag or rub it in people’s faces that you do all these things. In fact, try not to tell them outright at all. Instead, let them see you doing these things in a normal way. This will make it seem more natural and also let you show off without looking like a jerk.


For example, when your friend invites you to a party, say something like, “I’ll try to make it but I usually volunteer at the church on Friday nights. I might have to be a bit late.”
When you're going to meet them somewhere, show up early. Start doing an impressive activity like reading a classic novel or practicing guitar. They'll catch you ""in the act"" and be impressed. You don't even have to say anything.

, Girls tend to like it when a guy has confidence. This may be especially for the girls who are shy themselves.



Be Pretty.







, It will help to not fumble your words. Think of what things you can talk about and what you would say. You can practice speaking to a friend or family member. You can also practice with a mirror.

, Being hygienic is always attractive. Girls definitely like guys who are concerned about their hygiene.

, Smiling can make anyone's day, especially a girl.

, If one of your classes or stairways has a door, open the door for her! It will make her feel really special. Also, compliment her on something, like her eyes, but don't go overboard.

, If you happen to lock eyes, smile! It can be very attractive. But don't do anything too cheesy, just a subtle, nice, reserved yet flirty smile. After a couple of days of doing this, if you're feeling brave enough and she looks in a happy mood, be playful and wag your brows! It's cute and funny, two things girls love!

, Brush up against her arm if you happen to be walking in opposite directions, but make it really gentle. Not a shove. Only do this in a slightly crowded area. If it's just you two in the hall, it will seem a little weird. And don't do this too often, maybe only once or twice.

, For God's sake, don't try to hold her hand before talking to her! You gotta get to know her first and it may make you look desperate. Never look desperate, or she'll feel like she's just a doll in a game.

, In conversations, the girl really wants the guy to go first. If you can't think of anything to talk to her about, try asking her 'What class were you just in'? Or maybe, if you share a class, ask about the homework, even if you already know it. Just talk about anything you can think of, maybe there's a dance or sporting event coming up.(This is when your ""practiced speaking skills"" would come into play!)

, Not every girl you like will like you back. Sometimes they just aren't interested- maybe they like you as a friend, they're not ready, or they just honestly don't want to have a relationship. Don't take it personally, there's plenty of girls out there, at least two of which are sure to like you!

, Take into consideration of the amount of time you're talking to her. Make sure her body language shows you if she's interested or not. Let her get a word in! If she's shy, go ahead and ask her a question. Avoid yes or no, or simple answered questions. Something like 'What's your fifth hour?' and then ask her what teacher she has. Hopefully she'll pluck up the courage to ask something back!

, Find her profile on Facebook and add her as a friend! Sometimes not everyone has a Facebook, so don't be surprised if you can't find her. But, if she happens to have a Facebook, send her a request.

, If you like football, ask her if she likes it! If you like art, ask her if she does too! And most of all, Have Fun! Make little jokes, but nothing too bad. Make sure she knows you're being sarcastic, but be subtle about it. Be nice about it. Girls like guys who can have fun and still be themselves!

End on a good note.",How to Hook up With a Guy As a Teenager," The first step to hooking up with a guy is to find the right place to do it. You don't have to go on a moonlit stroll or find the most romantic place in the world to start locking lips, but you should try to find a place that is convenient, isolated, and somewhat romantic, so you can start off on the right foot. Don't overthink it, though--sometimes these meetings happen naturally, and you can't plan every last detail or things are bound to go wrong.


He may be the one to get you alone. If you think that might happen, then just be prepared with fresh breath.
You don't have to create an incredibly sexy atmosphere here. Candles, roses, romantic music--all of these things don't matter as much to a teenage guy as they might to a girl, stereotypically. The guy is more interested in the hooking up part than the scent of the candles.;
, You can't just start kissing a guy without making some physical contact first. Guys love to be touched on the arms, shoulders, and chest area, so if you're standing close together, or sitting near each other, start naturally touching him in these places. Make sure he's touching you, too. If you start rubbing his arm and he does absolutely nothing, then you have a problem.


Take it slow, but not too slow. If you and the guy are alone and he likes you, he's probably waiting to hook up.
But remember: the guy is just as nervous as you are, if not more nervous. Guys are often expected to know what to do, and he may be just as clueless but will feel the added pressure of being expected to know what he's doing. Touching him with confidence will put him at ease.

, Once you've been touching each other a little bit, and that part may last a few minutes or only a few seconds, pull the guy toward you. To do this, make eye contact, maybe even smile a little bit, and let him see that you want more. He may even brush the hair away from your face. If he's more forward, he may begin to pull you in, but you can also give him a pleasant surprise by taking charge and putting your arms around his neck while you pull him toward you, or just by placing a hand near the top of his back to move him in your direction.


Though some guys like to take control, others will be relieved if you take over.

, Kissing is the first step to hooking up, obviously. You can start by moving toward his lips at a slight angle so you don't end up kissing each other head on and bumping noses. Start off slow, just by touching lips for a second or two, and then touch lips a little bit more firmly, until you really feel the passion of the moment. As your kiss intensifies, you may tilt your head at a more dramatic angle.


While you're kissing, make sure to keep your hands somewhat busy so they don't hang at your sides like limp fish. Kissing isn't just about the lip action, it's about the entire physical experience.

, Once you've kissed him with a closed mouth for a while, it'll be time to move on to French kissing. Don't be nervous about it: just slowly slip your tongue inside his mouth and wait for him to do the same. First, you can just play around by letting the tips of your tongues touch, or you can get more aggressive and slide more of your tongue inside his mouth.


Remember to come up for air every few minutes at least. You'll be needing a break.
It's okay if your mouths get a little covered in spit. Just wipe your mouth like it's no big deal because it isn't.

, French kissing isn't the only way to kiss your guy. You can also try a variety of kisses that involve sucking or gently nibbling on his tongue, nibble on his lip, use your breath more vigorously, or just mix it up between regular kissing and French kissing. There's no right way to do it and everyone has his or her preference; your guy may love French kissing, or he may love the variety instead.


Keep trying new things until you find a rhythm that works for you. If you do the same old thing for minutes on end, the hook up session will start to fizzle out.
Then again, if this is your first time really kissing or hooking up with a guy, enjoy the moment without worrying too much about keeping things fresh. If you're 14, 15, 16, or even older, you two may still just enjoy the novelty of kissing.

, The neck is a very sensitive area for guys, and they love to be kissed there. Once you've been kissing on the mouth for a while, keep touching his body while moving your head down to give him sweet, gentle kisses on the sides of his neck. This will turn him on guaranteed. Breathing some hot or cold air on his neck will make him even more excited.


If he really likes this and you're feeling brave, give his neck a very gentle nibble. But only do this if you're pretty comfortable with each other.

, Guys also love to be kissed or touched on the ear. Once you've kissed his neck, move your way up toward his ear and give him gentle kisses on his earlobes, at first. Then, if he responds well, you can start biting his ear lobes very gently. It's important to do this very lightly, or you could end up hurting the guy and ruining the moment.

Kissing a guy's neck and ears is easier if you're both lying down. But if you're not ready to hook up in a horizontal position, no worries.

, If you're wanting to take things to the next level and you're sitting next to each other and keep exploring each other's bodies, then you should try moving even closer to the guy to sit on his lap. You can sit with both legs hanging to one side of his lap, or even straddle him, if you're feeling more bold. Just remember that this is a pretty sexy position and will lead him to want something more.


You can keep your arms wrapped around his neck or touch his chest when you do this.

, Teasing a guy, if done the right way, will get him even more excited about hooking up. If you want to tease him, then give him a long, passionate kiss, and just when you feel like things are getting really hot and heavy, pull away for a few seconds and stare into his eyes. Then, lean in to kiss him again. Just those few seconds of deprivation will remind him how much he wants you and how good you make him feel.


This move should be tried sparingly, of course. You want to be playful not an actual tease.

, Whispering something sexy in the guy's ear will not only excite him just from having your hot breath on his sensitive earlobe, but also from hearing what you have to say. It doesn't have to be anything ground breaking: just say, ""I love kissing you"" or ""I love what you're doing to my body,"" and he'll be even more excited to hook up with you.


This should also be done sparingly.
As you spend more time together, you'll have a better sense of the guy's hookup style. Maybe he likes to take breaks to talk a little or to whisper into each other's ears, or maybe he's more into just hooking up.

, A guy's scalp is another sensitive part of his body, so don't underestimate how much he'll like having his hair touched. Gently touch the top of his head with your fingers, or run your fingers through his hair, either moving from the top of his head to the bottom, or the reverse. The area just above the back of his neck is especially sensitive.


You should do this while you're kissing, if you have the coordination.

, This is only for advanced hookup artists. If things are getting really sexy, pull his index finger in your mouth, suck it up and down, and make eye contact with the guy while you're doing this. Just know that this is a very suggestive move, and you probably shouldn't try it unless you want to take things to the next level., Let's face it: everyone has a different definition of what hooking up means. Some people think it just means kissing, while others think it means sex. So, if it means more than kissing to you, then you can move on to other things. You can let him reach his hand under your shirt and cup your breasts. You can start taking off each other's tops. You can touch each other's private parts over your jeans or pants, or even start getting down to your underwear. The important thing is not what you do, it's that you feel comfortable doing it.

, It's possible that the guy you're with will have more expectations for the hook up than you will. That's perfectly natural. But that does not mean you should do anything that you're not comfortable with just to please him, to avoid disappointing him, or to avoid looking like a tease. If you feel that you've gone as far as you can handle, whether that means just kissing or oral sex, then firmly tell him that NO, you don't want to do anything else.


If you're with a good guy, then he'll respect your decision to cut things off. If you're with a jerk, then yeah, he may get annoyed or upset. But who wants to hook up with that guy anyway?

, Think you're ready for oral sex? For real sex? Knowing if you're ready for sex is not so different from knowing when you're in love: if you know, then you know. If you're unsure...then you shouldn't do it. Generally, it's a good idea to only get more intimate with a guy if you really know and like each other, and if he's your boyfriend. Or maybe you're just a free spirit who likes hooking up there's no judgment here, but make sure you don't end up getting hurt if that's what you really want.


If you like the guy, you should hook up with him at least a few times so you can really make your mind up about him and get comfortable doing more.
Make sure you're both on the same page. If you think having sex will make the guy your boyfriend but he's just looking for a good time, then you have a problem.
In general, moving forward sexually does not mean that your actual relationship becomes more intimate; if you really like each other, then your relationship should be established outside of how far you go with each other.

, It goes without saying: if you are sexually active, then you should always use protection, no matter what. Any guy who tells you that he doesn't want to use a condom because it doesn't feel as good should not be trusted. Do you want to be a teenager with an STD? A baby growing inside you? Probably not. So, if you're going to have sex, make sure you use a condom every time and know how to put it on, and that you're also considering additional methods of contraception.


If you're sexually active on a regular basis, you may consider going on the birth control pill if your doctor thinks that's right for you. The birth control pill is taken every day and should be used in addition to a condom for extra protection.

, Once you've finished hooking up with the guy for the night, make sure you have a smooth exit. Tell him you had a great time, give him a sweet kiss, and say goodnight or goodbye. There's no need to be awkward about the fact that you both just hooked up; in fact, you should both be happy about it. Keep your cool and make sure you're on the same page about your feeling for each other before you try to hook up again.


Teenage hookups and relationships can be confusing, unpredictable, and downright frustrating. Remember to take it slow to make sure that you get what you want out of the relationship.

Consider how you feel after being with your group of friends.,
Think back to how or why your group friendship formed and try to figure out what's happened since.,
Consider whether you've changed.,
Consider whether your group friendship is having a demeaning or demoralizing impact on you.,

Look for reasons to remain in this group of friends.,
Take it slowly in forming new group friendships.",How to Know when It's Time to Find New Friends," The biggest sign that something needs changing is that you feel consistently upset or unhappy after spending time with your group of buddies. They may all continue to espouse the BFF virtues together but if there are cracks in the cohesion, you may be wondering if you really belong to this group.


Do you feel upset after spending time in your group of friends? Is this an occasional feeling or is it happening most times you all meet up?
Do you feel any sense that comments or actions are being directed toward you as a way of keeping you on the outer edge of the group?
Does being in the group leave you feeling moody or upset? Did you start the day feeling happy and positive but then end up feeling upset after being with this group of friends?
Does the group seems to thrive on constant drama or put-down antics? If so, it's likely that the group has transformed into a hotbed of competitiveness and distrust.;
, This can be fairly complicated because, unlike a single friend, group friendships tend to morph over time, as a friend is added here and there. However, seeking to understand what brought you together as a group friendship can enlighten you as to whether or not that reason is still there and, if not, whether its loss means the group no longer functions as a healthy source of friendship. While the reasons may be complex, here are some common possibilities for changes in group friendships:


A group friendship that formed in childhood, maintained through later school years and into adult life: In this case, although the bonds can hold for life, they can also easily fall apart with major life changes. Since people tend to evolve in the face of new pressures like career, moving across the country and marriage, new perspectives and ambitions can strain a childhood group friendship over time.
A group friendship from work: Sometimes it's just easier to hang out as a group in the workplace context. Unfortunately, this can disguise deep differences if the friendship group is taken beyond the workplace context. Or, it can disintegrate when one or more of you changes workplaces or career trajectories, leaving little common ground with the rest of the group.
A group of friends through your children: As you're raising children, you meet other moms and dads and bond over commonalities from diaper rash to college applications. Group friendships formed on the basis of being a parent can be very supportive and cathartic ways to learn about parenting issues and to offer support to one another. Equally, such a group friendship can be wrought with difficulty, as differences of opinion about parenting styles crop up, competitiveness over raising children falls into the mix and even arguments over how one child is treating another can become a little too personal. And most commonly of all, when the kids grow apart, so can the group friendship.
A group friendship formed over a common interest, be it a hobby, faith, education or other sources: In time, this type of group friendship can become strained where some members lose interest in the original reason you came together or change their whole ideas about it, as they mature and discover new interests.

, It can be one thing to think that it's everyone else who is changing and quite another to realize that it's actually you. This has both positive and negative aspects––while it is part of every human's journey to grow internally and mature throughout life, sometimes other people just fail to grow with you, or cannot accept you for who you have become. Whether you've changed for better or worse, the group friendship might have started to feel like a hindrance, a noose around your neck or just a tiresome bore. Do you find that you're more negative in this group, or do you get annoyed or stressed easily around them? Perhaps you think the group friendship has stopped enhancing your life and you feel it's holding you back from achieving or being what you really want. A good way to find out how much you've changed is to raise a discussion about topics that are now of interest to you and to see how responsive your group of friends are––if they seem disinterested, flippant or evasive, then it's probable that they're not willing to come along on your new journey.


If your current set of friends is creating sadness, pain or confusion for you, or you feel left out most of the time, realize that it's not your fault. First, internal change is healthy and for most, inevitable. Second, influenced by changes and peer pressure, sometimes group friendships change too, turning into something different from what they once were, and perhaps you just no longer fit what the group has evolved into. Rather than getting swept up into situations that you don't want to be a part of, or feeling down around these now-uncertain friends, accept that it's time to take action that will make things better for you.

, At one time, this group friendship may have been a source of both support and enjoyment. However, if you feel pressured to act in ways that don't represent who you are or you feel used up, the values underlying the group friendship have clearly changed in direction. If, for whatever reason, the group has become negative over time, this can result in behaviors that harm each member of the group even though everyone may think their behavior is ""normal."" For example, snitching, complaining, blaming, spreading rumors, indulging in doom and gloom and finding flaws in others all the time can be a sign that the group friendship mentality has turned totally negative and is feeding off itself. Things to consider include:


Does time spent with this group of friends cause you to turn gossipy and judgmental toward others? After spending an hour or two with these friends, do you find yourself judging others more harshly and freely, especially when being judgmental is not in your nature? In your overall impression, does your group seem to have developed a sneering attitude toward anyone outside of the circle?
Do you feel stressed and overwhelmed? Although friends should be there to support each other, do you feel as if you have turned into a sort of sounding board for the woes of your group of friends? Absorbing negative emotional energy from the group can drain you.
Do you feel that when you're part of this friendship group that you're pressured to not adhere to your original ideals or morals? Do you feel pressured to conform to a way of thinking that's against what you really think?
Do you find yourself making your decisions based on how your friends act and feel? Do you no longer feel as if you have control over how you act or the decisions you make? Do you feel judged if you differ from your friend or the group?
Does being part of this group cause you to shun other friends and family members due to pressure from the friend(s)? If the group's attitude pushes away the core support individuals from their life, it's toxic.

, You might be the sort of person who continues to give and give, generous to a fault. In a supportive group of friends, your friends will not only appreciate your willingness to give them support and help but they'll also refuse to take advantage of you, even pointing out where you need to take more care of your own needs instead. In a toxic group friendship, your generosity will not only be taken advantage of but you'll also find that it soon becomes all about ""them"" and never about ""you"". Being heavily vested in their wishes and wants above yours remains a no-win situation for you and isn't true friendship. Signs this might have happened to you include:


You lose a pet and your group of friends is either dismissive or even callous. They may fail to bother contacting you at all to give you condolences. If you aren’t feeling the love from your group of friends when a significant event occurs in your life, they're not interested in your well-being.
Your friends only ever want to discuss their problems––when it comes to your life, they don’t want to hear about it. By being a personal therapist to your friends, they've forgotten that you have feelings and needs too.
Your group of friends ditches you on your birthday or completely forgets your birthday. Any true friend should acknowledge important dates, so if you’ve been ditched on your birthday or any other significant day by you group of “friends”, it shows utter disregard on their behalf.

, This is a matter of self-honesty as well as combining the answers you've derived from the steps above. If you can list good, sound reasons for remaining, then perhaps it's worth giving the group another try. But if you're struggling at this point to come up with anything more than ""it'll be embarrassing to no longer be a part of that group"", then it's time to grow some courage and depart from their company.


Because “we’ve been friends forever” isn’t a concrete answer. Being friends for a lengthy amount of time doesn’t cut the mustard because people change and grow over time.
Reasons that revolve around so-called friends being your neighbors, co-workers or fundraising pals are not convincing. Friendship by virtue of being in others' presence for some shared activity or for reasons of geography is a matter of convenience but it isn't the bond that makes friendship real. If you need to spend time with these people for the sake of achieving something you're all working on together, at least stop kidding yourself that it's about real friendship and simply see it for what it is.
If you come up blank with any reasons why you are friends with this group, it's a total red flag. What's holding you back from moving on?

, After experiencing deep challenges with a group friendship, you might feel wary about forming another one. At least give yourself time before seeking this style of friendship again. Nurture the close friendships you have with one or two individuals to help rebuild your trust and sense of support. And don't be too concerned if you don't ever form a group friendship again in your life––sometimes being part of a group friendship is a temporal thing, bound by a particular situation in your life that has long since passed.

Go out of your way to make them happy.,
Remember the things they say.,
Care about the things they care about.,
Show your complexity as a person.,
Be unashamedly yourself.",How to Impress Someone2," The easiest way to impress someone that you are either dating or want to date is to go out of your way to make them happy. Do this unselfishly and just because you want to see them smile. They can almost always tell the difference. Try to base what you do on what you know about them and what matters most to them.


For example, you could bring your girlfriend an entire box of her favorite donuts when you know she's having a bad day. Include a note that says something like ""I tried to find something as sweet as you but they only had a dozen of these left.""
Another example would be to leave a fridge full of pre-prepared meals for a guy friend when you know he's sick or going to be very busy, so that he doesn't have to cook for himself. He'll be smitten.

, Pay attention when your significant other talks and log away tidbits of information for later, even if you have to write them down. Remembering small, off-hand comments that they make and acting on those comments can earn you serious points.


For example, maybe your girlfriend mentions off-hand, once that Valentine's Day is her favorite time of year because it's the only time when she can find conversation hearts, her favorite candy. Find a supply company and surprise her in a few months when her birthday rolls around with an entire bag full of the candy.

, Show your significant other how much the things that matter to them also matter to you. Doing things selflessly to make the people that they love happy or embracing a hobby that lets them shine goes a long way to show that you are above the rest of the competition.


For example, maybe your girlfriend is really into ballet. It might not be your thing, but you can take a few secret lessons on the side from a local community center and surprise her by taking her on a special date and dancing with her.
Another example would be if your boyfriend has an autistic brother whom he's very close with. Play with his brother and maybe even go out with him to movies or other fun locations. By genuinely connecting with the brother, you'll get to know more about the boyfriend's life. You'll also make it clear that you're a caring person.

, This is especially important when you're first getting to know someone that you'd like to date. Letting them see that you are a fully developed, interesting person can really surprise them if all they currently have to go on is a stereotype. Have opinions, show your passions, and do things instead of just sitting around.These all show them what they can look forward to when they're with you.


For example, you might be a closet book collector. Instead of hiding this maybe nerdy hobby, show it off instead. Let them see your collection and show them the book that reminds you of them. They'll be surprised and fascinated by your passion and hopeful that you can show the same level of enthusiasm toward them.

, When you focus on just being yourself, without shame or trying to hide what makes you happy or upset, you show a lot of confidence, and we all know how sexy and impressive confidence is, right? The ability to be comfortable in your own skin is also a trait many people feel like they don't have. When they see that you do, they'll be impressed and want to be around you more so that they can live vicariously and also learn how to be more confident just being themselves.

Work hard without expecting something in return.,
Take on extra responsibilities.,
Anticipate needs and solve problems, even if they don't affect you.,
Find ways to do more quality work with fewer resources.,
Be a supportive team player.",How to Impress Someone3," In order to impress your boss, a potential boss, or your coworkers, you should generally start by working very hard without expectation of reward.This makes you a selfless team player who works hard for her own merit. People will generally want to reward that kind of behavior and your bosses will be impressed, if they're aware enough to notice.


You should also do all of this work while keeping a positive attitude. Try not to complain too much and when you do bring up problems, remember to present them with a suggested solution and in a happy way.
For example, keep your ear to the ground for tech developments that could improve efficiency in your office.
Another example would be really pushing to get things done ahead of schedule so that you have time to do more work or to go back and make the work you did as good as it can possibly be.

, Another behavior which really impresses bosses, coworkers, and future employers is taking on more duties than you technically have to. Working the bare minimum is fine and doing it well will generally make people happy, but going the extra mile to make sure more gets done and gets done well will really catch attention.


For example, if your boss has a mindless paperwork task, offer to take it on for them so that they can refocus their efforts on improving the rest of the office.
Another example would be pushing to finish early and then cleaning up the office at the end of every day so that people can relax and focus on their work.

, A good worker doesn't just do the work they've been given; they also anticipate and look for ways to fix problems so that everyone can work better and the work they do can be higher quality.You should notice the problems that come up in your own day-to-day activities and look for ways that you can make those problems go away. However, if you also notice problems that plague your coworkers, you can also find solutions for those problems and suggest them, even if the problems don't affect you at all.


For example, lets say you notice that two coworkers aren't getting along because they both think the other is too slow at getting in the different pieces of paperwork that they each need to do their job. You can suggest a solution, such as a scheduling or process change, that helps their jobs both go more smoothly.

, When you find ways to do more work at high quality with fewer resources, you can generally save your employer a lot of money. As it turns out, they like that! Look for ways that you can streamline what you do and make your work, as well as the work that others do, more efficient. Your boss will be really impressed.


For example, maybe you've noticed that a piece of paperwork which is almost completely identical gets filled out by you and another person as well. Talk to your boss about having one or the other of you do both sheets, in order to fill them out faster and more efficiently.

, Coworkers, bosses, and future employers all love to see someone who's a great team player. Share the credit, even when you did most of the work. Compliment coworkers on their strengths and ask for their advice when you're working on something you know they know a lot about. Be similarly helpful when other people look to you for help. These kinds of behaviors show that you want to work with everyone to make sure that your company can do the best work possible.


This is especially impressive if you're in the under 35 crowd, because the older generations tend to see younger generations as poor team players.

Be your own person.,
Have a positive attitude.Strengthen your confident image with a smile for the whole world.,
Be cool, not perfect.,
Show your confidence with body language.,
Maintain an air of mystery.",How to Act Cool when You Have Few Friends1," Instead of trying to “fit in” with everyone else, set your own standards and live up to them. Dress how you like to dress. Geek out with pride over your passions. Show people that, for you, the most important source of approval is your own–not anyone else’s.Don’t take this to mean that you should be a contrarian! If other people’s values, interests, fashion sense, etc. happen to match yours, embrace them as your own. The point is to be authentic, however you present yourself.
Don’t stretch it, either. Again, the important thing is to be authentic, so don’t overreach to the point that you’re striking a pose and playing a character outside of yourself.;
, Recognize the “bad” in life for what it is, but don’t let it get you down. Being cool means that when problems arise, you are confident that you can solve them, so don’t undermine your image by acting defeated! Show other people that you are someone who is worth having around, regardless of the circumstances.


Treat failures as experiences to learn from, obstacles as challenges to overcome, and just about everything else in life as an opportunity to improve yourself!
Keep negative comments about others to yourself. Don’t be seen as someone who has to knock other people down in order to lift yourself up., Being confident means that you feel content with who you are, flaws and all. Avoid deluding yourself into thinking that you are superior to everybody else. Acting superior will make people think that you are doing just that: acting.Ask for help when needed. Don’t bluff your way through situations you can’t handle on your own.
Risk looking foolish. Show other people that you are brave enough to not care what people think, but also confident enough to laugh at yourself when you do end up looking ridiculous.
Voice your opinions during projects, debates, or casual chitchat, but concede with a laugh that you were wrong when other people prove themselves right., Feel free to make gestures to liven up your conversations, but in general, try to be still. Convey the sense that you are perfectly comfortable in your surroundings. Own the space that you are in by showing that you have no intention of fleeing. Move at a relaxed pace and keep your gestures small and languid.Keep your head still and your chin up. In conversation, always look people in the eye.
When you are standing, distribute your weight evenly across both legs. Own the ground you stand on. Keep your feet planted in place.
Sit still. Whatever seat you take, relax in it as you would in your favorite chair. Resist the urge to lean forward or bounce your legs as if you are ready to bolt at the first opportunity.

, When prompted, share your thoughts and opinions without fear, but refrain from oversharing, especially if no one asked for them in the first place. Avoid being confused as a bully or bragger. Share what's relevant to the moment, but leave other people wanting to know more about you, rather than wanting you to shut up already.If a conversation drifts into an area you know quite well, respond knowingly to comments other people make, but stop short of lecturing.
Leave all the really impressive things about you unmentioned. For example, if you happen to be talking about baseball, share your thoughts and opinions without mentioning the fact that you were the MVP for every team you ever played on.
Make people tease information from you. Frame your responses in conversations in a way that answers their questions, while creating even more about you, like, ""How could he/she possibly know so much about that?""

Stay together if you both feel like it could be something more.",How to Have a Summer Fling," Try to choose someone who isn't already attached to you. Avoid neighbors or friends because, since they'll be difficult to separate yourself from when the leaves start to turn. If you can, also avoid even just friends of friends. Look beyond your normal social group entirely. Good places to find a summer fling include the bar, the beach, a party, or even online. A good person for a summer fling is someone that's confident, energetic, and independent. That way, you can be sure to have a great time without letting him or her down rough.


If you're travelling for the summer, you will be in the best position possible to find a summer fling. You will be surrounded by people who will have never met a single person you know back home. You will also have a ready-made exit strategy: You're likely to be hundreds if not thousands of miles away from your summer lover come September.
If you're staying put, there are still plenty of options. Check out the dating scene in the nearest major city, beach town, or anywhere close but not too close to home. Be especially on the lookout for people who are just visiting for the summer.
If you're somewhere without a lot of people around, your best bet may be the Internet. Check dating websites and specifically look for people interested in casual relationships. Just be careful who you get involved with. It's best to make your first ""date"" in a familiar public place and possibly even bring a friend along.;
, Find out more about his or her personality and interests. Naturally, if he or she likes the same things as you, that's great. More importantly, look for signs that he or she would like to have a casual relationship. If his or her personality type is one prone to spontaneous adventures, you may have found perfect fling material.


You may also choose to use a summer fling to explore romance outside your normal comfort zone. You won't be worried about the relationship's future, so go ahead and try someone whose interests and lifestyle don't mesh with your own. Try someone who isn't normally your ""type."", A lot of communication is nonverbal. Look for the following in a potential partner that may clue you in to his or her interest:


He or she makes and holds eye contact with you more than other people.
His or her pupils dilate when the two of you talk.
He or she repeatedly touches you in a friendly way.
He or she is constantly fiddling with objects, especially when talking to you., While body language may clue you in initially, it's important to gauge each other's mutual interest as soon as possible. Remember that a summer fling has a much shorter timeline than a typical relationship. Don't take too long hoping that the other person will make the first move. Instead, be a little more forward than usual. Explain that find him or her attractive and plan a date together.Some examples of what you might say once you've found the right person include:


""Hey, you seem really cool! I'm looking for someone to have fun with this summer. Are you interested?""
""I'm only going to be in town for a couple months, and I don't want to miss the chance to be with you,"" is a good line if you're traveling.
If your potential fling asks whether or not your offers to ""hang out"" are platonic, be honest. If he or she asks if something is a ""date-date,"" don't be coy: ""Yeah, it's a date-date. I think you're really cute and want to spend more time with you.""

, Your partner should know you want a casual fling, not a serious relationship. Ideally, one or both of you will have a major transition at the end of the summer to make the break easier. This can be something like going back to (different) schools or traveling back home. If you continue seeing each other after the breakup, it will make for a tense, awkward relationship.


The best time to bring this up is when you're still flirting, before you've spent too much time together. Say something like: ""This summer I just kind of want to have fun, you know? I'm not looking for anything serious.""

, Try to do as many typical summer activities with each other as possible. Go swimming. Visit an amusement park. Hike a long, romantic trail. Book a cruise. Try to take advantage of the great weather and do as much outdoors as possible.

, Any type of sexual activity comes with the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). With a brief, casual relationship like a summer fling with a relative stranger, this risk can be greater. At minimum, be sure you and/or your partner use a condom. Using lubricants will also help prevent condom breakage and reduce transmission risk. Ask your partner about his or her sexual history and most recent STD test. Keep your partner's safety in mind and be honest about any STD(s) you may have yourself. Above all, don't feel forced to do anything you don't want to do.


Remember that there is no way to prevent STDs completely. Keep in mind that sex, just like every other part of life, will always carry a risk., Remember that the best summer flings are no-strings-attached. Keep yourself from being stuck with emotional baggage from falling for someone you don't want a long-term relationship with. Is there anything that makes you swoon for a guy or girl? Some specific city or type of date that you think is just super romantic? Avoid that like the plague.

, One great thing about a summer fling is that you'll have a ""standing date"" for all the fun activities you may not want to go to solo. Whether it's a barbecue or a concert, your partner will be there to make everything you do extra special.Avoid bringing him or her to serious occasions or to meet your family. Remember that a fling should be low-pressure and without commitment. Do you really want to explain that to your parents?
What you call your temporary partner will depend on your culture. In places where short-term romances are the norm, there's nothing wrong with telling others that you two are a couple. Likewise, calling him or her your ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" is generally fine. In more conservative climates, however, it may be better to just refer to him or her as your ""friend.""

, When you're away from the stress of day-to-day life, you'll feel like you're having a mini-fling within a fling.


Unless another couple or some friends tag along, save the road trip for the tail end of summer. You want to make sure your partner is completely trustworthy before traveling with him or her.

, When you've decided to bring your summer fling to an end, you generally have two options you can take:



The Honest Route: Ideally, both you and your partner are aware of the impending split. This stops any potential awkwardness dead in its tracks. After all, you had an agreement from the get-go. Just tell him or her the date you'll be leaving town or otherwise want to end the relationship. Then pack your bags (even just metaphorically) and move on to the next chapter in your life.

The Covert Route: If you can't bring yourself to be brutally honest, start planning your escape at least a week before you want to split. Figure out a good reason to break up, whether it's a surprise trip to study abroad or having to go back home to take care of your family. You could also just tell him or her that the relationship just isn't ""working out"" for you, even though he or she is a great person. The actual breakup should be clean and simple. Be sure to do the adult thing and break up in person, not over text or instant messaging. If you have trouble working up the nerve, remember that it's just a summer fling. Hopefully you chose a partner who can handle it.

, Reassure the person that the ending is for the best. You may want to use typical breakup phrases here to help them. Keep the break clean in order to avoid either of you holding onto the relationship. Make it clear that the summer fling has officially ended.

, Sometimes you may find yourself falling in love with a summer fling despite your best efforts. If the two of you won't be ""long distance"" at the end of summer, consider keeping the relationship going. Even though he or she may have agreed on an end date in the beginning, your partner may share your feelings."

Cherish your own personal God time.,
Keep in mind the reality that God is real.",How to Have a God Centered Dating Relationship," Knowing the love God has for you means that you do not have to seek fulfillment in how anyone makes you feel (a weakness of human love): the most perfect love comes from God, and it is always yours. He will do much more to fill the love-space than a person ever could. Approach your dating relationship knowing that God likes you and loves you, and there is plenty room for wonders of love, marriage, mature family love, i.e.: constancy (not fickleness) thus enabling you to build and love your own family, of course. (Christians: Always remember He sent His son, Jesus, to die for your sins.) Make sure you are strong in your loving relationship with God. This means knowing that He is always there to help you along the way. Trust Him. Make God the most important in your life. Make Him the love of your life.;
, Date someone that you would consider marrying. Choose a person that has a similar desire for God, one that will build you up in your faith. If you are already in a relationship, positively encourage one another in pursuing God. Help your boyfriend or girlfriend to keep God the focus. Understand that Christians are not to be ""unequally yoked"" that is, if they are not willing to accept the faith, the relationship might have to be sacrificed.

, Pray about your dating relationship. Give everything over to God. Let God know that you are asking His approval. Talk to God about the problems that arise. Thank Him for the opportunity to be in a relationship and the happy times you experience. You can also pray with your boyfriend or girlfriend. It is a good way to help each other out with whatever stresses life brings. By praying together, you are experiencing God together. Though, it could make the focus more about you two building intimacy—still there is a tendency to bring out one another's faults in prayer; therefore, avoid prodding, interrogating, judging; instead, help each other in order to build trust; love and forgive each other as the Lord's Prayer models for us.

, Make an effort to bring God into your conversations. Not only will it help in keeping God on your minds, you will also find out about each others beliefs. Talking about a spiritual subject changes normal conversation into one of eternal significance. Discussing God also allows you to build up each others knowledge and confidence.

, Keeping God’s words in your heart helps you to remember the love and promises He has for you. Try reading the Bible together. It is fun, spiritual and good for conversation. Different verses will help you along the way in your relationship.

, Make sure your boyfriend or girlfriend and you are active in the body of Christ. You will feel good about sharing God’s love. He calls us to serve Him.

, Hugs are great. God created physical affection to be good. But be careful in how much physical permission you give one another. A relationship can easily turn sinful if physical bonding occurs too quickly. Everyone is different. But if you feel guilty at all for actions, it may be good indication that you are going too far. Avoid physical actions that might cause lustful thoughts (such as sitting on lap, laying on each other or sensual kissing and massages). Save sex for marriage. Talk about your physical actions with each other, making sure you are both comfortable and feeling great. Understand what might be innocent to one or another might very well be dangerous to you.

, Make sacrifices for each other. Watch a chick flick. Go to a basketball game. Be willing to serve one another. Put one another above yourselves. Find how to show love to each other. Use the love God has shown you and bring it to your boyfriend or girlfriend.

, This will work to relieve stress in relationships in this World of troubles.


Cheerfully realize this is a package—not bits or pieces: ""Love, joy, peace, long-suffering (patience), gentleness (kindness), goodness, meekness (gentleness), faith (faithfulness) and temperance (self-control)... Against such things there is no law."", Galatians 5:22-23 KJV (parentheses NIV).Read those again and again...


, Smile and know that God is with you. Enjoy the life that God has given the both of you. Whenever you get the chance, praise God for whatever He has poured into your life. Trust and know that God has your back. He wants what is best for the both of you.

, Make sure you spend time alone with God. You need moments of reading the Bible, journaling or praying just between you and God. Since God is your ultimate love, it is good to have that time alone with Him.

, While having a special someone can bring great happiness in this world, realizing the eternally wonderful nature of God’s love is something you do not want to miss. God is real. His love is real. God is love. Realize that God is working in your life right now. His forgiveness is real and His promises are real. Give the love God has given you to your boyfriend or girlfriend. God’s love is perfect. Let Christ’s love reign in your dating relationship. Let the love you have for each other be a banner to the world displaying God’s goodness. Remember though, ""You are not your own, you were bought at a price"" - therefore God must reign in your relationships. We are called to be holy, because He is holy. We might very well have to ""honor father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even own life--""; our dating relationships are no exception. Remember, as C.S. Lewis has said, that love that becomes a god, becomes a demon. Submit all your love, therefore, to the one that is Love, and He, like a gardener, shall prune our loves which are so fickle and temporary by nature, into beautiful gardens which we may share with all our relationships including our dating relationships.

, When you are separated from the rest of the group, talk more about more personal issues. Find out if he's seeing anyone or if he's interested.

Introduce yourself simply.,
Be true to the situation.,
Share your discomfort.,
Talk less, listen more.",How to Act Cool when You Have Few Friends2," Start with the basics: “Hi, I’m Jim.” Unless the situation demands that you add some more specific detail about yourself, leave everything else unmentioned for now. Allow the other person to learn about you through natural conversation. Don’t force-feed them every factoid about yourself right off the bat. If you need to put yourself in some sort of context when you introduce yourself, keep it simple, like:“Hi, I’m Jennifer. I run track for Such-and-Such High School. I saw you run at last week’s invitational.”
“Hi, I’m Rick. I’m the birthday boy’s cousin.”
“Hi, I’m Susan. I was your sister’s lab partner in Biology last year.”

, We all have different sides of ourselves, so be the “you” that is most appropriate for the moment.Be confident and relevant at the same time. Even if you have x-amount of impressive facts about yourself that you are just dying to share, keep them to yourself if there isn’t any context for mentioning them. Avoid coming across as a bragger.For instance:


Say the two of you strike up a conversation about bands you like. Now let’s also say that you are a maestro on the guitar. Even though your guitar skills have to do with music, stick to your fan-based conversation about other musicians that the two of you admire. Impress the other person with your skills and your self-assurance by letting them find out how great you are from someone else entirely.

, If you feel nervous, don’t overcompensate by acting bolder than you normally behave. Instead, make the bold move of admitting to feeling anxious! Show the other person that you are so confident in yourself that you are comfortable sharing your imperfections, even with new people. Lure them into an instant air of intimacy by allowing them to see your vulnerabilities from the get-go.At a party or large gathering? Do crowds make you nervous? Say as much and let the other person know that hanging out one-on-one in the future will reveal you at your best.
Is the scene you’re in not really yours? Say you are at a football game and know nothing about the sport. Instead of faking interest or knowledge, confide in the other person and stoke their ego by relying on their expertise to guide you through the game.

, Keep the conversation focused on them. Show them that you are less interested in advertising yourself and more interested in learning about them.Make them feel important while creating an air of mystery about yourself. When the conversation ends, leave them feeling intrigued so they become eager to find out more about you.When they tell you a story, ask follow-up questions to indicate your interest.
When you share your own thoughts and opinions, ask them what their take is to shift the spotlight back onto them.

Value the friends you have.,
Put your friends before you.,
Respect their criticisms.,
Do the “little things.” Throwing your friends parties or making other grand gestures from time to time will undoubtedly make them feel important to you.,
Forge new memories.",How to Act Cool when You Have Few Friends3," Rest assured that you don’t need to surround yourself with a lot of friends to come across as cool to other people. But remember: it would look kind of suspicious if the few friends you do have all started to bail on you. Don’t take them for granted. Prove to them (as well as to others outside your circle) that you are definitely worth their time, respect, and loyalty.

, Shun the idea of being the center of attention. When your friends need to unload or vent or even just BS, put yourself on the back burner and really listen to what they have to say. Prove to them that you really do desire to know exactly what they think and feel about this, that, and the other thing.Ask follow-up questions once they finish telling you something to show them that you want to understand them fully.
Respond directly to their comments rather than switching the subject or simply stating your own opinions.
If you feel like a personal story or opinion of your own would benefit them, frame it in a way that clearly shows that this is a response to what they have said, and not just an opportunity for you to talk about yourself.

, Being cool and confident is a matter of seeking approval from yourself first and foremost, but that doesn’t mean you should disregard what the people who are most important to you have to say. When they point out a flaw of yours, take it as constructive feedback rather than an insult.Accept the fact that you are not perfect. Embrace your closest friends as people with whom you can be yourself, flaws and all, without having to strike a constant “cool” pose.


Keep an ear out for repeated hints about your flaws in case your friends are reluctant to address them directly.
Admit to your mistakes to show that you are more concerned with improving yourself and your friendship rather than just “looking good.”Laugh at yourself to diffuse tension and prove that you are empathetic enough to see yourself through your friends’ eyes.

, But making smaller gestures more often is much more feasible (and consistent). Make your friends feel important to you on a daily basis. Show them that you think about them all the time. Make a point of giving them a small sign that they are on your mind each day.

Forward them links to videos, stories, memes, etc. that you think they would appreciate.
Call them just to say “what’s up” and find out how they are, even when (or especially if) you have nothing particularly interesting to say.
Offer to do them favors and make their lives easier when they are busy, sick, or bummed out for some reason, or just do those favors anyway without asking if they need them.

, Pump some new life into your shared routines. Make your friendship exciting.If your friend mentions how it would be nice to do this or that, don’t let them only ever daydream about it–make a concrete plan to actually do it. Make your plans together or surprise them with a readymade adventure.


Go on a road trip, even if a day-trip is all you can manage.
Learn new skills together by taking art classes, guitar lessons, etc.
Get out of your comfort zone and take part in a poetry reading, open mic night, karaoke, or something more death-defying, like skydiving or rock climbing!

Look your best.,

Get the guy's attention.,
Be approachable.,
Go and talk to him.",How to Hook Up at the Beach2," When you're at the beach looking for a potential guy, you have to make yourself feel pretty and have the confidence to go up and talk to him. (Don't overdo it with the makeup, you're at the beach after all.)

, If you want to find a hot guy at the beach, you need to look around first. Look at places like the concession stand or in the lifeguard seats, in the water surfing, or playing games on the sand. Be sure to check that your chosen guy's not with girlfriend already.

, Try to make eye contact with him. This will help you to get his attention and maybe even get him to come up and talk to you. Ways to attract attention include:


Wave at him as you walk by.
Throw a ball in his direction and run to fetch it.
Let your dog run near him. Chase after your dog.
""Lose"" your sunglasses near him, then go searching for them.
Have a friend chase you around and eventually get near to where he is.

, Once you get his attention, smile and be friendly.

, Introduce yourself. Keep the conversation lively and interesting; show him that you're smart and cool and are keen to get to know him some more.Then once the ice is broken, you can start flirting. Things to talk about include:


Go up and say hello. Make a conversation about whatever the guy's doing, such as walking a dog, throwing a Frisbee or playing sport.
Ask if you can join the game he's playing on the beach.
Ask if he'd like to get an ice cream or drink with you.
Tell him you've seen him at the beach before and ask whether he lives nearby. (Only if this is the case.)

Embrace communication differences.,
Connect through the internet.,
Don’t stress if he doesn’t text a lot.,
Avoid reading between the lines.,
Say what you want.",How to Handle Boys when You're a Teenage Girl1," Many girls develop communication skills faster than some boys, so it's normal to communicate differently. Often girls are able to think more abstractly than boys, which means that they are more likely to connect thoughts better and provide more details. Because of this, some boys may provide short, direct answers and respond less to questions and comments from you.Don’t assume a boy is upset or doesn't want to talk just because his responses are short. Ask for more details and see if he continues to respond or prolong the conversation. If he doesn't want to talk, he'll continue to give responses that don't go anywhere.;
, Boys are more likely to want to hang out online than girls do, so reach out through social media.Follow him on social media. Use these apps to chat with him.
He may see your digital hangouts as being the same as hanging out in person.

, Girls are usually more concerned about texting with their friends often than boys are. Even when boys do text their friends, they don’t usually text as much as girls., Take his words at face value. While it’s tempting to try to figure out what a text “might mean,” teenage boys are usually direct about what they mean.


If you want to know what something means, ask a follow-up question.

, While it’s tempting to try to hint at what you want from a boy, he is unlikely to realize what you’re really wanting from a hint. Because he’s used to being direct, he’ll assume that you are as well.


For example, if a boy is going to the smoothie shop and you’re hoping he’ll bring you one, don’t text him, “I’m totally craving a smoothie right now.” He will not get the hint. Instead, text, “I’d really like it if you got me one, too.”

When a fight occurs don't take offense, it only makes it worse.,
Try to calm him down and find out what his issue is.,
Don't lie.,
Don't fight back, simply change the subject and ask ""what's up?"",
If he tells you off, tell him, ""If I was in your shoes I would..."" Give him advice as a friend, not as a girl who likes him.

,
If he calls you ignorant names, don't be immature and curse him off, it makes you look immature and trashy.,
If he completely blows you off, don't freak out.,
If he really likes you, he will show some remorse and apologize for being the way he was.

,
Many people have the same experience, if you like a guy who curses at people, and sometimes to you, and means it, they are NOT worth it!

",How to Get the Boy You Like to Stop Fighting With You," Well sure the things he says might hurt you, but don't show it. He'll just keep doing it.;
, If you did anything wrong,apologize and say you weren't acting yourself then.

, What gets done in the dark comes out in the light. He will find out.

, Maybe something is going on in his family. Try to help him. If he doesn't want to talk about it, don't force him. It will only make matters worse for you.

,, Simply tell him ""You're acting immature, I will talk to you when you're acting yourself again.""

, He probably needs his own space. Don't freak out and say something stupid like, ""But you don't understand how much I like you!!!"" It makes you look pathetic, clingy, and somewhat desperate.

Analyze what you're wearing, and your style overall.,
Look at your make-up, hair, and nails.,
Find your target.,
Develop a relationship with him.,
Ask him out.",How to Get More Guys at Your School to Want to Date You That Aren't Nerds," How you dress says a lot to everyone, especially to the opposite sex. Also, you would be surprised at how what you wear affects the people that you attract. If you dress in low-cut shirts and miniskirts, you're more than likely going to attract a guy that bases who he dates on looks. If you dress a little more conservatively, say in good-fitting jeans and a cute top, you will probably find a guy that will respect you. By the clothes you wear, you show a guy not only your personality, but how you view yourself. Dress like you don't want everyone to know what color panties and bra you're wearing! And if money is an issue: don't worry. Any guy worth having could care less whether you shop at a designer boutique or a discount store, or both.;
, You need to realize that with most guys, less is more. Don't apply that to clothes though!


With makeup, they want to see you, not a face you cake on every morning. Pick a foundation/base color that is your skin color, and blend it well with your neck and hairline. Pick a subtle color for an eyeshadow, one that complements your eye color. Put a little eyeliner on your lower lid, mascara to the top lid, and a sheer lip gloss to that beautiful kisser of yours. Maybe even add a subtle color to your cheeks, but you don't have to. It is absolutely necessary to remember, though, that if you're scared for a guy to see you without makeup, that your husband will one day eventually see you without it. Might as well get used to it now!
Your hair is probably one of the first things that people see when they look at you. There is no particular style that guys prefer, but there are some aspects of hair that need to be there. It needs to be touchable, neat, clean, and trimmed. No split ends or colored hair with roots that show. It's nice to style it a different way every once in a while. And if you part your hair, you might want to avoid the horrible part. Even a little to the side makes a huge difference.
Cute nails are important, especially if you plan on holding hands with that special guy once you find him! They don't even have to be painted. But, like your hair, there are some rules to follow. Your nails don't need to be too long, ragged, half-painted, or just ugly to look at. If you take care of them, they never have to be painted or made up. Just keep them filed, clean, and push your cuticles back every once in a while. Add a little lotion to soften them up, and the guys will be begging to hold your hand!

, He may be the guy in your history class, the boy that has the locker beside yours,... whoever. The first thing you have to do is probably the hardest: talk to him. A witty little comment, picking at him about something playfully, ""forgetting"" what your teacher assigned for homework -- anything. It doesn't have to be a drawn out conversation, either. Just a few words every now and then to keep yourself first and foremost in his mind. If he seems to enjoy talking to you, proceed to the next step! If not, don't be discouraged. Cut your losses and move on.

, Ask for his screen name or cell phone number to stay in touch with him. Ask him if he wants to go out with a group of friends one night, or if you're bold, alone. If he says no, don't worry. He may be legitimately busy, or possibly just nervous. Do not obsess, though. Guys get suffocated easily, and if you text, call, or IM him constantly, he will probably get freaked out. Let him initiate some conversations, too!

, It may be hard, yes, but it will be worth it! If he says no, do not take it as a failure or a waste of time. He may be nervous, talking to someone else, or just not want a girlfriend at the moment. If it turns out that he just doesn't feel that way about you, then at least you made a friend!

Create your partner beforehand.,
Keep your partner believable.,
Use the truth whenever possible.,
Give a good reason for their absence.,
Be consistent.,
Keep your partner up-to-date.,
Enlist someone you trust to help.,
Give your partner an online presence.,
Deflect suspicion with sarcasm.",How to Have an Imaginary Boyfriend or Girlfriend1," Have a firm grasp of who they are, where they’re from, what they do, etc. before sharing them with anyone. Know exactly how you met and what the two of you have done together since then. Rehearse your story until you know it backwards and forwards. Don’t give yourself away by taking the time to think up lies on the spot., Expect people to ask questions about them. Keep your answers grounded in what you know for sure.Invent a backstory for your partner based on places and cultures you’re already familiar with. Either give your imaginary partner an upbringing similar to your own so you can speak about it with authority, or model them on someone you know well enough to ""borrow"" a plausible background, like a best friend, roommate, or cousin.


For instance, if you’re Irish Catholic and know nothing about Asian cultures, don’t have an imaginary partner who’s Asian, since other people would expect you to have learned at least a little something about your partner’s beliefs and practices.
Instead, use someone you know fairly well to fill in all those gaps. Say you have a good friend who's Italian and also Catholic. Since you share the same religious background, make your partner a Catholic Italian, too. Then use what you know about your friend's family life as a template for your imaginary partner's.

, Bolster stories about your partner with real details. If you tell people about a date or day-trip that you went on with your partner, use places that you’ve actually been to. Misdirect their attention by talking more about the places you’ve gone together, rather than the person who went with you.For example, if you’re telling a story about a dinner date, shift the focus away from your partner by talking about the food you ate or something funny that really happened at another table. If you claim to have gone together to some event that you actually went to by yourself (like a movie, show, or concert), talk more about the event itself.
Let your partner ""borrow"" your own honest reactions. For instance, if you've telling someone about a really bad sci-fi movie that you saw together, say something like, ""The special effects were so bad, Rick almost choked on his popcorn because he was laughing so hard,"" if that's really how bad they were. Establish that ""Rick"" was with you, but keep the focus on the movie that the two of you went to instead of on him.

, When you create your imaginary partner, think of why no one else in your life ever has a chance to meet them. Give your partner a demanding job with odd hours. Have them live near enough for the two of you to have a relationship, but not close enough to come hang out just because your friends or family asked you to invite them. Give your partner a large demanding family of their own, for whom they have to do this on Saturday, that on Sunday, and the other thing next weekend.

, Come up with one story (“The Tale of My Amazing New Partner”) and stick to that one story with everyone you know. Even if you don’t expect, say, your work-friends to ever meet your school-friends, remember the world’s a small place. One of your work-friends might have a sister who dates the roommate of one of your school-friends, or something like that. Assume everyone you know will meet everyone else you know at some point, so don’t spread any inconsistencies for them to piece together later on.


Keep a diary of your imaginary relationship! Track what the two of you did and when. Add as much detail as you like. Use it for reference in case you become fuzzy on the details later on. Either keep it on the computer so you can go back and add new details as they come to you, or create new entries in your journal about how you’re remembering a certain day with your partner. Either way, writing stuff down will help you remember it in the long run., Think of the background that you’ve already given to your imaginary partner. Now think of how current events might effect them. Prepare yourself for any random questions people may ask you. Of course you probably wouldn’t be able to answer every single question on your partner’s behalf, even if they were a real person, but have an idea of how their life may change when certain things happen.


Let’s say you’re with your family for the holidays while your partner went back to their hometown of Boston to be with their own. Check the weather and such in Boston, just in case there’s a freak blizzard. Or say you’ve told everyone that your partner’s a real estate agent. Keep an ear out for any news of a crash in the housing market or anything like that.

, If you’re only trying to fool a small audience (like your parents or an ex), ask people you know and trust to back your story up.Coach them on who your partner is: what they look like, how they interact with people, what they like and don’t like to talk about. Come up with shared memories of times you all went out together as a group. Give your partner a real witness who will claim to have actually met them.

, First, create an email account for your partner, since a lot of other social media will require one to open an account with them. Then open other accounts with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or whatever else is used by people you wish to fool. Create profiles with your partner’s information. Then connect their account with yours (“friend” each other, “follow” each other, etc). Start a dialogue between the two accounts for others to see.Be inventive with photos. For your partner’s profile pic, use images of their interests. If they’re a surfer, use a photo of a monster wave, or if he’s a horror fan, use a pic of Bela Lugosi as Dracula. When you want to share photos of your dates, post pictures of the sites you see: a sunset, a lighthouse, the marquee of the theater you’re going to, etc.
Distinguish their text from yours. Don’t write in the same “voice.” Have them use abbreviations that you don’t use (“r” vs. “are”), or vice versa. Give them a simple catchphrase or two (“Whaddup”) or a signature name they call everyone (“bud” or “peeps”).
Link your partner’s account with other people’s. Don’t raise red flags by being the only person who’s connected to your partner. If you’re only trying to fool certain people like an ex or your parents, ask friends you trust to “friend” or “follow” your partner’s account and interact with it online. If not, stick to platforms like Twitter, which links people with common interests, and avoid others like Facebook, which is more for connecting with people you already know.Create your partners’ accounts sooner rather than later. Build some history for other people to see before telling anyone about it. Let other people see this new person in your life on your own page before you announce that you have a new partner.

, Since it's always easier to tell the truth than tell a lie, use the truth to maintain your story if anyone doubts it.Should they come right out and ask if you really have a partner, roll your eyes and say incredulously, ""Oh yeah, of course, I sat in my room, dreamed this person up, created a backstory for them, invented dates we never went on, etc, etc,"" as though the truth is simply too impossible to believe. Avoid giving away any tells or signs of guilt that usually come with lying.


Tread lightly if your secret is found out for sure. Depending on who you've told this story to and why, explain why you felt it was necessary to try and fool them. For example, if you've told your family you have a partner just so they would stop asking if you had found someone, open a conversation about how much they pressure you to find someone, to the point that making someone up seemed like the best solution to you.

Tell your partner that you wish to not have a relationship based on texting.,
Slowly stop texting so often.,
Begin to reduce the amount you text every day or every week.,
Find things to do other than text.,
Keep doing these things until your relationship is text-free.",How to Have a No Text Relationship," Explain to them that you'd rather be together in person more often. Make sure that they know that it's not that you don't want to text them; it's that you want to have your relationship based offline.;
, Don't all of a sudden stop texting; take it slowly. Start by limiting yourself to only thirty minutes a day, or send only a hundred texts a day. Switch to phone calls instead of texting; have an hour chat every other night to make up for the loss of texting. If you usually text often, this may be a bit hard for you. To keep you from giving up, think about how nice it would be to spend time with the one you love, and not just sitting around staring at a small screen, wasting time and phone battery.

, Keep at a pace that is comfortable for you.

, Go to parks with your boyfriend/girlfriend, record stores, the mall, events in your town; anywhere! You'll find that your time is better spent, you feel happier, and you can also see the face of the one you love and feel their presence.

, If you want to, go all the way and do this with everyone; stop texting altogether, or only use it for emergencies. By doing this, you will reduce your phone bill, save energy, and have more time to do important things.

Remember that hormonal changes are quite common, particularly in women going through menopause. However, if you are not within the normal age range for menopause or perimenopause or if your symptoms are intense, you may want to visit the doctor. Symptoms may include:Hot flashes or trouble sleeping
Changes in mood or moodiness
Changes in sexual function or decreased fertility
Altered cholesterol levels;
, Before you start an estrogen treatment program, ask your doctor about the effects of estrogen on your body. While estrogen insufficiency can result in problems, estrogen levels that are too high (or prolonged exposure at the wrong times) can lead to menstrual disturbances, ovarian cysts, and breast cancer.There are many conditions that can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, loss of libido, and other symptoms associated with low estrogen levels. Do not assume that estrogen levels are the cause of your symptoms. Consult with your doctor before starting any treatment to increase your estrogen, including taking natural or herbal supplements.

, There are a variety of tests available for determining hormone levels. Your doctor will likely have you take a blood test. Your blood may also be tested for FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone), which is responsible for regulating estrogen and progesterone production in the ovaries.You should tell your doctor about any medications and supplements you are taking before having the test done. You should also inform your doctor about any hormonal contraceptive you use, as this could affect your test. You should discuss medical conditions including thyroid disease, sex-dependent hormone tumors, ovarian cysts, and unusual vaginal bleeding with your doctor, as they could affect your FSH levels.The FSH test is usually drawn on the second or third day of your period.
There are three types of estrogen; estrone, estradiol, and estriol.Estradiol is the type of estrogen that is normally measured with testing, and a normal range is 30-400 pg/mL for premenopausal women (depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle) and 0-30 pg/mL for postmenopausal women.Levels lower than 20 pg/mL may cause hormonal symptoms such as hot flashes.
The value of checking estrogen levels is controversial, as levels fluctuate widely throughout the day. However, it can be helpful in conjunction with a physical exam, history, and other testing.

, There are a variety of estrogen therapies available, including pills, skin patches, and topical gels and creams. There are also vaginal estrogens available in the forms of tablets, rings, or creams that are inserted directly into the vagina.Talk to your doctor about the option that would be best for you.


However, if you have a uterus, you should not allow anyone to start supplementing you with estrogen only. Taking estrogen alone, without progesterone, increases the risk of uterine cancer.

, Smoking may have negative effects on the endocrine system, limiting the body's ability to produce estrogen effectively.Smoking in pre-menopausal women has been linked with menstrual dysfunction, infertility, and earlier menopause., Exercise has been linked to a drop in estrogen levels. Avoid excessive exercising, but get regular exercise in. Not only is moderate exercise healthy, it may also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women and increase overall longevity.Athletes may experience a drop in estrogen levels. This is because women with low levels of body fat have more trouble producing estrogen. If you are an athlete or have low body fat levels, see your doctor for a good way to replenish your estrogen., Your endocrine system needs a healthy body in order to work properly and produce normal levels of estrogen. Women cannot obtain estrogen from their diet, but eating a wide variety of fresh foods gives your system the best chance to naturally produce estrogen., Soybean products, especially tofu, contain genistein, which is a plant product that mimics the effects of estrogen. In large quantities, these may be able to lessen menopausal symptoms, but soy may not make a significant difference in hormone levels.If you want to try incorporating soy products into your diet, you may try the following:Edamame
Miso, in small amounts
Soy nuts
Tempeh
Textured Soy Product (TSP), or foods made from textured soy flour.

, Sugar can lead to a hormone imbalance in the body.Switch from simple carbs to a lower-carb, whole-grain diet.


For example, instead of white flour, opt for whole grain flour. Use whole grain pasta or brown rice.

, Women who drink more than two cups of coffee (200 mg of caffeine) per day may have higher estrogen levels than women who don't. While caffeine may increase estrogen levels, it does not seem to increase fertility. If you're trying to increase estrogen in order to ovulate, coffee and caffeine may not help much.Use organic coffee. Most coffee is a heavily sprayed crop, so drinking organic coffee should reduce your exposure to herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Use unbleached filters. Many white coffee filters contain bleach that can leach out into the final product, so try to find unbleached coffee filters for a safer brew.
Consume coffee and other caffeinated beverages in moderation. You should not consume more than 400mg of caffeine per day, and you should aim to consume much less than that on average., This herb can be found in pill form in most health stores. Follow the package instructions for the specific dosage. Chasteberry may help relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, although scientific evidence is currently limited.However, it has not been proven to reduce menopausal symptoms, increase lactation, or increase fertility.Chasteberry has been shown to influence estrogen levels.However, the exact nature and level of the effect has not been widely established.Avoid taking chasteberry if you are using: birth control pills, antipsychotic drugs, medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, or Metoclopramide, a dopamine-affecting drug.

, Phytoestrogens act like an estrogen substitute in the body and occur naturally in several plants and herbs. Consider using phytoestrogens if you're trying to alleviate symptoms of low estrogen levels, or menopause. Take phytoestrogens in moderation. You may actually want to avoid phytoestrogens if you're trying to conceive. Phytoestrogens have been linked to infertility and developmental problems, although you would need to consume massive quantities of these foods to ingest clinically significant levels of phytoestrogens.Foods and herbs that contain phytoestrogens include:legumes: soybeans, peas, pinto and lima beans
fruits: cranberries, prunes, apricots
herbs: oregano, sage, licorice
whole grains
flaxseed
vegetables: broccoli and cauliflower

, Several herbal teas or tisanes may increase your estrogen levels or provide relief for symptoms of menopause or premenstrual syndrome without affecting your estrogen levels. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for five minutes.Black and green tea. Black and green teas contain phytoestrogens.Dong quai (Angelica sinensis). Used in Chinese traditional medicine, this herb may reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Do not use it if you use blood-thinning drugs like warfarin.Red clover. Red clover contains isoflavones, which may help reduce symptoms of menopause or premenstrual syndrome., Flax seeds have one of the highest concentrations of phytoestrogens. Eat up to 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds to get the most effect. They're also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which may reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes.Adding flax seed to your breakfast cereal or in healthy smoothies is a good way to easily eat the seed.

Offer to make amends for your behavior.,
Ask your friend for forgiveness and accept their response.",How to End a Fight with a Friend," Fights with friends trigger a natural range of emotions—from rage to sorrow. While your feelings may be entirely justifiable, do not allow your emotional response to go unchecked. By remaining calm and quiet, you will minimize the risk of escalating the incident.Pause, take a few deep breaths, and relax.
Separate yourself from the situation until you have control over your emotions. When you feel yourself getting too emotional, excuse yourself from the conversation: “I am starting to feel overwhelmed, angry, and hurt. Before I do something or say something that I might regret, I am going to pause the conversation. We can pick up where we left off when I am calmer and in control of my emotions.” This method is called “Taking a Timeout.”;
, Anger, frustration, and jealousy are overwhelming emotions. When we allow these feelings to cloud our judgement, our actions and words can become destructive. Even though it is tempting to “get even,” seeking revenge may ruin any chance of reconciling with your friend or, at the very least, draw out the process.Recognize that your thoughts of revenge are a natural response to your broken trust. When someone hurts us, it is in our nature to get even.
Acknowledge that you may regret seeking revenge. When you seek revenge, your actions are coming from a place of anger and fear. Once the anger and fear subside, the satisfaction you got from getting even may be replaced with feelings of guilt and regret. Remind yourself, “getting even may seem like a good idea now, but later I will feel awful for hurting my friend.”
Accept that you can control these desires to seek revenge. If you find yourself plotting revenge:

Remind yourself that these desires are simply a natural human response to broken trust. You don’t have to act on these feelings, you always have the option to ignore them.
Tell yourself that plotting revenge is satisfying, but carrying out the plan will not make you feel better.
Choose to resolve the issue in a less spiteful manner, like through a dialogue.
Practice radical acceptance—acknowledge what you are feeling in the present moment and choose to accept those feelings with kindness and acceptance. In this instance, radically accept that people are going to break your trust. , When you are fighting with a friend, it is natural to vent about the conflict. Today, many people turn to social media to air their complaints. Broadcasting your frustrations or sorrow on social media platforms, however, will only prolong the fight.


Talk through the issue with a close, neutral confidant.
If your friend posts on social media, don’t reply. You may even want to block them temporarily., There are always two (or more) sides to every conflict. While it is easy to convince yourself that your version is the true version, this type of inflexible thinking may prevent you from reconciling with your friend. Viewing the issue from your friend’s point of view may make you revise your version of the story.


Remember, you don’t have to agree with someone in order to empathize with them.
Consider if your friend is experiencing difficulties in their personal, academic, and/or work life? Do these difficulties reveal anything about their negative behavior towards you?
Consider how your actions made your friend feel. Did you do something to upset your friend? Did you break your friend’s trust first?, In order to move beyond the conflict, you and your friend need to discuss the issue. Ask your friend to meet with you—invite your friend to coffee, dinner, or a walk on the beach. Your proactiveness will show that you care about repairing the relationship. Insist that the conversation takes place face-to-face—if you and your friend can see each other’s facial expressions and body language, there is less room for misinterpretations.


If your friend is not ready to meet, don’t push the issue. Give them a few more days to cool off and then ask again.Decline any offers to talk about your fight over the phone or social media platforms.

, When you and your friend meet, both of you may be experiencing very raw emotions. Your demeanor will set the tone for the entire discussion. Don’t let your negative emotions take control over of the situation—yelling, aggression, and defensive behavior will only derail the reconciliation.


Exercise self-control. When you find yourself getting mad, stop talking and take several deep breaths. You may find it helpful to count to ten or to repeat a self-soothing mantra, like “I am calm, cool, and collected,” until you sense that you are back in control of your emotions.If you feel yourself getting too heated, excuse yourself for a moment and return when you feel calm.Take a moment to think about why you are feeling angry and upset. Did you misunderstand their statement? Did your friend misunderstand you? Do you have any control over what is upsetting you? Use this time to gather and organize your thoughts—identify the source of your anger so that you can clearly articulate what you are upset about., When you meet with your friend, do not make excuses or place the blame on them. Instead, accept responsibility for your role in the conflict. Focus on expressing yourself calmly and rationally.


Use “I statements” to identify and take ownership of your feelings.Be as specific as possible. “I felt angry when you left me at the party.”
Avoid the words “ought” and “should,” as well as the phrases, “I feel like___” and “I feel that__.” These transform I-statements into You-statements.
Avoid yelling., After you have expressed yourself, allow your friend to share their emotions with you. It may be hard for you to hear what they say, but try not to interrupt. It is important that they feel heard and valued. Sit quietly and actively listen to what they are saying.When your friend is talking, put away all distractions, such as your phone or computer.
Maintain eye contact with your friend.
Lean forwards and tilt your head slightly to demonstrate that you are engaged.
Mirror your friend’s body language., After actively listening to your friend, set aside your point of view and desire to be right and empathize with them. Explaining the conflict from your friend’s perspective assure them that you were in fact listening. It also demonstrates that you are prepared to accept responsibility for your actions and prepared to move forward.


”I can see how my actions made you feel ____.”
”I didn’t realize I hurt you by ____.”
Avoid the word “but.” This word indicates that you did not actually see the issue from your friend’s perspective. Instead, replace “but” with “and.”, Begin your apology with a heartfelt, “I’m sorry.” Express your remorse with sincere and authentic words. Let your friend know that you regret that your behavior negatively impacted them.


For example, you could say: “I am sorry that my actions hurt you” or “I apologize that I didn’t give you a chance to explain yourself.”A false apology will not bring your conflict to a happy conclusion., You don’t have control over your friend’s actions, but you do have control over your behavior and reactions. Once you accept that your words and deeds, however minor, contributed to the conflict, you will stop justifying your poor behavior. Let your friend know that you recognize your role in the fight.


For example, you could say: *I realize that showing up late was inconsiderate and hurtful” or “I know I waited too long to tell you that I felt hurt.”Do not tag an excuse or justification for your behavior onto this statement. Doing so will only negate your apology.

, In addition to saying “I’m sorry” and taking responsibility for your actions, you also need to make restitution for your actions. Let your friend know how you intend to make up for your behavior. Make sure your promises are sincere.


For example, you may promise to abstain from this behavior in the future, communicate better, or spend more time with your friend. “I will try my best to set aside more time for you.” “I will make you a priority in my life.” “I will do a better job of asking about your life and struggles.” “I will do my best to support you through this difficult time/new opportunity.”
Make sure that this promise is achievable., Conclude your apology by asking for forgiveness. When you apologize, use phrases, such as “Please forgive me,” and “Can we move forward.” If your friend looks uncertain, you can reiterate that you take responsibility for your actions and you will strive to be a better friend in the future.


Your friend has the right to either accept your apology or withhold their forgiveness.
If your friend doesn’t instantly forgive you, give them some space and time to process your apology."

Create an excuse to talk to him.",How to Handle Boys when You're a Teenage Girl2," You can learn a lot about a person through their body language, including if they like you. If a boy likes you, his body will give him away. Whenever you’re together, see if you can pick up on some of these cues.His nostrils will flare.
His eyebrows will rise when he talks to you.
He will run his hand through his hair or smooth down the top.
He’ll get closer to you.
He’ll casually touch you.

, His texting habits can tell you a lot. See who initiates your texting exchanges to see if it’s always you or more of a balance. If he likes you, then he’ll sometimes initiate conversations, and he won’t be afraid to double text.He’ll also make it a habit of keeping the conversation going by asking questions.Ask yourself if he shows an interest in your life.
Wait to give him a chance to initiate texting if you've been doing it several days in a row.

, Next time you spend time together, watch him to see if he focuses on you or the phone. If he chooses talking with you more often than playing with his phone, then he may like you., Find a subject that he knows about and see if you can get him to help you with it, or offer to help him with something you know he struggles with. It will usually give you a chance to hang out with him one-on-one.If he complains about his score on the math test, say, “Why don't you meet me at the coffee shop, and I'll show you how to factor equations.”
Offer to be his lab partner in science class.
Think of a sport you both like. For example, say, “Wow, you’re so great at tennis! Can you show me how you do your serve?”

Don’t do anything you don’t want to do.,
Tell him how you feel.,
Get your friends to support you.,
Know that it’s okay to change your mind.,
Remove yourself from the situation.,
Consider ending the friendship.",How to Handle Boys when You're a Teenage Girl3," You are only responsible for your feelings, not the boy’s. If you aren’t interested in doing something, even when you like the boy, don’t do it. He may try to pressure you or tell you why you’re being unfair, but your wants are what’s important.A boy who really cares about you won’t pressure you to do something you don’t want to, so don’t be afraid to lose a guy you like. If he can’t take “no” for an answer, then he isn’t good for you.

, If you want to turn a guy down, let him know that you just aren’t interested. You don’t need an excuse or reason. Be direct and firm, then change the subject. If he brings it up again, say, “I told you I’m not interested, so don’t keep asking.”Tell him, “That isn’t something that I’m interested in right now,” or “I just want to be friends. I hope you understand.”
Don’t use another guy as an excuse. As tempting as it is to say, “I have a boyfriend,” that will make him think that he might have a chance if you were single. Plus, it takes away your power to say no just because it’s what you want.
Don’t worry about hurting his feelings or being “nice.”

, Tell your friends about the boy’s crush on you and that you aren’t interested. Your friends can help you avoid awkward encounters and unwanted advances., If you start to feel uncomfortable with a boy, it’s okay to tell him to stop, even if it’s not the first time you’ve done something with him. For example, if you’ve been kissing a friend you kind of like, that doesn’t mean you have to keep doing it.If you do something with a boy that you regret, you can still say “no” the next time.

, If a guy is pestering you, walk away and try to find someone you can rely on as a buffer, like a friend or authority figure., Sometimes the boy you want to back off is a friend. If he doesn’t respect your decision and keeps trying to initiate a relationship, then you may have to cut ties with him. While you don’t want to lose him, he’s not being a good friend to you. Additionally, he may believe that your continued friendship is a sign that you might actually like him.Distance yourself from him by saying “no” to spending one-on-one time with him. If you must cross paths with him, talk to your other friends about acting as a buffer.
If he asks you to hang out, say, “I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to spend time together anymore.”

Imagine what they look like.,
Identify them.,
Flesh out their backstory.,
Define them as a person.,
See yourself through their eyes.",How to Have an Imaginary Boyfriend or Girlfriend2," Pretend they’re standing right there in front of you.Build their face and body in your mind’s eye. Start with the basics: hair color, eye color, height, weight, etc. Then add more distinct features that make them unique, like a snaggle-tooth, a freckle pattern, or a faded scar


If you need to, use photos or other images of random people for inspiration.
Resist basing your imaginary partner on someone whom you know personally. You may end up feeling guilty, frustrated, and confused when they don’t act like your imaginary partner.

, Give them a name. Come up with other basic information about them, like their birthday. Think of answers to typical questions that people ask each other when they first meet, like:Where did they grow up?
Where do they live now?
Where do they work or go to school?
Do they have any siblings?

, Imagine their personal history. You know the name of their hometown–now ask yourself what happened to them there. Fill in the details of their background, such as:


Were their parents ever married? Are they divorced?
What sort of friends did they have growing up?
What were they like in school?
What sort of interests and activities did they pursue?
What if any religion were they brought up in?

, Build an inner life for them. Give your imaginary partner their own imagination and tastes. Ask yourself what sort of thoughts occupy them now:What are their current interests?
What are their hopes and dreams?
What do they worry about?
What do they wonder about?
What values and beliefs do they hold dear?

, As you build their inner life with their own wants, needs, and beliefs, measure yourself by their standards. Imagine what they see in you. Ask yourself what it is about you that sets you apart from everyone else in their eyes.What do you both believe in?
Where do you disagree?
What needs of theirs can you fulfill?

Embrace having an imaginary partner.",How to Have an Imaginary Boyfriend or Girlfriend3," Think of where and how you meet. Take their backstory and merge it with yours. Build on their personal history so that it leads them to you. Did you meet by pure chance? Or did your shared interests bring you together somehow? If you’re unsure, play out different scenarios in your head until you find one that just feels right.

, When you’re alone, either at home or out and about, pretend that your imaginary partner is with you. Watch TV together, share a meal, go for a walk–anything that couples do. Build memories with each other so that your partner becomes a true boyfriend or girlfriend instead of someone who just has a “first date” with you again and again and again, as if they had amnesia.

, Based on their tastes and interests, look around you to see what would catch their attention instead of yours. Open yourself to new ideas.If you go to a store, wander down the aisles that they would browse. If you hear something on the news about their hometown, think of how they would react. Watch movies you’ve seen a hundred times before and imagine how it would play to your imaginary partner, who may have never seen it before.

, Since no two people are exactly the same, think of how the two of you differ. Ponder how those differences might lead to disagreements. Then ask yourself how serious that disagreement would be. Would it just be a casual conversation with no hurt feelings, or could it build into an actual fight? Play the scene out just like it was happening for real, with no way to rewind or erase it.


Say you’re both watching a testosterone-fueled action movie that you love, but your partner doesn’t like the way all of the female characters are sidelined as cheerleaders and sex objects. How strongly does your partner object to this? Are they just making an observation? Are they a little disappointed about this one aspect of a movie they otherwise enjoy? Or are they really, really offended by the whole thing?

, Recognize them as a way to help you deal with real people and situations. Have them echo thoughts and concerns that people in your life have shared with you. Practice your ability to empathize and put yourself in other people’s shoes. Strengthen your relationships outside of your pretend one."
"
Realize that you have done something wrong to make the person fall out with you.,
Talk to the person and tell them that you understand what you have done wrong to them, you are really sorry for doing it and you really want to be friends again.,
Give them some time to mull over your apology and come to terms with what you have said.,
Give your friend a 'Sorry' card or a gift, such as chocolate.,
Understand that if they agree to give you a chance, be a really great friend to them.",How to Earn Friendships Back," The first stage is to accept that you are in the wrong and to figure out what you did to upset or offend the person.;
, Understand that they may not want to be friends again straight away. Think about what you are going to say before you say it. An insincere or vague apology is often worse than no apology at all.

, A few days later, try again. Ask the person if you can be friends, or at least talk again, and ask them to give you a chance. It is going to take a long time to earn their trust and friendship back and if you are really determined, you have to work at it. If they still say no, give them space and don't pester them. Move on and find someone else to be friends with.

, This could help your friend realize you are sorry, or it could make them think you are trying to buy their friendship. You should only do this if you know your friend well and know they would react well to this.

, Don't upset them or offend them, be nice to them (but don't over-do it), try your best to be a good friend. Don't expect them to confide in you straight away, and realize that it will take time for it to get back to normal.

Talk about your frustrations with another friend or family member.,
Consider letting your friend go if they keep betraying you.,
Don't carry the baggage to new friendships.",How to Become Friends Again With Someone Who Betrayed You," The first thing you need to do with your friend is clear the air about the betrayal and what caused it. During a conflict, communication is important because people will often assume and misinterpret other people's actions.Determine if your friend understood your feelings and figure out if they feel remorseful for their actions. Communicate your feeling to them and explain why you felt betrayed.


You can say something like, ""I felt betrayed and felt like you didn't care about my feelings or well-being. It really put me in a negative space and made me feel like I didn't want to be your friend anymore.""
Avoid shaming or humiliating the person during the conversation. It creates a negative environment.
Try to separate complaints about their personality with the act of betrayal that they committed. There may be things that you don't like about them, but you want to concentrate on the act of betrayal first.The primary goal of talking to them is to come clean about how you feel and understand what their perspective is.;
, Sometimes an act of betrayal can be so severe that it's impossible for you to forgive someone. If you aren't willing to forgive someone, or the person feels no remorse for their actions, then true forgiveness may be unobtainable.However, it's also important to evaluate the situation fairly, look at all sides, and be truthful to yourself. Perceived acts of betrayal may not be intentional, and could be a result of a lack of communication.


Talking to a close friend or family member may help you evaluate the betrayal.
Put yourself in their shoes and determine if you would have done the same things or would have felt inclined to do the same things.

, When you accept a person's apology, it isn't condoning their act of betrayal. Instead, it's understanding that your friend made a mistake. Accepting the apology does not mean that you instantly can forgive the person either. Forgiveness is a long process that can take years to achieve. The first step in forgiving them is accepting their apology.You can say something like, ""I don't agree what you did, but I can see how you would make that mistake. I accept your apology, but it might take a while for me to get over it.""
It's important to get what you want to say off your chest before hearing out the friend who betrayed you.

, The psychological toll that betrayal can have on the mind can be immense and can include a morbid pre-occupation over the circumstances.Obsessing over the betrayal even after you've talked to your friend is an unhealthy habit. Try redirecting your energy to something positive, constructive, or physical, like art, taking a class, or working out at the gym. It's normal and okay to feel upset, but you don't want it to damage your quality of life or overall happiness.


If you have a hard time shifting to something positive, then try taking a moment to evaluate your thoughts. For example, you might find yourself thinking, “She betrayed me before, so it will happen again.”
If this happens, ask yourself if this is the most likely outcome. Are there other possible outcomes? If so, what are they?
Then, use this information to help you revise the thought. For example, you might revise your thought to something like, “I know that my friend feels really bad about what happened, and that she will do her best not to hurt me again.”, Showing empathy is the process of trying to understand someone else’s actions from their perspective. It is the process of putting yourself into someone else’s shoes to get a better understanding of why they say and do the things that they do.Don't automatically assume the worst, like it was your friend's intention to hurt your feelings or that they acted in a vindictive manner. After talking to them, think about their motivations and what caused them to commit the act of betrayal. It may still not be the right thing to do, but at least you can try to understand why they did it.
For example, if your friend went behind your back and told someone a secret about you, try to think about why she might have done that. For example, might she have been concerned about you? Or, is it possible that she was coerced into sharing the secret and gave in because she wanted to feel liked and accepted by the person or people she told?

, Sometimes we need bad experiences to put our relationships in perspective. Regardless of how badly it hurt you, there's a good chance that the betrayal taught you something. Think about how the experience made you grow as a person and realize that the betrayal may have unintentionally had positive impact.


For some people, this is a reminder that they should speak up and stand up for themselves more often, and for others, it may be a sign to communicate boundaries to their friends effectively.

, Trusting someone again after a betrayal takes time and continued effort. Your friend will have to continually show that they can be trusted and you will have to continually acknowledge the trustworthy things that your friend does and allow yourself time to heal from the past betrayal.


Think about what the person did to betray you and why it upset you so much. What did they do? Why did it hurt you so much? Try writing down what happened and why it was so upsetting to you. This will give you a chance to identify your feelings and examining them more closely.Look at what your friend has done so far the show they are sorry. Has your friend apologized? Did it seem sincere? Have they done other things to show they are truly sorry? If so, then it will be easier to regain trust in the person, although the healing process will still take time. If not, then it might not be easy to trust the person. You might need to get a sincere apology before you will really start to trust the person again.Try to be patient. It can take time to feel like you can trust someone again after a betrayal. Don’t feel like you have to rush to get the relationship back to where it was before the betrayal. Just allow it to progress at a natural pace.

, If you have managed to forgive your friend, hanging out with them immediately after the betrayal is sometimes not the best idea. Allow time - a few days, a few weeks - for both of you to think about your actions. Time will also let your friend take reflect on what they did and better understand your perspective.


If you don't allow any time to pass, there's a chance that your feelings have not settled, and the same argument can arise again.Hang out with your other friends more often.

, Sometimes betrayal isn't simple and situations can get complex. If you did anything to hurt your friend or you lashed out after they betrayed you, you should apologize for your actions as well.


You can say something like, ""I reacted badly because my feelings were hurt. I'm sorry for yelling at you and calling you names.""
Apologizing to them may also make them more open to talking to you and taking responsibility for their actions., Even though you were the one who was betrayed, you may need to reach out to your friend first. They may think that you dislike them, or don't want to see them anymore. Being the one to initiate spending time together will show them that you're dedicated to the relationship.


Only ask to hang out after you've fully forgiven the person.

, While it's important to talk about the betrayal and your feelings, concentrating on the event or situation can take away the fun from your friendship. Remember to do things that you both enjoy, and try to remember what made you friends in the first place by revisiting fun events or doing fun activities with them.


This can be going to a movie that you both want to see, participating in a sport, going to a museum you both like, or playing a video game.

, After you've repaired your relationship and forgiven your friend, it's important to let them know that their behavior is not acceptable and won't be tolerated in the future. The first time they betrayed you could be blamed on ignorance or a misunderstanding. However if you explicitly tell them your feelings, and they cross the line again, you know that you did everything you could.


When you speak to the person about your boundaries and feelings, make sure to be assertive. Internalize how you feel and how you want to be treated, then communicate it in the most assertive way you can, without being angry or mean.Be open and honest with them. Don't hold things back to preserve their feelings.
You can say something like, ""I've forgiven you for what you did, but you can't do it again. It hurts my feelings, makes me feel betrayed, and is just not what I want in a friend.""

, The act of talking to a friend about your frustrations can make you feel like you have someone who understands and is there for you. This can reduce your stress and help you work out your feelings before a problem arises.They are also may be an excellent source for advice.

, If this is a repeating pattern in your friendship, it may be time to let your friend go. If you both have inherently different personalities or moral values, then betrayal can happen again and again. An important factor to repairing a relationship that's been ruined by betrayal is an understanding that the behavior was wrong in the first place. If they can't see why you are upset or don't care, then you may have to detach yourself from them.


If you have mutual friends, you can be cordial during social situations, but you don't have to be close friends.
Determine if they are likely to betray you again and how you would feel if they did so.

, Pain from a bad friendship can make you act differently in future friendships. Instead of punishing new friends for things that trigger bad memories of betrayal, have open and honest conversations with them about how you've been betrayed in the past. Get to know their intentions and motivations before assuming anything, and treat each person as an individual.All people are different and just because one friend betrayed you does not mean that other friends will.

Ask for forgiveness.,
Tell your friend you will adjust your behavior.,
Let your friend have some space.,
Do something nice for your friend.,
Discuss any issues before they become arguments.,
Maintain healthy boundaries.,
Spend quality time together.",How to Ask a Friend to Forgive You," You should ask your friend to meet you in an area that is quiet and not very crowded so you can talk in private. Choose an area that feels like neutral ground, as you do not want your friend to feel uncomfortable. You may opt for a quiet spot at school or a bench in a park nearby.You may also choose a coffee shop or local hang out you and your friend enjoy going to. Meeting in a spot that is part of your friendship may make the conversation feel less awkward.;
, Start the conversation by expressing regret for what you did to your friend. Humble yourself and be vulnerable. Do not get defensive or make up excuses for your actions. Instead, let your friend know that you regret what you did and realize it was wrong.For example, you may say to your friend, “I realize now that pulling that prank on you was wrong and inconsiderate. I regret doing that to you.” Or you may say, “I know now that lying to you was the wrong thing to do. I regret my actions.”

, You should then apologize to your friend in a sincere, heartfelt way. Always use “I” statements in your apology and focus on your perspective on what you did. Do not use “you” or “we”, as this can come off like you are blaming your friend for your mistake. Instead, focus on your actions only in your apology.For example, you may say “I am truly sorry for what I did to you. I hope you can accept my apology.” Or, you may say, “I realize now what I did was wrong. I am very sorry for my actions.”

, Once you have offered your friend a sincere apology, you should ask your friend if they would be willing to forgive you. Try to make your request with real emotion and be vulnerable in front of your friend. Your friend may be more likely to forgive you if they can tell you truly feel bad and regret what you did.For example, you may say, “Do you think you would be able to forgive me for what I did?” or “Would you forgive me for my mistake?”

, Even if your friend accepts your apology and forgives you, it still may take time for your friendship to recover. You should take steps to make amends for your behavior so your friendship can move forward in a positive way. Making amends, even in a small way, can help your friend get over your mistake.You may make amends by making a promise to change your behavior. For example, you may tell your friend, “I will be more honest with you going forward and never lie to you again” or “I will not play any more pranks on you.”
You can also ask your friend how you can make amends for your actions and be willing to follow through on their response. You may ask, “What can I do to make it up to you?” or “How can I repair our friendship?”

, Though you may have a good talk with your friend and feel you have both reached a better place in your friendship, your friend may still need time to process and accept your apology. You should step back and give your friend some space. Allow them some time to digest your apology and work through their own feelings around forgiving you.For example, you may tell your friend, “I know this is a lot to process and I understand if you want some time alone to digest my apology.”
You may then follow up with your friend in a few days to see how they are doing and to try to talk to them again. They may be more willing to renew your friendship if they have had some time away to process their feelings.

, You can also make amends for your actions for doing something sweet for your friend to show them you can be a good friend. This could be doing a thoughtful act for them, such as helping them study for an upcoming exam or assisting them with an errand or chore. You may also act nice to them by complimenting them or being more considerate of them.You may also surprise your friend with a thoughtful gift to show them how bad you feel about your actions. Choose a gift that will feel special to your friend and show them how much you care about them.

, You and your friend can maintain a stronger friendship by being honest with each other, no matter how tricky or sensitive an issue may be. You should be willing to sit down together and discuss any issues you may have with each other in a mature and honest way. Doing this will ensure smaller issues do not get blown out of proportion and lead to arguments or conflicts.You may check in with your friend periodically to make sure there are no issues or conflicts between you. If there are any issues, you should address them with your friend head on and work together to come up with a solution or a compromise.

, Friends are close by nature and you may have a very close relationship with your friend. It may become even closer once they have forgiven you and your friendship has recovered. But you should still try to maintain healthy boundaries in your friendship. This means you may not spend every waking minute together, and you should set aside time to hang out with other friends or partners. Having boundaries in your friendship will ensure you do not become too emotionally wrapped up in your interactions with your friend.For example, you may make plans once a week with your friend so you have time to hang out. But you may then devote the rest of your time to studying for school, spending time with your family, and hanging out with your partner. Having a balance in your life will ensure none of your relationships suffer or become too emotionally draining.

, When you do hang out with your friend, make sure it is a quality hang. Do something together that will be fun and engaging for both of you. Or choose an outing that you will both enjoy. Having quality time together will only strengthen your friendship and ensure it stays healthy.For example, you may have a standing dinner date with your friend where you eat and talk about your week, just the two of you. Or you may go on a mini adventure in your area so you can create quality memories together.

Take action.",How to Apologize to a Taurus," Tauruses have many positive traits and make trusted friends, family members, managers and employees. They are independent financially and emotionally and love stability, so you can always count on a Taurus. They can also be very generous, down-to-earth people who love to entertain and enjoy the finer things in life, such as art, music and fine cuisine.Tauruses are incredibly dependable, and this is a hallmark of their sign. They have a strong sense of duty and will always get the job done. They also thrive on feeling secure, and material objects bring them comfort.
Tauruses do have a gentle side as well. They are patient and can be very loving people.
Tauruses are persistent and will work very hard to get what they want. Obstacles, failures or setbacks do not discourage them.;
, There are a lot of good things about the Taurus personality, but people with this sign also carry many negative traits that can be difficult to deal with. In order to understand how to approach a Taurus, you need to know where problems could arise. Tauruses can be stubborn, inflexible, self-indulgent, lazy, materialistic and possessive.


One of the most familiar characteristics of this sign is stubbornness. It is what helps keep Tauruses steady in life and achieve their goals. Tauruses do not like changing their minds. Know that when a Taurus doesn’t like the points you are making in your argument, he or she may just refuse to listen to you.
Tauruses love to indulge in pleasurable and materialistic luxuries. Because of this, they can come across as lazy and unmotivated. You must give them a good reason to step out of their comfort zone.
People born under the Taurus sign can be very attached to people and things, so they may become possessive, resentful or jealous easily. Tauruses may not seem like they have a temper but they do. Always be wary of messing with the bull sign. If you do, steer clear until that temper subsides.

, Venus, the Goddess of Love, is Taurus’s ruling planet. For this reason, Tauruses seek love for fulfillment and are rarely cynical about it. However, Tauruses do not make the most romantic partners because they value logic, facts and reality over emotions and other abstracts. Their approach to love can be raw, dogged and physical. Tauruses possessive nature can make their partners feel as if they are being controlled instead of truly loved. Tauruses need to be reminded that lovers must be treated with dignity and respect.
When a Taurus is pursuing a lover, he or she can be resolute and unwavering. Tauruses will play the waiting game far longer than almost any other sign to get what they want. This can be a bad thing, though, if the one they are pursuing isn’t interested. Make sure a Taurus understands what you do and don’t want out of a relationship.
It may be difficult to compromise with Tauruses in relationships. They must be encouraged to ask questions and come to a mutual agreement instead of deciding things on their own.

, Tauruses are knowledgeable and articulate people. They are not passive-aggressive types who are afraid to tell you what they think. If you are wrong about something, a Taurus will let you know. Sometimes, this disapproval can sting quite a bit because they tend not to think about how what they say makes you feel.Tauruses may come across as bossy because of their critical eye and attention to detail. They rarely refrain from telling you how they think you should do things. The best thing you can do is not take this personally because the Taurus in your life is only trying to make everything perfect for both of you.

, People who fall under the Taurus sign are usually easy-going and laid back unless someone crosses the line or pushes their buttons. If you challenge a Taurus, be prepared for a lengthy conflict. A Taurus man or woman will argue obstinately, determined to make you agree with him or her. You will then see the legendary Taurus stubbornness firsthand, and while a Taurus will seem unmoved by the cruel words he or she says, these words can be deeply hurtful to you.Be careful when mentioning when a Taurus does something wrong. Though these people have no qualms about telling you when there's a problem with you, they are sensitive to anything that threatens their pride. They will avoid facing others when they make a mistake, and often attempt to apologize too late. This can push people away and even make enemies., The first step to preparing an effective apology is to realize what you did wrong. Don’t make up excuses for why you did what you did or blame others. Be brutally honest with yourself, and determine what offense you committed that contributed to the conflict.


Consider how what you did or didn’t do effected the other person and his or her life.

, You can now comprehend the Taurus personality a little better, so take a moment to think of how he or she feels both during and after the offense. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes, and use the Taurus perspective to imagine these emotions very clearly—anger, hurt or disappointment.

, Recognize that you wish you hadn’t done the action or said the words you did but don’t beat yourself up about it. Everyone makes mistakes, but your apology will only be effective after you forgive yourself. This is because guilt is very distracting, and an apology is not about you but the person you wronged. Forgiving yourself, apologizing to the person you hurt and trying not to make the same mistake again are the best things you can do for a guilty conscience.


The purpose of guilt is to discourage you from going against your values, moral codes or beliefs. Know that holding onto guilt serves no positive function.

, Every conflict has 2 sides and at least 2 people contributing to the problem. If the conflict occurred with a Taurus, then chances are you were also hurt in some way. Your apology will not be sincere if you have not gotten over the harm he or she caused you. Even if you don’t say anything about it, you will not be able to forget the things that hurt you, and resentment may slip through in other ways.


Think of at least one reason that the other person reacted the way he or she did. Consider the earlier exercise when you put yourself in the other person’s shoes. It is easier to forgive someone when you see their point of view and understand motivations, emotions and personality traits. This type of compassion may encourage others to forgive you more easily as well.Forgiving yourself and the person you wronged is not just fair but freeing. It allows you to take the first step to actually make the apology and then move on. Resolutions can strengthen relationships and allow you to let go of people who can't forgive., You want your apology to be a positive experience for both of you because you probably won’t get a second chance at it, so don’t be impulsive. Think about the words you want to use to express your apology based off what you did wrong and how the person likely feels. A simple, “I’m sorry” can work well but may not be enough for larger mistakes and transgressions.Don’t worry so much about the best way to make an apology. An apology of some sort is better than no apology. Overcome your anxiety and fear of being judged so you can make the apology.
You may choose to apologize in person, by phone or in writing. Face-to-face apologies are usually the best way to apologize to a Taurus because it shows your courage and sincerity--qualities this sign respects. However, it can be very stressful and remembering what to say under pressure can be difficult. Choosing to apologize by phone may be a better option here.
Apologizing in writing will allow you to perfect the message, especially if you have a hard time expressing yourself verbally. It gives both you and the person you wronged the time and space to consider your apology and forgive you. Though it is less stressful for you, it may not be the best option for a Taurus, unless he or she lives far from you.

, Focus your energy on finding a remedy that will satisfy the other person. Ask yourself questions, such as: “How can I fix this issue and restore his or her faith in me?” or “What can I improve to ensure this situation won’t happen again?” The solution may be something simple or it may take more time and energy., A meaningful apology communicates that you are sorry, that you accept responsibility and that you want to do something to make it better. This is also known as the 3 R's--Regret, Responsibility and Remedy. You need to express all 3 elements for your apology to be meaningful and effective.Know that you are apologizing only for your actions not for who you are. When you realize this, making the apology becomes easier., Be honest and genuine when you offer an expression of empathy toward the person, and allow your remorse and sincerity show on your face. Remember that letting the other person know you are sorry proves that you are capable of recognizing your error and strong enough to admit it.Even if you did not intend to hurt the other person, show him or her that you recognize something you did or didn’t do contributed to the person’s hurt or difficulty and makes you feel bad.
You might say: ""I am so sorry. I know I hurt your feelings and I feel bad for it."" Another idea is something like, ""I regret hurting you. I’m sorry,"" or, ""I’m truly sorry for any pain or inconvenience I may have caused you."", Don’t get defensive, try to explain yourself or use “buts”. You already let the person know you are sorry, now you need to tell them what you’re sorry about in a clear, respectful and direct way. Admit where you messed up, and accept responsibility for the consequences of your actions.People in the Taurus sign are straight-forward and frank. They will appreciate you accepting your mistake.
Even if there are valid reasons for why you did what you did, remember that these are not excuses that justify the consequences.
Examples of statements that show responsibility, include: ""I realize that by being late I caused you to worry about me and lose out on some of our time together,"" or, ""I know it’s hard for you to trust anyone, and my lying to you has only reinforced your inability to trust. There is no excuse for what I did. I shouldn’t have lied at all,” or, “I understand why you are angry. I shouldn’t have said that to you. I know it hurt you.”, Make a statement showing your willingness to try to remedy the problem. This may be a promise that you won’t (or will try not to) do it again or a statement that explains what you are going to do to make it better—such as pay for damages or go to therapy. You both understand that you can’t undo what was done no matter how much you wish you could, but you can still help repair the damage.


Examples include: “Let me make it up to you by paying for dinner next time,"" or “I'll let you know next time when your jealousy is making me upset instead of holding it in until I explode like that,"" or “I’m starting therapy tomorrow to try and understand why I am acting this way.”, How you feel about having to make an apology and what you want out of the apology will be communicated nonverbally. Make sure that your apology stems from a desire to reconnect, let the person know you are sorry and that you want to do something about what happened. Otherwise, your apology will not feel genuine and may seem manipulative, which makes it very unlikely to be accepted.Don’t apologize just because someone else tells you, because it is expected in the situation or because it will get you what you want.
Accept others’ apologies as well. If you want people to accept when you are sorry, then do the same. If the other person apologizes to you sincerely, be gracious with your response. Thank them for trying to make things better.

, If you just can’t come up with or give an adequate apology, then at least admit your inability to do so. If you know an apology would probably help but can’t follow through at the moment, tell the person something like, “I’m really mad right now. I know an apology would help but I’m not ready for that yet.” A Taurus may recognize that kind of stubbornness in themselves as well and appreciate your honesty., You can try to soften your Taurus by giving him or her something special, such as a home-cooked meal or a sentimental object that reminds the person of how you connected in the first place. Appeal to the loyalty that Taurus feels towards partners, friends and family as well as their love of material and luxury items. Always follow through with your promises to remedy the situation. If you said, for example, you’d go to therapy, then be sure to go.


If your Taurus is female, get some flowers or chocolates (if she likes them). Add a message like ""Dear Pooja, I'm very sorry I acted like that the other day. I hope you forgive me. Yours, Pragathi.
If your Taurus is male, get something he wanted badly, such as a new phone case or facial hair trimmer. Gift it to him yourself, and apologize. You may also try giving him a funny sorry postcard.

Never say sorry over txt or FB.",How to Apologize to a Friend," Unless you and your friend live far away from each other, your best bet is to apologize in person. Anything else could be considered lame, and make you look like a lame friend. Sending flowers or gifts is okay, but if you do this kind of thing instead of talking to your friend face to face then you're just hiding behind gifts. And flowers aren't going to pipe up and say ""I'm sorry."" If you want your apology to sound sincere, then no expensive gift or ornate bouquet is going to beat a face-to-face meeting.If your friend is really far away, then call or Skype them. It's not perfect, but it is way better than ignoring things until you see each other again.;
, Is it pretty minor, like not showing up to your friend's party when you said you would, or is it something serious, like hooking up with your friend's boyfriend? If it's minor, then you should act fast and apologize to your friend as soon as you both have some free time. Just get it done with. If your friend needs some time for her wounds to heal, then give her a few days to calm down -- your apology isn't going to mean much if they want to beat the crap out of you whenever they see you talking.


You should know your friend better than most people. Is he or she the kind of person who needs a lot of time to cool off, or who forgives pretty easily? How bad was it last time you hung out?
If you know your friend is going to be under an incredible amount of stress or is dealing with something personal, then just chill out and hold on. Your apology, remember, is about them, not about you.

, Apologies should be heartfelt. But they should also tick off the following boxes:


Taking full responsibility for what you've done.
Noticing how it's made the other person feel.
Including the words ""I'm sorry.""
Showing how grateful you are for the friendship.
Planning to make things up or be better next time.

, When you find that it's time to apologize, don't dilly dally and wait for your friend to approach you. If your friend approaches you about what you've done, then you already run the risk of looking like a wimp or a bad friend, so strike while the iron is hot (but when your friend has cooled off). Make apologizing to your friend a priority. If you don't care about doing it quickly, why do you even want to apologize?


Apologies can be hard. But they're necessary. Get over your fears and pride and remember that you hurt someone you love.

, If you really want to apologize to your friend, then you have to accept full responsibility for what you have done to him or her. If you don't think you should really apologize, are mad at your friend for doing something else, or think that your friend is overreacting and being dramatic, then don't even bother. You either apologize fully or you don't apologize at all -- got it?Say something like, ""I know I really let you down when I didn't go to your birthday party. I know how much it meant to you.""
You can also say, ""I am so sorry that I kissed your crush last week. I don't know what I was thinking, and I've been kicking myself over it ever since. Your friendship means way more to me than a dumb boy.""
If you're making excuses during your apology, you're a bad friend. End of story. Don't say, ""I'm sorry that I didn't go to your party, but..."" Giving an excuse for what you did is worse than not apologizing at all because it implies you're not really that sorry.

, That's right. This is the most important part. Suck it up and spit it out. Say, ""I'm really sorry that I did that."" Or, ""I'm really sorry that I..."" Make it clear that you are sorry about something that you've done to hurt your friend. This may be the hardest task, so take a deep breath, make eye contact with your friend, and say that you are really sorry.


Don't say something like, ""I'm sorry that you were so upset..."" This is some terrible, passive aggressive crap that basically blames them, not you. Like making excuses, it makes you a bad friend.

, After you accept responsibility for what you've done and have said that you were sorry, you have to acknowledge that you really hurt your friend. Show them that you're aware of how you have made your friend feel. This will make your friend see that you have put a lot of thought and effort into considering every angle of what you've done and that you feel really terrible about your actions.


Say something like, ""I can't imagine how disappointed you were when I didn't show up to your birthday party. You have been planning it for such a long time and I know you wanted it to be perfect.""
Or, ""I know you were incredibly hurt when I kissed Collin. You have had a crush on him for months and must have been heartbroken.""

, Let your friend see that your friendship is more important than anything else in the world and that you know you need to redefine your priorities in the future. Your friend should see that whatever you did wasn't worth it and that you wish that you could start over and put your friend first in mind instead. Be humble and honest. This isn't the time for lame half-truths like, ""you know I'm your friend."" This is the time for ""I'm your friend, but I didn't act like it. I will from here on out.""


Say, ""I missed your birthday party. I shouldn't have done that. I made a commitment to you and dropped it, but I won't take my promises so lightly again.""
Say, ""I can't believe what I did with Collin. He means nothing to me and you mean everything to me. Our friendship is more important to me than any romantic relationship.""

, Again, don't try and buy them out with fancy things. Things don't create friendships, conversations do. Take them out for dinner, make plans to hang out soon, and return to friendship. This is your friend, and it shouldn't be hard to make time for them if you really care about their feelings.Say, ""I'll never flake on you again. I won't leave you high and dry in the future. When I say I'll be somewhere, I'll be there. Let me take you out to a private birthday party at the movies/dinner/the park/laser tag/etc.""
Say, ""I'll never try to even flirt with someone you have a crush on. I know how much your crushes mean to you and I won't interfere with your romantic life again.""

, After you've said all of the things you've had to say, ask your friend, ""Will you forgive me?"" Hopefully, your friend will see how much your friendship means to you and will forgive you right away. Then you can hug, show how happy you are, and be relieved that you made it through the apology. And if your friend needs a little more time and won't forgive you, at least you can tell yourself that you tried. There is little more you can do than offer a sincere apology. If they don't take it, that is on them, not you, and you shouldn't keep pushing them to forgive you -- it won't work.


A simple ""Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?"" will mean the world.
No one likes asking for forgiveness, that's what makes it so meaningful when you do! Don't skip this step just because you're too proud -- it's important.

, When writing you letter, make sure it's sincere and apologetic. This could also be a good idea if they're too angry to see you in person. Make sure, however, that you write that you want to see them in person -- don't hide behind a letter or an email. You have to do this face to face sooner or later.

, This is a more dramatic peace offering, but it can help make your friend feel better and like you've really made an effort. Include a small card that also says your sorry so your friend feels more special. Not everyone will be impressed, though, and this can be seen as your attempt to cover up something you did. The workaround? Don't let it be a cover up -- you still need to see them in person!

, If you and your friend live far apart, then the best way to apologize may be over the phone. Just call your friend, be sincere, and do the same things you would do in person: accept responsibility, apologize, promise to never do it again, ask for forgiveness, etc. This may be a little harder because it'll be more challenging to read your friend and see how he or she is actually feeling.


Stay on the line when you're done, letting the conversation turn to other topics, like old friends would.
Don't apologize over voicemail -- it is just tacky and insincere.
If they don't call you back, too bad. They're not ready for the apology, and you need to go in person.

, If you're really sorry for something you've done, then sending a text message or Facebook message just isn't going to cut it. This is pretty impersonal and doesn't show much effort on your part. Sure, it's harder to suck it up and call the person or talk to him or her face to face, but this shows that you actually care about the friendship. Apologies are about you being sorry for your mistakes -- it is your job, therefore, to go apologize in person like a grown man or woman would."

Figure out why she was offended.,
Apologize in person.,
Be sincere in your apology.,
List the hurtful effects of your actions when you apologize.,
Admit your wrongdoing.,
Listen to her response.,
Ask for her forgiveness.,
Move on.",How to Apologize to a Girl You Accidentally Insulted1," Did your comment implicate someone she loved, like a family member or friend, accidentally? Did you bring up a story or event from her past that she would rather not talk about? Is there a simple misunderstanding between you two? The simplest way to figure out your mistake is to ask, but there are other methods as well.


Talk to her friends -- do they know how you insulted her?
Replay the event in your head -- did you say something off-hand that you didn't realize was offensive?;
, Pull her aside and let her know that you never meant to offend her. Outline briefly what you meant to say and avoid making excuses -- this is not the time to go on trial, it is the time to atone for your mistake.


Get your apology in as soon as possible -- the longer you wait to say sorry the harder it will be to convince her that you mean it.

, Do not apologize just to ""get her off your back,"" as she'll see through it instantly. Good ways to show your sincerity include:


Make eye contact.
Slightly bow your head.
Talk in a slow, calm, and measured voice.
Don't rush your apology to ""get it over with.""

, This will show empathy and show that you are actually sorry. If you simply say that you're sorry, you'll give the impression that you're only sorry about getting caught.

, This simple show of humility is the most powerful thing you can do in an apology. You made a mistake, knowingly or not, and you need to own up to your mistake to move on. Why were you wrong? Do you understand why you were offensive? Let her know that you've learned from your mistake.


""I'm so sorry I said that -- I never meant to hurt you and I won't say it again.""
""I made a mistake thinking that was okay, it won't happen again.""

, The apology is her opportunity to tell you how you made her feel, and an opportunity for both of you to move forward. Listen attentively and take her thoughts on board. If you can, rephrase them back to her to show that you were listening. This is why you need to get a few minutes to apologize to her.

, While difficult, you need to come clean, say you're sorry, and hope that she forgives you. If your mistake was accidental, chances are good she will be laugh off the misunderstanding and move on.


There is no more effective way to ask for forgiveness than a simple, ""I'm sorry.""

, Once you've apologized, it's time to get your friendship back on track. If you've accidentally offended her, the best you can do is apologize, admit your wrongdoing, and ask for forgiveness. If she is unwilling to accept this, than give her some time to see that you are sincere. However, don't feel like you need to bend over backwards to make things right -- everyone makes mistakes, and she needs to be able to forgive you.

Notice if he becomes nervous or suddenly quiet around you.,
Watch her movements when you're together and see if they mirror your own.,
Look for lots of eye contact.,
Get into a group situation with him and see if he pays more attention to you.",How to Tell if a Natural Flirt Likes You1," One way to tell if a flirt really likes you is if he doesn't flirt with you. If he's a natural flirt, he's probably not putting too much thought into his actions when he's friendly with other people--that's just how he is. But if he clams up when you are near, acts fidgety and nervous and not really like himself, it could be because he is now very aware of his actions and is overthinking everything.

Watch him interacting with a group of people, then walk up and say hi. See if his behavior changes--if he gets quiet, tones down his goofiness, or doesn't say much but keeps glancing at you.
See if one of your friends will join the group and try to embarrass him a little--nothing mean, just a small joke at his expense. If he blushes or gets embarrassed when he'd normally take the joke in stride, it might mean he doesn't want to look bad in front of you.
If you make him nervous, he may continue to be very friendly with other girls and appear to ignore you or be less friendly toward you.
Not every flirty person becomes nervous when around their crush, so if they're not suddenly getting shy, it doesn't necessarily mean they don't like you. They might be the type that will give you more attention instead.;
, If she's interested in you, she will subconsciously copy your body language.When you're hanging out, try crossing your legs and see if she does the same a few seconds after. Take a drink of water and watch for her to also take a sip.


Mirroring a person's actions is a way to bond, get comfortable with each other, and send the signal that you like the other person, even if you're not even aware you're doing it.If you decide to try this in reverse - mimicking her movements so she will subconsciously feel comfortable with you--make sure you don't follow too closely or precisely. Wait a few seconds before mirroring her actions. If she picks up on what you are doing, she may think you're mocking her and the effect will be ruined., Try to notice if she's constantly glancing at you across the room or when you're in a group, then blushing or glancing away when you catch her looking. When you're having a conversation, notice if she starts looking into your eyes as though she's studying them.Prolonged eye contact or a lot of quick glances in your direction indicates she's interested in you.

To see if she likes you, try holding her gaze while you're flirting. If she seems uncomfortable and looks away quickly, she's probably not interested in anything romantic. But if she stares back at you, it's a good sign that she's into you.You can find out if she's watching you by taking a small action, like appearing to look at something strange out the window. If she's watching you, she won't be able to help but look out the window, too., When you're with a lot of other people, does he seem to pick you out of the crowd? When you're having separate conversations with other people, does he suddenly chime in, alerting you that he's been paying more attention to what you're saying than the person he's talking to? If he likes you, he will constantly be looking for ways to be near you and interact with you.

Go out to dinner in a group and see if he makes sure he's sitting next to you.
Try to hang out a few times in group setting, and notice if he makes a point to come talk to you each time.
Go to a party and try to stay until the end. If he hangs around with you long after most people have gone, he probably went to the party just to talk to you.

Act politely.,
Understand why the insult was offensive.,

Remember what insulted her and refrain from repeating it.",How to Apologize to a Girl You Accidentally Insulted2," Is there something you can do to make her feel better? Is there someone else that you may need to apologize to, such as a friend or family member who was also nearby. Showing that you will do things to fix your mistake proves that you are truly sorry and want to prevent future insult.


Do not, however, feel like you ""owe"" her anything. Your actions should be done out of caring, and she should not take advantage of you with absurd or unreasonable demands.

, If you tell her during the apology that you are going to act differently in the future, put your money where your mouth is and actually do so.

, While you should do this all of the time, go out of your way to show that you still respect her, despite your slip up. Treating her with respect and humility will help heal the wounds that were accidentally opened.


You don't need to act like she is queen. Basic dignity and curtsey should suffice.

, You need to go a step further than apologizing if you want to make a real difference in your friendship. Ask her to explain why your words/actions hurt, and make sure you take the time to listen.

, You may feel entitled to an apology as well -- after all, you did not mean to be offensive -- but this is not the time or place. You need to understand where she is coming from if you hope to avoid further issues. Do no argue or try and convince her that ""you weren't being insulting"" or that she is ""overreacting.""


The offender does not get to choose what is offensive. If she felt insulted, then you insulted her.

, This may seem obvious, but oftentimes, after a sincere apology, you may think that you can repeat the insult ""jokingly."" This is not only rude, it is incredibly disrespectful. You need to honor her wishes and find new language to express yourself.

When you are in a group, does she seem to be glancing at you to see your reactions? If she quickly glances away when you catch her looking, then looks back, she's likely interested in you.Smiling, holding eye contact, or raising her eyebrows are all very flirtatious things she could do in the moment.;
, It's not flirting if she's outright mean, but if she's being a little sassy, and smiling and laughing as she gently makes fun of something you said or did, she's likely flirting with you.Tease her back if you want to flirt, but just make sure you stay above the belt--don't say anything really hurtful.

, Does she touch your arm while making a point or when she gets excited? Does she take your hand into hers? Does she rub your back while smiling at you?Does she come up behind you and tickle you where she knows you're sensitive? This is a playful way to get you laughing, touching, and flirting.

, If she texts you about something funny that happened in class, a silly picture, or a random question (like, ""If you were a super hero, what would be your super power?""), it means you're on her mind. She's trying to initiate a conversation with you because she is interested in you., If a girl initiates the conversation, this is a major sign that she is into you. Girls usually wait for the guy to come over to her, so this is a really good sign for you.

, Does she constantly try to get a hold of you online? Does she send you ""good morning"" or ""goodnight"" texts? These are clear signs that she's thinking about you. , Are her texts accompanied by a lot of smiley faces, blushing faces, or winks.

When a girl is into you, there is often something called a ""halo effect"" that makes you appear almost perfect in her eyes.She'll be the first to laugh at your jokes, no matter how silly or dumb they are.
This may be her subtle way of complimenting you--she wants you to know she thinks you're funny and that you're a blast to be around.

, This is a way to remind you of a joke or a moment you share (maybe she calls you ""grape soda"" because you once spilled an entire bottle in your lap), and to strengthen your connection. It might also be another way to gently tease you.


If everyone calls you ""Bear"" and she does too, it probably doesn't mean anything. But if she makes up a nickname that only she uses, she's flirting.

, This could be a flirting tactic to keep you wanting more.She doesn't want to sound desperate by always responding to you right away. Texting that she's got somewhere else to be might be her way of showing you that other people desire her attention, too.

, Games can be a nice segue into getting closer to you. Some of the following can suggest a flirty interest in you:


Is she boasting about beating your score in an online game? She's probably teasing you and trying to entice you into a flirty competition.
Is she telling you that she lost an online game? She might want you to feel sorry for her and respond (in a joking way) ""Are you okay?"".
Is she inviting you to join a shared game online? This could be her way of finding a neutral territory to spend more time together.

, This might give you a chuckle if you recognize it, but it's something to be flattered by. If she is feeling bold, she'll enter into your space by starting a random conversation.Here are some ones girls (and guys) use all the time:



""Hey, I forgot my notebook, do you remember what homework was?"" She might have actually forgot her books, but she chose to ask you about homework.

""Can you help me out with this problem? I have no idea what's going on here."" This is especially significant if she is a good student. Why would a good student need homework help?

""Can you hold my backpack/sit with my stuff for me? It's really heavy/a lot to carry!"" Girls plan ahead on almost everything. Why would she bring too much stuff to school if she couldn't carry it?

, When she's around you, does she start fixing her clothes, twisting her rings, touching her mouth, or twirling her hair? If she does these things while maintaining eye contact, or making eye contact and then glancing down, it indicates she's nervous--in a good way.When flirting, a girl might touch or lick her lips or fidget with her necklace or the collar of her shirt as a slightly suggestive way to excite you.

, When she's sitting near you or if you are standing and talking, glance at her feet. If her feet are pointed directly at you, it means you have her attention and she's interested.Don't worry too much if her feet are pointing in another direction.


If she begins to lean in while you're talking, she's signaling that she's interested. This is an especially good sign if you're in a group--she's singling you out.Tilting her head to one side is another sign that she's engaged with you and is interested.While her feet pointing at you might mean she's getting ready to flirt with you, feet pointed away doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't like you. This is not an either/or scenario.

, If her voice starts to get higher or lower when you are around, it's a sign that she likes you. People involuntarily change the tone of their voices when they're near someone they're attracted to., Does she lean back away from you when you talk? Or is she constantly looking to the left or right? She might be looking for an escape route., Sit down or stand near her when she has a bag or a purse and watch what she does with it. If she's clutching her bag tightly, using it to cover herself, or puts it between you when you're sitting near each other, it's a sign that she's not interested in flirting with you., If she doesn't respond and rarely laughs at your jokes, it's not a great sign. She might just be having a bad day, but if she's constantly rolling her eyes when you speak, seems indifferent to the conversation, or is outright mean, then this is not the girl for you.


What kind of tone does she use when talking to you? Does she always sound rushed or annoyed?

, Is she just a friendly person? Usually you can tell a girl is flirting with you because she treats you differently from others. So a really friendly girl might become shy around someone she likes. Another girl might pay more attention to her crush. But if she treats you just the same as all her other friends, there's little chance she's actually being flirtatious.

, If she just tells you a story about a random guy, or about someone hitting on her, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. She could even be trying to make you jealous. But if she's asking you for advice about how to get with her crush, or talks about hooking up with someone else, she's not thinking of you as a romantic prospect.

Use flirtatious body language.,
Make and hold direct eye contact.,
Touch him in a way that is affectionate, but not creepy.,
Surprise him by doing something spontaneous.",How to Make a Boy Blush1," Flirtation but subtle examples of body language includes making direct eye contact, good posture, and smiling. Sitting upright shows you are attentive and interested in him, looking into his eyes communicates a sense of closeness and connection, and a relaxed, natural smile shows you are happy and confident Many guys communicate through and are more receptive to body language instead of words.If he is interested you and enjoying the attention, he will respond through behavior such as smiling, uncrossing his arms, taking hands out of his pockets, looking into your eyes, or leaning towards you slightly.
Be subtle and avoid behavior such as standing or sitting too close, staring at him too intently, or constantly ""checking him out"". Using aggressive body language will make him feel uncomfortable and standoffish. In this situation, he may start blushing because he is upset and uncomfortable.
A good rule of thumb is to maintain at least one arm's length distance. Any closer, and his natural inclination will be to move away.;
, Exchanging a mutual unbroken gaze for at least 2 minutes produces increased feelings of passion, which will likely make both of you blush.Start by glancing in his direction and trying to casually catch his eye. If he makes eye contact and does not redirect his gaze, smile and look him in the eye for 5 seconds and then quickly look away.Repeat several times, increasing how long you maintain eye contact each time. Once he starts blushing, consider introducing yourself. Remember to keep a natural smile and avoid overly-toothy or tight-lipped grins.


If you ride the bus or subway with a guy you think is cute, consider sitting across from him. Pretend to casually read a book or look at your phone, while glancing up in his direction.
If you are shy, making eye-contact is a great way to be seductive and get a guy to blush. As you walk by him, look up and catch his eye, hold it for several seconds, smile and keep walking. Begin walking away and after a few steps, look back at him over your shoulder.If he drops your gaze or looks away, it's a sign he is not interested. Do not continue staring at him or trying to re-initiate eye contact. This will only come off as creepy and borderline sexual harassment., Communicate you are interested in him by gently touching his forearm, shoulder, or waist.Gently brush your fingers a short distance along his forearm or shoulder, or place your fingers his forearm or waist for several seconds and then remove.This type of touch is stimulating without being offensive, and is sure to make him blush if he is interested in you. Once you are more comfortable around one another, try softly brushing your fingers along his cheek or touching his biceps.


Do not linger too long - the touch should last no more than 3 seconds. Also, do not repeat too soon or too often, as this might be seen as moving too fast and negate the subtle aspects of your flirtation.

, Show you are confident by doing something spontaneous, but fun and flirty to get his attention and make him blush. This could be as simple as introducing yourself and initiating conversation or asking about his interests, or as outrageous as asking him to dance at a party or buying him a drink at a bar.


Being spontaneous will catch him off guard. The realization of being surprised, especially if he is the center of attention, will cause him to blush.

Start using a word a lot and see if he begins saying it, too.,
Evaluate the depth of your conversations.,
Find out if he's been asking or talking about you.",How to Tell if a Natural Flirt Likes You2," It doesn't have to be anything very obvious--maybe you start saying ""y'all"" instead of ""you guys""--and notice if it starts popping up as part of his vocabulary. This is a way of subconsciously signaling you are on the same wavelength and try to get you to like him.

If you have a slight accent, he may begin mirroring your accent without realizing it., Does she always keep things very light, with a lot of joking and talking about movies or a difficult assignment--subjects she'd probably discuss with anyone? Or has she begun to confide in you a little bit, telling you more personal things or getting really deep into her beliefs or hopes for her future? If so, she wants you to take her seriously and to build a deeper connection with you.


If she looks upset or you know she's had a bad day, make a point to let her know you're available to talk, and see if she confides in you.
If conversations are somewhat surface, but she gets over-the-top excited when you have things in common, she's still trying to connect with you. So when your chat about movies reveals you both love Jason Statham and she is overjoyed, she's showing that she's a good match., Ask your friends if your name has come up in conversation and see if they can find out from his friends if he talks about you a lot.If he likes you, he's going to be curious about you and what makes you tick. So if he randomly asks your friend who is on her way to basketball practice ""Oh, isn't on the team, too?"", he's very interested in you.

If it turns out your name often comes up in conversation--maybe relaying something funny or interesting you said--it's a sign that you're on his mind.
He may even tell mutual friends that he's really interested in getting to know you, hoping they'll tell you."
"
Wait until you have time off after a fight.,
Empathize.,
Don’t be passive aggressive.,
Broach the subject.,
Express regret and remorse.,
Take full responsibility for your actions.,
Acknowledge repercussions, if there are any.,
Keep it short.,
Suggest reparations.,
Allow him a chance to speak.,
Try not to get defensive.,
Move on.",How to Apologize to a Guy," If you have adrenaline pumping through you, you are less likely to express yourself adequately when you apologize. Most men will understand if you need to take a moment for yourself, even if you are in the wrong.For example, say something like ""I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now, so I need a little bit of time by myself to cool off, but we can talk about this when I come back."";
, Try to think of what he’s feeling. If you did something wrong, determine how you’d feel if it were done to you. Empathizing with the one you hurt is an essential part of the recovery process., A common mistake some women and men in relationships make is having an ulterior motive to your apology. If you plan on saying “I’m sorry, but…” it is not a real apology.Passive aggression can come in many forms, like sarcasm, such as ""I'm sorry I'm such an awful girlfriend,"" or trying to shift the blame, such as ""I'm sorry your feelings got hurt.""

, After you've collected your thoughts and you're prepared to apologize, you need to think about how to start the conversation. Wait for moment when nothing distracting is going on, when the two of you are alone, and not pressed for time. Long car rides can be good for this, or at night when the two of you are eating dinner. Say something along the lines of ""If now is a good time, I'd like to apologize for what I did."" Get straight to the point.If he says now isn't a good time, don't press the issue, just wait for a better opportunity. If the reason it isn't a good time is because he's still really angry about the issue, let him know briefly that you understand why he's angry and you are there to talk about it when ever he's ready and wants to.

, Look him in the eyes and say “I’m sorry,” and paraphrase what you are sorry for. It's important that you make clear that you understand exactly how you've hurt him. Including what happened will let him know you listened and considered his thoughts.For example, if you're apologizing for yelling at your boyfriend for something you knew wasn't his fault, you might say, ""I'm sorry I lashed out at you last night over something you had no responsibility for. I understand how this made you feel like I didn't care about your feelings and was just using you to selfishly take out my anger.""

, Instead of including a reason that you would have behaved this way, you should refrain from giving your feelings on the situation immediately. Giving excuses for your behavior will make it sound like you're not really sorry.For example, instead of saying, ""I'm sorry I acted the way I did. I was just really frustrated with things at work and I had a headache that was making me cranky,"" you should just say, ""I'm sorry I acted the way I did. I had no right to be like that to you.""
If he wants to know why you acted the way you did, he can ask you. Then, you can explain your behavior.
Insincere apologies often express a regret for being caught, rather than actual remorse., For example, saying “I understand it will be hard to trust me” will help him to understand that you have considered how your actions affect him. It's wise to let him know you don't expect immediate and total forgiveness.

, Cut down everything you want to say to short, straightforward statements. Get your remorse, understanding, and acknowledgment across without going on to much. This will both give him more time to let out what he needs to say, and avoid any sort of miscommunication, While this does not apply to all small offenses, it can help in more serious situations. The best way to suggest reparations is to suggest how you are going to change bad behavior or habits in the future.Another way to suggest reparations is to ask “What can I do to make this better?” Then let him know you'll take his comments to heart., Try to keep the apology short and sweet. It will be less muddled and allow for a better conversation. A good apology should be a dialogue, not a monologue., There's a good chance that he is still angry. It's important that you keep your cool during the apology. Listen and express additional regret, if you feel it is necessary, but don't turn the apology into an argument.

, Stop talking about it once he has accepted the apology. Men often find it easier to accept an apology at face value and move on without resentment; so don’t bring it up unless it becomes an issue again."

Be playful by gently teasing him.,
Whisper something to him.,
Smile at him and then wink.,
Be playful by using a corny pick-up line.",How to Make a Boy Blush2," Teasing that is good-natured, and does not degrade or criticize, can help a guy feel self-conscious is a positive way.When you tease someone, you are trying to provoke a response - such as blushing - by commenting on the other person's appearance or personality. Teasing can be verbal or non-verbal, and is followed-up by indicator that lets the other person know your are being playful and are not serious. Good examples of how to tease in a way that is friendly and flirtatious, and not pushy or insensitive, include:


Pretend his hair is messy and playfully offer to smooth it down or stroke it out of his eyes.
Use an adjective like sweet, adorable, or lovable to describe his personality or what he is wearing.
Say the color of his shirt is so last year and then follow it up with ""just kidding!"". After a pause, tell him how much you like his outfit.
There is a fine line between teasing and bullying, and some people are more sensitive than others. If they react negatively, apologize immediately. Do not say something like ""I was only teasing"" or ""Can't you take a joke?""., Whisper about something special that you two share, like an inside joke or a common interest. Unless you are already comfortable around one another, do not actually cup your hand around his ear, but simply lean in and tell him something quietly. If he's interested in you, the intimacy of a whisper could cause him to blush.

, Smiling and winking might sound old fashioned and cliché, but it is endearing will probably make him blush. You can do it jokingly, by smiling and giving him an exaggerated wink. If he's interested, he might even smile and wink back.

, When most people think of pick-up lines, they usually respond by rolling their eyes. However, using a humorous pick-up line is a great way to get someone to laugh and make them blush.Avoid pick-up lines that are shallow, offensive, or only offer empty compliments such as ""Hey baby, did it hurt when you fell from heaven?"".Instead, choose one that is direct or innocuous.Here are some examples of ""tasteful"" and funny pick-up lines:


""How much does a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice, hi I'm (say your name)!""
""I saw you across the room/on the bus/in the store and I had to meet you. What's your name?""
Find a cheesy pick-up line that reflects his interests, such as science or literature."
"
Give him an unusual compliment.,
Give him a sincere compliment.,
Compliment him on his attractive qualities.",How to Make a Boy Blush3," The more unique the compliment, the better. For example, does he have a quirky habit or unusual hobby that you find endearing, but he often gets teased about? Pick a feature or interest he seems to be, or should be, proud of.If you know him well, then compliment a strong, positive personality trait. Say something about how confident, kind, or humorous he is.Compliments are a great way to make someone feel self-conscious and lead to blushing, but in a positive way. As long as they are genuine and meaningful, compliments show you are paying attention to him in a way that is not creepy and will (hopefully) make him feel better about himself., A sincere compliment is specific, to-the-point, and personal.Avoid giving compliments that are ambiguous or inappropriate.Also, avoid giving compliments too frequently, as you will risk him blushing because he's annoyed rather than flattered.Examples of sincere compliments include:


Expressing your appreciation for something he did, such as helping you with a project or to drag your heavy suitcase onto the bus.
Tell him that something he did inspired you, such as how he worked hard to achieve a certain goal, how he came up with a creative solution to a unique problem, or how he volunteers his time to help others.When giving a compliment, timing is important.While you do not want to miss an opportunity, randomly inserting a compliment into conversation or blurting it out without introducing yourself will come off as sounding too rehearsed and awkward.

, Ask yourself what qualities (physical feature, personality trait, accomplishments, etc.) you admire in him or that you find attractive.Especially if he is shy, he might not be used to receiving compliments. Practice what you want to say before hand, making sure it is respectful and sincere. This is not only a way to make him blush, but also show you are attentive and genuinely interested.

Limit your phone time.,
Limit the time you spend together.,
Have your own life.,
Keep it a bit mysterious.,
Don't be too easy to reach.,
Beware of trying to make her jealous.,
Be the last thing she thinks about at night.,
Make her wonder if you're thinking of her.,
Leave a piece of yourself with her.,
Charm her even when you're apart.,
Write her a letter.,
Treat her like a queen when you're together.",How to Make a Girl Miss You," If you really want the girl to miss you, then you can't spend all of your time talking to her on the phone, or she'll feel like you're not really away from her at all. If she knows she can talk to you all day long, she will begin to take you for granted and won't miss you nearly as much as she would if she knew she could only talk to you for twenty or so minutes a day because you're so busy.


Make it clear that you have a set schedule and that you can't just chat for hours whenever she feels like it. But don't be too harsh about it -- sometimes, a long conversation can be the perfect thing to solidify your relationship.;
, If you want the girl to miss you, then you can't always be around her, can you? Absence really does make the heart grow fonder, and you can't spend all of your time with the girl or she'll never have a chance to wish you were together. Though you shouldn't limit your time together so much that she never sees you and forgets all about you, you should find a balance where you do get that quality time together, but where she doesn't feel like she can hang out with you all the time.


It's all part of playing hard to get. If you'll show up and hang out with her all day any time she calls, then she'll know she can have you whenever she wants you.
This also means that you shouldn't always be available to hang out when she feels like it. You've got to plan in advance because you're really busy all the time, remember?

, If you want the girl to miss you, then she's got to respect you as an individual. She has to know that you have your own life, your own stuff going on, your own friends, and your own hobbies, from basketball to playing the guitar. If she thinks that you have nothing going on, then she'll think that she can hang out with you whenever and wherever because you'll never be doing anything so important that you can't drop everything and hang out with her.


Staying busy and active will make you a more appealing partner to any self-sufficient girl. Of course, don't be so busy that you have no time for the girl or that it leads you to be stressed out and unhappy with how things are going in your life. Apologize afterward if necessary.

, Don't tell the girl absolutely everything that you're thinking or doing every single day of your life, or she'll feel like the mystery in your relationship is gone. While you don't want to lie to her or sneak off for days at a time, leading her to expect the worst, you shouldn't tell her absolutely everything about yourself and your plans right away. You want her to feel like she's slowly peeling an onion when she hangs out with you, learning a little bit more about you at a time. Being an open book is just not as sexy as making her work for it.


The more time you spend together, the more you can reveal about yourself. But this takes time. If she feels like she knows everything about you after the first date, then why would she go for a second?

, You have your own life, remember? Therefore, you can't pick up the phone every single time she calls, or respond to her text messages after ten seconds. Sure, sometimes you can pick up the phone, and you can text her right away if she's asking you a pressing question, but in general, give it a little time before responding to her or returning her calls. This can mean an hour or two, half a day, or even a day if you're really busy. Just don't make a habit of ignoring her calls completely or she will get annoyed, bored, and may suspect that you're seeing someone else.


If she thinks that you'll answer the phone every time she calls, then she'll believe that she has you wrapped around her little finger.

, You may think that disappearing for a few days, talking about other girls, or not letting the girl know how you really feel will make her miss you even more because she'll get jealous, thinking you're with someone else, which will only make her want to see you. And you'd be right -- up to a point. Sure, you don't want to put it all out on the line, but you don't want to create so much distance or even be seen with other girls just to get the girl you want to think of you; these plans will quickly backfire, and your girl will be hurt or will just lose interest all together.


She'll quickly be on to your tricks and will definitely miss you even less.

, If you want the girl to miss you, then you have to be the last thing she thinks about before she closes her eyes and drifts off. Subconsciously, this will make her think of you more and miss you even more. So, make a habit of giving her goodnight calls or texting her before you know she's about to go to bed. If she's not into this so much, then don't force it upon her or you'll look too desperate. But if your voice is the last thing she hears before she goes to bed, she is guaranteed to miss you even more.

, After you had a fantastic date, you can call her to check in for a minute, but don't go on and on about how much you like her. Tell her you had a great time, and take a break the next day. Lead her to wonder if you're thinking of her as much as she's thinking of you. Once you do that, you've got her in the palm of her hand. If something happens the next day that really makes you think of her, then you can let her know, of course, but don't make too much of a habit of it.


If she tells you she's been thinking of you, you don't have to be too coy. Tell her you've been thinking about her too. Just don't initiate this type of conversation too much.

, If you want the girl to miss you, then you have to leave something with her that reminds her of you. It can be a cute bear you got her at the carnival, a sweatshirt of yours that smells of you, or a framed photo of the two of you at a concert on your first date. If she has something nearby and always in her sight that reminds her of you, then she is guaranteed to miss you even more. Giving her a gift or an item of yours is the perfect way to make sure you stay in her thoughts.


Give her a nice ring or bracelet so she's always looking at it if she wears it.
Give her a poster or something she can hang up in her room so it's always in her line of sight.

, When you talk to the girl when you're not together, you've got to keep her interested so she wants to see you again. Even if you can only talk to her for twenty minutes a day, you've got to make that time count. So, make her laugh, tell her funny stories about something crazy that happened to you that day, ask her about what she's been up to, and make her feel like you think she's special. She should feel like you're worth talking to and talking to you and hearing what you have to say should make her want to see you even more.


Okay, so not everyone's a phone person. You don't have to have a million deep phone conversations if it doesn't feel right to you. Just do your best when you do talk.
If you're nervous about what to say to her, put some thought into it before you talk on the phone. Think of three things that you can talk about, and that should get you going.

, If you want her to miss you because you live far apart, then one cute and unexpected thing you can do is to write her a letter. No one writes letters anymore, and she'll appreciate the gesture and will find it incredibly romantic that you made the effort and wrote her a letter. She will treasure the letter and will be unfolding it and reading it over and over again, thinking of you all the while. The letter doesn't have too be too long or anything -- just tell her about how your days are going and let her know that you're thinking of her.


You don't have to be Shakespeare to write your girl a nice letter. She'll be impressed by the effort, not by your literary skills!

, Though playing hard to get when you're apart is guaranteed to make the girl miss you more, when you're together, you should give it your all. Make her feel special, tell her how pretty she is, and have an amazing time on your dates so your girl can remember you fondly when you're apart. Talk to her about her interests, compliment her, and take the time to really listen to her.


Don't be afraid to tell her that you've missed her. That's not a sign of weakness, but a sign of how much you care for her!

Be confident in your ability to flirt.,

Smile.,
Touch him lightly.,
Be genuine.,
Avoid loaded or leading questions.,
Know when to back off.",How to Subtly Flirt With a Guy1," If you’re not confident, fake it until you make it. Smile, try not to fidget and look your target directly in the eye when talking to him. These few steps are often all you need to do to subtly catch a guy’s interest.;
, Humor is one of the best ice-breakers on the planet. Throwing in a joke here and there shows that you are spontaneous, fun, and laid-back, all of which tells a guy you may be interested., Body language is the oft-forgotten secret weapon of flirting. Not only does it work, but it works subtly, letting a guy know subconsciously that you are interested. To flirt with your body:


Face your shoulders and hips towards him.
Play with your hair.
Make eye-contact.
Nod and smile as he talks.Avoid crossing your arms, looking away/down, or staring into space as he talks.

, Smiling is the number one way to flirt with someone.Show off your pearly whites every chance you get, and you’ll notice that he’ll be smiling too.

, Breaking the touch barrier between two people is a great way to separate flirtation from friendly conversation. Touch his shoulder or knee lightly, or put your hand briefly on his back as you get up to go the bathroom.


Feeling adventurous? Offer to play a quick game like patty-cake, slaps, or invent a secret handshake together.

, The quickest way to lose your future date is to fake your interest. Ask him questions about himself, laugh only when you think something is funny, and remember to feel natural. If you’re having a good time, chances are your flirting is successful. But if you cannot be genuinely nice to a guy, he probably is not the right fit for you.

, Never ask a guy about marriage, his last relationship, or if he wants kids. These are big, difficult questions that usually come up later in a relationship. Remember that flirting is supposed to be light and fun, not serious.


Religion, politics, and how much money he makes should all be avoided.

, Flirting can quickly go from fun to creepy if you don’t know when to leave. If he wants to go see his friends, keeps looking away and checking his watch, or starts giving one-word answers, it is time to back off and give him some space.

Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer.


Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you’re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.;
, Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you’re trying to ""game"" her.


Girls like compliments as long as it doesn’t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you.Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes.
Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you’re not.
Don’t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. “You’re pretty for a brunette” is not a compliment.Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.

, It not only lets her know that you’re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn’t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she’ll be more likely to open up to you., If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal.Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet., Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do., Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better.Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you’re thinking about her. You don’t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn’t really exist. Just be “normal."", Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her.


Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn’t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it., If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don’t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group"

First, do not try to force a connection with the guy you want immediately. However, also do not avoid him. Hang around with him consistently and when something comes up that bonds you two, you should work with that connection.


For example, if you are both in a class together, study for a test together. Studying for a test together will help you bond over the stress and work it takes to get through the test.
Hang out with him a variety of settings. If you only see him at school, for example, offer to meet at a library to study. Sometimes when you are in a new environment, it is easier to make that connection.
When you do start connecting, be aware of leaving at a good time. Leave him wanting more, but do not cut the conversation short, either. Be aware of when might be a good time to leave and follow your intuition.;
, It may seem obvious to you that you want to talk to him, but it may not be obvious to him. There are three easy non-verbals you can use to demonstrate that you are interested. The eyebrow flash is a non-verbal signal that says that you are friendly and approachable. Tilting your head to one side is another way to show interest while he is talking.
Finally, smile! When you smile at someone they will usually smile back at you. Smiling will make him feel good, because it releases endorphins! , Think about what you are good at and find ways to show that off in authentic contexts. For example, if you are going to be studying together, and you are good at math, offer to help him study for the math portion of the test.


If you know he is having trouble with a certain part of the class, study for that portion of the curriculum harder. You can take good notes, stay after school, or go to office hours. Then offer to help him.
Do not try to become good at things he is good at. You probably will not be able to get good enough to impress him in a short amount of time.
Do not brag. Do not overtly tell him what you are good at out of context in order to impress him. Guys are going to be much more impressed when they get to witness how good you are at something that he is less familiar with.

, The text or call can be simple, and don’t worry; if he is interested it will go somewhere!


Make sure to pay attention to how he responds. If he doesn’t respond much- don’t keep texting. Let him text you.
If the texting goes on for a sustained about of time, consider asking him to get together and do something.

, When you are in places that you love the best you will most likely come out. Go out to get dinner and catch up or go to a coffee shop and go on a walk. You can also go somewhere more like a date where you can be carefree, laugh, and have fun, for example, try going to a local fair or a theme park.


He will be able to experience more about who you are through seeing the places you love. Explain to him why the place is important and give him a tour of what is awesome about the place that you love.
Tell him stories about things that happened in that place. Ask him if there are places that he loves to go.

, Be interested in what he says in person, in text or over the phone. If you are in person, use your body language to show your interest. Nod your head, and be expressive with your facial expressions so that he can see what you are thinking about what he is saying and genuinely laugh. Be empathetic to what he is talking about, if he is expressing anything that is difficult show him concern or sympathy.
Remember what he says so that you can be more specific when you ask him how things are going. Showing him you remember what is going on in his life isn’t creepy, everyone wants to be listened to and acknowledged.

, Smile often and make eye contact. As the night goes on, let your eye contact linger longer, and stay closer by his side, longer. Touch him on the arm when you are talking to him about something that he says that you find exciting or interesting.


Touching his arm in conversation will allow you to break the initial barrier of physical touch.

, If you are interested in getting a guy to want you at somewhere like a bar or club, make sure you look and feel great. Take your time getting ready and putting together your hair, make up and dress.


Give yourself around an hour to shower and get ready.
Take time to style your hair. Blow dry your hair, curl it or straighten it so that it has a particular style. Use a product like mousse, hair spray or hair gloss to preserve and perfect your hair look.

, Because you are going out, you can add a little more flair to your make up, for example, you can add some light glitter eyeshadow or a darker lipstick than normal.


Apply a thin coat of eyeliner, and use dark brown-black mascara on your top eyelashes.
Use a concealer, a shade lighter than your foundation, to cover the bags under your eyes, blemishes and any imperfections on your face.
Apply a light coat of foundation; use the applicator or your fingertips to well blend the foundation into your skin.
Choose a shade of lipstick that is not too bright; apply sparingly and blot with a kleenex. Keep gloss or chap stick on you to keep your lips moisturized.
Choose a couple of items, like your lipstick, concealer and eye liner to keep with you in your purse to freshen up your makeup, if need be later in the day.
If you have a friend that is good at doing makeup or hair, have him/her come over and have him/her help you. You two can get ready together before you go out.
Be careful not to apply too much makeup. You still want your natural beauty to show through. Make sure your foundation matches your skin complexion well and is well blended.

, Dresses for going out are usually tighter or shorter than you might normally wear. Have fun with it and find something that makes you feel attractive. Your own confidence will go a long way in showing your beauty.


You can find a going out dress at a department store like Macy's or at a local boutique. Additionally, you can go online to buy a dress. Simply search for “dresses for going out” and you will find a lot of great, affordable dresses that will attract guys.
If you go to a store, talk to a customer service representative about the kind of dress you are looking for. He/she will be able to direct you to the dresses that might be the best for what you are looking to wear.
Shop for the dress at a few different stores. Go to a mall where you have a few different shops to explore. Don't buy something that you don't feel good in. If you don't have a good feeling about a dress, don't buy anything. Keep looking until you find something that you love.

, Use your taste in music to direct your choice of venues. You will enjoy yourself more if you like the music, and you may be able to meet more guys who you would be interested in. Find one or two bars, clubs or events where you can find lots of younger people.


Go online and search for music venues, dancing or shows near you.
Get your friends together to go with you. Buy your tickets together and meet up before you go out so you can go together.
Consider planning to go to more than one place, just in case one turns out to be a bust.
Plan to stay out late. You may have to stay out late to meet guys. After a certain time of night, depending on the location, it becomes easier to meet guys. Guys will also feel more comfortable coming up to you when it is a little bit later.

, Walk through the place and find a good spot where you can keep a good eye on the crowd, and where you feel comfortable talking and dancing with your friends.


Keep moving around until you find a good spot. You can change rooms and events as the night progresses.
If your are unable to find a good place with people you are interested in, keep looking.

, If you are at a club, make eye contact a couple of times to let him know you are interested in him. Take notice of whether he seems interested in you as well. You will know he is interested in you if he will move closer to you or he will meet your eye contact.

, Guys want girls who come off confident. You can talk to him or you can talk to his friends in order to get the conversation started. For example, you can ask him about how his night is going. This is a simple and direct conversation starter that shows you are confident.


In this method, you don't have to act as though you are uninterested. Playing hard to get will most likely not work if you are in a setting where you are getting to know people.
If the conversation doesn’t go anywhere, that is okay. Move on and talk to other guys. As the night progresses, there will be plenty of other chances to meet guys.

, Write down the things that make you awesome, and let him know them. Knowing why you are awesome and not being afraid to show it attracts others. Do not be afraid to make mistakes around him. Be authentic to the real you, quirks and all. Relax and laugh when you make mistakes, everyone does.
Do not act like someone you think that he would like instead of being yourself. Imagine if someone were acting in a certain way to please you, you would probably not find it attractive.

, Let him see different versions of you. Hang out with other people who bring out the best version of you with him. Enjoy laughing and hanging out with other people in his company. Showing him that you are fun, independent and have your own friends is important to establish.


This will show him that friends are important to you and will help him see what you are in like with other people.
It could make him a little jealous (in a good way) and maybe he’ll want to hang out with you more than before.

, Most people love to be loved, and the best way to get them to want you is to learn about them first. Listen to what he says or what other people say about him to learn about his quirks and habits. It can be simple stuff, like finding out that he loves to go to all you can eat buffets or that he never misses the cartoons on Saturday morning.


Tease him about those little things about him. If he is going home on a Friday night, for example, you can say something silly like, you must need your beauty rest for those Saturday morning cartoons.
Consider what his sense of humor is like. Once you get a feel for what he finds funny, incorporate his sense of humor into your conversations. If he thinks it is funny when people are a little mean, playfully make fun of something about him.

, For example, if you forget to give him a hard time about the Saturday morning cartoons, send him a text later in the night when you remember.

, Find out about the experiences and people that made him who he is. People want to be known and getting to know a person's story can be a form of intimacy. He will want you because you he will have developed a kind of dependency on the love that you give him.


This is going to take some time and you shouldn't try to get his whole story in one sitting. Often it is more fun getting pieces of the story along the way.
One way you can ask someone about their story is by asking them why they are interested in the important parts of who they are. For example, if someone is a huge fan of baseball, ask them why they love baseball.
Not everyone feels comfortable talking about personal things. If he isn’t comfortable with it, that is okay. You want him to be comfortable, above all. Typically, personal conversations will happen naturally with time.

, If you can start connecting the dots of his life, you will be able to understand him on a deeper level. Combine your knowledge of his history with his current interests. For example, you can say, I can see why you are interested in becoming a teacher, because you said you had to take care of your brothers a lot when you were kids.


Show him you enjoy his conversation. You aren’t just trying to figure him out, you want him to know you like what you see. It is simple, people like people who like them. If you can make him feel good about himself, he will want to be around you more. Nod your head when he talks, maintain eye contact and smile and laugh often.

, Disagreeing is a way of showing him a part personality, and you will be able to see another part of his personality, as well. People respect people who stick up for their views. Explain why you disagree or ask him to explain more about why he thinks the way he thinks about a topic. Sometimes people become more attracted to people who disagree with them. Even in the getting to know you stage, you should not be afraid to be honest. He will like it.


Be respectful when you disagree. Make sure you keep your tone of voice conversational and not confrontational. Don’t raise your voice.
If things are getting heated, consider using humor when you are disagreeing. Come back to the conversation later.
Once you have worked through your differences in your disagreement, you will both like each other more.

, Continue to pursue the hobbies you have that he has no interest in, and don’t change to be more like him. You are a dynamic individual whose interests and personality will mostly likely not match his in all ways, and that is good.


If you can own the ways that you are different, for example, if he loves Family Guy and you think watching television is lame, don’t pretend that you have suddenly decided that television is really cool. Remember, having your own opinions is attractive.

, Conversation is the best way to begin a connection with someone. It also shows your interest and lets you get to know each other, which allows you ample opportunities to flirt. Some conversation tips include:

Ask questions. Show your interest by asking about his life, not talking about yours.
Make jokes. The occasional burst of humor can be a great way to show a guy you're interested on the sly.

, He should be able to talk to you without feeling like he's invading. Separate yourself from large groups of friends occasionally, smile often, and give him the chance to come find you without feeling overwhelmed.

, Most guys love it when they are approached by a woman. Have confidence in how amazing you are, then take a deep breath and walk right up to him to start a conversation.


Buy him a drink.
Ask him a question about himself, the surroundings, his shirt, etc.
Casually mention him by saying “I saw you across the bar earlier, what’s your name?”

, Giving someone a little grief is actually a great way to get a guy’s attention. Make sure your jokes are not about anything serious, but it’s okay to give him a hard time if he spills a drink or says something silly. Teasing is often at the root of flirting, cause it shows that you are willing to have fun and be a bit silly.


Make sure you’re willing to be teased back – it means he is trying to flirt with you."

Touch her hand or arm when you laugh.,
Tuck her hair behind her ear.,
Put your hand close to hers.,
Play footsie.",How to Physically Flirt with a Girl2," Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs.


Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn’t look like she’s enjoying it, stop., Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you’re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say “ you jokester.” This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers., This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.

, When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.

, If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl’s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you’re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you."

Hug her.,
Play with her hair.,
Put your hands around her waist from behind.,
Push her playfully.,
Put your head in her lap.,
Tickle her.,
Be respectful.",How to Physically Flirt with a Girl3," It’s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It’s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her.


If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs.However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.

, Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.)From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you’re giving her a neck massage.

, If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower.Once she’s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she’ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You’ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).

Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.), If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you’ve flirted with this girl many times before.

, Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don’t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while., Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, ""stop"" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.

Study his smoothness.,
Spot over-the-top flattery.,
Pay attention to what he never says.,
Pay attention to how he talks about past girlfriends.",How to Know if the Boy You Love Is a Player1," Boys who are players aren’t going to be nervous, stammering types around a girl. They will seem almost too practiced, and they will flirt with you with ease: Because it’s a game to them, and they’ve done this before.For example, they will always have a perfect opening line or conversation starter, probably including a flirty joke that sounds like something they’ve used before. You will think he’s “prince charming” and like you can do no wrong in his eyes.
They are brimming with confidence around you, and they act a bit glib. That means that they talk with ease and say everything that a girl would want to hear. However, they speak in generalities rather than including details that are meaningful to you.
And they do this before they have a chance to really get to know you. They say these things very early on in their efforts to make you a quick conquest (the key word is ""quick""). It sounds a little artificial, but some girls overlook that because it also feels good to be the object of the boy’s attention. These boys go over the top to impress.;
, A guy who is a player will seem more interested in you than anyone has before. At first. However, he will then cheat or just leave you once he gets what he wants, which is physical intimacy and/or your affirmation.


To increase his chances of scoring, he will try to get you to fall for him by making you feel extremely important. He is a master at this. It’s hard not to fall for when a guy you’re interested in showers you with flattery. A player may also read poetry to you. He will become a chameleon, figuring out what interests you and pretending it interests him too so you are amazed how much you have in common.
It’s nice if a boy says positive things to you. To spot a player, you need to pay attention to how soon he does it, how much he does it, and to what degree. A player will be almost over-the-top in his flattery toward you at first.
There is a word for this. It’s called “love bombing.” He bombs you with terms of endearment, praise, listens attentively to everything you say, pampers you, and basically acts like you’re on a pedestal. And he does it right away. His flattery will focus primarily on your looks, such as your pretty eyes or great body., There are certain words that a player is likely to never say to you. Although the player is very talkative, he’s not going to sacrifice being in control.


A player is unlikely to say “I love you.” There are a few players who will say this just to get what they want and not mean it, but generally speaking, a player won’t utter those words because he doesn’t want you to think this is long term.A player won’t say that it’s up to you to decide what to do when it comes to going out. That’s because he’s not really interested in your life, hobbies, desires or activities. A player stays in control of the timing and venue. He might even require that you only meet inside his or your home so others don’t see you.
If he tries to have sex with you and doesn’t have a condom, it’s less likely he’s a player. A player will always come prepared because he does this a lot. You may discover you don’t know much about him or what you thought you knew was wrong., If a guy is a player, he’s probably hurt a lot of women or girls before. In order to throw you off the scent, he will project his behavior on them. He will act like he was victimized by them.


That means that he will trash talk his exes, by calling them “psycho” or “crazy” and basically trying to make you think that he was the victim and the breakup was all their fault.
If he does this repeatedly or about more than one person, you should start questioning whether the person engaging in bad behavior was actually him.
Are there girls who suddenly show up in the scene and act with hostility toward you? Maybe it’s because he recently led them on. Pay attention to how girls treat you, and pay attention to how many girls are in his orbit. Players always seem to have a lot of girls around them, especially desperate-seeming girls who seem angry at them.

"
"
Notice if he flirts with other girls.,
Spot whether he moves too fast.,
Study his actions.,
Watch his body language.,
Figure out whether he answers the phone right away.",How to Know if the Boy You Love Is a Player2," A guy who is a player isn’t going to be satisfied with just the attention of one girl, you. Instead, he will seek affirmation from many girls and in many corners, and he will sometimes do this when he is with you.


He likes being in the spotlight, and he derives pleasure from female attention. He wants to “capture” as many girls as he can, as if making another notch on his belt.
He will do this by flirting with many girls because he likes to have many girls chasing him or interested in him. He will entice girls to crush on him by indicating interest in them through things like steady eye contact.
He will flirt with playfulness by smiling, telling jokes, and initiating friendly conversation. He will do these things to you. And then he will do them to others, sometimes when you’re not there or looking and sometimes even if you are; then he will deny he was flirting with other people.

, A guy who is a player is interested in physical contact with you right away. Since that’s often his central goal, he sees no reason to take it slow. He is eager to cut to the chase and get what he’s really after.


He will see no reason to develop any emotional intimacy because all he is really interested in is physical intimacy. Thus, he will go for it faster than a guy who is truly interested in developing a longer term relationship with you.
He will touch you on the first date, perhaps by kissing you (or even trying to move farther if you will let him). He sees no reason to patiently wait.
By the second date, his patience will be exhausted, and he will likely try to initiate some type of physical intimacy with you. If he senses that you want to go slower and don’t give him what he wants, he will probably move on to someone else he has a better chance with because his central goal is physical intimacy.

, A lot of girls make the mistake of focusing on a boy’s words instead of paying attention to his actions. A player will do things like act like it’s a chore to find time for you. It’s a cliché but true: Actions speak louder than words.


His flowery language may be designed to flatter you by luring you into liking him. To determine whether the boy you love is a player, focus on what he does, not what he says. Actions reveal more and they are harder to fake.
Does he text you at the last minute instead of trying to develop a strong in-person relationship? This can be a sign of a player. Someone who isn’t a player will do things like call you or ask you to study in the library. A player will rely on texting and try to make hasty last-minute plans. If he always controls the timing of when he sees you, that’s bad too (especially if he vanishes for long periods of time).
Does he ask you to go on actual dates? Does he want you to meet his parents or his friends? These are all signs that he is not a player. A player will try to stage a hook up behind the scenes without introducing you to others. If he's mysterious and hides aspects of his work schedule or life, be very suspicious.The player will text you right as bars are closing or, if he’s underage, he will text you at the last minute and try to see you. That’s because he doesn’t really want it to be a date. Or he might not want anyone to see you with him because he has other girls he’s doing the same with right now.

, A player thinks he’s charming, and he plays it to the hilt. He’s a flirtatious, overly confident, braggart. He thinks he’s all that, so he doesn’t try to pretend to be humble.Watch how he walks. A player will swagger when he walks. He will almost strut, walking with utter confidence. He will smirk sometimes, as if he has a hidden secret.
A player will touch other people a lot, putting his hand on their lower backs and putting his hand on their shoulders, often while uttering a compliment. That is, except you. A player will show more physical affection with you in private, but may avoid public displays of affection.
A player will be an extrovert, who is very outgoing, talks a lot, and enjoys being the center of attention. He will use a lot of direct eye contact, and will move into yours and other people’s personal space. In fact, intense eye contact is one of the strongest signs of a player.

, A player won’t be able to answer the phone right away all the time. The reason: There are people he doesn’t want to know about you, and he might be with one of them at that time.


Perhaps he’s with another girl. Perhaps he’s with guy friends. Perhaps he’s with family members. The key is that he doesn’t want them to know you’re calling.
Thus, he screens his calls. He will call you back, but he doesn’t answer the phone right away. Similarly, if he doesn’t answer his phone when you’re with him, it might very well be another girl calling him that he doesn’t want you to know about.
The same goes for texting. If he takes forever to respond to a text, there could be a reason for it: He’s busy with someone else. He will closely guard his phone, password protecting it and showing that he is trying to keep you from using it. He certainly would never let you see his texts.

"
Analyze whether you’re impulsive around him.,
Make him wait.,
Pay attention to whether he keeps you secret.,
Pay attention to his relationships.,
See whether he cares a lot about his appearance.,
Check out his social media.",How to Know if the Boy You Love Is a Player3," Boys who are players will try to trigger impulsiveness in you because this works out to their advantage; they want you to violate your boundaries on physical intimacy fast.


He stokes your impulsiveness by making you think there’s an instant emotional connection, perhaps even saying that you might be soulmates or sending you songs that are romantic or imply the same.
He’s trying to get you to cross your boundaries so that he can get what he is after, which is physical intimacy.
He will lose interest fast in a girl who reasserts her boundaries, who seems very cautious, and who requires patience because he’s not really interested in a relationship.

, The best way to sort out for sure whether a guy is a player or not is to make him wait a significant time for any physical intimacy with you.


If he’s not a player, but is just really into you, he will be OK with this. In fact, he will value and respect you more because you are not “easy.”
If he’s a player, he will be annoyed by this. He will try to cajole you into breaking your boundaries anyway, and, when this doesn’t work, he will dump you. Be aware there are some players who can wait a long time to get what they want and will dump you the second they do.
When he does dump you, he won’t look back and will move onto the next conquest. He will turn from excessively flattering and warm to cold and distant overnight. He might disappear and stop returning texts and calls. It’s true that a lot of boys are interested in physical intimacy even though they are not players. However, the difference is: Is he open to developing emotional intimacy too?

, A player will have a reason to either keep you secret or just to downplay your relationship to others so that he can keep playing the field with other girls.


The reason is sadly that he wants to keep his options open to mess around with lots of girls, and if he tells people he has a girlfriend, other girls might stay away.
It’s important to see whether he tells other people about you, and whether he downplays the state of the relationship to them if he does.
In other words, does he say things to you that indicate you’re exclusive or he’s into you romantically, but around other people he acts like he barely knows you or you’re just a friend? If he’s downplaying you, he’s probably a player.

, Other people around him, who have known him longer, will have had time to see his patterns. Check out his other relationships, and maybe talk to some of those people.


For example, does he have a lot of friends, boys and girls, who think very highly of him? If they don’t, they’ve probably observed his bad behavior one time too many. If his male friends are also known players, that’s obviously a bad sign too.
Is he mostly friends with girls? That’s a bad sign. It means that guys have figured out he’s not a very good person, and he doesn’t like the male competition. A player will barely mention his family to you, either, because he’s not really trying to bring you into all aspects of his life.
Is he still connected to his ex in a way that goes beyond being nice (talking, texting, making plans with her?) He’s probably not available emotionally to you if he is. Do girls like him or do they seem desperate around him, like they think they have a connection with him (or did) and are now angry at him or vying to get his intention? If it’s the latter, he probably did to them what he’s about to do to you.

, It’s good if a boy cares if he looks nice. That’s not the point. But if he’s over the top about it, there’s a greater chance he’s a player.


For example, a player will spend a lot of time working out and will brag about and show off his muscles. He puts a high premium on physical appearance.This will extend to how he dresses. He will likely be seen in nice clothes, including flashing expensive labels to show off.
His car will also be flashy. There’s nothing subtle about this guy. He uses his body, his clothes, and his car to draw girls.

, The way a guy presents himself on social media can give you a sense of whether he is a player or not. If he is a player, he will use social media to try to attract girls.


Check his relationship status. There are some boys who are in a relationship but will pretend they are not on social media. Do you think you’re his girlfriend, but he pretends on Facebook that he’s got no attachments? Do you think he’s single, only to discover that on Facebook he’s indicated he’s in a relationship with someone else? Players will have lots of people on their friend list, including many attractive girls. They use social media to show people how attractive they are. Their comments on Instagram and Facebook will be flirty in nature; girls will be flirting with them, and they will flirt back. If he's only interested in an online relationship with you, he's probably hiding something.
Their photos and videos on social media sites will be designed to showcase their physical attractiveness. They will post pictures without their shirt for example. Other girls post comments that are overtly flirting to him, and he seems not to mind or dissuade them from doing it.

Don’t play too many games.",How to Make a Guy Jealous Through Texting," One of the best ways to make a guy jealous over text requires you to do nothing at all. If he starts texting you, let at least a few hours go by before you give him an answer. If he texts you on a Friday or Saturday evening and you have no intentions of trying to meet up with him, then you can even get back to him the following day, leading him to wonder about how you spent your evening.


Though you may be tempted to answer with something snippy or clever right away, you should wait at least an hour or two before you respond. This will keep him guessing. He may begin to wonder if you’re not getting back to him because you’re too busy with other guys.
If he feels like he can talk to you any time he wants, then he won’t think your time is so valuable.;
, When you do text him, don’t tell him about everything you have going on all weekend. Even if you’re only going to your grandfather’s birthday party, you can lead him to think you’re going on a hot date with the man of your dreams. Instead of revealing every little detail of your plans, just tell him that you’re busy, that you have something going on, or that you won’t be able to talk. Here are some subtle ways to make him jealous:


“I have something to do later…”
“I have a lot going on this weekend.”
“I had such a long night last night! It was crazy.”

, You don’t have to tell the guy flat-out that you have some hot plans for the evening, but you can certainly make him think you do! With just a few careful words, you can lead his mind to wonder...and wonder. Here are some things you can say to make him think you’re going on a date:


“I’ll talk to you later. I need to get a new dress for tomorrow night.”
“I had the most amazing pasta dish last night.”
“I can’t believe how late I got home last night.”
“I have to get going now…I’m meeting up with someone later.”

, You should flirt with the guy a little bit to keep him interested and to show him that you’re ready to play ball. Give him just enough to see that you do like him a little bit without thinking he has you in the palm of his hands. Just a few casual compliments or comments at the right time can do the trick. Try saying something like this:


“I have to say, you didn’t look half bad playing basketball yesterday.”
“You always know what to say to make me feel better, don’t you?”
“You can make me laugh over text, but I wonder if you can do it in person…”

, You don’t need to be so obvious about the fact that you’re hanging out with other guys—whether they are real or make-believe. Just a subtle hint or comment about another guy is all you need to make to get the guy you’re talking to worried about what you’ve got going on. If you’re too heavy-handed about it, though, then the guy will see that you’re just bluffing. Here are some subtle ways to mention other guys:


“This new guy I met is actually going to the concert with me.”
“Nick gave me a ride to school yesterday…”
“Bill let me borrow his record player for my party.”

, Another way to make a guy jealous when you’re texting him is just to make it seem like you have a million things going on, whether you’re hanging out with guys or not. You could be really into your classes, your new summer job, your soccer team, one of your hobbies, or your friends and family, which will leave you not to have too much time to text the guy anyway. Let him see that you’ve got many other priorities, and he’ll be jealous that you have so many ways to spend your time that have nothing to do with him.


Don’t just talk about how busy you are. Casually mention some of the things you do in your spare time, and he’ll be wishing he could spend more time with you.
Your texts also don’t have to sound like you spent hours writing and proofreading them. Sending a text that isn’t totally crystal clear or has a typo or two in it shows that you’re too busy to try to really impress him.

, If he tries to make you jealous or to talk about other girls, just play it cool and don’t let him get a reaction out of you. He’ll see that you have the upper hand and that nothing he can say or do can make you jealous. This will make him a bit frustrated, but it will also make him feel more attached to you because he’ll be more determined than ever to win you over.


If he doesn’t respond to your messages for a few hours, don’t text him asking what’s up. Wait for him to come to you.

, Another way to make the guy jealous is to make it seem like you suddenly had to go just when things were getting interesting. If you leave a text conversation after things got pretty boring, then he’ll think you just lost interest; but if you’re having a great talk and then you suddenly say that you have to get going, then he’s more likely to get jealous because he’ll think that you ran into another guy or are getting picked up for a date.


Also, leaving in the middle of a great conversation will make the guy realize how fun and easy it is to talk to you.

, While you may want to make the guy jealous, you don’t want to end up hurting his feelings so much that he stops talking to you. You should still be respectful and shouldn’t make fun of how he looks, how much money he makes, or how physically inadequate he is in some way. This will make a guy lose interest fast, and it will also make it more likely that he’d tell other guys to steer clear of you. Here are some things you should avoid texting:


“Ugh, you’re so gross.”
“I’m so sick of jerks like you.”

, Though you can make a guy jealous by mentioning that you’re hanging out with other guys or even hinting at the fact that you’re going on a hot date, you don’t want to start talking about how much better all of the guys around you are than the guy you’re texting. After all, you do want him to like you, and if you take it too far, he’ll just think you’re mean. Here are some things you should avoid saying:


“All of the guys here are so much hotter than you.”
“I just went on a date with a guy who makes twice as much money as you do.”
“Why can’t you dress more like Joe? He looked so cute in his new jeans today.”

, Though you can’t put all of your feelings out there if you want to play hard to get, you don’t want to be so coy that the guy has no idea that you actually like him or care for him. You have to give him something to hang on to or he’ll start texting girls that he actually thinks he has a chance with. You can be subtle and still let him know that you care about him. Here are some simple things you can say to keep him interested:


“I missed you at the Radiohead concert last night. It would have been so much more fun with you there.”
“You always know how to crack me up.”
“It’s great to hear from you. I’ve had such a long day.”

, Though you may think that putting down any of the girls he’s with will only make you look better or will make him doubt his other romantic choices, in reality, this will only make you look insecure and not worth the guy’s time. If he’s telling you he’s hanging out with other girls, you can just act like you don’t really care or say something nice about them to show that you’re confident enough not to care if he’s with other ladies.


You should really be the bigger person and say something nice about a girl he’s with instead of putting her down. If he mentions a girl he’s hanging out with, you can say something simple like, “Oh, I love Jackie. That girl always cracks me up.”

, Though you may think that not texting him back for two days is the best way to win the guy over, in reality, if you take it too far, he’ll actually just get angry and will lose interest or may even start to actively dislike you. If he really wants your help or has an important question for you and you’re ignoring him just because you want to prove a point, then that will give him the wrong impression.


Sure, being coy and seeming like you’re too busy to respond to him ASAP is one thing, but if you take it so far that he feels like you’re just being mean, then you may lose him.
Try to get a sense of the tone of his message. Is he just being playful, a little impatient, or really needing to hear from you?

, Of course, it can be fun to play games and to get a guy to be interested in you by making him jealous while you’re texting. Playing games in person, too, can be a great way to capture his attention. However, if you really want to start building a relationship with this guy, then eventually you have to let him see that you really do care for him and that none of the other guys matter. This is the only way to really move forward with him.


Though playing hard to get and keeping a guy on his toes can help move a relationship forward and will keep things interesting, you don’t want to spend too much time trying to make a guy jealous over text if you want to begin a genuine relationship with him.

Check to see whether he is constantly looking at you, or (cough, cough) ""looking"" at the clock to have an excuse to turn around and look at you.,
See whether he stalks you.,
Be sympathetic, if he is shy: He tends to avoid close contact or close attention.,
Be prepared for those boys who are ""not"" shy: If you are blessed to be one of the ""popular"" type (and if so, you are blessed), then you will probably be liked by a flirty, more confident boy.,
Don't accept some teasing and annoying activities even if he is not just mean.,
Notice how he looks at you to test whether he should laugh (or not), ie: if he/you/someone tells a joke, and everyone cracks up -- now watch how if you are laughing harder than he is, then he will laugh more.,
Ask a trusted friend to observe whether he says ""Oh, where is -your name- today?"",
Glance around to see whether or not he looks happily at you when you walk in a room first thing in the morning, as if to say: ""Oh good!,
Talk, flirt, and use groups to go to a movies together or go to play Putt-Putt Golf.

,
If he's shy try to get him to adjust to you.",How to Know if a Boy Likes You in Sixth Grade," The boy looks at you a ton; kids this age tend to do this.


When you talk to him, see whether he usually avoids direct eye contact and smiles/blushes, if shy. If not shy, he will tend to gaze deeply into your eyes.;
, Well, stalk is a bit strong of a word, but he tends to start ""following"" you around. Oh, you're going to throw something away? Hmm... this would be a fine time to clean out your binder, or get a drink? ""Oh! All of the sudden I'm incredibly thirsty!"" Going upstairs because you forgot your binder in the computer lab? He tags along; he forgot his, too, or some other excuse.

, He ""coincidentally"" ends up wherever you end up -- but if you actually approach him, he freezes up, looks at his feet, and starts rambling about some favorite video game. These are raging hormones: blushing (even trembling, voice breaking) and shy. He doesn't act like himself around you and is very, very awkward, and so he:


Avoids eye contact.
Starts talking to you about random, really geeky things (his new game/program).
Acts crazy (but only around you) or tries to get your attention.
Laughs his head off at your jokes.
Starts singing when your are near? (Why? He wants to be cool).
Just all in all acts very awkward? He cannot help this -- the hormones, anyway.

, He will text you, forward you emails, and try to act all ""cool"" (eg: he may come up to you and say, ""Oh, we went motorcycling this weekend, and I almost broke my arm... oh, it hurts!"") He will also try to impress you by telling you about ""brave"" things he did, or by telling you how bad he is at a school subject.


One thing he might say is, ""Oh, I suck at math!"" -- in hope that you will say something like: ""You wanna come over and study then?""
He may also touch you (he might press his arm against yours or across your shoulder to get your attention, brush by you, or even hug you).

, If you have say, a pencil on your desk -- he flicks it off. You go and put it back up. He flicks it off again. You pick it up and put it in your binder, safe. He pushes your binder off, sigh. Despite the fact that, yes, he probably is doing this because he likes you, it doesn't make it any more right, and you have every right to tell him off.


Watch out - some guys might just do this because they are mean, not because they like you.

, But, if you aren't laughing, he will stop. He will also laugh the hardest at your jokes.

, If you are absent, he tends to be the first to notice.

, You're here...""

,, Like start talking to him more often. But if he dosn't want to be bothered don't force.

Respect her.",How to Impress a Girl in High School1," While guys tend to be impressed by physical appearance, girls are attracted emotionally. This means you can impress a girl with a combination of personality and physical attributes., You may impress a girl if you are motivated and have a direction in life. Whether you’re trying to get into a good college, make the varsity sports team, or get elected to student council, be enthusiastic in your pursuits.Don’t become preachy or overwhelm her with your passion.

, Think about what’s impressive about you and write it down. Make sure that you’re the only one who sees it as some people might mistake it as gloating. Use this list to boost your confidence and give you a sense of what makes you stand out from others., Don’t be arrogant but let her know something interesting about yourself each time you have a conversation. You may also mention something just in passing. You want to build intrigue by sharing only a little bit about yourself.For example, say something like ""those are nice runners, I use to wear ones like those when I use to run track."" You not only complimented her shoes but you also let her know that you run track.

, Hygiene is important. Brush your teeth, use deodorant, shower every day, and make sure you look clean. Girls are seldom impressed by a slob or someone they think is gross.


Make sure you’re always clean, not just when you are around her. A rumour could start if someone sees you in a mall and thinks you smell. This could get back to her in school.

, While everyone has their own style, taking pride in your style will impress her. It doesn’t matter if you share the same style but showing that you dress as an individual conveys confidence.

, Don’t ask your friends to lie on your behalf or be fake. The way you treat your friends and interact with them will impress her.It also shows that you are generally a sociable person.

, High school girls tend to follow the most confident girl and form a clique around her. Follow the same cues to impress a girl by asking her to do small things for you, like picking up a book in the library for you. Subtly convey your confidence as time passes.Girls may easily get self-conscious so constantly taking control of a situation shows your confidence and will impress her.

, Don’t be shy. If the conversation is going on to a boring topic or into an area that you have little to contribute to, change topics so that you have a lot to say. Make sure not to be rude or constantly takeover.The “rule of association” states that you can take any word from the conversation and make a new conversation from it. For example, if she talks about how she met a cute guy over the summer, take the word summer and say something like, “That sounds great. What was your best summer vacation? Once I went Hawaii and caught a shark.”
You may also ask questions about her to control the conversation. She will be impressed that you want to know so much about her. Avoid getting her to talk about negative things like doing poorly on a test or a past relationship. You want her to associate you with positive conversations to keep her impressed. Ask something like ""What's your favourite flavour of ice cream?"", You don’t want this to be a one-way dynamic in which you always have to impress her. Make sure you aren’t constantly trying to get her attention. Have your own hobbies and interests., Respect her boundaries and generally respect her as a person. You will impress her by not becoming a creep or insulting her. Follow her lead and observe how she acts with her friends and in class. You will soon learn what she finds appropriate and what she doesn’t."
"
Don't agree.,
Look at the girl straight in the eye when you talk to her.

,
Do not overdo the perverted jokes, one or two make the girl laugh but not too many.

,

Do not be clingy... Just like you guys hate when a girl is always there annoying you... girls don't like when a guy is always there and is always trying to talk to her.,
Be confident in yourself.,
It's important to pay attention to a girl.. but don't give her all your attention.. don't make her the center of your world.. not until your dating anyway.

,
girls like to feel safe and protected.. so make her feel safe!,
Don't kiss her on the forehead.,
Make her feel special!

Ask him what he likes, Just simple questions like: ""What's your favorite brand food?"". Be yourself and act kindly around other people. Even if you dislike certain people, act neutrally towards them without any hints of disdain. If you pull off a neutral act to everyone that isn't your friend, you will gain respect and people will start to look up to you.


Be a social butterfly. Mingle with different groups - don't just stick with one! Invite those that sit alone to sit with your group, as long as your friends are fine with. become an outcast just to accompany another outcast. You want to be kind!;
, This may seem shallow, but boys are actually attracted to pout lips and blushing cheeks. Flattering clothes, cute makeup and a fit body are highly recommended. However, not all of these things are necessary in order to win a guy over. Simply wearing clean, appropriate fitting clothing and a little natural looking makeup should be good enough. Exercise and take showers daily, wash your hair at least three times a week, and clean your face every day.


Wearing comfortable but flattering clothing will boost your confidence and give you a casual, comfortable look. Both you and your crush will be comfortable!
It doesn't matter if you aren't the slimmest girl on the block. Just wear flattering clothes and it does a world of difference.
Makeup, will give you an unflattering appearance. Makeup should add a ""I'm cute and don't need makeup"" look.
High inappropriate clothing that reveals too much is unflattering and will kill your reputation, not to mention your integrity and appearance! It is best to have a modest appearance! (boy's are looking for a modest girl)

, Guys dig confident girls, but be sure you aren't over-confident! Be proud of who you are and it will show, adding a glow to you. If you have no confidence in yourself, it will definitely show and downgrade your whole act.

, This article cannot stress this enough! It's pointless having a relationship if it only centers on you, so take a break and listen to other people's feelings. Let the guy have his chance in the conversation; normally, people enjoy talking about themselves unless if they're shy. Even if the guy you're trying to win over is shy, that doesn't give you permission to hog the spotlight. You just have to be a little more gentle with the questions and flirting!

, This doesn't mean drunk-at-a-party funny, but it means to crack jokes and smile as much as possible. Avoid the plastic, forced smiles and stick with the natural, beautiful smiles. Be sure the jokes you tell aren't corny or dumb. Make sure they actually are down-right funny!

, Too much flirting will probably scare him and make you look desperate, while too little flirting won't press the hint in deeply enough for him to realize and remember it.

Point them to other resources.",How to Help Your Sibling with Homework," It’s important that you know the subject, material, and type of questions before you start helping. Your sibling may not have understood the assignment for themselves, or may be confused about how to follow the homework rules. If you help them understand the assignment, they may not need further help.


Which subject is your sibling working on? Are they writing an essay, or solving multiple-choice questions?
Look over a hard copy of your sibling’s assignment. If they’re confused, read over the assignment with them.;
, Different people struggle with different types of work; see what’s causing your sibling to have a hard time with this particular assignment. Once you understand where your sibling’s confusion lies, you’ll be better able to help them with the homework, explain the concepts to them, and answer any questions that arise.Ask your sibling questions like:


“What don’t you understand about the assignment?”
“What methods did the teacher ask you to use when you work on this homework?”
It may be the case that your sibling misunderstands a small point, and once you explain this to them, they will excel on the rest of their homework.

, Since nearly all students can plan on homework every night, it’s important that you help them find a homework schedule that works for them. This will help your sibling be more productive.Have your sibling schedule their homework for a single block of time, before dinner, and without TV or other distractions.
Don’t wear yourself out with helping your sibling. Try to avoid helping with their homework every day; limit yourself to two or three days a week.

, As odd as it may sound, different people work more productively in different settings. See where you sibling can work most effectively, and help with their homework there.For example, your sibling may prefer to work in the relative quiet of a bedroom or study room.
Alternately, they may prefer to work in the busy and stimulating atmosphere of a kitchen or dining room.
If your sibling is in high school or college, you could take them to a coffee shop or café and help them work there.

, Your sibling will need your help at points where they are confused or stuck, but they do not need to you to micro-manage every point of their homework. Assist them only when they struggle:


Show your sibling the error they have made, and ask if they have ideas about how to fix it.
If your sibling does not understand a core concept of the assignment, explain it to them, but do not complete the homework for them.
Come up with a model or example of a problem similar to the one your sibling is struggling with, then ask them to think through the example you created and solve it.

, This will inevitably happen when you’re working with your sibling: they’ll make a mistake and complete their homework incorrectly. Before you criticize your sibling, or hand them the answer, ask them to try the problem again. This is a good study technique for them to remember; a second attempt will often yield a correct result. While you’re working with your sibling, say things to encourage their work. Try saying:


“You’re doing a great job; this is a tough subject to work on.”
“I’m proud of how much progress you’ve made so far.”

, If your sibling is in elementary school, this may help them understand a concept better and have fun while doing it. Flash cards will make homework portions smaller and easier, and aid in memorization.


Explain the topic to your sibling and ask them to create a drawing about the term described. This is especially useful in fields like math or science.

, If you struggle to explain a topic to your sibling, or think that your sibling would understand a concept better if it were explained via visual aid, don’t hesitate to show them a video online.


Youtube has a wealth of instructional videos. Start here, and branch out into other sites if Youtube does not have what you’re looking for.
This will work for siblings at any level—there are many useful instructional videos for high-school (or even college-) age students.

, Especially if you are proficient with the work your sibling is struggling with, it can be tempting to simply give them the answer without explaining the thought process behind it.However, this won’t help your sibling understand the homework for themselves.


Rather than simply handing out answers, explain the concept underlying your sibling’s homework, and see if they can work out for themselves how the problem should be solved.

, You don’t need to take a long break; just give your sibling some time to clear their head and think about something else for a few minutes. This will help them return to their homework with more focus.


Suppose your sibling has one hour of homework. Break for a maximum of 10 minutes after half an hour.
Eat a healthy snack. You may have fruits, juice, milk, or crackers in your break time. Have a light snack and start with your assignments again.

, Rather than training your sibling to write down the answers that you supply, let them do the mental work and figure out answers on their own. You will put your sibling at a disadvantage if you simply supply their answers, since they will not be able to complete any homework if you’re not there with them.


Ask your sibling to explain the answer of a problem. This will test if they understand the problem for themselves, or are just parroting your answer back to you.

, As tempting as it may be to simply do the work yourself, this defeats the purpose, as it does not allow your sibling to learn anything for themselves. You can guide your sibling towards the answers, but he or she should be doing the mental work.


For example, if there are three similar math problems, you could show your sibling how to solve the first one, and let them solve the second and third problems on their own.

, Especially if your sibling is much younger than you, or struggling with work that may seem easy to you, it’s important that you encourage their work. Discouraging words from you may make your sibling feel stupid or hopeless.Even if they make mistakes, stay positive while working with your sibling.

, For better or worse, you will not always be available to help your sibling with their homework. In situations where they need help but you are not around, they need to be able to find other resources to help with confusing homework. Show your sibling:


A local public library. This will have books and reference materials that can help your sibling learn more about any subject.
Useful websites. Don’t just stop at Wikipedia—there are many academic reference sites that you sibling can refer to. Focus on sites that end in .org or .gov—.com sites are commercially based and may provide biased information.
For younger children, show them where they can find school supplies such as pencil, paper, crayons, and markers in the home.

Do not lie about who you are or why you want to know about her. You may come off creepy or ruin your friendship if she learns you lied.

, Don’t try to read her mind. Open communication is the best way to find out what might impress her. You may come off too needy and overwhelm her.

, Try to read her body language and don’t get distracted by your surroundings. If she has her arms crossed and is looking around, she is probably bored and not interested in what you’re saying. Keep her interested and read her body language to see if she is impressed with you.If she is touching your arm or asking questions, you have her attention and she is impressed.

, Check her social media profiles and find out about what may impress her. You can see what she Likes on Instagram or what she posts on Facebook.

You can also post on her timelines with links to things that may impress her.If you don’t have access to her social media page, make sure you look over your own social media profile before asking for a Friend request. You don’t want her to judge weird photos or posts on your timeline.

, Does she play sports? Is she part of any clubs? Simply ask “what are you up to this weekend” or “How’s your week so far?” You can impress her with your own busy social calendar or take up a shared interest for a chance at impressing her later in the school year."

Act cool.,
Break the touch barrier.",How to Impress a Girl in High School3," Treat her better than her past relationships. Focus on the little things. Open the door for her, walk her to class, and be courteous. While grand gestures are good, consistently treating her well will impress her.Don’t be a “player”. Flirting with a lot of girls is disrespectful to the girl that you want to impress., Girls can sense if you are being fake. It’s a turn off if you’re trying too hard to impress her. Make sure you have your own interests and opinions. Don’t be afraid to disagree. Be your own person.Don’t take up a hobby that you don’t enjoy just to impress her. Take up your own interests. ""It's cool that you enjoy running but it's a bit too boring for me if I'm just running in my neighbourhood. I like to mountain bike because of all the cool things I can see on the trails. You should come out next time.""

, Sweep her off her feet and show her that chivalry isn’t dead. Open the door for her, walk her to class, take her to exciting activities like roller coaster rides. Think of yourself as the leading man in her fairy tale.Don’t overcomplicate things and spend more than you can afford. Being courteous and doing small things like eating with her at lunch can impress as much as a grand gesture.

, Find a quiet place and try not to fidget with your cellphone. You don’t want friends or people walking by and making either of you feel self-conscious. Getting alone time makes it easier to be yourself.Find an activity like hiking or a movie that you can enjoy together. Put her at ease and it will be easy to impress her. ""Hey, I heard you like Adam Sandler. Did you know he has a movie coming out next month? Do you wanna check it out together?""

, She can pick up on nervous energy but you should be able to as well. Don’t make things awkward. If you feel like holding her hand, just do it. The more you hesitate, the more you’ll build up and awkward tension. She will be impressed with confidence and ease., Some people are more comfortable touching than others. She may have already hugged you or touched your arm. In that case, it will be easy to reciprocate. If you haven’t touched her already, you may subtly touch her arm if you laugh at a joke or reach out to feel the fabric of her coat if it’s cold.Touch can follow a compliment. She will be impressed that you noticed and compliment her. ""Your hair looks really good today. It looks really soft, may I touch it?""Place your hand on her lower as you escort her through a door. While this is harmless, subconsciously it’s a cue that you want to get closer to her.

It might be that part of the problem is you, and your sister is responding to your treatment. It also might be that you have been busy with your own friends and life and haven’t paid much attention to her for a while., Whether she’s older or younger, close or far apart in age, every sibling relationship is different and the dynamics are dependent upon your personalities. Think about how you want to interact with your sister and how you want your relationship to work.#*Do you want to be buddies and go to parties together?

Would you rather have her as a mentor figure to help you figure out problems in your own life?
Do you want to help, guide, and protect her?

, Are you still thinking of her as she was five years ago? Do you really know her as she is now? It’s easy to not pay attention to how your sister is growing and changing -- she’s always around and you have a lot going on in your own life. If you don’t really know what your sister is like now, or her interests or friends, it’s time to get to know her. She might feel the same about you.Come up with some fun questions you two could ask each other, from wacky to ordinary: favorite movie of the last few years, favorite weird-sounding ice cream flavor, place she’d most or least like to visit.
Follow her on social media -- you will be able to see how she presents herself and her interests, who her friends are, and how she sees her place in the world.
Take a trip together. It could be a simple as an overnight camping trip to the beach or getting a motel room at the mountain. There’s just something about a trip with someone that can really help you get to know them more and open up.
Do an activity together. It could be anything -- rollerskating, volunteering at a soup kitchen, learning yoga together, whatever you and your sister think sounds fun.
Look through old pictures of yourself together. Remember some of the fun (and not-so-fun) times from childhood.

, We all come to sibling relationships with baggage from the past, but it can weigh on both you and your sister. Forgive past behavior of your sister’s that you haven’t liked. Don’t re-hash arguments or problems you had when you were both much younger., Ask her how she would like your relationship to change. She might have some great ideas in addition to the ones you’ve already considered. Make sure that you have this conversation in private and with plenty of time to talk., Find something that you both enjoy doing and make time to do it with her. Sometimes it’s hard to find common interests, and it might be fun for you to try something new together and see if you both like it (or both hate it).Go to a movie
Watch TV series
Learn how to kayak
Take a cooking class together
Explore a new neighborhood
Try a new restaurant

, A lot of siblings find that short texts and Facebook posts help keep them close, rather than lots of long conversations. Once you and your sister have established a strong relationship, keep it up through shorter, casual contact with long conversations every so often., Even if you and your sister have arguments, she’s still going to be your sister. Figure out the best way to cool off and then come back to her. Apologize and ask her if you can move forward.


“I’m sorry I got so upset about you being late. There was no reason for me to yell. Can you forgive me?”
“I really thought it was a bad idea for you to date that guy. Sorry. I was wrong -- he is a pretty cool guy, and it’s certainly not my place to judge and then tell you what I think you should do.”
“You were right. I was dressed completely wrong for that party and I had a terrible time. And since we had argued, I felt even worse. I should have come with you and your friends.”

, You and your sister are together for life, and if your sister asks your advice, be honest while also being diplomatic and sympathetic. Even if it’s not what she wants to hear, you are in a better position than almost anyone to tell her what you actually think and make her listen. She is also in that same position for you. Parental advice can sometimes feel meddling, but a sibling’s advice is often just what you need., Your family is often your best support throughout your life, and your sister could be the most important part of that. She will be with you through the big events in your life, and having someone to turn to in difficult times that really knows you can be incredibly helpful. She probably knows you better than anyone else, and it’s to your advantage to keep your relationship strong and close., Everyone has difficult moments, and sometimes a sibling can help comfort you better than anyone, and vice versa. It’s usually not about giving advice -- if she wants it, she will ask -- but just about being there when things don’t go well. Be a good listener. Really paying attention to her problems can be helpful to her and deepen the relationship the two of you have.

, If you don’t like telling her how much you love her, do kind things for her. Give thoughtful gifts, celebrate with her when things are going well, and be there to cheer her up when life isn’t so easy."

Play outside.,
Plan a special activity.,
Cook together.,
Make forts.,
Make arts and crafts.",How to Have Fun With Your Siblings1," There are plenty of outdoor playtime options. Play tag, catch, or make up an adventure. If you’re a younger, ask your older sibling to teach you how to do cartwheels, throw a ball better, give you tips on kicking a soccer ball, or whatever else they might be good at.


If you’re older and are playing with a much younger sibling, try planning out a scavenger hunt by hiding little toys or other objects around the yard. Try having them look for certain flowers or leaves. Remember to keep an eye on them and don’t hide anything in any potentially dangerous areas.
Go on bike rides together, or for a walk or jog around the neighborhood, as long you have permission from a parent. If you’re taking care of a younger sibling, make sure to keep an eye on them and don’t leave them behind.;
, Do special, unique activities to add diversity and interest to the time you spend together. Find a nearby hiking trail and plan a day to go exploring. If you don’t have your own swimming pool, find a nearby recreation center or a beach.


Try going to a museum together, especially if either of you have an interest in a particular subject. For example, if you're older and can drive, and your sibling loves science, take a trip to a museum of science within driving distance. If you love art and want to share that interest with your sibling, ask them to go to a nearby art museum.
Go roller skating or ice skating together. If you skate but your sibling doesn't know how, try to teach them, or vice versa.

, Cooking and baking together is a great way to have fun while working on cooperation skills. Make fun shaped snacks, such as cookies or sandwiches. Make sure you get a parent’s permission, and supervision if necessary, to use the oven or stovetop.

, Use blankets, boxes, or sticks and longs to build an awesome fort. Build it inside or outside, depending on the space and materials you have on hand. Tell ghost stories, play a board game, or just hang out and talk in your new special clubhouse.


Consider asking a parent, relative, neighbor, or other handy adult to help build a more permanent fort or treehouse outside.

, Get creative, and look up various crafts that you both might enjoy. Make a volcano, an art project for your parents, or anything else that interests you. Paint or draw, and think about working together on a project like a comic strip.


You could try making sock puppets, candles out of broken crayons, modeling clay out of household items, or a miniature city out of boxes and cans.
Make sure you have a parent’s permission when doing arts and crafts and get help from them to avoid making a big mess.

Don't bother your sister when she has friends or her boyfriend/girlfriend over.,
Let your sister approach you.",How to Get Your Older Sister to Be Nice to You," It's important to treat others how you want to be treated. If it hurts you when your sister is mean to you, why would you want to cause her that same pain by being mean to her? Being kind to your sister is the first step in getting her to be nice to you.


Avoid interacting with her when you're feeling angry. If you're in a bad mood, you're bound to take it out on her. Being mean to her will only make her be mean to you.;
, Although you are younger, that doesn't mean you have to be immature. Even if your sister is being mean to you, that doesn't make it right for you to be mean back. Instead of fighting back when your sister starts an argument, it's best for you to just walk away.


Pick your battles. If your sister tries to start a fight, think about the importance of this fight before you engage. Do you really care about winning this argument? Does the outcome matter to you? Don't waste your time and effort arguing over something stupid., Doing things like helping your sister with her chores or offering to help her practice her sport or hobby are great ways to show your sister that you're making an effort to improve your relationship. Hopefully your sister will realize that you are trying to be kind and will, in turn, try to be kind to you.


Don't do all of your sisters chores and don't let her take advantage of you. It's best to help with tasks that can benefit from two people. For example, washing and drying dishes.
If your sister is in a school play, offer to run lines with her. Or if she plays soccer, offer to practice with her.

, Since you and your sister are completely different people, you're most likely good at different things. Maybe you're skilled at basketball and your sister is an aspiring actress. Maybe you get great grades and your sister is captain of her volleyball team. Whatever your differences are, embrace them instead of comparing them.


For example, don't rub it in your sister's face whenever you get a good grade. Your sister may be self conscious about getting lower grades than you, so don't make her feel bad.
Celebrate your sister accomplishments instead of belittling them. If your sister had a great volleyball game, congratulate her instead of being jealous., Even though she is really hurting your feelings, your sister may think that she is just joking or playing around with you. It's important that you tell her how her actions are making you feel. Make sure she knows that you are serious and not joking around with her.


Be inviting and relaxed when you approach your sister to talk. When you want to talk with your sister, say ""I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes.""
Tell her how she hurts you and why those actions you feel so bad. Say to your sister ""It really hurts my feelings when you ______. It hurts my feelings because _____."", Big sisters are easily annoyed with younger siblings, so ask your sister if there is something you are doing that is causing your sister to be mean to you. Then, figure out how to fix your actions.


Say to your sister ""I really want to improve our relationship. Have I done anything to upset or annoy you?""
Once she gives you an answer, ask what you can do to be a better sister. Say ""What can I do to be a better sibling to you? I really want us to stop fighting so much."", Even though serious conversations are necessary to resolve conflict, bonding over fun and casual conversations is important too. Compliment her on her shoes, tell her that you like the posters she has hung up in her room, ask her about the boy/girl she likes at school. Have a fun conversation with your sister to help you two bond.


Be sure to let your sister know that you enjoy spending time with her and that you'd like to do it more often.
Big sisters typically like to give advice. If you ask her for advice about fun things like fashion, love, or music, she'll enjoy talking with you.

, Your older sister may push you away because you are younger. However, showing her that the two of you have common interests may prove to her that your age difference isn't such a big deal. Try to find certain activities, movies, music, or hobbies that you and your sister both enjoy. If your sister starts to enjoy spending time with you, she'll most likely start being nicer to you. For example, when your sister isn't busy, ask her if she wants to kick a soccer ball around the backyard or watch music videos on YouTube.


Try watching a weekly TV show together. This will give the two of you some designed sister time while watching a show that you both enjoy.
If you both enjoy baking, try baking brownies or cupcakes together.

, If your sister sees that you are making an effort to learn about her interests, she may begin to gain respect for you. You can show your sister that you're interested in their life by asking inquisitive questions, giving encouragement, and acknowledging things that are important to them.


If your sister has a new favorite album, ask her what some of her favorite songs are. Or ask your sister how her day was at school.
Encourage your sister when she seems sad by saying ""I don't know why you're feeling down, but I know you can get through it!"" Or give her some encouragement if she'd feeling nervous about something (let's pretend it's sports) by saying ""I know you're nervous about the big game, but I know you'll do great!"", Siblings usually have many differences, even if they've grown up in the same household. Dealing with the differences of age, gender, personality, talents, or interests will help you learn to better relate to others. Instead of hating your differences, learn from them. Finding out what sister cares about most may help you view things differently.


Get your sister to appreciate your differences by showing her that you respect her differences. It might take awhile, but your sister will eventually learn to appreciate you for who you are., Sharing a room, or even living under the same roof, as your siblings can be aggravating. It's important that you each get a couple hours a day to yourself. If need be, spend some additional time doing homework at a friend's house or at the library to allow you and your sister to some space from one another., Everyone needs their own space, their own friends, and their own life. Let your sister enjoy her personal time without bothering her. If she sees that you're giving her space, she'll be more inclined to spend time with you when she doesn't have company over.


Younger siblings often annoy big sisters and their friends. Don't be that kind of younger sibling! Only hang out with your sister and her friends if they invite you. If you don't annoy them by bothering them all the time, they may start inviting you to hang out with them all of the time
It's important that you have your own friends as well. Think about how you would feel if you were constantly bothered by your sister while you're with your friends. Treat her how you would like to be treated., It's often said that space allows the heart to grow fonder – this reigns true with siblings as well! Allow her to miss you, all her to want to spend time with you. Even if your big sister doesn't know it, she will miss you if you're not around all time.


If your sister approaches you, it will most likely be in a positive way. Wait for her to initiate an interaction instead of always approaching her first.
You deserve to have your own life, so enjoy it! Have your own friends and your own hobbies, as this will prove to your sister that you are an individual, not just her annoying little sister."

Enjoy music together.,
Go shopping.,
Catch a movie.,
Keep in touch.,
Understand how people and relationships change.",How to Have Fun With Your Siblings2," If you both like the same singers or bands, listen to them together and make each other playlists to discover more music. Go to shows together, even if you don’t like the same music. Go to a show of your sibling’s choice one month, and to one you choose the next month.

, Going to the mall or out shopping can be especially fun if you’re around the same age or if one of you needs the fashion advice of the other. Try going to the mall with mutual friends if you’re around the same age.


Maybe you have great taste in clothes and your sibling has a date or special occasion. Without implying that they’re unfashionable, offer to help them pick out an outfit.

, If there’s a movie coming out you’re both interested in, go see it in theaters together. Plan out a weekend for a movie marathon where you watch your favorite film or television series from beginning to end.


You definitely each need your own space and own social groups, but if you’re around the same age, try to go to movies or other places with mutual friends.

, The time might come when you or your sibling move away to college or across the country for a job. It can take a little more effort to keep your relationship up. However, with so many forms of communication at your disposal, you can still stay involved in each other's lives no matter the distance.Try to text each other at least every few days. Share something funny about your day with them, send them a meme you saw on social media, or just say ""Hey, thinking of you, hope you're having a great day!""
Do your best to have a phone chat regularly. Try to schedule a date every week or two, or at least once a month. Ask your sibling about their schedule and try to find an hour or so that you're both free.
Consider using Skype or another video chat service to talk face to face when you can.

, Over the years, you and your sibling will develop different ideas of fun, interests, social groups, and priorities. You might become independent or mature at different rates, especially if there’s an age difference. Accept that you might be really close at some points in life and might drift away during others.If you feel like your older sibling is growing distant from you, try to understand that they have to be there own person. Have a little faith that the situation is temporary in the long run. Focus on the positives, and ask your older sibling for advice as you get older.If you feel like your little sibling is becoming a shadow, try to take the time to remember that you care for them and that they look up to you. Set aside time to spend with them, even if you’re not into the same things anymore. Share advice with them and try to include them in your life as much as you can.As you become teenagers and young adults, try not to hold grudges about things you and your sibling did that annoyed each other you were younger."
"
Find common ground.,
Take turns choosing activities.,
Be yourselves.,
Work on trusting each other.,
Avoid using other sibling relationships as models.",How to Have Fun With Your Siblings3," Look for things you both enjoy. Try to be grateful to have one or more siblings who have things in common with you, no matter how different you might be at first glance. Think about how great it is to be in it together, whether you’re an older sibling sharing your wisdom or a younger sibling who can look up to a mentor.Even if you think you and your sibling seem completely different, you’ll find you share a lot in common if you look closer. Make it clear to each other that you’re a team within your family unit and within the broader world because of your history together, your family values, and other circumstances and influences.Try saying, “Hey, it’s really cool to have someone else around who shares my genes, parents, and has gone through some of the same stuff as me!”
In addition to genes and upbringing, think about activities you and your sibling both enjoy. Maybe you both love a sport, a television show, or to sing. Narrow down some areas of common interest or activities that you both would have fun doing.

, Siblings often spend lots of time together, and sometimes not all of it can be spent on doing things you both love to do. It’s considerate, fair, and often necessary to play a game that your sibling loves, but isn’t your favorite. Keep track of who chooses each game or activity, and take turns choosing to make sure you each get to do what you like to do.Your sibling might love playing hide and seek, but you might find it boring. On the other hand, you might love playing video games, but your sibling isn’t so great at your favorite game. To compromise, spend an hour or so playing hiding seek, then the next hour playing the video game. Consider playing a video game that your sibling is better at playing to make things more fun for everyone.
Definitely go for things you both like to do first. If there are only a couple activities you both enjoy, playtime can get pretty boring. Just make sure you both have equal chances to choose the activities.
If you’re older by several years, give your younger sibling the choice of what games to play. Ask them, ""What are some of your favorite games? What do you think we could do that's really fun?"" Allow them to make more selections, as long as the activities are safe.

, While it’s great to look for common ground, try to remember that you’re each individuals and allow each other to be good at different things. Try not to force your sibling to be the person that you want them to be. Give each other space when necessary, and respect each other’s talents.If they’re really good at something, do your best to show your interest and support, and try not to be jealous.
It’s great if you both enjoy a sport or activity, but don’t, for example, start playing basketball just because your sibling plays and you’re jealous of the attention they get for it. Play because you like it, or perhaps because you actually want to spend more time with your sibling.

, Try to avoid being a tattletale. Do go to mom, dad, or a teacher about every little disagreement. Try to get to know the difference between little and serious issues.If your sibling hit you or was otherwise violent, you shouldn't hesitate to tell a parent or trusted adult.
If your sibling used your hair gel without asking, you can probably talk to them about it without tattling, especially if it’s the first offense. Try saying, ""It bothers me when you use my stuff without asking. I really need my own space and for both of us to respect each other's belongings.""
If your sibling tattles on your for something silly, tell them, ""It hurt my feelings that you tattled on me, especially over such a little thing. I want us to be close and to be able to trust each other, but that won't happen I can't tell you anything without you going to mom and dad.""
Developing trust in each other early will lay the foundation for having fun together while growing up, and help you continue to enjoy each other’s company into your teen and adult years.

, Try not to look at your friends’ relationships with their siblings and think they’re better than yours. Remember, even with your closest friends, there are often less attractive aspects of their relationship that you don’t see.Every relationship, including the one between you and your sibling, is unique and has positive and negative aspects. Everyone has their own way of communicating and showing affection.
Thinking someone else’s sibling relationship is better can undervalue your own, creating a negative mindset and causing you to assign blame. Focus on the fact that relationships are unique instead of thinking in terms of better or worse.

Notice the telltale signs of sibling jealousy.,
Try to discern what is the cause of the jealousy towards you.,
Approach the sibling in a sincere way.,
Explain to your sibling why it's not good to be jealous about that thing or matter.,
Seek to give your sibling better options.,
Try to ""flatter"" your sibling a bit.,
Tell your sibling a story about the disadvantages of being jealous.,
Share the things you have with the jealous sibling.,

Find your sibling a hobby.,
Get out of your sibling's reach for a while.,
Ignore your sibling for a time if things fail to improve.,
Tell your parents.",How to Handle a Jealous Sibling," This will help you acknowledge that there are specific motivations behind the behavior that you can hopefully address. Some signs include:


A sibling throws tantrums if you get something that he or she doesn't, including parental attention or an award for an achievement.
A sibling takes things from you without asking, and may even go into your room to get them.
A sibling deliberately breaks things that are yours. Often there are comments about it leading up to the breakage.
A sibling uses such language as ""It's not fair, why does big brother/little sister always get X, Y, Z and I don't?""; ""You always get better everything than me""; ""You have it so much easier than me""; ""Dad/mom hates me and thinks you're the favorite"", and so forth.;
, It can be a certain object, event or anything in between. What is important that you ""extract"" information on why is the sibling jealous.

, Once you know the cause for the jealousy, it's time for you to approach the affected person and try to sort things out with him/her.

, However, don't point fingers or blame them. Simply make it clear why there is plenty to go around, why their own talents will soon shine, how you admire certain things about them, and so on.


Try not to infuriate your sibling more. If you start explaining things that he/she wouldn't like to hear, he/she would not listen to you anymore. Do not blame, judge or conclude that you're right and the sibling is not. This just makes things worse. Instead, focus on changing the behavior and moving forward positively.

, Try saying ""maybe we could.."" or ""Tell you what; I could give you..."" and things like that. Once he/she agrees with you, the problem is often completely over.

, Make him/her realize that he/she doesn't have to be jealous because he/she gets the ""nice"" one, is the favorite or has equally good qualities and achievements.

, That may help him/her realize that jealousy is a bad feeling.


Look for short stories, fables and tales about how badly jealousy ends for people.

, After all, he/she wants to have yours so badly, so why don't you share it with /him her? Doing so will take the wind out of their sails and remove the source of contention. They may also discover it wasn't worth being so mean about after all.

, If you can find a fun, enjoyable activity that the two of you can do after you've dealt with the problem, it'll help restore your sibling's sense of pride and they'll be happier around you again.

, That should keep them away for a while. Make sure they don't need your help.

, The ultimate distraction is your absence. Try finding fun things to do without your sibling. Get yourself a hobby and get away for a while. If they want to see what you are doing, tell them to go away.

, Every response from you makes them want to see how much you can handle. Even if they start singing a really annoying song, pretend you don't hear them. They will soon stop.


If they constantly try to be annoying, walk away. If they come after you, go in the bathroom and lock the door.

, Talk to them and see if they can do anything. If they say that you should pay attention to your siblings, try it, but don't give them the air.


Ask your parents that your sibling be held accountable for his or her behavior, just as you are. This may include instituting rules for bad behavior following an outbreak of jealousy.

"
"
Ask your sibling why they are behaving the way they are.,
Keep calm and don’t be angry.,
Be understanding.,
Describe the situation to your sibling from your perspective.,
Speak directly and frankly.,
Ask a parent or guardian for advice if things don't go well with your sibling.,
Ask your parent to intervene.,
Ask your parent sit in on a neutral conversation between you and your sibling.,
Ask your friends for advice.",How to Deal With Your Siblings1," The first and most simple way to resolve a conflict is to talk to your brother or sister. Ask them thoughtful and genuine questions about why they are acting the way that they are.Direct questions can include:


""Why are you acting so off-the-wall lately?""
""Is there something I can do to make things between us better?""
""Has something been bothering you recently to make you act out?"";
, Any hostility will further provoke your sibling and make them more likely to continue to bother, annoy or harass you. Take deep breaths while speaking to calm yourself and relax, then reassess the situation and approach it again once you're no longer angry., Respect your sibling and their situation, and try to see things from their view. They may be jealous of something, angry with you for some reason, or simply looking for attention., Ask them to think about how they would feel if you treated them the way they are treating you. By doing this, you can persuade them to feel empathy for your situation, and imagine what it would be like from your perspective., Talk about exactly the way you feel without stepping around the issue, and ask them to stop their negative behavior. Whether they're younger or older, get right at the heart of what's bothering you. Try saying:


""Your behavior is keeping me from getting my work done, and while I love you, it's getting out of hand.""
""You and your friends make fun of me, and I don't appreciate it. It really hurts my feelings.""
""I don't like it when you take my things without asking. I'd be more than happy to share them with you, but I also don't want them to get lost.""

, Your parent will know both you and your sibling’s behaviors and stories, and they may be able to give valuable advice about the way your sibling is behaving and why.

, While no one likes to be a “tattle-tale”, there are many situations in which a parent may need to step in and help you directly. They might discipline your sibling or talk to them for you.

, If talking to your brother or sister alone didn’t make a change, having a parent watch over the conversation can help to keep it civil.

, Many of your friends will also have siblings, and have been through the same things. Whether they have younger siblings or older siblings, they’ll likely have great advice and stories about times they resolved conflicts in their own families.

Don't yell at your siblings, especially if they are young.,

Praise the sibling for cleaning up.,
Once they have cleaned a few times, move away from bribes.,
Approach your sibling.,
Support your sibling because they ARE doing something good.",How to Get Your Siblings to Clean Their Mess," They will most likely yell back, rather than listen to what you are trying to tell them. When your parents hear you yelling, both of you will be in trouble!;
, Remember: your parents are in charge, not you. Hitting your siblings just makes them tell on you. That gets you in the bad books with your parents, and that definitely won't increase your chances of them backing you up on your argument.

, Little kids have very short attention spans, so make sure if they're cleaning the room, they're not doing anything else.

, Most people see cleaning up as a chore, and that's why they don't do it. Don't make the same mistake!

Find a time when your sibling is free, such as before dinner, or after school, and then nicely ask them. Make it a game! If you have a TV in your room, tell your sibling that they can watch a show after they clean up the room. They will likely be more motivated, but make sure your parents allow this.







, Don't jump on them and scream at them to clean their room. Explain gradually that the mess is getting pretty big, and they really should clean it.

, Since they are still young, they will grow up with the knowledge that cleaning can be fun!

, Find where the mess mainly is. This works if your siblings are still getting distracted by TV, drawing or other things, trick them into cleaning. Targeting where the mess is will help you devise a plan to stop it.


Find out what they're doing wrong after you target the mess. Then, show them your method. If they don't want to do your method, but modify it, don't teach your way. As long as they keep their room neat, it doesn't really matter how they do it. You can organize things as much as you like, but it won't teach your sibling to clean up unless you show them your method.

, You can make a sticker chart:

Every time your sibling cleans up the room, you can add a sticker to their chart. Set goals:
20 stickers and they get a new toy, a cookie, or something else you know they want.







, If there's one thing that inspires little kids to do something, it's ""I bet you can't..."". They get so eager to prove you wrong, they try extra hard. You know your sibling best, so devise a plan that works for them and motivates them.


Have regular cleanups. They will be much quicker! When you leave the mess to pile up for a long time, it builds up, making the clean up longer because you have to sort through everything.







, Even if they didn't really do a good job. When you're teaching a little child something, there's no such thing as ""No"", ""Wrong"" or ""Don't"". Remember to praise them especially well if they clean up without you asking them to.

, Teach your sibling to do it with their own free will. Reward her occasionally, but never promise a reward. If you run out of the reward, she may throw a tantrum. Plus, next time she's told to clean her room, she'll expect a reward. That turns out bad because your sibling gets the idea that she doesn't have to clean her room, she's just doing it for the reward.

, Tell them why they need to clean their room. Devise a timetable such as ""Once a week you should clean your room"". For the first few times, help them clean, then just leave them to it. Ignore any smart remarks; they will stop.

, Give them time to adjust to the fact that they might not have as much free time to watch TV or sing and dance anymore.

, Remember you parents are in charge, not you. So if you sibling will not clean they will take care of it.

, Little kids have a short attention spans. Put on some music or something like that.

, Most people see cleaning up as a chore, and that's why they don't do it. Don't make the same mistake parents do! We all know the feeling when we're having fun watching TV or playing video games and we get told to clean our rooms. That's why we HATE doing it. Find a time when your sibling is free, such as before dinner, or after school/kinder, and then tell them.

, Don't jump on them and scream at them to clean their room. Explain to them why they need to clean there room and the punishment if they don't clean it.

, Don't force them to do it. If they don't do it explain to them why they need to do it. Also get your parents if the talking does not work

, First, target where the mess mainly is. Is it under the bed? Is it on the floor? Is it on the shelves? The closet? Or is it everywhere? Targeting where the mess is will help you devise a plan to stop it. *So, now you know mainly where the mess is... how do you stop it? So... the mess is on the shelf. Find out why it's on the shelf. Look closely at your sibling, and find out what they're doing wrong. After a while, I noticed that the shelf was messy because after all the time I spent organizing it, my sister was taking pencils, paper, toys and things off and not putting them back in the right place. As a result, half the mess ends up on the floor, the other half scattered in random places on the shelf. Now you have the information, you have to put it into action. Run things through with your sibling. This is to help THEM, not you. You can organize things as much as you like, but it won't teach your sibling to clean up unless you show them your method.

, You can make a sticker chart... every time your sibling cleans up, you can add a sticker to their chart... set goals... 20 stickers and they get a new toy, a cookie, or something else you know they want. (Something not to big)

, Make it a game like step 8 and you can also make a bet with them while they do this.

, Try cleaning up the room every other day so the mess is not to bad.

, Even if they didn't really do a good job, you should do it so they know how good it is after cleaning.

, Reward her occasionally, but never say: ""If you clean your room, I'll give you a cookie"". If you run out of cookies, she will throw a tantrum. Plus, next time she's told to clean her room, she'll expect a cookie. That turns out bad because she gets the idea that she doesn't have to clean her room, she's just doing it for the cookie.

, Give them time to adjust to the fact that they might not have as much free time to watch TV or sing and dance anymore because they were cleaning.

Spend time away from your sibling.,
Ignore their bad behavior.,
Try hard to keep things peaceful between you and your siblings on your end.,
Ask a parent to separate you.",How to Deal With Your Siblings2," When your sibling has bothered or bullied you to the point that you’re frustrated, take some time and create space between you both. Creating space and seeking privacy can give you time to cool off, think about your thoughts, and return to the situation when you’re less frustrated.Some examples of space-making activities might be:


Going into a bedroom or office and doing school work
Taking a long bath or shower
Leaving the house to hang out with friends
Joining a club or activity group
Going to a library to read or use the internet

, While constantly avoiding problems with your siblings is unlikely to change their behavior, ignoring them when they act out can be a powerful tool. Often, annoying or irritating siblings (and people in general) are seeking attention from you.If you deny them the attention by ignoring them, you can show them that their behavior isn’t working.

, If they're bothering you and making you frustrated, count to ten and try to avoid retaliating. Walking away and taking a break from the situation can diffuse things.

, Just like asking a parent for advice or intervention, asking a parent to separate you when things get rough can be a good way to stop your sibling’s bad behavior.

Realize that your sibling may want something from you.,
Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself!,
Explain to them that you need your own time.,
Take time out of your day to do things with them.,
Spend an entire day with them.,
Offer them a bargain.,
Realize that you might annoy them!",How to Deal With Your Siblings3," Sometimes, when siblings act out, all they want is time and attention. This may be true especially if your sibling is younger than you. They may want you to read to them, play with them, or just spend more time around them., When a sibling is annoying you, simply telling them that you need a break from the annoyance can work, as long as you tell them respectfully. Simply telling them to stop will give you better control of the situation and empower you to stand your ground even more next time. They'll also learn that you will only take so much., Whether it’s studying, hanging out with friends or working on projects, help your sibling to understand that they need to respect your time.

, You don’t need to schedule hour-long blocks of sibling-only time: you can space a couple of 15 minute breaks to spend with them throughout your day. Throw a football, talk to them about their day, cook a meal with them, or play with toys.

, Ask your brother or sister what they’d like to do, and spend a whole day on an adventure.Take them to a museum and explore the exhibits
Go to a sporting event
Go shopping and buy them something nice
Go to the movies and then out to eat

, If talking alone doesn’t keep your sibling at bay, strike a bargain. Giving them something they want can help maintain peace in your house! Consider compromises, such as:


""If you can go a week without bothering me, I'll do your chores for the whole week.""
""If you leave me alone while I do my homework, I'll take you to get ice cream later.""
""If you stop messing with me, I'll let you have the house to yourself when you hang out with friends on Friday.""

, Consider whether you've been rude, irritating or needy towards them lately. It might be possible that you're doing the same things to them that they've done to you. Ask them what bothers them about your behavior, and promise to stop your bad habits if they stop theirs."

Set aside sibling time.,
Introduce him to friends.,
Suggest a hobby.,
Teach him a sport.,
Offer a reward (or bribe).",How to Get Your Little Brother to Stop Bugging You1," If your brother is always pestering you when you are hanging out with your friends or chillin’ in your room, try scheduling a special time to do something with him.


You could plan a specific time each week to do something fun with your brother, such as Saturday afternoon when you have free time. Ask him what he would like to do, or come up with an idea together.
You could also set aside time during the week to do something you both enjoy. For instance, you can tell your brother that you will play video games with him on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:00 to 5:00 PM.
If he continues to nag you, explain that you won’t be able to do the special thing you planned if you can’t finish your homework or your basketball game with your friends.
You might even begin a weekly tradition, such as going bowling or watching a movie together on Friday nights.
Hanging out with your brother regularly will also have the added benefit of improving your relationship. He’ll be less likely to bug you if he gets to know you better.;
, Maybe your brother nags you to hang out because he doesn’t have friends. Maybe he is shy and has a hard time meeting people. If he has friends, he’ll be less likely to always pester you.


If your friend has a younger brother about the same age as yours, plan to do something together so that they can meet. The four of you could plan to hit the ball around at the park one weekend.
If you don’t know anyone with a younger sibling, take your brother places where he might meet a friend. If you have a neighborhood park where kids play basketball, ask him if he wants to go and join the game. Introduce yourself to the other kids if your brother is shy and then introduce your brother.

, Help your brother find other interests than bugging you! Hobbies that your brother can do by himself will be the best ones to suggest. Otherwise, he might begin to nag you to help him with his hobby.


Consider your brother’s interests. If he seems really interested in insects (versus being afraid of them), ask him if he would want to start a bug collection.
Maybe your brother likes to read. Lend him a book you really enjoyed or offer to take him to the library. Spending a couple hours at the local library might just result in less pestering during the week, since your brother will be engrossed in his books!
If your brother likes to create things, you could get him a model airplane to put together. If he is tech-y, you could help him gather old computer hardware so he can build his own.

, Maybe your brother really wants to hang out at the skate park, but doesn’t know how to do any tricks. If you spend some time showing him how and helping him practice, he will be more confident in going to the park by himself. He will likely also meet other kids who skate and make friends on his own.


You could also offer to help him get the equipment he needs for the sport he wants to try. If you drive, take him to the sporting goods store one weekend and help him pick out the stuff he needs.
If your brother doesn’t have money to buy a skateboard or basketball sneakers, you could help him earn some extra cash. For instance, if your parents will pay you to clean the garage, offer to help your brother do this extra chore but don’t demand any of the money. Alternately, if he has a birthday coming up, give him a gift card as a present.

, As a last resort, promise your brother something if he will stop bothering you. Loan him your ipod or let him pick the television show if he will leave you alone!


Perhaps you are trying to finish your homework, but your brother keeps interrupting you. Try loaning him something for a short period of time with the requirement that, while he is borrowing the item, he cannot bother you.

Set their clock four or five hours ahead.,
Torment them with their least favorite food.,
Try taking their things and hiding them.,
Glue their deodorant closed.,
Put some tape on the nozzle of their sink.,
Spray whipped cream in their hands while they are sleeping.",How to Get Revenge on Your Siblings1," Then when you wake them up, tell them that they have slept through whatever they needed to do that day. And make sure you are dressed for the day when they wake up. , Make sure to hand out the biggest portion of that dish onto their plate when it's being served.


Alternatively, you can use a food they like. If they really like ice cream, eat all their ice-cream and leave the empty container in the freezer.

, Put their straightener under the couch or their homework in the microwave. Try taking only one thing every day (something that they won't notice right away, like a pen). Hide it in your room and make sure it blends in with your stuff or simply hide it in your closet. Keep making the things you take more and more important to them everyday, but don't take things that are very important to them.


If they accuse you of hiding their stuff, deny it! If you act like you have no idea what’s going on either they might become even more confused.

, Buy some superglue that is invisible once it dries and glue all their deodorants closed. If you want to be really mean you can glue all their soaps in the shower closed too. This will confuse them and then really frustrate them. , Leave a small gap towards the front. When they go to wash their hands the water will spray them right in their face! This is a simple and effective prank. , When they scratch their nose or roll over to sleep on their side they’ll end up covering themselves with whipped cream. Be careful, this might get you in trouble with your parents. "
"
Help your brother understand.,
Take away the temptation if possible.,
Ask your parents for a lock.,
Put a password on electronic devices and online accounts.",How to Get Your Little Brother to Stop Bugging You2," It’s possible that your brother just simply doesn’t understand why privacy and personal space are a big deal. Begin by talking to him and explaining why it bothers you that he goes through your things.


Ask your brother how he would feel if you were touching his personal belongings, rearranging them, and possibly breaking them. Chances are, if given a moment to think, your brother will recognize that he wouldn’t like it if you were doing these things. This will encourage him to reevaluate his behavior.
Tell your brother that when he gets older (like you!), he will want his own space. It’s possible that he doesn’t understand that it’s not appropriate to go through someone else’s things without asking first. Yes, sharing can be a great thing, but it has its time and place.
If the problem continues, consider asking for a family meeting to discuss privacy and personal space. However, don’t create a situation where your brother feels attacked. Instead of accusing your brother of invading your space, explain how you feel when your space is invaded. In other words, stress your feelings rather than his actions.
If your brother still doesn’t want to leave your stuff alone, you could decorate a container or box and give it to him. Tell him that this is a place where he can collect his favorite things. You can put one of your brother’s prized possessions in the box to get him started, and help him find a special hiding place for the box. This way, you will be teaching him about privacy and personal belongings in a way he can better understand.

, If your brother constantly messes with one or two of your belongings, see if there is somewhere else you can put those items. You could keep them in your locker at school, at a friend’s house, or in your parents’ room.


For instance, if your brother sneaks into your room to play with your guitar, ask your music teacher at school if you can store your guitar there.
You could also ask your parents if you can keep the guitar in their room when you aren’t using it. Your brother will be less likely to sneak into your parents’ room.

, If your brother is constantly snooping in your room, and you’ve tried everything else, explain the extent of the situation to your parents. Ask them if they would allow you to lock your room when you are not home so that your brother doesn’t go through your things or break any of your valuables.


Your parents might be hesitant to allow you to lock your room, since you would be locking them out of your room as well as your brother. Be sure to say that you want them to have a key so that they can access your room if need be when you are not home.
If you share your room with your brother, you obviously can’t lock him out of your room, because it’s his room, too! Instead of asking for a lock on your room, you could ask your parents for a lock box where you could store the important things that your brother keeps messing with. Again, emphasize that you would want your parents to have a key as well so that they know you aren’t trying to keep secrets from them.

, If your brother steals your phone, laptop, or ipod, you can password protect these items so that he cannot use them. Also, be sure to secure your online accounts (such as gmail and facebook) by changing the password regularly.


Maybe you have a shared, family computer instead of your own laptop. If your brother snoops through your emails or social media accounts, be sure that the passwords aren’t saved on the computer and that you have to manually type in your password to access your accounts.
If your brother reads your school work on your shared computer, consider saving your work on a flash drive or in a password protected cloud storage platform, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.

Think about the reasons your brother bugs you.,
Do not engage in an argument right away.,
Talk it out.,
Know it’s a phase.,
Spend time apart.",How to Get Your Little Brother to Stop Bugging You3," Maybe you are jealous of your brother, or he is jealous of you. Maybe you think your brother is annoying because it seems like he gets all the attention. It’s pretty typical that an older sibling thinks the younger sibling is the favorite.Understand that you and your brother have different personalities and, because of that, sometimes butt heads. You can still be kind to your brother even if you don’t always like him.
If you typically feel left out or like your parents only give attention to your younger brother, consider requesting a family meeting or talk to your parents one on one.Very politely explain that you desire a good relationship with your brother and have realized that the conflict stems from your feelings of jealously. Try to come up with a solution together. It's possible that your parents just aren’t aware that you feel this way. Be sure that you aren’t accusing them of neglecting you. Instead of putting the focus on what they don’t do, put the focus on your feelings.

, If your brother tries to pick fights or purposely does things to annoy you, don’t take the bait. Smile and keep doing whatever you were doing.


If you find that you can’t keep yourself from responding negatively, you can say something like “I’ll have to think about what you said,” and then go into another room. Lock the door if necessary.

, Ask your brother why he is bothering you, but don’t make it sound like you are attacking him. Say, “Why are you (saying, doing) that?” If he continues to bother you, tell him, “I feel (sad, hurt) when you (say those things, do those things) to me.” Make this about your feelings and not about his actions.

, You don't want to behave in a way that could damage your future relationship with your brother. It might not seem like it now, but when you get older, your annoying brother might just turn into your close friend.

, We fight most with the people we are around all the time. Time away from your brother will help you have a more positive relationship.If you find it hard to avoid your brother at home, consider joining an after school club or volunteering in your community. In this way, you would be taking yourself out of the situation and would also be doing something positive for yourself or your community.

"
"
Take initiative.,
Speak calmly.,
Show your brother some respect.,
Don’t get physical.,
Be a role model.",How to Get Your Little Brother to Stop Bugging You4," Notice that it is you who is starting a dialogue with your brother in most of the above scenarios. You want to solve the problem instead of making it worse, so communicating your needs and feelings with words is important.


Try talking to your brother when you are both in a good mood, not when you are angry at each other.Don’t promise your brother something if you can’t follow through. If you set aside time to hang out, for instance, be sure that you do not schedule anything else during that time.
Tell your brother the truth. He will know if you are being dishonest and will resent you for it., Don’t yell or raise your voice. Even if you are frustrated, you will only make the situation worse if you start screaming, and your parents most likely do not want to hear you arguing.


If your brother says something to push your buttons, do not respond immediately. Take a few deep breaths or walk away. Physical distance, however, will not resolve your problem, but it might give you some time to cool down., Don’t talk down to your little brother. He may be younger, but he’s usually not incapable of understanding when you’re being rude. Don’t speak too slowly or use sarcasm.Pretend he is a friend of yours. How would you speak to a friend if they were doing something that bothered you?

, No matter what, do not engage in violence. Do not hit, push, pinch, or bite your brother. Control your temper by sitting on your hands if you have to.


If your brother is violent towards you, do not hit back. Reflect on the moments when your brother has shown aggression toward you. Was it in response to something you said or did? In the future, try to avoid creating a situation where your brother might respond with violence.
For instance, maybe your brother always hits you when you ignore him. Instead of ignoring him when he is talking to you or asking for help, acknowledge that he has spoken. If he is interrupting you, respond to him, but explain that you are busy now and that you can help him a little later.

, Your brother is probably bugging you so much because he wants to be like you. Even if he’s being mean to you, the fact that he’s paying attention to you at all proves that he wants to be around you. Do the right thing and show him how to handle difficult situations with grace. One day he’ll thank you.

Change their autocorrect in Microsoft Word.,

Fill their backpack with underwear.,
Talk to your sibling’s girlfriend or boyfriend at school.",How to Get Revenge on Your Siblings2," If your brother or sister is at the point in school where they are writing a lot of papers on their computer, you can prank them using their word processing system. Go to “Autocorrect” under the “Tools” tab and change the settings to automatically replace normal words like “that” or ‘the” with ridiculous ones like “blarganauv” and “snoodle-shanks”. Change as many words as you want! If you want to really get them in trouble you can change the words to something like “my teacher stinks” and hope that they don’t notice it.

, Do this after they go to bed or before they head to school in the morning. You don't want to give them a chance to notice it and change it back. Change their wallpaper to something embarrassing, like a picture of them sleeping in a funny way, or maybe pictures of puppies and hearts that you find on the Internet if they are a boy. You know your sibling, choose something that you think would embarrass them. When they open up their laptop at school people will see their new background.

, Right before they go to school, find their backpack, empty it, and fill it with their underwear. They will be so confused, and it will also inconvenience them throughout the day.

, Introduce yourself and say, “Oh, you must be ”. When they say no, act confused and tell them that your sibling is always talking about this other person. This will get your sibling in some hot water! "

Choose how you want to get revenge.,
Choose your prank.",How to Get Revenge on Your Siblings3," You probably wouldn't want to use the same prank on an 18-year-old as you would on a 7-year-old. Try to find a prank that will be appropriate for their age.

, You can get them into trouble with your parents, or simply prank them. It’s generally best to leave your parents out of it unless it’s a really serious situation. You might as well get your revenge in a fun way through a prank.

, Make sure it isn't a predictable prank. There are so many great pranks out there, there’s no reason to fall back on one that's boring. Pranks have all sorts of levels of intensity so choose one based on how much revenge you're looking for.


If you know good pranks, write them in a notebook and keep it in a place no one would look such as in your desk, under a pillow, or in a box. Keep your ideas secret until you decide to act.

Sometimes they will be so upset that you will have to give in to them and nobody feels happy.;
, This might get him/her bored and then he/she will go away.

, If they do, they might forget that they were bothering you about something.

, Make it clear to them that behaving like that only makes you less likely to want to spend time with them.

, Get them interested in something else that they can play by themselves. For example, suggest to them ""Wouldn't you rather see 'The Lion King' DVD?"" or, ""How would you like me to set up your computer game?"" or ""Why don't you go and count the clouds and see what shapes you can make?"" or ""How about coloring? You love coloring!""

, Begin playing with them, then say you need to go to the bathroom, and just simply ""forget"" to return to the game once you're done. Another way to make them sick of it is to play the game really quickly or make the rules very difficult all of a sudden (for example, tell them that they have to sit very still for five minutes before they can have a turn). This will result in their attention wandering to something more exciting.

, Make them cater to you. This will usually result in them wanting to play something else quickly!

, Offer to play a game that they really like either straight away or later (depending on how you feel), as long as they let you play your game without them. This will give them some of your attention and it will let them get over their need to spend time with you.

Be kind to your brother.,
Create a bond with him.,
Spend some quality time together.,
Become best friends.,
Read body language.,
Show interest in what he enjoys.,
Be sympathetic.,
Be a healer.,
Stay calm.,
Tell your brother how you feel.",How to Get Along with Your Brother," He could be acting this way because you're the one who was rude first. Make sure that it's not your fault by being kind. You can do random acts of kindness towards him - making him snacks and helping him out with his chores (or even homework if he's younger). As tempting as it may be, don't try to purposefully get on his nerves. That'll just make the situation worse.;
, Maybe this sounds like something your mom might say to resolve your fights, but it's true and it works. If you push yourself to get along with him and try to enjoy things that he likes, you'll be able to have more in common. This way, you'll find yourselves with less to fight about. If you want to go to the mall but he wants to go to a World War II museum, go along with his idea. You'll be able to go shopping some other time, and maybe you'll even find something new you're interested in.

, You can watch a movie you both agree on, play a board game, share jokes, and even have meaningful conversations together. If your brother is older he can give you advice on how to deal with things like bullies at school and stressful homework, and that can make you both closer.

, Make up a secret handshake like you would with your best friend. You can share a joke from a movie you both love, keep silly little secrets from your parents, or have inside jokes that only the two of you understand. If you treat each other like best friends, you can become not just family, but friends as well.

, If your brother is upset and tells you to leave him alone, don't start to pick on him and keep bugging him. He might get angry with you and yell at you, which could get him - and you - in trouble!


If he would rather be left alone, just do as he says and leave, don't mutter anything or glare. It's probably not your fault, and he'll be feeling better and ready to hang out with you in time.
If he's upset and wants someone to talk to, let him vent to you and listen closely.
If he's being bullied, be kind and share his feelings. Let him know you hate bullies too. You might even be able to share a few pointers with him if he asks you for advice.

, If he loves video games, learn some gaming terms and learn about different types of games. Tell him what games you like and why. Say something like, ""Oh, I like 'name of game' better. The graphics are better, and I like the storyline too."" He might be impressed with your knowledge of the things he enjoys, and might even invite you to play with him! If he calls you a ""noob"" or says you're terrible, don't let it get to you. Just laugh it off. He won't keep irritating you to get a reaction out of you if he knows you won't react.

, Let him know that you understand his feelings. If his favorite football team loses, don't laugh, even if you hate football. Say things like, ""What? How could that happen?"", or, ""Seriously? But they're such a great team!"" This could even spark up a conversation that he'll be interested in. If he got grounded for something he finds unfair, say, ""Yeah, I know how that is. It really sucks!"". Then you can suggest something you two can do together, like playing a board game or playing pretend. If your brother is younger, hug him and let him know that you love him if he's upset.

, If your little brother - or even your big brother - gets hurt, for example, if he stubbed his toe on a chair, make a big show of being silly and teaching the chair a lesson. Smack it and scream at it, and tell that chair that was a horribly rude thing to do. Chances are, he'll start laughing and will forget about his pain. If your brother is younger, you can play pretend doctor and wrap his foot in a ""cast"" made out of a blanket and pretend his foot is broken. Give him a comfy place to sit and bring him food and water. He'll stop crying soon enough.

, If nothing works and your brother continues picking fights and threatening you, saying things like, ""I'll break you laptop"" or other empty threats, don't try fighting back by saying ""I'll break your phone!"" Instead, be the bigger person and walk away, or ignore him and keep doing whatever it is you're doing. If you fight back, that's immature and you're being just as bad a person as your brother is. If you don't, you can save yourself from getting in trouble, and your brother will realize it's not very fun to pick on you.

, Let him know that you want to get along with him. He'll most likely listen, because although he may not show it, he loves you more than anything. You're his sibling, and you're irreplaceable. It's nice to have a sibling to get along with, so you two should try your best to get along.

Explain your feelings.,
Let her express her emotions.,
Avoid getting physical.,
Come up with a compromise.,
Establish boundaries.",How to Deal With Big Sisters1," If you’re upset with an older sister, it’s usually best to be honest and explain what’s bothering you. Keeping it to yourself usually causes your hurt and anger to grow, leaving you more likely to blow up at her at some point. Because she’s older, your sister will hopefully be mature enough to listen to your side without getting too defensive. Stay calm as you’re discussing your feelings. Your sister is unlikely to listen to you if you start yelling and shouting.
To keep her from feeling defensive, use “I” statements. Instead of saying, “You never listen to me,” say “When I feel like I’m not being listened to, it hurts my feelings.”
If your sister raises her voice or speaks to you harshly, politely ask her to stop. Make it clear that you want to have a conversation, not an argument. For example, you might say, ""I don't want to fight. Let's try to calm down so we can actually listen to each other."";
, If your sister is upset with you, ask her to explain her feelings so you can understand where she’s coming from. Try to be patient, and really absorb what she’s saying so you're better able to address the problem. Avoid interrupting her and trying to defend yourself while she's talking too. Don’t be afraid to ask her to clarify what she’s saying to ensure that you really understand her feelings. For example, you might say, ""I really want to understand what you're saying. Do you mean that you feel disrespected when I borrow your things without asking?""
If you find that your mind is wandering while your sister is venting, bring the focus back to her by repeating what she’s saying in your head. Make sure to put it in your own words, so you're sure that you understand what she’s saying.

, When you’re upset with your sister or she’s upset with you, it’s common for both of you to get frustrated. If that happens, anger often boils over, and someone may be tempted to do something physical, such as shoving, hitting, or kicking. You’re never going to resolve a conflict with violence, though, so it’s important to do everything you can to prevent it.If your sister becomes violent during the course of your discussion, walk away immediately. Don’t be tempted to fight back, or your conflict will only become worse.
Tempers may occasionally flare, but if your sister often resorts to hurting you because she’s bigger and stronger, you’re dealing with sibling abuse. Tell someone that you trust, such as your parents, grandparents, or a teacher.
When you feel yourself losing your patience and contemplating hurting your sister, try counting to 10 in your head. That can often give you enough time to get your anger under control, so you don't wind up doing something that you’ll regret.

, The best way to resolve a conflict is to find a solution that satisfies both parties, which means comprising. For example, if you’re upset because your older sister never lets you borrow her clothes and she’s angry because you sometimes take her clothing without her permission, see if she’ll identify a few items that you’re allowed to occasionally borrow as long as you promise to ask first. Whatever solution you come up with, make sure that you’re meeting each other in the middle.You have to be willing to give something up when you compromise, so don’t expect your sister to do all the giving. The goal is to find a way for both of you to get a little bit of what you want.
You might introduce the idea of a compromise to your sister by saying something like, ""Maybe we can find a way for both of us to be happy. What if we try this?""
When you’re arguing with your older sister, it’s usually best if the two of you can resolve the situation with your own compromise. If you involve your parents, one or both of you may wind up punished.

, In many cases, conflicts will arise with your older sister because one or both of you don’t understand the other’s limits. For example, you might get annoyed when your sister calls you names, while your sister may not like it when you mimic her and repeat everything she says. To avoid problems in the future, sit down and explain your boundaries to your sister -- but you must be willing to accept hers as well.Your boundaries don’t just have include behaviors that you don’t like during an argument. You and your sister should discuss all of the things that you don’t like, such as entering one another’s rooms without knocking or borrowing one another’s belongings and not returning them.
Be direct when you're explaining your boundaries, so your sister knows what will happen if she crosses them. For example, you might say, ""If you call me a loser, I'm going to walk away from our conversation.""
It may be a good idea to actually write down a list the boundaries that you’ve discussed. Make two copies so you each have one, and neither of you can claim that you didn’t know or understand any of the things that you’ve discussed.

, The more time you spend with your younger sister or brother the more you will get to know about them and like them.Also, it will give your parents a much needed break.


Take some time to play with your little sister or brother. Play peek-a-boo, hide-and-seek, or even a video game.
Read a book to your sibling and let them read a book to you. You could even make up a story together and write it down.

For example, if your sister is pulling your hair, you could say, “Vivian, please stop doing that. It’s really bothering me.”
You can also just walk away or ignore your sister or brother when they are being super annoying.
For instance, if your brother keeps repeating everything you say, then just stop talking for a moment or two.

, Sometimes you may need to put yourself in time-out to give yourself time to calm down from your annoying younger sibling.You can also use this time to think about ways that you can prevent the situation or handle it in the future.


Go to another room or for a walk to give yourself time away from your sibling. If you can’t have privacy anywhere else, go in the bathroom and lock the door.
For example, if you are upset because your toddler brother broke your favorite watch, then go outside for a few minutes to calm down.
Do some deep breathing while you are in time-out to calm yourself down. Slowly breathe in through your nose, then slowly exhale through your mouth.
For instance, you come home to find that your younger brother has trashed your room. Go to the bathroom and take some deep breaths to calm down.

, Don’t bottle these feelings up, if you do they will explode when you aren’t expecting it and cause a big problem. Instead, find a mature way to express how you are feeling about what is going on.Talk to your parents or another trusted adult about how you feel and why you think your much younger sibling makes you feel that way.
For example, you might say, “Mom, can I talk to you about some feelings I’m having about what Parker did to me?”
Write about how you are feeling in your journal or talk to a friend about what is going on.

, One of the best ways to deal with a much younger sister or brother is to be patient with them. Whether they are an infant, toddler, kid, or even an adult that is much younger than you, if you can be patient instead of becoming quickly annoyed you will deal with them better.

Or, for instance, if your younger brother is making you run late because he’s taking a long time to tie up his shoes, be patient with him.

, They do this because they look up to you and want to be like you, but also simply because it can be fun. The best way to handle your younger sister or brother imitating you is just to ignore it and eventually they will get tired of doing it.


Don’t tell them to stop repeatedly because they will probably just repeat what you are saying and annoy you even more.
If you can, calmly go somewhere that they can’t come, like your room or the bathroom.
For instance, if your much younger sister keeps imitating every movement you make, don’t have a temper tantrum, just ignore it.

, Most much younger sisters and brothers develop a habit for telling your parents every little thing you do. They do it for attention, just to cause trouble, and sometimes because they don’t know what they should tell and what they shouldn’t. It can be super annoying but you can deal with this issue by talking to your sibling and your parent about what is going on.Tell your sibling, “You should tell Mom or Dad if I’m doing something to hurt myself or someone else. But, you shouldn’t tell on me just to get me in trouble.”
Sometimes kids tattle because they want attention. If you play with them they may stop trying to get your attention in negative ways.
Explain to your parents that your sibling’s tattling is really bothering you.

Explain “tattling” versus “telling.” If your sibling is very young, expect them to not understand the difference between the two, especially if they are between four and eight years old.,
Explain the impact of tattling.,
Be helpful, not hurtful.,
Appeal to their desire to be a “big” boy or girl.,
Be patient.Remember that your younger sibling is little.",How to Deal With a Sibling Who Always Snitches on You1," Sit your sibling down for a talk, either before they run to your parents or sometime afterward, once they have calmed down. Spell out in plain words how one is different from the other:”Telling” on someone is when you see them doing something that is seriously wrong, like hurting someone else, hurting themselves, or behaving in a way that may end up hurting someone, such as playing in a busy street.
”Tattling” on someone is when you gripe to your parents about every little thing, like seeing someone playing a forbidden video game or coming home twenty minutes after curfew.
Open the conversation gently so they don’t feel defensive. For example: “Tara, I'm not mad, but do you mind if we talk about something?”;
, Tell your sister or brother how their tattling can irritate people.Explain how it can hurt their relationships over time by leading people to form a poor opinion of them. Use your parents and your sibling’s peers as examples. For instance:


Explain how your parents will grow tired of listening to what your sibling has to say if they tattle all the time: “Do you know how you get tired of Mom and Dad telling you to clean your room over and over? Well, Mom and Dad get tired of hearing us complain about each other over and over again, too.”
Warn how your sibling’s classmates and neighborhood friends will stop including them if your sibling rats them out all the time:“You wouldn’t want to hang out with me if I got you into trouble every time we played together, would you? Well, kids at school are going to feel the same way.”

, As you tell all this to your sibling, make it clear that you are having this talk for their benefit, not yours. Do not use this opportunity to berate them for what they have done. Present this as advice, not a reprimand, so they are more likely to listen. Keep in mind that yelling at them will probably make them defensive and less receptive.Use examples from your own life to a) demonstrate how snitching can backfire on you, and b) assure your little brother or sister that you are speaking to them as an equal.

, Share your parents’ hopes that you will both grow up into people who can take care of themselves. Emphasize that “big kids” should be able to resolve problems on their own without running to Mom or Dad. Tell them that, when somebody does something that your sibling thinks is wrong, they should try to think of how they can fix things without bothering Mom and Dad.Warn them that they might not like the solution 100%. For instance, say their friend, Bill, hogs all of his own toys whenever they play together. One solution may be to stop playing with Bill for a while in order to teach him a lesson. They may not like doing this at first, so explain how it will make Bill realize that refusing to share has consequences in the long run.

, Appreciate the fact that they are too young to take this one talk to heart right away. Expect them to backslide and tattle afterward. When they do, resist the urge to get mad. Pull them aside later on and ask them in a friendly, concerned way if they remembered this talk. Then offer possible ways that the two of you could have resolved this last instance on your own.


Let's say they snitched on you for coming home late after hanging out with your friends:
First, ask them if anyone got hurt because of it. When they say no, reiterate how this means that “coming home late” isn’t something to run to Mom or Dad about.
Then explain how, if the two of you had agreed to keep it to yourselves, you would also feel obligated to keep your mouth if you caught them doing something wrong.

"
Don’t make comparisons.,
Give her space.,
Respect each other’s belongings.,
Find common interests.,
Make a date.",How to Deal With Big Sisters2," Because your sister is older, she’ll have done many things before you, and it’s only natural that you’ll sometimes compare yourself to her. For example, you’ll compare your B+ in Algebra to her A-, or the fact that played first chair in orchestra while you were third. Comparing yourself to her in that way is one of the surest ways to create resentment and conflict between you, so do your best to remind yourself that you’re your own person and avoid those comparisons.You shouldn’t make your sister feel bad about herself by making comparisons either. Whether the comparison makes you look good or not, it can cause trouble in your relationship.

, Everyone needs time and space to be by themselves sometimes. To make sure that the two of you get along, it’s a good idea to give her time alone on a regular basis. Remember that you don’t need to spend every minute together to have a good relationship.Your sister isn’t the only one who can benefit from time alone. Make sure to take some time for yourself too.
If you share a room, talk to your sister about coming up with a schedule where each of you gets a couple of hours or so a week of private time. You can do the same with shared spaces in the house, such as the family room or game room.
Don’t try to tag along every time that your older sister goes out. Understand that sometimes she just wants to hang out with her friends.

, Most people are protective of their things, such as clothing, jewelry, books, and headphones, so if you and your older sister aren’t respectful of one another’s belongings, it can be a major source of conflict. Make sure that you never borrow your sister’s things without her permission, and always return them in the same condition. You should also make it clear to your sister that you expect the same from her.If you’re not sure whether you’re being respectful of your sister’s things, just ask yourself, “Would I want her to treat my stuff like this?”
Respecting one another’s belonging doesn’t just involve the things that you borrow. Don’t go snooping through her stuff to read her diary or take her phone to see who’s texting.

, Even if your sister is several years older, there are bound to be some things that you have in common. Whether it’s a sport that you both play or a TV show that you both watch, a shared interest is an ideal thing for the two of you to bond over -- and a way to ensure that you always have something to talk about.If you're struggling to begin a conversation with your sister, start with your shared interest. Ask her a question about it, such as ""What did you think of that episode/game last night?,"" so she has the opportunity to share her opinion.

, If you want to have a good relationship with your older sister, it’s important that you both make time for one another. That’s why it helps to set up a weekly or monthly “date” that you set aside to spend time with one another. You might go for a hike every Sunday afternoon or plan a movie night every Thursday. Even a regular trip to the mall can be fun with your sister.Working on a joint project together can be a good way to spend time together. For example, you might agree to make dinner for the family together once a week.
It’s also a good idea to set aside some time each month just to support one another. You might go to your sister’s soccer match, while she attends your dance recital, so you’re both taking an active interest in the other’s life.

Push for ground rules.,
Ask to limit hand-me-downs.,
Suggest family meetings.",How to Deal With Big Sisters3," While you probably want to leave your parents out of conflicts with your sister whenever possible, they can play an important role in maintaining harmony between the two of your. Ask your parents to establish ground rules so both you and your older sister understand exactly what sort of behavior is tolerated in your home. Even more importantly, though, make sure your parents establish what the consequences are for breaking the rules.If you're not sure what how to ask your parents for comprehensive rules, you might say, ""I want to make sure that we all know what behavior is acceptable and what isn't. Could you please set down some ground rules?""
You may want to ask your parents to establish a procedure for how to report rule violations too. You don’t want your sister to accuse you of tattling every time you try to alert your parents to her behavior.

, One of the worst parts of being a younger sibling is having to deal with hand-me-downs. Whether it’s clothing, sports equipment, or electronics, it’s no fun when you’re always getting your sister’s old things while she gets new items just because she’s older. Explain to your parents how you feel, and see if it’s possible to limit the number of hand-me-downs that you receive.It’s important to be mindful of the fact that money sometimes plays a role in how many hand-me-downs you get. Don’t expect your parents to buy you all new items if your sister’s are still in good condition.
If you're unsure how to broach the subject with your parents, you might say, ""It really makes me feel like an afterthought when I have to wear all of my sister's old clothes.May I pick out a new shirt/dress/pair of pants for the party next week?""

, The best way to ensure that everyone in the family gets along is to set aside a specific time to address concerns and problems. Ask your parents if you can hold weekly or monthly family meetings where everyone can talk about what’s bothering them. That way, if there’s an issue with your sister that she’s not aware of or vice versa, you have neutral ground to discuss it, with your parents on hand to moderate.Explain to your parents that you think it's important for everyone in the family to have a chance to share their feelings. You might say, ""I think we'll all be able to get along better if we clear the air on a regular basis.""
You don’t want family meetings to have a confrontational feel, so it often helps to make them feel more casual and fun. You might hold them on a night when you’re eating out as a family or having pizza delivered. That can help make the meeting something that you all look forward to.

"
Ask them why they snitch.,
Remedy the situation as best you can.,
Mind what you discuss with your parents.,
Resist type-casting your sibling.,
Move forward.",How to Deal With a Sibling Who Always Snitches on You2," Find out for sure if they are truly worried about you. If not, ask them why they feel it is necessary to tell Mom and Dad every little thing that you do wrong. If all of your offenses are really very minor, expect the reason for your sibling’s tattling to be either:A belief that they are punished more than you for being “bad.”
A desire to be seen, heard, and rewarded.
A defensive tactic to redirect attention away from their own bad behavior.

, Set aside your own frustrations. Imagine your family life from their perspective. Ask yourself if their complaints are valid.If so, work together to come up with ways to improve matters. For instance:


Offer to talk with your parents about how your sibling is treated more harshly. If that doesn’t work, make a point of being their ally. Do favors to improve their situation, like relaxing rules when you’re babysitting or smuggling goods for your sibling when they are grounded.
Spend more time with them if they feel overlooked. If your parents tend to talk more about your own achievements at dinner or with people outside your family, mention your sibling’s to even the score so they feel recognized.
Join forces if they are only ratting on you to keep your parents’ focus away from them. As long as their own hijinks are relatively minor, become co-conspirators with readymade alibis!

, Obviously, don’t snitch on your sibling if you want them to stop tattling on you. Additionally, as you grow older, beware of your parents confiding in you more and more regarding your sibling, as though you were your parents’ equal and not your brother or sister’s. Expect your sibling to resent this, even if your parents were the ones who started the conversation. When the topic turns toward your sibling, decide whether you should disengage. Ask yourself:Is the vein of talk positive or negative?
If I overheard my sibling and parents having this conversation about me, would I be upset?
Are my parents asking me for specific help with my sibling, or are they just complaining about them?

, Even though you are trying to improve your relationship with a sibling who snitches, avoid backing them into a corner and framing them as “The Snitch.”Allow them the room to grow out of this behavior by leaving labels out of it. Also, avoid blinding yourself to their improvement should they grow out of this habit.


Avoid labels in general, since these may warp your perception of each other and lead to strained relationships in the future as you outgrow these roles with age.
Remember: there is a difference being tattling and telling. A sibling who used to tattle on you might have a valid reason to inform your parents about behavior that genuinely concerns them later on.

, Let go of grudges from past fights, disagreements, and betrayals. Whether your sibling is younger or older than you, recognize that they are older than their past selves and no longer that exact person. Give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they have matured. Clear the air by opening a conversation about conflicts that have stuck with both of you so you can bury them for good.Keep the conversation lighthearted, with an air of “I can’t believe that happened.” Always use the past tense to show that you have moved on and no longer consider either of you as “that person.”
Practice what you wish to say beforehand so you can ride the wave of any pent-up emotions on your own, rather than risk getting tripped up by them during your talk.

"
"
Prove that you are mature.,
Be the bigger person.,
Apologize sincerely.",How to Deal With a Sibling Who Always Snitches on You3," If your sibling does not relent in snitching on you, counteract this by presenting yourself to your parents as a capable kid who keeps their priorities straight. Do your homework and chores without being prodded. Volunteer to take on more responsibilities around the house. Demonstrate that helping out your family is important to you.Make a point of getting as much done when your parents aren’t there. Convince them that you spend your time wisely when unsupervised.
Engage them in conversation at home to prove that your relationship with them is important to you.Present your best self in public. Address other adults politely and behave respectfully when watched so that it is your sibling’s word versus everyone else’s.

, When your sibling tattles on you, resist the urge to start a fight over it. Avoid confessing your guilt by mistake in a heated exchange with your sibling. Instead, treat their snitching as a non-issue that is too beneath you to even acknowledge. Create the impression that you are the more mature one, even if their tattling leads to you being caught., Accept responsibility for your actions, rather than shifting the blame onto your sibling for snitching.

Lessen your parents’ disappointment in you by acting mature. Even though you have been found out, trust that facing your punishment like an adult will leave a better impression than your sibling’s tattletale behavior."

Consider why your sibling might be getting extra attention.,
Avoid blaming your sibling.,
Enjoy your freedom.,
Ask your parents to spend time with you.,
Join in with chores and errands.,
Do chores, so that they have more free time.,
Get attention from a mentor.,
Look to your friends and your siblings.,
Get attention from pets.,
Never act out for attention.,
Tell your parents that you feel left out.,
Talk to a counselor if you are really having a hard time.",How to Deal With Getting Less Attention Than Your Siblings," There may be a legitimate reason why your parent(s) or guardian(s) are spending so much time with your sibling.


Kids with disabilities (e.g. autism, ADHD, Down Syndrome) need extra support. Your sibling has a hard time with many things, and they'll spend a lot of their childhood playing ""catch up.""
Illness or personal crises may mean that a sibling needs extra help. For example, if your sibling is having a major depressive episode, or their best friend died, they'll need a lot of emotional support.
Consider behavioral issues. If your sibling is acting out, your parents will spend more time trying to make them stop.;
, Just as you didn't choose to get less attention, they didn't choose to get more of it. They may even wish they could have more freedom like you do. Resenting your sibling can lead to a lot of stress for the both of you, so try to keep a good relationship.

, If your parents are more focused on your sibling, it means that you have licence to do what you want. Your parents may be less strict with you, and you'll have a lot of time to pursue your interests.


Work on your hobbies. Read, dance, write, paint, play an instrument, or play sports.
Spend time with your friends. Talk on the phone, text, and IM.
Get outdoors. Taking a walk or hike, or exploring your town, can be fun.

, If your parents are occupied, they might not realize that you want attention too. The easiest way to let them know is to ask for it. Ask them if they will go for a walk with you, sing with you, do your hair, toss around a football in the yard, et cetera.


If they say no, they aren't rejecting you. It means they're too busy, or now is a bad time.

, Your parents already have to spend time on these things, and you can get attention by doing it with them. Fold laundry together, go to the store with them, pick up sticks in the lawn, help them make supper, and find more tasks to join them in. It lets you get one-on-one time with them, and they'll think very highly of you for helping out.

, If you do some of the work, your parents will have more time, and they can spend some of it with you. For example, if you make macaroni for supper while they help your sister with her therapy homework, then they might have more free time after supper.


Try making explicit deals with them. This way, you can plan for time with them for certain. Say something like ""If I handle the laundry today, would you have time to teach me about baseball?""
Even if something big happens and they can't hang out with you, they'll remember the promise that they made. Your parents will want to make it up to you.

, Even if your parents are pretty busy, you might have a relative, coach, clergy member, friend's parent, or neighbor who can hang out. They can give you some time and positive attention, and maybe teach you some things that they are good at.

, Many of them are free to hang out. You don't need to get attention only from adults. Walk up to them, or pick up the phone, and ask if and when they are free to spend time with you.

, If your family doesn't have a pet, you could look to friends' pets or neighbor pets. Try becoming a dog walker, cat sitter, or volunteer at an animal shelter. Animals can offer unconditional love and affection.

, This will get you punished, not lead to more loving attention. Don't assume that your parent(s) will read your mind and realize that you want affection. Instead, you may get caught up in a trap of doing more and more drastic things for them to notice, and you could end up hurting yourself quite a bit.

, It's okay to express your feelings and say that you want to spend more time with them. Use ""I"" phrasing to talk about how you feel, without trying to place blame.


For example, ""I know that because Kate is autistic, you need to spend lots of time with her. Sometimes, I feel left out. I want to spend time with you, but it always seems like you're busy.""
Work with them to find ways to make it easier. They might have some ideas about how you can get more time with them.

, Loneliness can be a difficult feeling, and if you are struggling to manage it, you can get help. Here are some reasons you might want to talk to a counselor:


You don't know how to cope with your feelings
You feel like acting out, or hurting yourself, to get attention (for example, restricting calories or causing trouble at school)
You feel listless, and find it hard to enjoy anything
Your parents aren't meeting your basic needs (food, water, shelter), or they are being very mean to you (humiliating, name-calling, etc.)

Review the risks of running away.,
Save up money.,
Earn money.,
Find a place to stay.,
Prepare what you'll take.,
Make sure your parents don't find out before you turn 18, or they could make it really rough on you.,
Don't go back unless you know things will change.

,
Don't leave if you think it will hurt you.",How to Wait Until You Turn 18 to Leave Your House," You'll either end up getting injured, killed, or brought back to your parents anyway, so it won't help at all. Unless your situation is physically abusive, do not even consider running away as a minor.;
, If your parent(s) give you an allowance, this is extremely easy, just set it aside in a safe place and try not to spend money on toys, games, candy, etc and only food unless your parent(s) check what spending you have.

, If your parent(s) do not give you an allowance, try to do jobs. At 14, you're usually okay for doing babysitting jobs and at 16 you can get jobs at McDonald, Sonic, etc. Again, keep your cash safe and don't spend it unless necessary!

, Friends, other family, or your own apartment. Work out how much it will cost for food, rent, etc. on a month-to-month basis to see if you'll make enough.If it costs $500 and you only make $350, that won't work.

, A single suitcase should be sufficient. Clothes, any personal belongings (iPod, photos, etc), possibly some non-perishable food (Saltine crackers, rice bowls), and if there's any free space stuff whatever else belongs to you into it. If you can't bear to leave it behind, make sure its one of the first items in. Try not to bring unnecessary items, such as a cell phone or laptop, as these are expensive bills to pay after awhile for internet and service.

, Taking away whatever money you had saved, throwing away any suitcases/duffels you own, etc. It's best if you don't tell them until after you leave, perhaps leave a letter or call from a pay-phone.

,, Parents argue all the time, and they WILL yell at you. This is made strictly for the kids who are yelled at for everything they do or don't do, every single day of the year. Not for the spoiled brats who think the world hates them if a parent tells them they can't have a toy!

Think about it.,
Be communicative.,
Remember that if you sacrifice one thing for them, they will sacrifice another million for you.,
Take care of them, mentally and physically.,
Write/text/email things to them every day, about how much you love them.,
At your school, show them off and think how lucky you are to have two great parents.,
Finally, just love them a little bit more every day!",How to Treat Your Parents," You can't compare anybody to them. Yes, on days you may feel like saying ""I wish my mum had Angelina Jolie's lips,"" but you don't really mean it, even if you think you do. Parents are the people you should love a lot in your life.;
, A nice, simple greeting like ""Hello,"" ""Hi,"" or ""Good morning,"" will brighten their day. You don't have to say ""Salutations, paternal and maternal units,"" and even though this may make them laugh, deep down they just yearn for an ""I love you"" from you.

, Keep that in mind and you'll love them even more.

, If they are feeling sick, make them some chicken soup and give them a box of tissues, and if they're feeling stressed, give them a massage and chat to them about the good things in their life.

, Call them up at work to say hello and check how they're doing. Parents love nothing more than talking to you.

, Invite them to plays, talk to them about parent/teacher conferences, you can even help mum join the PTA in your school.

, Keep a love meter to tell them how much you love them. On their bedroom table, have a piece of paper and a meter, and color it in a little more each day, until it's full. Then write ""I love you so much, it can't fit on this paper.

Always start simple.,
If mom is really reluctant to stray from her old favourites, try to find out why.,
Try to address her fears by doing some shopping on your own.,
If it's a time constraint that keeps mom at the same old stores, see if you can find two or three good new shops in advance, and have a few items picked out so she can see what they offer.

,
Be honest about the styles.,
If you're too young to go to the mall alone for advance shopping, log on to a shopping portal site like Catalogs.com and browse the online catalogs.,
Above all, stay calm and mature.",How to Tell Your Mom That You Would Like to Shop at Different Stores," Ask mom if the two of you can try some new stores. You might be surprised and find out that she is as tired of the old places as you are!;
, Is the clothing budget tight, and she knows the old stores offer clothes at a price she can afford? Or is her time limited, and she just can't imagine when she could browse new shops? Or perhaps she is nervous about the styles she's seen at other shops, and worries that the clothes might be too mature or revealing.

, If it's budget that has her worried, check out the prices at the newer stores. Are they comparable for similar items? Or even better, are they cheaper?

,, If your mom has rules about clothing styles, don't expect her to make the jump from GAP to Hot Topic. Compromise and find some shops that carry clothes to meet her rules and still express your changing tastes. Have a few items placed on hold, then try them on when mom is with you. Let her see that different styles can still be modest.

, You can bookmark the ones you like, and show mom your choices and the prices when you have some time together at home. Odds are, she'll appreciate your effort and the fact that she can see the clothes without driving to the store.

, You're trying to convince mom that that you're old enough to choose your own clothing stores. Whining, temper tantrums or screaming will never accomplish that, so even if mom says no this time, remain calm and thank her for listening. Your new level of maturity will convince her in the long run.

Know that it's ok to feel upset.",How to Stop Your Parents from Fighting," In most cases, talking to your parents about how their fighting is upsetting you is a good thing. It's possible that your parents don't know that you can hear their arguments, or they may not realize how upset you are.They might think that their fights are no big deal, and haven't thought about it from your perspective.;
, As much as you want their fighting to stop immediately, it's best if you stay away (if possible) during your parents' fight.Wait until they've calmed down, and tell them that you want to talk about something that's been bothering you., You are making a mature decision to talk to your parents about how their fighting is affecting you, which is great! To increase the chances of having a good conversation with the outcome you are hoping for, you need to try to communicate effectively. You should begin by explaining to your parents what you observe from your perspective.For example, “Mom and Dad, it seems like you have been having a lot of fights lately, especially in the mornings when we're all getting ready.”

, Because you want your parents to understand things from your perspective, it can be a good idea to let them know what you think about the situation, even if what you think is that you are totally confused.For example, you could follow up by saying “I'm not really sure why there have been so many fights lately. Maybe it's because you guys have been working extra shifts or because you have to bring me to school early for band practice.”

,


For example, you can continue the conversation by saying “Anyway, it's been pretty stressful. I'm worried that you're mad because of me, and I'm worried that you're going to split up.”

, Don't forget to tell your parents what you want.Of course you may really just want them to stop fighting altogether, but that might be unrealistic.


You can, however, ask them to try keep you out of it, or to do their best to argue in private.

, If you are nervous about remembering everything you want to say to your parents, or if you're worried that you'll be really emotional, it might help you to write things out before you talk to them.Make sure that your message includes all of the steps outlined above (about telling them how things seem to you, etc.), and then rehearse it.

, While it's probably best for you to try to talk to your parents face-to-face, if you are too nervous, then writing them a letter may also help. This could give them time to digest what you're telling them and talk it over together.


If you write your parents, you still want to communicate effectively, so think about the steps we explained above so that you know what to include your letter.

, Hopefully, your parents will be willing to talk to you about what's been going on between them and can explain why they've been fighting. If they are opening to talking, do your best to listen to them without interrupting.


With luck, you guys can all begin to work it out, and may be able to come up with a plan about how to handle stress, disagreements and fights in the future.

,


Pick someone who cares about you, who you can trust, and who look out for you. Think about going to a relative, a school counselor, your favorite teacher, or your religious leader for advice. , It's possible that your parents may suggest that the family goes to counseling or therapy. They may decide to do this after you've talked to them, but even if you haven't gotten around to that, they may realize on their own that their fighting is getting out of control and suggest counseling.You may not like the sound of this at all, especially if you are shy or private or are just worried that it will be boring.
Remember though that it's a good sign! If your parents suggest you all go to counseling, it means that they care about trying to keep the family safe and happy.

, Because you don't know everything about why your parents are arguing, and because you might easily misunderstand something you overhear, it's probably best if you try not to listen in on their fight.


Eavesdropping while your parents are fighting will probably just upset you more, when there's a good chance that they will soon work it out.

, If at all possible, you should try to go somewhere away from where your parents are fighting so that you can relax and let them work it out.


For example, you can go to your room and read a book or play a video game, or go play outside, You may not always be able to go to another room or go outside when you're parents start to argue.


For example, a lot of parents get stressed out and argue during long car trips. If this happens, you can still try to find a way to tune them out.
For example, put your ear-buds in and listen to some relaxing or fun music, or try to focus on a magazine or book.

, If you don't feel safe when your parents are fighting, if your parents are threatening each other with physical violence, or if someone else is getting hurt, it's very important that you get to a safe place and that you call for help.You may be worried that your parents will be mad at you for involving the police, but remember that it's always better to be safe than sorry, and that it is not your fault that the police were called—it is their fault (totally and completely) for having put you in that difficult position.

, Maybe your parents have started yelling at each other in the next room, or maybe they've been ignoring each other for days. Either way, you know that they're really mad at each other, and it may have you really stressed out.


However, it's important for you to understand that it's normal and sometimes even healthy for parents to disagree and argue with one another.If your parents don't fight all the time, and if neither of them seems particularly worried, you may not need to worry too much yourself about their occasional argument.

, Even though your parents are older and are supposedly wise and mature, they are still people. We all get tired, stressed, or have bad days, and it's possible that your parents are fighting today for these reasons.Chances are, they'll both start to feel better soon and will make up.

, Family health experts nearly always recommend that parents don't fight in front of their children (you don't need to know all of the details of their adult lives and worries). Even so, it's important that kids know that their parents do have arguments from time to time.


One of your parents' jobs is to teach you that disagreement is something we can't avoid, even with the people we love, and to teach you how to deal with it. If your parents hide all of their disagreements from you, it may be harder for you to learn how handle those sorts of situations when you are in a relationship.
Hopefully your parents let you know that they're not mad at each other once they're done fighting and that they've worked it out. If they always forget to tell you this, and you have to watch them nervously to figure out if everything is ok again, you may want to have a talk with them.

, You've probably fought with your brother or sister, or with one of your friends and said something terrible like “I can't stand you!” or “I never want to play with you again!”


Once you cooled down, you probably had to apologize and explain that you didn't mean those hurtful things.
While we want our parents to always act perfectly, they will also sometimes say hurtful things to each other that deep down they really don't mean. Hopefully, they will also apologize soon after the fight.

, Parents can fight about all sorts of things, from work, money issues, and even about stuff that seems to be about you. For example, they might be fighting about money when you know they just had to write a big check for your swim team expenses. You may be thinking that if you hadn't asked to join the team they wouldn't be fighting at all.


While it's easier to blame yourself and it's hard not to think that it's your fault, it's very important that you understand that it is never your fault that your parents are fighting. Your parents have made a grown-up decision to have this argument, and it's their fault that they aren't handling it well. Remember that even though a fight might seem like it's only about one thing (you) it might actually be about a lot of other things that have nothing to do with you., It's possible that if your parents fight a lot, they may eventually get divorced. Remember that if that does happen, it won't be your fault.


However, you also need to remember that fighting is normal between people who love each other. A fight doesn't mean that your parents don't love each other (or you), and even having several fights doesn't mean that your parents will get divorced., Even if you understand that fighting is normal, you may still feel sad, stressed, worried, anxious, or even angry. Your emotions might feel strange to you, but it's ok for you to feel them."

Shampoo your hair.",How to Smoke in Your House Without Your Parents Finding Out," If at all possible, make it an outdoor spot. Part of the garage, or an area under your deck are both good choices. If an outdoor spot isn’t an option, you can use the bathroom.


A bedroom isn’t a great spot to smoke if you’re trying to hide it. There are a lot of fabrics that will soak in the smoke and it will be hard to mask the smell.;
, If you’re disappearing to smoke every hour, your parents will get suspicious. Time your breaks wisely. Use other excuses to get a moment away.


Before you shower.
Using the bathroom after a meal.
Nightly phone call from your boyfriend/girlfriend.

, Using a towel, plug the cracks between the door frame and the door. Freshly laundered towels will produce a more pleasant smell as air moves through them. If you’re outside or using a garage, don’t worry about this.

, If you’re inside, be sure to exhale through an open window. Not only will this force the majority of the smell outside, but it will help aerate the smell that’s inside.

, Having ventilation planned is key to hiding the smell of smoke. Placing a portable fan at a window can help control air flow and diffuse the hazy, smelly cloud of smoke.


Use a room that already has a fan. Carrying a fan around with you is suspicious.

, Using a lightweight jacket, sweatshirt, or long sleeve shirt will help keep the smoke from clinging to your clothes. Leave this cover-up in your smoking spot. , A smudge stick is basically a bundle of dried herbs. It acts as a heavy duty incense stick. This will not only mask the scent, but also make any escaped smoke less suspicious., Spray these before and after you smoke. This way, you don’t overuse it and cause your parents to be skeptical. You don’t want them wondering why it smells like you took a bath in it., Ozium is an odor neutralizer that inhibits the ability of the nose to smell anything other than the neutralizer. This is commonly used to produce the “new car smell” and can fix many other problem smells. Make sure you spray according to the directions and only use it directly before you leave the room. , Brush your teeth immediately after smoking. If your smoking spot is outside and you have to cross your parents before getting into the bathroom, use chewing gum to freshen your breath. You can also hide the smell by eating something with a strong odor, like onions or garlic. Of course, if you go this route, you’ll smell like onions or garlic, but that might be better than smelling like smoke. , Using a strong scented soap, wash your hands as thoroughly as possible. If this is not enough, you can also use a scented moisturizer or scented hand sanitizer. You can also mask the scent on your hands by eating an orange. Peeling the orange will leave the juice and scent of oranges on your hands., You can clean any tar on your skin with rubbing alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol can be safely applied to skin. It will dry out your skin so be sure to have scented moisturizer with you as well. , Your hair absorbs the smell of cigarette smoke because it is porous and absorbs the particles of smoke. This smell is retained for a long time. The only way to get the smell out of your hair is to take a shower and use a good shampoo. Using a coconut shampoo and scented hair styling product will help mask the smell. "

Spend quality time together.,
Clean the house without being asked.,
Do some outdoor chores.,
Organize a family dinner with surprise guests.,
Write her a letter.,
Make her a gift.,
Go classic with breakfast in bed.",How to Surprise Your Mother1," Whether you want to surprise your mother for a birthday, Mothers' Day, or just because, quality time together trumps material gifts every time. Organizing an outing together might not be the most shocking surprise you could possible organize, but it might be the most meaningful. Put your phone away and give your mother some quality time and attention. Talk to her. Listen to her. Be with her.


Organize a quiet day together, having afternoon tea at the house and talking. Go for a walk in a nearby park and spend the evening watching family movies, or movies your mother likes. Go through old picture books. It doesn't have to be complicated. Gather photos, old family video, or other trinkets and go through them together. If you're feeling really ambitious, you could edit a family video compilation for her and have the premiere.
Go for a walk around an exciting part of town your mother doesn't often visit and show her around, or go on a long hike, bike trip, or run together if your mother is the adventurous type.
Take your mother to church, or to visit other relatives she may not get the chance to see often. Whatever you do, just arrange to spend the day–all day–together.;
, An excellent way to surprise mom is to make the day less stressful by cleaning up the house, especially if it's not a chore you often undertake without being told to in advance. Even spending a little bit of time tidying up can make a big difference. It'll mean a lot.


Start in your room to make sure you get that all the way done while you have time. Take your clothes to the laundry and tidy up your belongings, putting things in the right place. Then, move to the living room and other areas to finish as much as you can before your mom sees. If you don't have time to do a serious cleaning, just organizing books, straightening pillows, and picking up can look great.
Dishes, garbage, and dealing with recycling are all added bonus steps. Clean up the kitchen, then wipe down the countertops to give them a little sparkle. If you get the chance, finish by running the vacuum. You'll be the favorite of the siblings.

, If you've cleaned up indoors, you might move outside to do anything that needs to be done. Cleaning up outdoor toys, or other yard clutter, is a good place to start before moving onto yard maintenance and other tasks.


Mowing the lawn is a classic, though it might be more of a favor for dad, depending on how the chores are split up around your house. Depending on the season, raking leaves, shoveling snow, and trimming any bushes around the house can also be a great way of letting your parents take it easy and making the house look great.

, It might take some negotiating, but calling up some of your mom's closest friends, or some of your extended family members that your mother enjoys spending time with can be a great way of surprising her for a special occasion, especially if you organize a dinner yourself and don't force her to host. If you’re organizing around mother’s day and the spring weather is nice, make it a picnic. Organize plenty of food and drink and bring your mother to a pre-planned spot where fun guests are waiting. It'll be a great and memorable experience.


Plan a simple meal that you can prepare ahead of time and get it ready. Set the table and prepare everything for the evening, so your mother won't need to scramble when surprise guests arrive. Let her talk and visit with them, and take care of the other stuff yourself.

Prepare a thoughtful toast before the dinner, as tribute to your mom, if the occasion is right. You'll bring the house down.
If a big dinner with friends and family would stress your mom out, go for the simple. Show up with a pizza, six pack of beers, and Tremors 2 on VHS. Have a goofy quiet evening hanging out and joking around, just the two of you.

, One of the cheapest and most heartfelt ways to tell your mother how much she means to you is to write it down. If you want to surprise your mother with something meaningful, it doesn't need to be any more complicated than a sincere letter. Write down funny memories, stories, and thank you's. Let her know how you feel.


Get some nice cardstock that you can fold into a greeting card and decorate it with drawings and funny pictures for added flair. She'll love it.
Alternatively, hang little notes all around the house, in places where she’ll be sure to notice. Make each one a separate ""thank you"" for something she does every day that goes unnoticed.

, Homemade gifts will always trump store-bought things. Making your mom a little trinket, a card, or a picture is a great and easy way to surprise her and show her that you care.Weave a simple bracelet or necklace, or get more complicated with crocheting or knitting, if you're feeling ambitious.
Collect a bunch of drawings that you've made and bind them into a book. Dedicate it to her and give her the one and only copy.
Go for a walk and collect flowers, then present her with a bouquet of pretty greenery for the table.

, As long as you don't make a racket and burn the toast, one of the best ways to surprise your mom is preparing breakfast in bed. Set an alarm to get up at least an hour before your mother typically wakes and get the coffee going.


The trick to pulling off the breakfast in bed is going simple. It's probably not a good idea to try eggs Benedict, which is difficult and messy to eat, and it takes a long time to make. Try running out for some fancy pastries the night before and hiding them, so you can surprise mom in bed with coffee and croissants. Even making some cinnamon toast or making up a fruit salad can be a great breakfast.

Know when your mom is right.",How to Get Your Mom to Let You Hang Out with a Friend She Doesn't Approve of1," Does your friend make you laugh? Do they help you think about the world in a different way? Do they inspire you to be a better person? Whatever your reason, your mom might be more willing to let you spend time together if she understands why you want to hang out with your friend.;
, Explain to her all the good ways you’ve changed your life or behavior due to your friendship, or the ways your friendship has made you a better person.


For instance, if your friend helps you understand your homework, your mom might be more disposed to letting you hang out with them. Likewise, if you tell her that your friend encouraged you to eat a more healthy diet, your mom might be impressed and change her mind about you hanging out with them.
If your friend is, in fact, having a negative impact on you and your life -- for instance, if they encourage you to lie, steal, or abuse illegal substances -- your mom is right that you should not hang out with that person.

, Being able to connect with someone in an authentic way is rare, especially in an era of digital technology and social media. Tell your mom that hanging out with your friend relieves stress and makes you feel as though you belong.


If your friend does not make you feel good, your mom might be right that you should not be hanging out with them.

, Your mom might have a hard time seeing your side of the argument and respond more positively to someone else. Having a third party talk to your mom on your behalf might change her mind about you and your friend, even if all they do is rehash the information and appeals that you’ve already made. Your mediator might be:


An older sibling
Your father or step-father
A family counselor, teacher, or trusted family friend, Sometimes, moms might disapprove of your friend for good reasons. If contact with your friend is causing your grades to slip, or leading you to try risky behaviors, you should take advantage of your mom’s insight and stop hanging out with that friend.Moms usually want what is best for their kids.However, if your mom disapproves of your friend for arbitrary or unfair reasons (like their religion, class, gender, or race) you should do all you can to show your mom that she is being prejudiced and bigoted.

Focus on the chores you are known for not enjoying. Doing chores that you don’t particularly enjoy shows your understanding that sometimes people have to do things that they don’t like. If your parents are often asking you to clean your room, keep it as clean as you can all the time.
Make sure to do your housework without complaining. Doing your chores without whining about having to do them shows that you understand why they must be done, and demonstrates your maturity. If you hate mowing the lawn or raking leaves, but your parents ask you to do this often, make an effort to take care of the lawn without being asked.Do chores that benefit everyone living in your house. Spend time doing the dishes for the entire family. If you have a dishwasher and see that it is full of clean dishes, take the time to put them all away. Vacuum or tidy common areas, such as your living room, whenever you notice they need cleaning.;
, Treat school as you would treat a job that you are paid to do. Focus on your school work and set goals for your academic future. Whether your goals revolve around what college you will attend or improving your current grades, spend time planning on how to achieve these goals. Dedicating time to your studies is an important step in showing your maturity.


Be awake and ready for school as early as possible, so your parents do not have to rush you out the door.
Finish school related tasks before your parents have to ask you to finish them. Complete your homework as early as possible, and if you can, try to get started on work that may not need to be completed until the following week.
Make your parents proud by setting goals that help you earn good grades. If you are struggling in a class, make the effort to reach out for help with that subject, either from your teacher, a tutor, or a classmate.

, Ask your parents if you can do work around the house to earn money, or take a step further and try to do jobs around the neighborhood. Whether you are walking dogs, mowing lawns, or babysitting, demonstrate to your parents that working for your own money is important to you. This will show them that you are ready to take on more responsibility.


Ask your family for jobs that you can do around the house that are more involved than your regular chores, such as cleaning out the garage. Explain to your family that you are trying to earn your own money and assign rates for each of the jobs they propose.
If you are old enough, head out into your neighborhood and offer your services to your neighbors. You can rake leaves or shovel snow, so long as your neighbors have agreed to let you do the job.

, When you get some cash, whether it's your birthday, a holiday, or money you have earned through hard work, show your parents that you can manage that money responsibly. Avoid spending money that you’ve received or earned right away, as this can be a sign of impulsivity and immaturity. Your family will respect your decision to responsibly save money.


Ask your parents to help you open up a savings account at your local bank.
Set aside a portion of your money for savings and a separate portion for spending on whatever you'd like. This shows that while you might want to spend your hard earned money frivolously, you know that saving money is an important skill to have for the future.

, When you get mad, don't start kicking things and crying, as this may be interpreted as childish behavior. A big part of showing your maturity is learning to control how you express your emotions. Remaining calm and collected in a variety of scenarios will help show your parents how mature you are.


Be tolerant and patient with others. Just because someone has snapped at you does not mean you need to snap back at them.If you get angry about something at home, walk away. Take some time to cool down and think straight before telling the person who made you angry how you feel.When you’ve calmed down, explain to your parents why you were angry and offer solutions as to how you can take steps to fix the problem.

, When you are frustrated with what you feel is unfair treatment, explain this to your parents. If you are being asked to do a chore more often than your siblings, tell your parents why this upsets you. Stay calm when discussing the problems with your parents, and practice what you will say before having the conversation.


Try saying, “I am frustrated that I have had to do the laundry all week and my sibling has not. I would feel better if we all pitched in to help with the chores,” or try saying, “I feel that I am doing more than my fair share of the housework and would appreciate some help from my siblings with the chores.”
Be the mature sibling. Don’t argue or engage in petty fights with your brother or sister. Stay away from conflict, and if you really have the urge to argue back remember that you have a goal, to prove you are mature to your family.

, No one is perfect and a true sign of maturity is recognizing that you have made a mistake. Take responsibility for your actions. Avoid blaming other people for your mistakes, as this is a sign of immaturity.


Think about what you’ve done and tell your family about it. Let them know that you have the capacity to understand that you did wrong and how you would deal with the same situation in the future.
If you lost control of your temper and yelled at your parents, apologize by saying, “I am sorry I raised my voice to you when I was angry. I know that is not a good way to handle my frustration, but I was very upset,” followed by the reasons you lost your temper.
Be sincere when taking responsibility for your actions. If you have made a mistake that has hurt someone, apologize and express your remorse for the situation.

, Sit your parents down to have a conversation about the goals you've set to demonstrate your maturity, such as keeping your room clean or completing chores without being asked, and what you expect to achieve from meeting these goals. Before having this conversation, make sure you have shown improvement on your school work and made an effort to help around the house. Explain to your parents that you are making an effort to be more responsible.


Tell your parents about your goals and how you’ve laid the groundwork to achieve those goals. Ask your parents for feedback on your goals. Whether they have constructive criticism or advice, listen to what they have to with an open mind.Talk to your parents about what you hope to achieve by demonstrating your responsibility. For instance, if you want a new pet, try saying, ""I have been making an effort to keep the house clean to show that I am responsible enough to take care of an animal. I think that the effort I have put into doing extra chores shows that I am dedicated and ready to take care of a new pet.""

, Consider if you are looking to prove your maturity for a specific reason, or if you would just prefer to be seen as a more responsible and mature kid. If you're looking to earn specific privileges (such as getting a new pet) by showing your parents how responsible you can be, consult with them on your plan.


Write a list of the goals you have set for yourself. Discuss these goals with your parents, and ask them for advice, feedback, or help in achieving them. Try saying, ""I am working towards keeping my room clean and organized at all times, and I am hoping that this will show that I am responsible. Are there any other responsibilities you would like me to take on?""
Write out the reasons you want to show your maturity. Perhaps you want a new pet or a longer curfew. Ask yourself what you have already done to deserve these things, and what you can continue doing to work towards them.Understand that certain goals may be more long term than others. Give yourself a reasonable amount of time to achieve your goals.

, Think about your plans and the goals you have set to prove your maturity. Ask yourself if your goals are appropriate for your age. Understand that your family may have certain rules in place for your safety and learn to value their reasons. If your goals directly violate your family’s rules, consider whether or not it is a reasonable goal for the time being. You may need to change some of your goals to compromise with what your parents think is reasonable.


If one your goals is to go out with your friends on your own, understand that your parents may feel uncomfortable without you having an adult available in case of an emergency. If this is the case, offer to compromise with your parents. Perhaps ask to go on a trip to the mall with your friends, and go to the stores you’d like on your own, while you parents are in the mall.
Building trust with your parents is a great way to showcase your maturity and work towards your future goals. Continue to make compromises with your parents until you have earned enough trust to do the things you want.

, Most likely, your parents are not making rules to keep you from being mature or having fun. Your parents make rules to keep you safe and healthy. The most mature thing you can

do is to make an effort to understand why your parents make the rules they do.

Your parents will know when you are old enough to do certain things, like extend your curfew. Continue working towards achieving your goals to express your maturity, and they may be more likely to allow you to do the things you want. Take this time to enjoy being with your parents.
Stay positive, even when your parents won’t bend the rules. Remember, just because your parents won’t bend the rules doesn’t mean they don’t see all the work you are putting into being a responsible kid.

That's the perfect time to go crazy on your social media sites. The best time for this will be summer vacation or right after school

, If your parents don't go to work or work at night, try staying up all night alone using it. Here is an article about staying up at night. Make sure they don't see the light on your device, and don't stay up too late.

, This works if you have your own phone. Try using it when they're busy or just not noticing you.

, Open another page or window with something you're allowed to do. If your parents come and ask you what are you doing, quickly switch the screen to the other page so they won't know that you're using social media.

, If your school allows you to bring your own phone, and you have internet yourself, use it on the way to school or back home (if your parents aren't there). Also, if your school allows you to use your phone every break, use it as long as possible. Keep in mind that most schools block you from accessing social media websites.

Get the house cleaned professionally.,
Organize a family trip.",How to Surprise Your Mother2," Moms can be stubborn and selfless. Figuring out what kind of a gift would really knock mom's socks off can be hard to figure out, but surprising her might take doing some digging. Maybe she's always wanted to see Greece, but has never mentioned it.


Secret tip: try to get in touch with her old friends, like college roommates, or childhood neighbors. Find out what she always used to talk about doing when she was a young adult. try to find out what she wanted to see, do, and be. Use that to figure out a big surprising gift for her.
Use dad for info. Presumably, he should be listening to mom the most. try to figure out what she's interested in lately and keep him from spilling the beans.

, If you want to up the ante, sending your mom to a day spa where she can get pampered professionally is hard to beat. Talk to your dad or some of your siblings to find out when she's got a free day that you could schedule for a spa package and organize everything. Look into local options and nearby places that she might enjoy.If you want to keep things cheap, you can usually pick between the services offered. If she's been stressed lately, a massage might be in order. If she loves getting her hair and nails done, go for the beauty treatment.

, Make an order with a local florist and have flowers delivered to your mom's house, or while she's at work. To keep thing cheap, check out specials that the florist is running and try to avoid the major flower-gifting holidays for the best deals. Avoid roses, which are usually super-expensive and less colorful than a seasonal arrangement.


Your mom's not a flower fan? Try signing her up for Birch Box, to get an assortment of hand creams, lotions, and other new products delivered in sample-sizes for her to try.

, If your mom gets a kick out of concerts, plays, or other stage shows, organize a night for the two of you so you can take in the city life. Score some tickets ahead of time and book reservations at a restaurant with cocktails and small plates for before the show. You could even schedule a car to take you, so you don't have to worry about a thing.


If the idea of three forks and a Broadway show makes your mother cringe, change up the pace. Take her to a juke joint for happy hour, order some wings, then hit up the dollar theatre for a midnight screening of Rocky Horror. Make her feel young.

, If your mom is the nostalgic type, it's hard to beat a professional-looking scrapbook of trinkets, pictures, and memories. A little bit of planning can take your scrapbook up to the next level. Collect old family photographs and get in touch with your grandparents to snag some old pictures of your mom that she might not have seen in a while. Cellphone pics printed out from last week is one thing, but pictures of her from prom? From childhood vacation? That's the ticket.


Alternatively, it might be a good idea to set your mom up with scrapbooking supplies of her own if she enjoys little projects. Hook her up with pages, books, pictures, and other supplies and let her organize her own.

, If your mother lives with a yard, it's likely yard chores are a drag. Even moms with green thumbs aren't crazy about having to mow every week during summer, pick up leaves in the fall, and do other maintenance activities. If your mom's always wanted a garden, but never gotten the chance, you can talk to a local landscape architect to price a professional job and organize it. Even just having the yard mowed and cleaned up could be a nice treat.


Make sure a project like this fits in with your mother's actual desires for her house and the yard. You might want to organize and price the project, offer to pay for it, and set things up for a consultation, without actually going through with an expensive landscaping project she might be unhappy with.

, While your mom's out, have a professional cleaning service come and tidy up, do a thorough cleaning, and make their escape before your mom gets back. She won't need to be embarrassed about the state of affairs in the family room if she never sees it happen. If you play your cards right, you might even be able to take credit for the cleaning.

, If you want to pull out the heavy surprise artillery, planning out a trip for the family might fit the bill. Road trip to Yellowstone? Disney World? Cruise to the Caribbean? Tour of wine country? Pilgrimage to Comi-Con? Whatever your family's interests, being the one to get the ball rolling on a big trip can cut the stress and up the fun.Alternatively, pool the money up with your siblings and get your dad in on the scheme as well. Organize a solo trip for you mom, to a place she’s always wanted to go, and send her solo to have some quality time by herself.

Have your friend over.Your mom might disapprove of your friend because she doesn’t know them well, or she might have false information about your friend.,
Pair your friend with a friend your mom likes.,
Be productive with your friend.,
Join an extracurricular activity with your friend.Sports are not only a great source of exercise, they can also be a great way to spend time with a friend your mom doesn’t approve of.",How to Get Your Mom to Let You Hang Out with a Friend She Doesn't Approve of2," Ask your mom if you can invite your friend over for dinner or to just hang out at your house for a bit. This way, your mom can monitor the situation and, hopefully, realize that she misjudged your friend's character.


It might help if your friend’s mom or parents came over, too. Moms often like to meet the parents of their children’s friends., This is a good option if your mom lets you hang out with your friend even though she doesn’t approve of them. Your mom will probably be more lenient and feel more comfortable when she knows that you’re in the company of a friend she approves of. There are lots of fun things you can do in a group with your friends, including:Try cooking something new with your friends. Talk with your friends about something tasty they might want to make. Go to the store, get your ingredients, then divide up the cooking process (one person can chop veggies, one person can boil the pasta, etc.).
Go shopping with your friends. If you don’t have money, try window browsing, or ask your mom for some money.
Have a movie night with your friends.

, Invite your friend to the library or to another friend’s house and do homework, work on a group project, or review for a test together. This way, the approval you get from your mom for being studious will negate (or at least diminish) her disapproval of your friend.


Be sure to actually study with your friend if that’s your intention. If you goof off watching cat videos online, your plan will backfire and your mom will not be happy.
You don’t necessarily need to tell your mom that you’re studying with a friend she doesn’t approve of. Just tell her that you’re studying after school. However, if she asks directly who you’re studying with, don’t lie.
Studying or doing homework with a friend is a great way to learn. Studying with one or more friends can improve rates of retention over the material, increase motivation, and can provide greater access to information., Talk with your friend about sports you both like. Many schools or community education agencies organize volleyball, swimming, baseball, and other sports teams for people of all ages.


Sports aren’t the only extracurricular activity you could engage in. Some schools offer chess clubs, video game clubs, and photography clubs.
If you can’t find a club you like, talk to your school administrator about starting a club of your own where you and your friend can hang out together and meet new friends.

If you want to write your entire statement out and read it word-for-word, that’s fine, but it’s better to engage in natural conversation with your mother.
If you’re really creative, you could put together a PowerPoint presentation about why she should let you hang out with your friend.This will show her that you are serious and that your friend means a lot to you, even though she disapproves of them.

, Talking to your mom is probably best during the weekend, or after dinner during the week.


Do not try talking to your mom in the morning, when the crunch of rushing off to work and shoveling down a quick breakfast might make her indisposed to pay full attention to what you have to say.
Similarly, don’t talk to your mom too late in the day, when she will be tired and preparing for bed.

, For instance, you might promise to be home at a certain hour, or to stay home and babysit your kid brother tomorrow. Whatever your situation, try to find something your mom wants and use it to sweeten the deal., Be clear about what you want and why you should be allowed to hang out with your friend. Appeal to your mom’s logic and sense of fairness. Acknowledge her point of view by saying, “I know you disapprove of my friend, but here’s why you should approve of him/her…”


Encourage empathy.Your mom might have forgotten what it was like to be your age. Ask her to remember a time when she was younger and her mom told her that she wasn’t allowed to hang out with a friend. How did it make her feel?
Be polite to your mom. Don’t say, “It’s really stupid that you won’t let me hang out with my friend.” That will not encourage her to change her mind, and could actually steel her resolve against allowing you to hang out with your friend.
Nod when your mother asks a question. This behavior shows you are listening and being respectful.

, If you insist on a decision immediately, your mom might continue to reject the notion of you and your friend hanging out. By giving her some time to make a decision and process everything you’ve said more carefully, you improve your odds of getting a good response.

, If she allows you to hang out with your friend, keep her informed about what you and your friend are doing. Tell her where you plan on going and when. If your plans change, let her know.This will show her that she was right to trust you, and dispose her toward giving you more freedom with other friends in the future, even if she initially disapproves of them.


If she decides to stand firm in her decision and continues to forbid you from hanging out with the friend, ask her why. Think about how you can alleviate her specific concerns and take action to do so.
If she still says no after you’ve talked things over with her, don’t whine, pout, or yell about her decision.

Write down your feelings.,
Consider what you want to get out of the conversation.,
Choose a good time to talk.,
Go in without expectations.,
Consider your parents' point of view.",How to Get Your Parents to See Your Point of View1," Trying to explain an issue you're having to your parents can be hard. It can be helpful to write your feelings down ahead of time. This helps you figure out what you want to say, allowing you to have a productive, effective conversation.


To start, just write down what you are feeling. Are you upset over an argument you had with your parents? Do you feel like your parents do not respect or understand you as much as they could? Explain your feelings in detail, and also make note of why you're feeling them.You should also purge any anger in writing. Going into a conversation mad can be toxic to healthy dialogue. It may be a good idea to write out any anger you're feeling ahead of time rather than expressing it later.
Try to find the best way to articulate your feelings. As you write, read over your words. See if there's a way to tweak them to make them more easily understandable. This can help when you sit down and confront your parents.;
, You should consider what your end goal is with this conversation. Do you want your parents to apologize? Do you want them to do something differently in the future? A difficult conversation should have some kind of end goal. Make sure you consider this ahead of time.


To start, you probably want your parents to simply understand where you're coming from. Generational gaps can cause misunderstanding between children and parents. Things change over time, and cultural norms are likely different for you than they were when your parents were your age. It's important to get your parents to understand how you're shaped by the times.You may be looking for something more specific, however. Maybe you're asking permission to do something, like attend a party. Maybe you want support or guidance in school or your social life. Try to consider what you're asking for, and the best way to make that request. For example, maybe your parents will think you wanting to extend your curfew for prom night is petty. However, maybe you're a senior in high school and this is one of the last nights you and your friends will spend together as a group. Talk about your need for social connection and lasting memories., When you have a conversation can be just as important as how you have. Pick a time to talk when you and your parents will not be stressed or distracted. This can help the conversation run smoother.


Look for a day of the week free of external obligations. Talking 30 minutes before your Dad has to get to a PTA meeting is a bad idea, as is choosing to talk when you have basketball practice in 15 minutes. Pick a day of the week when everyone's night is relatively free.Pick a good place to talk. You do not want to start a difficult conversation at a noisy, crowded restaurant. Instead, choose to talk in your living room. Minimize external distractions. Turn off the TV and do not check your phone during the conversation., If you go into the conversation expecting it to unfold in a certain way, you may feel disappointed or frustrated when things turn out differently. Do not try to predict how your parents will act. Allow things to unfold freely.Negative expectations can cause you to go into the conversation with hostility. If you expect your parents to be dismissive of your desire to stay out late on prom night, you may come into the conversation angry and confrontational. This could make your parents less likely to listen to your perspective.
You should also not have overly high expectations. If you're asking for permission to stay out until 4 in the morning on prom night, it's unlikely your parents will agree. Try not to insist on getting your exact way. Know ahead of time you may have to compromise on some things during the conversation. For example, maybe your parents will agree to extend your curfew, but only until 1:30 and only if you check in every half hour.

, Before going into the conversation, consider your parents' perspective a bit. While you may feel like they're being harsh or unfair, your parents ultimately want what's best for you. Try to understand the rationale for their rules. Your parents will be more willing to listen to you if you've shown maturity by considering their perspective.Are there any extenuating circumstances at play? For example, maybe you have an older sibling who has gotten in trouble in the past. Your parents may have developed strict rules for you to prevent you from following the same path.
Keep in mind being a parent is very hard. Raising a child comes with a lot of stress that's hard for you to understand if you're not a parent as well. Be empathetic. Place yourself in your parents shoes and imagine how scary and difficult it must be to raise a child in a world that's often dangerous and unpredictable."

Forgive your parent.",How to Tell a Parent You Hate Them," When you feel that your parent has wronged you in some way, you might be tempted to lash out in anger. For instance, if your parent has recently taken away your car or phone, you might feel anger towards them. However, you might find that you tend to say things that you don’t mean when frustrated or mad. Step away from the situation or conversation that is affecting you and take a few moments to breathe and calm down.


Breathe in deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
Say to your parent “Do you mind if I take a 5 minute break from this conversation to clear my head?”
Quiet moments alone tend to provide greater clarity.;
, Your feelings for your parents may feel chaotic in your head. Writing them down is a great way to process your thoughts, remain calm, and begin developing what you will say to them. Get out a notepad and write down exactly what you are thinking and feeling.


It might be helpful to write a poem or a song if you are feeling creative.

, Sometimes, you might find that you lash out in anger at the wrong person due to stressful circumstances that are outside of their control. For instance, maybe you were bullied at school all day and then you came home to your mom asking you to clean your room. Though your anger has been building all day, you should not take it out on an innocent party.Consider also any behaviors or comments your parents have made that have built towards this moment, as hate does not typically come about all of a sudden, but usually builds over time.

, After some reflection on the the circumstances, you may feel that hate is not appropriate and that what you want to say is “I am angry with you” instead. Other times, you may feel that your hate is justified. Perhaps your parent has been abusing you or neglecting you for years. In these instances, hate is understandable.However, if your parent has grounded you for a few weeks because you got in trouble in school, this action probably does not justify you hating them.
Keep in mind that you cannot take back what you say. Consider if telling your parent that you hate them will make you feel better or truly depict how you feel.

, Think about the circumstances that have led you to hate your parent and consider why they have acted as they have. Perhaps your parent has a mental health disorder or has been a victim of abuse. Though this is no excuse for mistreating you, it can help you to at least make sense of the situation.


Begin breaking negative family patterns through open and honest communication.
Often times, developing sympathy will dissipate some of the hate you might feel.

, Before you tell a parent that you hate them, you should discuss your feelings with family or friends who you trust. Perhaps a friend of yours has gone through a similar period; vent to them. Your siblings can be particularly helpful through this as they may feel the same or have some advice on how to move forward.Say something like “Do you remember when you and your dad were fighting a lot? Whatever happened to end that?”

, When you do decide to speak to your parent, you will want to ensure that you do so discreetly. Don’t talk to them in a crowd or in front of people who are not aware of the situation. Instead, set aside some time to speak to them away from noise and people.


You might say “Hey mom, can we talk some time tonight about something? Maybe we could go for a walk in the park?”
Either have this conversation on the phone or invite an adult you trust if you feel that you will be in physical danger.

, Hate typically comes from a place of deep anger or hurt, but you must control these feelings during your conversation. Before you begin the talk, meditate, pray or take some deep breaths until you feel as calm as possible. Speak to them honestly and not with wrath or bitterness.

, Once the time comes, begin the conversation in as nonthreatening a way as possible. Do not yell, scream or curse at them. Be very honest and open and get out all of your true feelings about them.Say “I have been thinking about this for a while. As parent and child, our relationship should not be this way. But because of things that have happened, and things that you have done specifically, I hate you.”

, Resist the urge to try to defend yourself once your parent begins speaking from their perspective; remember that this is a conversation, not a trial. Do not repeat yourself over and over, either. This discredits and cheapens your words.For instance, if your parent says “Well, you are an ungrateful child”, don’t try to reason them out of this. Say instead “I hear you and will think more about that but it doesn’t change my feelings.”

, Though you should not be defensive, you should listen to your parent. This is both a time for you to get out your feelings and for them to do so, too. Situations or circumstances may exist in their life that you did not know about which may diminish the hate you feel. Allow them to speak without interruption. Avoid preparing a response in your head while they are speaking.


Remember that what they say might provide you with the clarity that you need to move forward.

, If you feel threatened by your parent or would simply like some support during this talk, invite a trusted adult relative to be present. Make sure this is a person who is not completely against your parent because your parent may feel ganged up on. Tell this person to either remain silent or to mediate when necessary.The presence of an adult can prevent violence from escalating.
They can also help provide mutual advice that will end the conversation in a positive way.
Ask your other parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle.

, Perhaps you feel that you express yourself best on paper or that your parent won’t listen to you in person. Write a letter to your parent expressing how you feel and leave it for them in a place that they will find but others will not.


You might begin by saying “I have been wanting to discuss this with you for a while and I’m finding it difficult to do in person, which is why I’m writing this letter to you now.”
Consider typing the letter so that you can make edits easily.

, After you have told a parent that you hate them, the both of you will likely need some space to process. After the conversation is over, suggest that the two of you not interact beyond what is necessary for a few days or at least a few hours. Go for a walk, watch a TV show, or read to distract yourself and give yourself a mental break.


Say something like “We have both stated our feelings. This was a very heavy conversation and I think we could benefit from some space from one another for a little while.”

, During this period of space and even after it, avoid fights with your parent. Don’t nag or badger them. Don’t criticize or insult them. Remember that you establish peace in your home and in your relationships. Though people can disrupt that peace, you can restore it by controlling and moderating your responses. Do all within your power to avoid fights and arguments., One way to avoid future arguments is to maintain your responsibilities and keep your promises. If you are supposed to do your homework everyday before dinner, then do so. If you are scheduled to babysit a sibling or mop the kitchen floor, do so without having to be reminded. This will help to ensure that you are doing all that is possible on your end to keep the peace.


Remember that you cannot control others; you can only control yourself.
Don’t try to get back at your parent by not doing your chores.

, If your relationship is salvageable, which most are, consider going to family therapy to work through your issues with your parent. Many therapists are trained to help restore families and give them better communication techniques. If you want to go to therapy alone, that is a great option, as well. Your therapist can help talk you through the problems that exist and help you improve your situation.Say to your parent “Hey Dad, I would really like for us to go to therapy together to work out our issues. I don’t want to hate you anymore.”
If you are in school, you can also talk to your school social worker or counselor.

, Your parent may have done something awful to you, something that you cannot move past. Remember that forgiveness does not mean that you have to have a relationship with them, forgiveness is for you and forgiveness is a choice. Holding onto hate for them will only detract from your happiness.You don’t have to forget what they did but you should try to let go of the hurt.
Pray and meditate about forgiving your parent. Talk to a friend to get your emotions out.
Consider also writing down what they did to you and then burning it or throwing it away to signify that you are letting go of the hurt.

Follow up later when your parents are calm.",How to Tell Your Parents You Lost Something," If you're delivering bad news, it can help to try to predict the reaction you may receive. Before confessing you lost something, think about how your parents may feel about this. Have a little empathy so you can predict the reaction and figure out the best means to deliver the news.What did you lose? Parents are unlikely to be angered by the loss of a small item, but if you lost something big and expensive, they may be angrier. They probably worked hard for the money to pay for a bigger item. They may view the fact you lost it as a form of disrespect or irresponsibility.
Considering how your parents are likely to feel, what's the best way to approach the situation? Think about how you would react in the same situation. How would you prefer the news be delivered?;
, You want to make sure you don't deliver the news at a bad time. If your parents are very busy on a particular day, they may react with stress if you give them bad news. Pick a time when both of your parents are free and relatively relaxed. This can help them keep their emotions in check. Also, think about place. Where is a good place to deliver the news you lost something?You may want to pick a public place, as this may force your parents to stay calm. They're unlikely to yell at, say, a restaurant. Try telling them over dinner or lunch when you're out.
However, if you're nervous, you may feel more comfortable having the discussion at a more private place.

, It's never easy to tell someone you lost something. As you'll likely be nervous during the conversation, practicing what to say can help. This can prevent you from stumbling over your words while breaking the news to your parents.It may help to write down what you want to say first. You can stand in front of a mirror and rehearse.
For example, you can practice saying something like, ""Mom, Dad. I wanted to let you know I lost the car keys. I know it's expensive to have them replaced, and I'm sorry.""

, When having any difficult conversation, it's important to have goals. Before sitting down with your parents, think about what you hope to gain by telling them you lost something.Do you simply want your parents to know what happened? If you lost something important, like a phone or credit card, it's important your parents have this news. The item may need replacing.
You may also want to apologize and find a solution for the future. If you lost something your parents bought you, they likely want an apology. You also may want to find ways to avoid losing items in the future.

, When introducing a difficult topic, you may be nervous. Let your parents know from the get-go they may be disappointed by your news. At a moment when your parents are relatively calm, carefully let them know you have something to tell them.You can begin with something like, ""Mom, I need to tell you something. I'm a little afraid you'll be disappointed.""
This way, your parents will be prepared for bad news going into the conversation. This will lessen the shock slightly when you confess to losing something.

, At this point, there's nothing to gain from obscuring the truth. Tell your parents what you lost and how you lost it. Losing an item can be a breach of trust, and in order to regain your parents trust you should be as honest as possible going forward.Simply bite the bullet and tell them what happened what happened right away. Do not try to minimize or excuse your behavior.
For example, ""I wanted to let you know I lost my new phone. I'm really sorry and I should have been more careful. When I got home from the movies last night, it wasn't in my bag.""

, Saying you lost something is stressful. You may be inclined to cry or yell during the conversation, especially if your parents are mad. However, strive to keep your emotions in check. There's not much to gain by getting emotional in these kinds of situations.It's a bad idea to go forward with the discussion if everyone's moods are high. If you start raising your voice, or if your parents do, it's okay to put things on pause.
You can say something like, ""I see that you guys are really mad. Maybe we can continue talking when you've calmed down?""

, You do not want to be argumentative, especially when delivering bad news. Your parents may be angry. They may express their disappointment or frustrations. Try to remain calm and listen. Do not argue or whine in response.Your parents may want to discipline you in some ways. While you may find this frustrating or unfair, arguing will only make it worse. If you accept the punishment without argument, you'll come off as more mature.

, ""I""-statements focus on your personal feelings. You state your feeling, how your parents are making you feel that way, and why you feel the way you do. This can help things run more smoothly during an argument.For example, you can say something like, ""I feel stressed that you're yelling at me right now because it's not helping to solve the problem.""
An ""I""-statement can come off as less judgmental, as you're emphasizing how you feel over an objective assessment of the situation.

, Your parents may be very angry if you lost something. They may yell or scold you. Instead of responding with hostility in return, remain calm and try to use words to deescalate things.Try saying something to acknowledge your parents' feelings. For example, ""Okay, I hear what you're saying. You're disappointed in me. You're making that very clear.""
You should let them know yelling is not helping. Try something like, ""When you yell though, it makes it hard for me to listen. I think we should work on finding a solution instead of getting angry.""

, If you lost something very expensive, your parents may be difficult to calm down. In this case, try to disengage emotionally. Try to avoid letting their anger get to you.Remind yourself everyone occasionally fights with their parents. Just because your parents are angry now, does not mean they will be angry forever.
Keep reminding yourself emotions are temporary as you deal with your parents anger and disappointment.

, Sometimes, a conversation is not productive. If your parents are simply yelling and angry, propose you take a break. Say something like, ""I know you're mad about the phone, but yelling at me isn't helping. Can we talk about this when you've calmed down?"" Then, get up and leave the room. You can go to your bedroom until your parents are ready to talk to you., Once everyone is calm, you can follow up regarding the conversation. Approach your parents again and say something like, ""So, I know you guys are pretty mad, but what are we going to do about the phone?"" It may be a good idea to give your parents a day to process before following up.Try to figure out a solution. Your parents may want to look for the missing item. If it can't be found, they may want you to help pay for it.
Be calm when working towards a solution. No one likes losing things, but you will need to deal with the situation effectively.

Show that you're responsible.,
Practice in your room.,
Don't be afraid to perform in front of people.,
Develop your social skills.,
Do any non-professional acting that you can.,
Research agents or casting calls that you are interested in.,
Ask your parents why they're concerned about your acting.",How to Prove to Your Parents You Can Act," No parent is going to let their child run off into the dangerous world of acting, modeling, dancing, and the whole entertainment area when they know the child is irresponsible and immature. Try cleaning up your room every night, arrange your school stuff before the next day, get good grades, take care of your body, be kind, and all that stuff.;
, Practice dancing, acting, singing, modeling, and all that stuff in your room, or personal place. For dancing, just blast some music and choreograph on the spot. For acting, write a skit of your own, find one online, or copy down some lines from a show or movie, or musical (or play.) Recite them and be sure to be the character, not say the lines. Add emotion! For singing or musical things, download the free audio program, Audacity, for your computer. It helps record, but otherwise, practice stage presence, and playing your instrument or singing in front of the mirror or sibling or friend to your fave song. For modeling, take some pictures of your self, or if you don't have a camera or web cam, then just practice faces in front of the mirror.

, Try performing small things like songs you wrote, or show pictures, or show a dance routine or skit for them and don't be scared to ask others to help, and most definitely don't forget to be the part.

, Social skills are important. If people don't know you or even like you now, what makes you think they will in the future?

, Maybe your parents won't help you get jobs, but you can still do community theater! Or even the school play. If your parents say no to this, start by convincing them to let you do one play. It will be a lot easier than begging to start a theater career. Audition for everything you can. Once you land a role, put in lots of effort. Then invite your parents to the performance!

, It will make you appear a lot more serious. Convincing your parents to drive you to one audition will be easier than asking them to agree to the general concept of acting. Show your parents what roles and agents you're interested in. By naming names, you look smart and build your credibility.

, Are they scared about you getting hurt? Show them how mature and responsible you are. Do they not think you can make a career out of it? Get a part-time job somewhere else to prove you can still earn money.

Be kind to your siblings.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Have a Sleepover," When it comes to asking your parents for something you want, timing is everything. Your mom or dad are much more likely to say yes in the middle of a relaxing Sunday afternoon on the porch than when they come home from a stressful day at work or have spent all day cleaning the kitchen. Look for a time when your parents are relaxed, when they don't have a million things on their to-do list, and when they're generally happy with you. Though it may be impossible to know exactly what's going on in their minds, you can watch them for a little while to get a sense of whether or not they would really listen to your proposition.


Though you may not know exactly what your parents are worrying about, you should avoid asking them right before your grandparents visit, when they're doing work at the kitchen table, or when they just generally seem too tired to really listen. Though you can't wait forever to ask them, it's better to wait until the time is right unless you're really in a rush.;
, Another thing to think about is when you actually want to have your sleepover. Don't ask to have the sleepover the night before your grandma comes to visit, and don't ask to do it when you know your parents will be doing some spring cleaning. Pick a time when they won't have much to do around the house or too much on their minds. The more convenient the time, the more likely they'll be to say yes. You should also pick a time when you are relatively free so they'll be less likely to make an excuse like, ""You have a math test/soccer game/spelling bee competition that day.""


You may really, really want to have a sleepover as soon as you ask for it, but it's important to think at least a few weeks ahead to improve your chances.

, When you approach your parents to ask for something, whether it's for them to buy you a new video game or to get a ride to the movies, tone is everything. If you come in there acting like, ""I'm going to have this sleepover and you're nuts if you think you can stop me,"" then they will say no faster than you can walk through the door. Instead, be kind, understanding, and let them know that they have the power. This will make them much more inclined to say yes.


Though it can be hard to remember to respect your parents when you really want them to give you what you want, this is something you should do at all times. After all, they make the rules around your home, and provided that they are fairly reasonable, you should avoid complaining or being mean if you don't get what you want because it'll only make things worse.

, If you've never had a sleepover before, it's probably not a good idea to invite every girl in your fifth grade class to spend the night at a Twilight themed party. Instead, just invite two or three friends, at most, and don't have any special theme or complicated food requests. If your parents let you have a basic fun and simple sleepover, then they may be willing to let you do more in the future, but you should avoid overwhelming them with complicated requests because they'll be more likely to say no.

, You may just expect your parents to say yes and give you exactly what you want. However, you should think more about it and realize that they would appreciate, and that they would even deserve, to have something in exchange. You can offer to help do the dishes more, to do more of the chores that your parents do, or to find another way to help out either around the house or in some other way. If you're old enough, maybe you can help with the grocery shopping, walk the dog, or do something else to give your parents a bit more free time.


You shouldn't even wait for them to say no. When you finish asking your question, you can finish by saying, ""And in exchange, I'd be happy to clean out the fridge/take out the trash all month/clean the kitty's litter box from now on.""
Think about it: is there something your parents really dread doing that they would love for you to do? Maybe they always complain about picking up the mail, answering the phone when they know a telemarketer is calling, or having to weed the garden. See if there's something that you can offer to do that they would love so much that they'd have to let you have a sleepover in exchange.

, Though you don't want to make your parents feel guilty about making you look like you have no friends or not letting you hang out with people, you can make a casual point about how it's pretty common for kids your age to have sleepovers and that you don't want to miss out. Tell them that you'd like to hang out with your friends in a nighttime setting and that you think it'll be a fun way to get to know them better. Make your parents feel like they'd be making you miss out on a fun opportunity.

, Okay, so if you've tried being nice, pointing to times when you were responsible, or just saying ""pretty pretty please?"" and it's a no-go, you can try some tactics that are a bit more drastic. Here are some options:


Tell your parents that your friend really wants you to sleep over her house. After they say no, you can say, ""Well then, can she sleep over here?"" Most parents are really afraid of having their kids go sleep in some other parents' home and are much more comfortable letting kids sleep over their place. If this is the case with your parents, then they'll be more likely to say yes after you pose the first question because they'll see having the sleepover at your home as the lesser of two evils.
Ask them if you can do something more extreme first. You can also ask your parents if you can do something a little more extreme, like going on vacation with a friend and her family, getting a dog, or taking horseback riding lessons, and then wait for them to say no. After they've said no, be really upset and give it a day or two so they think you really mean it. Then, casually ask them if you can have a sleepover. If they're not on to your tricks, then they'll be more likely to say yes.
If you have a pesky younger sibling or two, you can say that they can also join the sleepover. That way, your parents get a babysitter for free and can take the night off.

, Parents aren't so different from their kids all the time. Sometimes, the biggest thing that they don't like is the unknown. They may say no to a sleepover because they don't know what to expect, and picture ten kids having a crazy pillow fight and ruining all of their antique furniture. If you want to ease their worries that nothing horrible will go wrong, then the best thing you can do is to tell them exactly what the night would look like. Here's what they'll need to know:


How many people are invited
What you'll be eating
What movies, if any, you'll watch
Where your friends will be sleeping
What time they'll arrive and when they'll leave

, Another reason your parents may not want you to have a sleepover is because they can already picture themselves making a big dinner and having to clean up a big huge mess in the morning. They may also be worried about cleaning the house so it's presentable to your friends and their parents. Tell them that you'll do all of the cleaning before and after and that you'll make sure your friends won't make a big mess. Also, say that you'll do something simple and cheap like ordering pizza so they won't feel like they have to do a million things to keep your friends happy.


Once you make it clear that your parents won't have to do a ton of the work, they'll be more likely to let the sleepover happen. They'll also be impressed that you're taking so much initiative and showing responsibility.

, If your parents haven't met the friends that you want to sleep over yet, then you should invite them by so that your parents see that they're nice, normal people who can be trusted to stay the night. Invite your friends to a baseball game with your family, or to have dinner or watch a movie at your home, so your parents see that there's nothing to be afraid of. If your parents are worried about letting your friends sleep over, then letting them see that they're good people can go a long way in making them change their minds.


Your parents may also feel more comfortable if they meet your friends' parents when they pick them up.

, The best part about having a sleepover, for your parents, may be that they can theoretically check up on you almost any time, unlike when you're out at another friend's house. Tell your parents that they're welcome to check in on you when you're eating, watching a movie, or just hanging out with your friends. They can bring you milk and cookies or even make you breakfast in the morning, if they want to do that; chances are, they'll mostly leave you alone, but they'll feel comforted by the fact that they'll be able to easily see what you're up to.


Say you'll leave your door open a crack or that you'll come say hi to your parents every few hours. Though this may be a bit much for you, it's better than not having a sleepover at all!

, If you really want to get your parents to say yes, then after you ask them if you can have a sleepover, you can remind them of what a responsible, awesome person you've been in the past when you've hung out with your friends. Maybe the same friends who you want to sleep over had hung out at your house the last week. You can say something like, ""Remember when Maggie came over to watch TV and eat pizza? Nothing bad happened, right?"" Show them that it's not a big deal that your friends, who you're good at hanging out with already, just spend a few extra nighttime hours in your home.


Your parents need to see that you can behave well instead of just being promised. Make a list of times when you've played well with others in the past so you can bring it up to put them at ease.

, If you want your parents to let you have a sleepover, then it's not a bad week to bring home some As. Show your parents that you're a good student, that you're focused on your work, and that you won't be distracted by a few friends. Having friendships is healthy and important to your development, and you should show your folks that you have the whole balance between work and play under control.


If your grades aren't so hot, your parents can use that as an excuse to keep you from having a sleepover. Work to be a good student and to show them that you have things under control and they'll be more likely to say yes to you. Not everyone is meant to be at the head of the class, but doing your best is important.

, Another way to persuade your parents to let you have a sleepover is to be extra helpful around the house. You should not only do your chores, but go above and beyond to make sure that everything is spic and span. Do the laundry, make your parents' beds, and even offer to cook dinner or to pick it up, if you can. You can even vacuum, dust, or do some of those other less than pleasant tasks that your parents are always doing. Your parents will see that you're really responsible and will be impressed.


Of course, you shouldn't help out only so that your parents let you have a sleepover. Demonstrating responsibility can help you grow as a person.

, This may sound obvious, but many kids are surprised when their parents say no to them even after they've had a string of bad behavior. If your parents tell you to come home at a certain time, don't overstep your boundaries. If they tell you to help your little sister, don't ignore them. If they ask you to get up for school, don't complain in bed for an extra ten minutes. The more you listen to what they say, the more they'll be likely to listen to you when you ask then if you can have a sleepover.


If you disobey your parents, then they'll have something to point to when they explain why you can't have a sleepover. It's better to obey them so you can point to positive behavior to support your case.
Be a good host when your family has guests. If your family has guests, whether it's your cousins or your parents' childhood friends, act like a good host by taking their coats, bringing them food, and showing them where everything is. Let your parents see that you'll be a great host when the time comes for your friends to sleep over!

, Another way to show your parents that you're responsible enough to have a sleepover is to treat your siblings fairly and kindly when you have the chance. Whether you have a pesky younger sister or a jokester for an older brother, you should do your best to be nice to them as much as you can. Help them out when they need it, don't tattle on them if they haven't really done anything, and work on being a good sport and a good sibling.


If you're respectful to your siblings, then your parents may see that you've earned the responsibility of having a sleepover.

Remain calm.,
Be clear and direct with your parents.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Listen to your parents' perspective.,
Avoid arguing and complaining.",How to Get Your Parents to See Your Point of View2," Before beginning the conversation, try to remain calm. If you come into the conversation angry or stressed, you may be inclined to yell and argue. This will make it hard for your parents to see your point of view. Take a few deep breaths just before the conversation. This will help you enter the situation in a calm fashion., You want to make sure you are understood. As you begin to try and express your viewpoint, be as clear and direct as possible. You want to make sure no information gets obscured.


Be upfront about what you want to discuss. Open the conversation stating your concerns. Start with something like, ""I wanted to talk to you guys about prom night. I've been thinking about it for awhile, and an 11 o'clock curfew seems early. This is a special occasion and I would like to stay out later.""Be honest. If you leave out or obscure any information, this can lessen trust. Your parents will be unlikely to see your point of view if they feel you're being dishonest with them. Provide them with all the information necessary. For example, say something like, ""I know you feel like my friend Joel is a bad influence. He will be hanging out with us for a little bit on prom night, but I promise I won't do anything I'm not supposed to do. If there's any drinking or anything else illegal going on, I promise I'll come home right away."", ""I""-statements are a great way to express yourself and get others to see your perspective. They emphasize personal feeling over objective truth. You'll be telling your parents how a certain action or behavior makes you feel. This way, your parents won't feel blamed or judged by your assertions.


An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel,"" after which you immediately state your emotion. Then, you state the action that lead to that emotion. Lastly, you explain why you feel that way.
Stating your emotions without an ""I""-statement risks sounding judgmental. For example, you may be inclined to say something like, ""You guys always assume that I'm going to end up just like Elizabeth. I know she screwed up in high school, but stop looking at me like I'm my sister."" This statement is needlessly confrontational and accusatory. It may escalate the situation instead of allowing your parents to see your perspective.
You can easily rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. Try something like, ""I feel misjudged when you bring up Elizabeth's mistakes when making rules for me because I'm my own person."" This is far less judgmental. You are not expressing anger or frustration, but merely explaining how your parents behavior affects your feelings.

, Just as it's important that your parents understand you, you should be willing to take their point of view into consideration. Even if you feel frustrated by their responses, remain calm and listen to what they have to say.Your parents probably have reasons for making certain rules for you. Even if they seem unfair, you should try to understand. If you're confused about something, ask your parents for clarification on why they feel the way they do.
Be respectful. Do not say something like, ""Why would you expect me to drink just because other kids are drinking? That makes no sense."" Instead, ask for clarification in a calm manner. Try something like, ""I understand you worry about other kids influencing me, but I've always been really responsible. Can you explain why you still have reservations?""

, Sometimes, your parents simply will be unable to understand something. Even if they make the effort to listen to your perspective, they main remain relatively firm in their stance. If this is the case, avoid arguing or complaining. This only serves to escalate the situation, frustrating both you and your parents further.If your parents aren't listening to your perspective, try to end the conversation. While you may be frustrated, continuing to push, argue, or complain after a certain point is counterproductive. Say something like, ""I'm sorry. I don't think we're hearing each other. Maybe we can talk again later.""
It's always possible your parents will feel differently in a few days. Parents are not perfect and yours may overreact to certain requests or declarations. Even if you were just sincerely trying to express your perspective, this can be misconstrued as an insult or accusation. If the conversation does not go well, give it a few days. Then, approach your parents again. Say something like, ""I know we already talked about prom night, and you didn't seem too happy, but can we talk again? There are just a few things I'm not sure I understand.""

Look for a mutually beneficial solution.,
Have patience.,
Accept rules and responsibilities.,
Talk regularly.,
Think about the bigger picture.",How to Get Your Parents to See Your Point of View3," The point of sharing your point of view is to find a solution to a problem. If you and your parents are routinely misunderstanding each other, work to find a mutually beneficial solution.Look for a way to smooth out miscommunications as they occur. For example, maybe your parents feel you're on your phone too much. Your parents come from a generation that primarily communicates through phone calls and face-to-face interactions. They may not understand the function of social media and text messaging on modern relationships.
Try to say something to your parents like, ""The next time you see me on the phone, think about my age. My whole life, text and the Internet have been how I communicate with friends. It may seem petty, but it's really no different than when you and Dad phone old classmates.""
You should also be willing to compromise. While they want you to have a healthy social life, maybe when you're on your phone at dinner or family events, your parents feel like you're not enjoying their company. You could request they not give you a hard time about using your phone during your own downtime. However, you could agree to lessen phone time at the dinner table or when you're all hanging out.

, Change does not happen overnight. It may take your parents time to hear and understand you after you explain your perspective to them. Do not expect them to change overnight.


Forgive your parents for small mistakes. Maybe they agreed to ask less questions about your social life, as you've proven yourself trustworthy. However, they may still pry on occasion. Try to let go of the fact your mom asked three questions in a row about your friend Jane's new boyfriend.Remind your parents, respectfully, when they're forgetting your point of view. If your mom asks you why you've been on your phone for an hour, say something like, ""Mom, sorry, but we talked about this. I spend a lot of time talking to my friends through my phone. You know I'm just texting Sophie. You don't need to ask.""

, While you may want your parents to understand your point of view, you can't expect you won't have rules and responsibilities you need to follow. It's reasonable that your parents have certain expectations of your behavior. Try to respect these expectations.


Be upfront about what you're doing. If you're going to see a movie with Theresa, do not say you're hanging out at Theresa's house for the evening. If your parents want you to check in on occasion, call them or send them a text updating them on what you're doing.
Complete any responsibilities you have. Do your homework on time, keep up with chores around the house, and be respectful of your parents.

, If you want your parents to understand you, active communication is key. Make a point of talking to your parents regularly. This way, your parents will get to know you as a person. This will make it easier for them to understand your point of view.


Talk every day. Even if it's just a 10 minute chat over dinner, communication is important. If your parents ask you how your day was, make a point of offering an in-depth answer instead of something like, ""Okay"" or ""Fine.""Chat about day-to-day things. If you're struggling to think of topics for conversation, just talk about small things. Share an anecdote about something that happened at school. Let them know about the funny thing your friend Josh said at lunch., There's always a bigger picture at play when there is a disappointment or misunderstanding between two people. What is it you really want your parents to understand about you? How can you continue to make this clear as you move forward? What can your parents do to help make your relationship run more smoothly?Let's return to an example from earlier. You want your parents to understand why prom night is important to you. However, on a deeper level you wish they would trust your judgment more. What are ways you can make this clear to your parents?
Small things can speak volumes in terms of establishing trust. From now on, maybe you could fill your parents in on small aspects of your life without prompting. This may make them less likely to think you're hiding something. If you got a bad grade on a test, let them know you slipped up and will try to do better in the future. It's better they hear it upfront, from you, rather than receiving the news from your teacher in a few days.

Pay attention to each political party's views.,

Follow election news and commentary that interests and challenges you.",How to Maintain Republican Views if Your Parents Like Democrats1," Do your research on both parties and find out what they represent. You shouldn't support or oppose a specific party just because your parents do. Instead, it is your free choice to make an informed decision. Acquaint yourself with past and present officeholders and candidates' views, and their actions. A good place to start your research is by visiting each of the party websites, scanning and reading about their current issues and convention platforms (party statements of methods and objectives).By having a broad understanding of the Republican and Democratic party platforms, you will be better equipped to have a meaningful political conversation with your parents.
It will be easier to maintain your Republican views if you are satisfied with why you have chosen to support them in the first place. For instance, you can explain that you are not supporting the Republicans to disagree with your parents. Instead, you have made an informed decision.
Sufficiently understanding arguments and issues often presented by Democrats will also help to strengthen the basis and details of your own position, if you end up in a disagreement with your parents.;
, Another way to clarify your political views and consequently help maintain your political affiliation is by listening to debates of some of your legislators, representative, senators and governor, or candidates for such offices. There are two primary reasons why people support one candidate over another: (1) You support their platform and policies or (2) you like their presentation of their views and their leadership qualities. You are more likely to maintain your Republican affiliation, if you support both the party policies and party leadership.Research into the past work and outcomes on issues of the Republican Party in local, state and U.S. House and Senate and their leadership in order to find reasons why you appreciate their views and support them.

, In order to maintain your own political views and not be influenced by others, specifically political commentators and your own parents, you should personally view speeches on TV or videos, and read election materials to get info directly. This will allow you to more clearly articulate why you are supporting one party over the other. For example, watch a debate that takes place between candidates, read a wide variety of political analysis (especially written by people on your side of the political divide, realizing that the other side will often disagree with Republicans on many basic issues). Also, become involved in a campaign if you find it desirable.It is important to educate yourself on the major issues in any given election in order to develop your own views and opinions, rather than becoming a carbon-copy of your parents. You will be able to maintain you own views more easily if you follow elections closely."

Set up a full morning or afternoon to weed out your current wardrobe.,
Make up 4 signs for the piles you will create, to keep them separate as you work to go:


things that don't fit, but are still in good condition and can be passed down or donated.,
Once you've done the weed out, invite your parents in so they can check your good work, and then you carefully bag up the donations and the trash, and box the off-season things for storage.,
Make a written list.",How to Persuade Your Parents Into Letting You Shop for Yourself," Schedule it. Block the time. Put it on the family calendar. This proves you are organized and planning ahead. Tell your parents you will do this work yourself, but want them for 20 minutes at the end to ""go over"" your work and give their input. It reassures them you won't just throw everything out to get more stuff.


Tell them you plan on trying things on and you might need ""second opinions"" about anything being too short/tight, especially if you're still growing - this shows that you've been aware of the work they've always done in managing your clothes and getting you new ones as you needed them, and shows you're sensible and conscious about your clothes fitting appropriately. (By the way, you'll be doing wardrobe weed-outs for the rest of your life: it's a good habit every 2 years once you're adult sized to avoid being a pack rat);
,
things that have rips, stains, or broken zippers or fastenings and should be discarded.
TO STAY: things that fit, and can still be used in the coming season (example: layering a summer t-shirt under a sweater or over a long-sleeved shirt gets more months out of it in cold weather) 
To PUT AWAY:  things that were loose or over-sized this year and can be put away for next year at the same time (winter coats or bathing suits are examples of seasonal things that might still be good next year). Even though you are sorting your clothes into piles, keep them folded and nicely organized. The stuff you donate or give away is going to be somebody else's and should be treated with respect and care. Doing the weed-out in an organized manner are actions that prove your maturity and consideration for others.
If your parents ever tell you ""actions speak louder than words,"" this is a huge way to show it.

, Make sure the ""TO STAY"" clothes all get put away as neatly as if you were seeing them in a store: hung on hangers, folded in drawers. Seeing you take excellent care of your existing things tells parents you will take excellent care of new things. (Also, and this is kind of a sneaky secret: hanging everything back up according to type (shirts, then skirts, then long pants then dresses) and putting everything away neatly will leave a lot of visible empty space - your parents will see that you need new stuff!) Clean up the whole room after the job is done. It's a lot of work, but it shows how adult you are to take on a job like this.

, This is a great break to do immediately after the weed out: sit on your bed and list the things that you need to replace while they're still fresh in your mind: ""2 pairs jeans, 1 pair of boots, one pair of converse chucks, one pair dress shoes, 3 tops, a belt, 5 pairs of underwear..""


Try typing this list up on your computer, because then you won't lose it and you can go online to the websites of your favorite stores and window shop. You can check out prices and sales. You can save the links in the document so you know which stores you saw what things in, and you can show your parents what you like before you go shopping. You can compare value (a pair of black skinny jeans for $25 is not as good as two for $35!) Besides that, there are things you NEED (shoes, jeans, coat) and things you'll want (accessories, bling!), so you need the ""must haves"" before the ""fun stuff"" - having that list, ""doing the homework"" adding up the total for the Must Haves shows your parents you are making decisions based in realism and practicality. You really ARE thinking and acting like an adult - and not just any adult, but someone with good judgement and shopping savvy.
You are not just skipping off to the mall in a buying frenzy of materialism and consumerism and impulse purchases, you are making a planned trip, and conscious, well-thought out choices. (Besides, this way, you can get the BEST new stuff. You won't buy a so-so outfit and then see something fabulous only after you've run out of money. It's another sneaky way to really make this situation really work for you.)

Hint to your parents that you support the Republicans.,
Avoid criticizing your parents' views of politics.,
Listen nicely to why your parents support the Democrats.,
Appreciate any common ground.,
Tell your parents that it is one of your rights to hold your own opinions, including political views.",How to Maintain Republican Views if Your Parents Like Democrats2," Once you are informed about the major issues and platforms of each of the parties, it is a good idea to be ready to tell your parents about the basics of your views -- and that you have decided to support the Republican Party. Be peaceful and calmly let them understand that you agree with many of the Republican's views. For example, explain to your parents why you align with certain Republican platform ""planks"". You can provide them with several concrete examples to help them better understand your position.Do not try to convince or convert them. It is okay that you don’t share the same political views as your parents, even if it is uncomfortable and awkward.

, Instead, speak in a respectful manner. Do not judge or argue with your parents because they hold different views than your own. This will only lead to unnecessary arguments, divisions, and polarization.


Approach any political discussion with a friendly and affectionate attitude. Say, ""Okay."" when one disagrees, ""I think, I see what you mean. Yeah... we can agree to disagree as friends on some issues.""

Avoid oppositional or insulting words. You will not want to say ""You're crazy/stupid/foolish/speaking nonsense"", or use profanity or loud talk. Anger, silent treatment, avoiding each other and being spiteful will get you nowhere.

, Once you have revealed to your parents why you support the Republicans, it is equally important that you respectfully listen to your parents when they explain why they support the democrats. In order to be able to accept the fact that you may have opposing views from your parents, you need to allow them to express their perspectives, and you might understand how they came to those views (but not necessarily). You will likely realize, over time, that their perspective is personal, as it is grounded in their own experiences and outlook on the world. Peaceful, effective communication, on any issue, requires respectful listening skills. You will be better equipped to maintain your own political views if you have a reasonably accurate understanding of why your views differ from your parents'., Even though you do not support the same political concepts as your parents, you may be able to find issues that you can agree on. Many people hold conservative views on some issues, moderate ones on others, and liberal views on another area. For example, you may agree or disagree with your parents about abortion or pro-life issues, but find that you agree with them when it comes to same-sex or traditional marriage issues. By primarily accentuating the common political beliefs you can help bridge or avoid widening the gap between you and your parents. This will make it easier for you to maintain your Republican views., If your parents are upset because you do not share their opinions and political views, then you can calmly explain to them that it is your right to freely choose which candidates and issues to support.


Tell them you will always respect their views, and that they should respect your views as well. It is important that your parents understand that you have developed your own opinions based on your life experiences and they should respect your rights.
You may find that your parents will respect the fact that you are independent, strong-willed, and think for yourself, rather than letting other people manipulate your views and opinions."
"
Decide if you can ""not"" discuss politics with your parents.,
Find others with whom you share similar political views.,
Become involved with the Republican party if that is of interest.",How to Maintain Republican Views if Your Parents Like Democrats3," Some people will openly dispute and even discriminate against people who do not share the same political views. The reason for this is that many people tie their political concepts to their own personal identity. Any attack against a political view, therefore, becomes a personal attack. If this is the case with either your parents or yourself, it is probably best to avoid continuing to talk about politics with them (and others with whom you strongly disagree). Because political issues can be very polarizing you do not want your political differences to drive a wedge within your family and your associates. By avoiding political discussions with your parents you can more comfortably maintain your own political views while enjoying a strong and healthy relationship with your parents.Be prepared to say: I love you, but we obviously do not see eye-to-eye politically. Let's just avoid the topic of politics, at least until this election is over.'

Avoiding politics can be ""peacekeeping"", if you have already attempted to discuss your differing political views in an calm and civil manner.

, If your parents refuse to discuss your political views with you, then perhaps some of your conservative friends, colleagues, or teachers, etc. may be more open to discussions. You might want to locate people who share similar political views as you, and save political discussions for when you are with them.

, You can also help to maintain your Republican views despite familial differences, by becoming active within the party. For example, you could try volunteering for the Republican Party during an election campaign. In this role you will get to meet and communicate with like-minded individuals which can help to strengthen and reinforce your own political views."
"
Wear thick socks so you don't make too much noise.,
Wear dark clothing.,
If you get caught while still inside your house, give an excuse like you wanted a glass of water or needed to use the bathroom.,
Make sure you practice sneaking around the house and outside.,
Make sure you check the weather forecast.,
Wear pajamas over your real clothes just in case you get caught and your parents find out you're going somewhere.

,
Make sure your siblings and parents and pets are asleep.,
Make sure you never carry any weapons if you're going outside.,
Pull yourself together.,
Make sure you put a rope ladder in your room, if you are planning to sneak outside but your room is close to your parents room.,
Make sure you are prepared.,
Make sure you are prepared for when somebody comes in your room at night when you're outside.,
Make sure you are positively silent.

,
Make sure you know when your parents are getting up and when they are going to bed.

",How to Sneak Around at Night (for Kids)," If you have slippery floors, go barefoot, or opt for socks that have rubber grips on the bottom. Try not to tip-toe or you will make noises if you're staying inside. Wear dark colored slippers or boots.;
, Do not wear shorts or t-shirts. Preferably a dark hoodie and pants. Do not wear black! Black sounds like a good idea, but it is not. Dark blue is a good idea.


If you are going outside, wear dark blue or purple. This will help you blend in with the shadows more.

, But don't use the same excuse over and over again. Using the same excuse makes it seem kind of suspicious.

, Find any spots where the wood squeaks or you could trip or fall inside, and outside find any dangerous spots you might not be able to see at night like a ditch or a river nearby.

, Wear warm clothing if it will rain or if it is windy. You don't want to wear something too light because it might be cold at night.

,, If they are awake and ask why you came into their room, say you were coming in to say goodnight.

, The cops might find you and arrest you for having a gun, regardless of your age. But don't worry, bring a walking stick or get one to protect yourself, you can't be arrested for having a stick.

, If you see a spider in the house and feel like running for the swatter or screaming ""Spider, spider!"", don't. Be brave and face fears like the dark or insects. But paranoia can also be your friend: Don't go out if you feel it's a dangerous area, like if you live in the middle of the city.

, Hide it in your room during the day and stuff a pillow at the bottom cracks in your door to muffle out all sounds. Then tie the rope to a bed or dresser leg and lower yourself down. Then fully shut the window and pop the screen back in. Or leave the window ajar if it's safe, as you want to get back inside! If your room is on the bottom floor, you don't need a rope. Just step out of the window.

, Use a rope or ladder that was hidden in your room during the day. If your window is really screechy then make sure you rub wax, Vaseline, or a candle on the part where the window slides and screeches because it will make it glide smoother. Make sure if you're planning to come back in from the front or back door then unlock the front or back door (the door you want to come back in by) when everyone goes to bed. But if somebody wakes up and locks it, it's good to not lock your window when you leave. House-keys can be noisy and hard to use sometimes.


If you are going outside, be sure to bring a flashlight.

, Put pillows and stuffed animals under the cover so it looks like you're still there and leave a note that says you are under the blankets so do not disturb. Also you could really fool them by putting some doll hair that looks like yours at the opening and a voice recording of you snoring to really fool them!

Throw away your garbage.,
Dust the room.,
Make your bed.,
Sort your clothes.,
Pick up books and toys.",How to Help Around the House1," Sometimes you might get lazy and let garbage or unnecessary stuff pile up around your room. Get a garbage bag and go around your room. Put everything that you could throw away in there.It can be very helpful to have a little garbage can in your room for you to throw things away into. Make sure you clean it out when it gets full.
Not only will this make your room less cluttered, but garbage also attracts bugs and other pests. Plus it smells. Getting rid of it will make your room smell better.;
, You can use an old rag, or a nicer wipe, and wipe all the dust off the top of your furniture. You’ll probably find a lot of dust on places like nightstands, dressers, and your desk if you have one., Clear off everything that isn’t your sheets and blanket. Tuck your sheets under the corners with “hospital corners” for a neat look. Place your blanket on top and smooth it down, then fold down the top of the blanket and sheet down. Then you can put back on your pillows or anything else you like to keep on your bed.


A good time to make your bed is first thing in the morning. That way you will remember to do it right away. Also, it will make sure that the only time your bed isn’t made is when you are sleeping in it.Your bedsheets should be washed every couple of weeks, so make sure to strip your bed when your parents ask to make sure they stay clean.

, You always want to keep your clothes neat so they will look good when you wear them, and so you know where they are. If you have clothes lying around the room, sort them into clean clothes and laundry. That will help decide where they go next.


If your clothes are clean, fold them and hang them up in the closet or put them back in the dresser where they belong.
If your clothes are dirty, gather them up, and take them to the laundry room. If your parents let you, you can even do the laundry, and clean your clothes yourself. Just make sure to check with them first. Once they are clean, fold them and put them away properly in your room.

, If you have items lying around your room, get them off the floor and find some place to put them away. If they are just lying on the floor, it can be tough to move around without stepping on something. Doing that means you could hurt yourself, or break one of your toys, or both.


Don’t just throw things into a pile in your closet. That only moves the mess to another part of your room. Make sure you have a shelf or chest to put things in before starting. If you don’t have enough room for all of your stuff, you may want to ask for something else to store them in, or consider getting rid of stuff you don’t use or play with anymore.

Talk to your parents about their rules.,
Acknowledge what causes your bad behavior.,
Avoid trouble at school.,
Don’t argue with your parents.,
Make peace with your siblings.,
Respect your parents’ home.",How to Behave Well at Home1," Perhaps you have been getting in trouble a lot lately at home and are unsure of why. Or maybe you feel that your parent’s rules feel unfair to you at times. If this is the case, talk to your parents about their restrictions and why they find them important. There could be underlying factors at play that you don’t know exist that will help you understand them and their rules better. This is also a time for them to understand you better.Say something like “Hey Mom and Dad, I know that I’ve been getting in trouble a lot for breaking my curfew of 10 o’clock by a few minutes. I really want to be a better child and I never want to stress you out or for you to worry about me. But I’ve had the same curfew for a year now, and I was wondering if in the future you would consider extending it to 11, after I’ve proven that I can be home by 10 consistently?”
Perhaps your parents are very strict on you because there are a lot of kids in your area who do drugs or get into fatal car accidents. If so, you can reassure them by being drug free and by driving carefully.;
, Often times, there are certain situations that you can get yourself into that you know will lead to trouble. Take some time to think about occasions that you have gotten into trouble. Work to avoid such behavior and negative circumstances in the future.For example, if you get into trouble nearly every time you hang out with a certain friend, consider spending significantly less time with that friend. You can also try to talk to the friend so that you both can be better friends to each other and avoid trouble.

, One other way to be good at home is to be good at school. No parent wants to hear the news that their child has been disruptive at school, and doing so can almost guarantee that your parents will be upset and disappointed in you. Work to be good at school and avoid issues so your parents never get a bad report.


Review your school’s handbook as far as conduct policies as well as the classroom policies that your teachers have on an individual level. Follow these rules and you will avoid punishment.

, Another issue that many parents have is frustration when their children argue or talk back to them. You must remember that you are the child, even if you are in high school, and your parents are the authority figure over you. Though you may enjoy a close and even friendly relationship with them, they are still your parents and they are deserving of respect. Therefore, if you disagree with them about something, present your issue respectfully and without arguing.


For example, if your parent won’t allow you to go to the mall with your friends, accept their decision. You can say something like “I know you said I can’t go to the mall with my friends, and I accept your decisions as my parent, but I do still want to go. If you change your mind, please let me know. Also, if there is any way you’d feel more comfortable with me going, could we talk about that?""
In the future, ask them a bit in advance so they have more time to think about it, and don’t demand an answer right away.
Never under any circumstances tell your parents that you hate them.

, You may get into a lot of trouble at home stemming from fights with your brothers and sisters. These fights, however, can typically be avoided. Sit down with your siblings and have a talk about ending the issues between you, and discuss ways to avoid fights should tempers begin to flare.For instance, you should always take a minute to calm down once your sibling has done something to upset you. Walk away for a moment, gather your thoughts, and then return to have a talk
Never hit your sibling under any circumstances.

, Always remember that you are living under your parents’ roof, not vice versa. Your parents probably work hard to provide a home, food and clothing for you and want nothing more than for you to be taken care of. Respect the things that they have given to you and the rules that they have put in place. When you are older and have your own home, you will be able to set your own rules.For instance, don’t play your music too loud.
Keep your room reasonably neat.
Take care of the things they have given you.
Don’t invite friends over without checking with them first.

"
Finish your chores.,
Be a good student.,
Obey household rules.,
Treat siblings or pets with respect and take care of them if applicable.,
Respect your parents’ viewpoint on issues.,
Answer your phone when your parents call and return their texts.,
Save your money.",How to Prove to Your Parents You Can Look After Yourself1," If you are asking for more privileges from your parents, you need to demonstrate that they can depend on you. One way to do this is by completing your household chores and responsibilities on time.Complete your chores before you need to be reminded of them.
Be good-natured about helping around the house. If you complain the whole time you’re cleaning your room, for example, your work won’t be as appreciated.;
, An easy way to build trust with your parents is to do well in school. By taking care to finish your assignments on time and study as much as you can, you will show that you take your education seriously and are preparing to be a responsible adult.

, By respecting the rules they already have in place, you can show your parents that you understand limits and respect their viewpoint.Come home by your curfew. If your curfew is 11:30, don’t show up at 11:45. Staying out just 15 minutes after your designated time shows that you aren’t trustworthy.Respect their limits on screen time.
Don't have friends over when your parents aren't home, if that is one of their rules.

, Any help you can offer around the house will be welcomed by your parents, and it will demonstrate again how responsible and mature you are. You can offer to help younger siblings with homework or watch them while your parents run errands. Additionally, you could be the primary person for making sure your pet is fed and exercised daily.

, Despite the fact that you want to assert your independence, you can still learn from your parents’ experiences and perspectives.


When they offer advice or constructive criticism of your behavior or choices, don’t immediately become defensive and argue with them. Rather, you can ask them why they feel the way they do and try to see things from their perspective.
Additionally, you can ask for their opinions when you are making difficult decisions or trying to solve a problem. They will be happy that you asked for their help, and they’ll be impressed that you are trying to solve your problems in a mature way.

, You can show your parents you respect them by responding promptly to their efforts to contact you. Being in contact with them also shows them that you are dependable and trustworthy.

, One way to demonstrate that you are maturing and looking towards the future is to be frugal and save money when possible. If you are asking your parents to allow you to study abroad or travel with a friend for the weekend, you need to show them that you can handle money responsibly.Set up a savings account at a local bank.
Track your spending and savings with an online app, like Mint or Pocket Money. Apps like these allow you to set up simple budgets and savings goals, and they can send you alerts when balances drop below a certain level. These will help you as you work to save money and work toward future goals."

Ask other people if they need help.,
Set the table for meals.,
Do the dishes.,
Clean the floor.,
Take out the trash.,
Get the mail and newspaper.,
Clean up after yourself.,
Ask for regular chores.",How to Help Around the House2," Sometimes people, including your parents and siblings, won’t always ask for your help. Instead, you can keep an eye out to see if they might need it. For example, if your dad comes home with groceries, ask if you can help carry them into the house. Or, if your mom is cooking, ask if she needs you to do anything else that will help get dinner ready.


Your family may tell you they don’t need your help, and that’s okay. The important thing is that you thought to ask, which they will appreciate., Make sure you have all the plates, cups, and utensils you will need to eat your meal. You can also look up proper ways to set the table or fold napkins for something nicer and more creative to look at.After meals are over, you can also be helpful by clearing the table. Get all the dishes and silverware into the sink or dishwasher for cleaning.

, After meals, you need to clean off dishes and make sure they get put away. Nobody likes cleaning the dishes, so you can really help your parents out after they’ve put in a lot of work to make meals.


Start by scraping off all food scraps, which will make the dishes easier to clean. Remember to use warm water and soap to clean off the whole dish. Clean all the dishes, silverware, cups, anything that you used to eat or make food with.
Remember to clean food scraps out of the sink drain when you are finished. Throw them away so they don’t clog the drain.
Empty the dishwasher. If your house has a dishwasher, unload it after it finishes. Just give it a few minutes to cool down first, as dishes can be hot. You don’t want to accidentally burn yourself.
Be careful when handling sharp objects like knives and other utensils. If you aren’t careful, you can cut yourself, so always pick things up by the handle, and watch where you are reaching., Dirt, dust, crumbs, and other things gather on the floor and can attract bugs. Help by sweeping up crumbs into a dustpan and throwing them away. This is especially important after meals, both where you ate, but also where you or your parents made the food.If you are older, and your parents let you, use a vacuum to help give the floors a better clean.

, Taking the garbage bag to a can or bin outside lets someone come and take it away. This is an easy chore, even for young kids. If you notice the trash can getting full, especially in the kitchen or bathroom, take it outside. Just remember to replace it with a new one., These usually come once a day, though there is no mail on Sundays. It can be a quick walk down to your mailbox to grab whatever you got for the day.Don’t hide bad news or bad grades. This is not a chance for you to keep your parents from seeing stuff like that.

, If you make a mess somewhere, or you are trying to do things like cooking or projects on your own, take care of it yourself. This can mean garbage, crumbs, a spill, or dirty dishes. Cleaning up where you were is a good way to show your parents that you are mature and responsible.


There are plenty of other types of messes that can appear around the house. Piles of books, papers, clothes, toys, and dishes can appear at any time. You can be a big help by cleaning them up.

, There will always be plenty of things that need to get done around the house, including stuff you might not think about. Asking for a set of regular chores can be a good way to make sure you are helping things to get done. It will also be easier on your parents because they won’t have to remember to ask you to do something, you will just know to do it.


Doing regular chores is good for you too. It will help give you a sense of responsibility, and prepare you for the things you will need to do when you are older and don’t live you’re your parents anymore.You can help here by giving your parents suggestions of things you would like to do. These can be chores you know you would be good at, or things you would like to get better at doing. In talking with your parents, you may decide that you will have a set list of chores, or maybe you will rotate a list of chores with your siblings.
Create a chore chart. This is a good way to help everyone remember what you are supposed to be doing. The chart should explain what you need to be working on, and how often you should do it. For example, setting the table could be every day, but taking out the garbage would only happen once a week. You can even be creative with the chart, and make something that has fun designs and ways of checking things off. Just remember that it needs to make sense to everyone who uses it.Remember that chores may not always be divided fairly. If your siblings are too young to do something, you will need to do it until they are old enough. The important thing is to not whine about it, and do what needs to be done.

Feed your pet.,
Clean your pet’s home.,
Play with your pet.,
Take your pet for a walk.,
Clean your pet.",How to Help Around the House3," Like you, your pet needs to eat regularly, so make sure he gets his meals on schedule. Make sure you know what kind of food your pet should get, how much of it, and when he should be fed.You should only feed him proper pet food, so no table scraps or treats.
Don’t forget to make sure your pet also has a supply of clean water. If the dish still has water in it, but it looks dirty, rinse it out and refill it.
This is a good thing to talk about with your whole family, so everyone knows who is supposed to feed your pets and when. You don’t want to overfeed or underfeed him.

, If your pet lives in a cage or tank, make sure you clean it regularly. Replace newspaper in the bottom of bird, rodent, and reptile cages, change the bulbs in heat lamps for reptiles, and clean out the water in fish tanks so that your pet has a comfortable place to live.If you have a place for your pet to use the bathroom, whether in the cage or a litter box, make sure you clean that out regularly as well.

, Your pet is part of your family, and you should want to spend time with him. This is especially important for active animals like dogs, but also smaller pets like mice or hamsters.Even cats will want some time with family members, so go ahead and pet him or let him curl up with you for a nap.
Make sure you keep an eye on your pets, especially if they are smaller. You don’t want a gerbil or lizard getting loose in the house.
Be nice and friendly to your pets. If you are mean or aggressive, your pets won’t like that. They will either become more aggressive to you, which could mean biting or scratching, or they will become afraid, and not want to play with you., This is another great way to spend time with your pets for exercise, and one less chore for your parents to do. Make sure you have a leash or other equipment to keep a hold of your pet so he doesn’t run away or get into trouble.


If you have a dog, or another pet that needs to use the bathroom outside, remember to bring a bag so you can pick up his poop to throw away., If your pet has fur or hair, he’ll need a good grooming. Brush or comb him everyday to help get rid of loose or shedding hair, and give him a nice clean look.When you comb through hair, make sure to check for fleas and ticks, as well as anything else that might be stuck in your pet’s coat. If you see a tick you can try to get it off yourself, or ask your parents for help. Just make sure your parents know you found the tick, so they can call the vet if something needs to happen.
You may be able to bathe your dog or cat as well. This can be tough, as your pet may not want a bath, or enjoy splashing. Make sure your parents know you want to give yours a bath. Just don’t overdo it. Once a month for dogs, or once every few months for cats, should be enough.
For rodents and reptiles, pets that live in cages, keeping the cage clean should be enough. You don’t need to wash them.

You should always complete your chores without having to be reminded.

, Your parents may come home each day from work and ask to see your homework so they can check it. Make sure that you are completing your homework each day after getting home from school so that your parents don’t have to stress about unfinished work.

This will signal to your parents that you are responsible and are becoming more mature, and they will likely trust you more and think of you more favorably. If you know how to do certain things that your siblings usually rely on your parents for, you can step in occasionally to help.


For instance, if your mom or dad usually gets your sibling a snack at night, you can get it for them some nights instead.
You can also help them with their hair or when they pick out their clothes. Ask them if they want help first, though.

, Even if your parents make rules that you think are strict or perhaps even a bit harsh, you should always obey them. Many issues can be avoided if you heed the wise instruction of your parents.

Offer to babysit your siblings.,
Consider getting a part time job.,
Show empathy and understanding to your parents.,

Do a few extra loads of laundry when you have time or wash the dishes if you see some in the sink.

, Your parents very likely do nice things for you often, probably even more than you notice. Take some time to think about ways to return the favor, but also to show your parents how much you love and appreciate them for all that they do. This is a great way to go beyond just being good at home, but to show your parents how much their own goodness is important to you.For instance, you could write your parents a letter expressing your love for them.
You could bake them a batch of cookies or save up your money to buy them a gift.

, If your parents are together and both are working, they may find it hard to find the time to go out on a date with one another like they did before you were born. If you are old enough, suggest babysitting your younger siblings so your parents can have some time to themselves. They will appreciate the gesture and you will be able to spend time with your brothers and sisters., Extra money helps out any household. If you are age 16 or older, consider getting a part time job if your parents consent. This job will not only provide you with spending money so you have to ask your parents less often, it will also make you more responsible and will give you skills that are important for the workforce. Your parents will appreciate you taking this initiative and it will give you an opportunity to get out of the house for a bit.


Consider looking for employment at the mall or at a restaurant.
You can also babysit kids in your neighborhood or do errands for your neighbors.

You may be your parents’ first child, and while they are always doing what they think is best, they don’t have all the answers. Know that and don’t take it out on them when you feel that they are being unfair or unreasonable.


Put yourself in their shoes and imagine what you would do if you had a child. Think of how protective you would be.
Be thoughtful. You can do this in small ways like not leaving the bathroom floor wet after you take a shower, as well as in larger ways like giving your parents some space after a long day at work.

, There will never be anyone or anything more important in life than your family. Remember that your parents’ love for you is deeper than anyone else’s that you know, more than your friends, and more than your significant other if you have one.

After you submit your application or resume, follow up with the hiring manager a few days later, either in person or by phone.

, You may be able to find an internship that is related to the new freedom you are seeking. For example, if you want to study art abroad in Italy, you could try to intern at a local art museum. This could help prove to your parents that you truly are interested in studying art, and it may help your case.


Many businesses and non-profit organizations utilize interns for a variety of tasks.
Call the business or organization, and ask to speak with the intern coordinator. If they don’t have one, you could just speak with someone in the human resources department.

If you want to stay home alone for a weekend, plan out how you would spend your time. Learn about what you would do in emergency situations and how you could keep yourself safe in your parents’ absence.

Show them how responsible you are.,
Show them what you’ve learned about the privilege you’re seeking.,
React well if they say no.",How to Prove to Your Parents You Can Look After Yourself3," Giving a child more freedoms and privileges is a big step for parents. If you ask for their advice or involvement in the process, they may be more willing to take your side.Ask them to help you do more research on the topic. Say something like, “I would like to drive with my friend to visit her sister at college. Can you help us figure out how long that would take and what the best route would be?”
You could also say something such as, “I really think I want to pursue a Ph.D. in art history. Can you help me figure out which study abroad program would be most beneficial for helping me reach this goal?”

, It’s not a good idea to ask your parents for new privileges as you’re all trying to get to school or work on time. By having a calm discussion with them, you’re more likely to convince them to see your side.


Figure out a time to talk with them when you will not be rushed.
If you have younger siblings, try to talk when they are not home. That way, you won’t be distracted or interrupted.

, By getting right to the point, you can more quickly start to explain to your parents what you want and why you think you deserve that new privilege. Stay calm and be respectful during your conversation.


Say something like, “Mom and dad, I’m getting older, and I think I’ve shown I’m responsible enough to have my curfew extended.”
Another approach could be, “I’ve really gotten interested in French history and culture through my French classes at school, I would like to study in Paris next year to really immerse myself in the culture.”
You could also remind them of how they could help themselves by granting you new freedoms: “I think you would have a better time at your cousin’s wedding if you made it a romantic weekend. I am happy to stay home by myself for a few days while you get away and relax.”

, Take time during the discussion to show your parents how much you have matured recently, whether through improving your grades or volunteering at an animal hospital. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, sometimes everyone forgets to notice the changes going on around them.


You could show them how much your bank account has grown recently through your dedication to saving and/or your part-time job.
Be sure to remind them of all you have done recently around the house to make your home a better place.
If you’ve recently improved your math grade, make it a point to tell your parents during this discussion. Anything you can add about your added maturity and sense of responsibility will help you.

, If you let them know that you’ve taken the time to research and think about what you’re asking for, they will be more likely to take your request seriously.


Use your research to say something like, “I know it will be expensive for me to study in Paris next year, but here’s how I plan to pay for most of it.” Or, you could take another approach, “Studies show that those who study abroad have an increased chance of attending graduate school.”
If your request involves extending your curfew, say something like, “Mom and dad, the concert I want to attend ends later than my curfew. The concert venue is in a safe location, and I will be with several friends. I think that I deserve an extended curfew because I know how to be safe and I will be responsible.”

, Despite all of your planning and persuasive efforts, your parents may not agree to additional freedoms or privileges for you just yet.


Calmly ask about their objections. You could say, “I’m really disappointed that you feel this way. Why do you think this is a bad idea?”
Don’t yell or cry; that response will further convince them you are not mature enough for extended privileges.
Ask what you can do to prove to them you are ready for this step. You could say something such as, “I understand you think I’m not ready to travel alone yet, but can we talk about this in a month or two? I think I’ll be able to show you that I’m responsible and ready for this privilege before we discuss this again.”

Put away your phone or other electronics and make room for them on the sofa if you are sitting in the same room.
If you are using the TV or listening to music when they come over, turn it off. The background noise can be distracting and make it appear like you don't really care about their presence.

Your parents friends' will probably ask questions of you, too. Be sure to give them genuine answers. If they ask how school is going, don't just reply, ""Fine."" Mention a project you recently completed or a book you read for class that you enjoyed.
Use polite language. Don't use profanity or other harsh language. You might think this makes you look mature, but it really is just off-putting.

Be yourself.",How to Behave In Front of Your Boyfriend's Parents2," Talk to your boyfriend well before the meeting and ask what his parents like and don't like. He should also be able to tell you some favorite subjects you can talk about and topics to steer clear of.


Things you might want to find out: Where are his parents from? What kind of work do they do? What do they like to do in their spare time?
Make sure you find out conversation topics to avoid in order to prevent a foot-in-mouth moment. For example, you might not want to talk about the expensive cruise your family just went on when your boyfriend’s parents are having money problems., Make eye contact and use body language, such as nodding and leaning toward the speaker, to indicate you are interested in what they are saying.

, Most people love to talk about themselves. Try to get his parents talking by asking about their lives, or to tell you more about their children. Ask them to share a funny story about your boyfriend as a child.Ask open-ended questions. Questions that require more than a yes or no answer are ways to continue the conversation. Try saying, “Tell me more about that” or “What was that like?”, If you need to correct his parents on something, be respectful and polite. Don’t act like a know-it-all, and do not engage in an argument.


You could say, “I’ve also heard this perspective…” or “You know, I just read about this! The article said.....” which can help take the heat off you while gently offering another perspective.
Do not say things like, “You’re wrong,” or “How can you even think that?”
Don’t act like a know-it-all. People do not like lectures, they prefer conversations. Make sure you are allowing others to share their opinions, even if you are an expert on a subject. , It is easier to talk to people you don’t know well when you have some common ground. See if his parents share any of the same interests as yours, and start a conversation about that.For example, say you and his father are baseball fans. Ask which teams he supports, if he’s been to any games this season, and if there are any players he’s been impressed with this year.
Steer clear of controversial topics like politics or religion. Remember that movies, TV, and music are generally easy discussion topics to which everyone can contribute.

, His parents will likely also want to learn about you, too. Share about your childhood, your education, career goals, and family life.


Be careful not to overshare. Especially in the early days of your relationship, it’s probably not a good idea to unload on his parents about the problems you have with your family, for example.

, Remember, your boyfriend is with you because of who you are. Make sure that his family gets to know what makes you so unique, too! While it is important to be polite and respectful to your boyfriend’s family, don’t feel like you need to shove your entire personality in a box whenever you are around them.


Share your interests with his family, whether it is your fondness for baking or your unapologetically dorky love for sci-fi movies. Your enthusiasm will help them get to know you better.
If you have a good sense of humor, try to make them laugh (with appropriate jokes). If you love children, spend time with his younger cousins. Let his family get to know the real you.
If your true personality includes of lots of swear words, make sure you make efforts to stop swearing in front of his family. Many people find swearing unpleasant, and many people also believe it makes a person look less intelligent."

Offer to clean up or help.,
Offer to pay your own way.,
Get to know his other family members.,
Keep your hands to yourself.,
Respect his family time.",How to Behave In Front of Your Boyfriend's Parents3," If they have invited you for a home-cooked meal, offer to do the dishes or help prepare the food. See if there is a side dish or dessert you could bring.


Offer to help with family projects. If your boyfriend’s family is outside raking leaves, ask if they need any help. If you are there for a family birthday party, blow up balloons or help set out the snacks.

, If his family invites you somewhere, offer to pay your own way. They might not take you up on it, but it is polite to extend the offer.


You could also offer to treat for a portion of the outing. You could say, “Thanks so much for taking me ice skating! Could I treat everyone to some hot chocolate?”
Be sure to thank them for inviting you and for treating you to the activity. You could say, “Thanks so much for such a fun evening, and thank you for treating me to dinner. I really appreciate it.”

, Don’t just monopolize your boyfriend. Get to know his siblings, too, or other extended family. It will make spending time with his family more fun if you have built relationships with the rest of his family.For example, if his little sister admires the necklace you made, tell her the next time you come over, you’ll bring your jewelry kit and help her make one.
Talk to his older relatives about their lives and memories. Find out from your boyfriend if anyone has interesting stories to tell, and then talk to them. You could say, “Jack told me that you worked for NASA in the 1980s. What did you do? What was that like?”, No PDA (Public Displays of Affection) in front of his family. Holding his hand is okay, but refrain from doing much beyond that. It’s disrespectful to his family.Make sure your boyfriend keeps his hands off you, too. Before you go into his parents’ house, you could say, “I don’t want to make your parents uncomfortable, so please don’t do anything more than hold my hand, okay?”

, Don’t expect to be invited everywhere. Understand that he gets to spend time with them without you, and don’t try to invite yourself to every activity. Let your boyfriend or his parents extend an invitation to you instead.While you may want to be included in his family’s holiday plans, respect their wishes if they choose to keep significant others out of their celebrations. Different families have different boundaries around what “family” means.

Build good feelings with your parents.,
Spend time with your parents.,
Make compromises about the things you disagree on.,
Stay calm when arguments brew.,
Apologize when you're in the wrong.,
Communicate frequently.,
Be a positive force in the household.,
Give hugs.",How to Have a Healthy Bond with Your Parents," This is something that you can play a big role in, just by being a helpful, considerate and well-mannered member of the household. Things that can contribute towards good feelings include:


Being polite and respectful when talking to your parents.
Using good manners in the house and when out and about with your parents.
Being friendly rather than spiky or challenging. Friendliness opens pathways to communications rather than shuts them down.
Caring about your parent's feelings and their well-being.;
, If you feel as if you aren't seeing much of your parents, or if you've been distancing yourself from them, make a change by suggesting that you all spend more time together. Enjoy quality time when you really do engage with each other, talking and sharing ideas, thoughts and notions.


Ask your parents to set aside some time, once or twice a week where you can spend some quality time with each parent individually.
Make use of car time to talk openly with your driver parent about your life and interests, and their life and interests.
Look forward to spending time together; see this as an opportunity to learn more about one another and to build closeness.
Choose activities that both of you enjoy doing. Find a common hobby, a common interest or a common activity.

, Human beings are not all cut from the same cloth, even those who are genetically related. Simply because your parents view things one way, does not make it that you'll agree with that view. And that's fine, because it's how human civilization progresses, through diversity of opinions and outlooks. However, there is also a need to get along and to respect each other's differences. To this end, learn the art of compromise and finding a middle ground that is acceptable to both you and your parents on those issues about which you do not see eye to eye.


You might use making a compromise as an opportunity to say that you will do more for them if they step back on you a little bit.

, Conflict is part and parcel of human relationships, and it's impossible for life to be completely conflict-free. The trick is to learn how to manage conflict better and use it as an opportunity to constructively air grievances and dislikes, without riling people or attacking them personally. Since your parents are the closest persons to you when you live at home, they present the perfect opportunity to learn how to deal with conflict constructively. Keep calm, reiterate your points without anger or resentment and be prepared to make the aforementioned compromises.


There is a difference between conflict and abuse. If you are constantly living in a negative household where fear and abuse rule the roost, seek help from other family members or a trusted outside.

, This is a part of being responsible and owning up to the things you haven't quite done the way you should have or the things which have harmed the dignity and well-being of those you live with. Not only is this part of maturing and becoming a fully fledged person ready for adulthood but it is also about nurturing good relationships with the people you care about. A simple sorry may feel hard to say sometimes but it's often the simplest way to resolve rising tension.


Realize that saying sorry is not the same as giving in, giving up power, losing face or feeling ashamed. Sorry is simply about being a responsible person; it does not belittle or undermine you, in fact, it proves how strong a person you really are.
In turn, be accepting of your parent's limitations. You will already be well enough aware of these, since you live with them and see their actions daily. This proves that your parents make mistakes, just like everyone else. Help them to know that you are aware of this and that you are both understanding and forgiving. Be willing to move forward together, encouraging them to say sorry too, when it's truly needed.

, Tell your parents what is happening in your life, in your head and in your relationships. Part of building trust is feeling able to freely share the things you're experiencing and thinking about. You'll know when it's TMI, but up to that point, be as open as it's sensible to be. In turn, your parents will find it easier to talk to you and will likely open up about their experiences more, and will offer you the wonderful advice from experience that can only come from being older.


Good communications include using good manners. Saying thank you and recognizing the kind and caring things your parents have done for you never goes astray!
Listen more. It's commonplace to want to share your side of the story, but interrupting and talking over others is a form of thoughtlessness. Moreover, closing down when asked to do chores that don't interest you is frustrating for a parent. Listen well, respond to show that you've heard and things will run far more smoothly than ever, freeing up whining time to do more interesting things!

, Communicate good feelings as much as you share the lows and annoyances of your day. Seek to compliment others in the household, including your siblings, to see the best in them all. Your parents will appreciate the goodwill and kindness you are bringing into the household and will feel compelled to live up the example too.

, Show your parents affection on a regular basis. They love to know that you care about them and that they've done a good job raising you. A hug now and then will help them to feel connected to you in a way that words can never really express.

Get to safety.,
Keep a phone nearby.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Distract yourself.",How to Protect Yourself from Violent Parents1," If you live with violent parents, getting yourself somewhere safe should be your number one priority. Identify places where you feel safe such as a friend's house, a relative's, your school, a shelter, or anywhere you feel protected, and go there.It should be a place where there are other people who can care for you and keep you safe. Let them know why you are there and what is happening at home.


If you can't leave the house, and your parents are being emotionally abusive to you, go to your room and close the door.
If you feel you are in immediate physical danger and you cannot get out of the house, then you should make yourself as protected as possible. Barricade your door, lock the windows, and hide if it makes you feel safer. Call Emergency Services and wait for the authorities to arrive.
If you can leave the house, but are unsure of where to go, make your way to the nearest police station.;
, Your greatest tool in protecting yourself will be your ability to call for help or talk to someone you trust. Make sure that you keep your phone with you at all times. If your parents take away your phone frequently, have a pre-paid phone hidden somewhere you can get to it easily. If you are worried about your safety or the safety of others in your home, call the Emergency Services. Make no hesitation to do this, it not only will help you, but will help everyone in your home as well.


In addition to use your phone to call Emergency Services you can also use it to call domestic abuse hotlines, or helplines such as 1-800-4-A-CHILD., If your parents are violent with you, you should talk to an adult you trust about it. In situations like this, the child often does not notify anyone because there is fear and shame involved. If you are fearful or afraid of your parents, that is a big sign that something is wrong. You need to talk to someone for help. Remind yourself that you didn't do anything wrong. Try talking to multiple adults such as friends, other trusted family members, guidance counselors, teachers, or doctors.

, Living with your violent parents has a lot of challenges. One of them may be the inability to leave the house when you are upset. It may help to distract yourself while you are around them, until you can get somewhere where you can talk to someone. This may be especially helpful if your parents are mentally or emotionally abusive to you or towards each other. Try the following activities to help distract yourself.


Write in a journal. Writing will help protect your emotional health and help deal with the negativity your parents send your way. Your journal is a place you can express whatever you are thinking or feeling without consequence.Listen to music. If you parents are frequently fighting with each other, that can be upsetting to hear. Try distracting yourself with some headphones and your favorite music.
Engage in an activity that you enjoy such as art, movies, or reading. It may help you take a break from what you are struggling with, even if just for a little while.

Set boundaries.,
Get your parent the care they need.,
Attend a support group.",How to Protect Yourself from Violent Parents2," As an adult, you have more control over your relationship with your violent parent or parents. Being more independent from your parents affords you different options for handling interactions with them. As an adult you have an opportunity to set boundaries with your parents and detach with love in order to protect yourself.When setting boundaries, keep the following in mind.


Be clear and direct when setting your boundaries with your parent.
Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements when explaining what is happening and why.
If the conversation becomes violent or abusive state, “I deserve to be treated with respect. This conversation is over.”

, If you are a caretaker for your parent, the situation may call for involvement of other professionals or agencies. It may be necessary to consider assisted living or facility placement for your parent. Some conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, can make otherwise nonviolent people violent. If your parent's condition is worsening and you need more than just a break from them, you should think about putting your parent in a facility where they can receive constant care.


Alternatively, it may be beneficial for you to involve respite care. Getting respite care allows you to take a break from caring for your violent parent and helps to prevent elder abuse.However, respite care does not provide an ultimate solution, only a break from your parent.

, While you are working on setting boundaries and determining the level of care needed for your parent, it may be beneficial for you to have help and support as well. Joining a support group for adult children of abusive parents, may be particularly helpful. Attending a support group may help you discuss or process through the following.


Anger with your parents or with yourself.
Guilt for having to separate yourself from your parents for your own health.
Shame for wanting a relationship with people who have treated you badly.Sadness for the state of the relationship you have with them.
Grief for the loss of the relationship you should have had with them.

Talk to a mental health professional.,
Find resources for children.,
Have a contact plan.,
Have an action plan.,
Build a support network.",How to Protect Yourself from Violent Parents3," The impact of violent parents can be more severe and long-lasting than you might think.Seeking help from a mental health professional will help you deal with the affects of violent parents as well as help you plan for a healthier future. It is especially important to seek mental health care if your parents physically harm you, but is helpful for emotional and mental harm as well. Talking to a mental health professional can help with the following.


Trauma
Low self-esteem
Anxiety
Depression
Developing coping skills

, If you are a child or are trying to help a child, you might run into some barriers because psychologists can only talk to children with the parents' permission. If you are a minor or are trying to get help for a minor, though, you do have some options:


Call a child hotline, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline (1-800-4-A-CHILD). If you are not in the US, look online to find a child abuse hotline in your country.
Call 911 or the police. If you are a child in immediate physical danger, call 911. Talk to the responders yourself and explain what is happening. You can also call the police if you are not in immediate physical danger but would like to speak with law enforcement.
Tell a teacher, nurse, or counselor at school. If you tell one of your teachers or guidance counselors at school, they will be able to help you and direct you to even more resources.
Tell an adult you trust. You can do this in person, on the phone, or in a letter. If you have a friend whose parent you like and trust, for example, tell them about this abuse so that they can help you. You can talk to any adult that you trust, including your friends' siblings and grandparents., Determine the level of contact you wish to have with your parents going forward. If you are a minor this may be a more delicate situation, but an equally important one. If you are an adult, you can make the decision to not let your violent parent be a part of your life for your own mental and emotional health.Deciding the level of contact with your parents has to be an informed decision that ultimately you make for yourself. Some options include:


Going no contact. No contact would be ceasing all contact with your parents. This includes stopping yourself from reading text messages and emails or listening to voicemail messages. Maintaining low contact. Low contact might include limiting phone contact with them to once a week or whatever you are comfortable with. It may also be reducing the physical time you spend with your parents to holidays or special occasions.Having limited contact. Limited contact might include being in contact with your parents only when it is necessary.

, In addition to setting up and enacting a contact plan, you should also have a plan for what you would do should your parents become violent again in the future. Your action plan or safety plan should be specific to you and your circumstances.Your plan ideally should at least include plans for where you will sleep, who will be willing to help you, and what you will say or do should your parents become violent.


If your parents are physically violent with you and you are worried about your safety, you may want to include an emergency bag in your plan as well. An emergency bag will include anything you may need if you have to leave your home in a hurry., There may be a long-lasting feeling or desire that your parents treat you with the loving care you deserve. With violent or toxic parents, gaining that relationship with them is not always possible. It is important that you surround yourself with a strong support system of other family and friends that provide you with the love you are lacking from your parents. Build a support network to include anyone that you trust and feel comfortable talking to about your parents. It should also include individuals who are in your action plan or who can help you.

You want to pick a time and place that allows for open dialogue.Know when your parents are not busy. You want to pick a time to talk when everyone is free of outside obligations. If both your parents are typically home on Tuesday evenings, this may be a great time to talk.
Eliminate distractions. Do not talk with the television on or with your smart phones out. Let your parents know you would like to have a somewhat serious discussions and ask that they leave outside distractions behind.;
, You should go into the conversation with a potential outcome in mind. Think about what solution or compromise you're looking to get out of this conversation. You should also identify your personal feelings about the conversation.Figure out how you feel. You may feel nervous about talking to your parents about spanking. You may worry they'll feel they're being insulted or otherwise disrespected. It's okay to acknowledge you're nervous, but try not to let feelings of apprehension inhibit your ability to have the conversation.
Think about what you want from the conversation. You obviously want your parents to understand why you feel the way you do, so it can help to write out your thoughts ahead of time. It may also help to address some possible solutions to the problem at hand. For example, maybe your parents could agree to cut back on spanking or try alternative types of punishment.

, Explain to your parents on no uncertain terms what your issues are regarding spanking. Be direct about your feelings, as well as changes you would like to make in your relationship.Be brave and start off the conversation by clearly and directly expressing yourself. For example, you can say something like, ""I know you use spanking as a form of punishment a lot, but I feel like I'm getting too old for it. I would like to talk about moving away from spanking as a form of punishment.""
Explain what your opposition to spanking is. Do you feel embarrassed by it? Is it physically painful? Do you feel nervous at the prospect of getting spanked, to the point you're experiencing undue stress?

, It's important to listen as much as you talk in the situation. You do not want your parents to feel attacked or judged. Listen to how your parents explain and defend their behavior. Try to understand so your parents feel heard.Your parents may have reasons for disciplining you the way they do. They may have been spanked as children, and may feel the punishment was effective for them. This may be why your parents have adopted a pro-spanking stance in the present. They also may feel spanking has been effective throughout your childhood to improve your behavior and make you understand the consequences of your actions.
Try to be as mature as possible. Your parents are much more likely to be impressed and receptive if they feel like you're making the effort to hear their side. For example, say something like, ""I appreciate you guys wanting to make sure I grow up with good values. I understand you feel spanking helps me develop as an adult."" Allowing your parents to feel heard during a discussion can help both of you move forward to find an alternative solution.

, There are many ways your parents can discipline you that do not entail spanking. Keep in mind your parents want to see you grow and mature as a child, and may feel spanking can help you become a better person and understand actions have consequences. In order to get your parents to ease up on the spanking, ask them if they'd be willing to try alternative forms of punishment.As your parents want you to use consequences, tell them you'd be happy to accept punishments related to what you did wrong. If you failed to turn in a homework assignment on time, for example, tell your parents you'd be happy to stay in that weekend and do your homework instead of seeing your friends.
You could also ask your parents for less physical forms of traditional punishment, like being sent to your room, over spanking.
Show your parents you're more than willing to accept the consequences for your actions. You would just prefer those consequences not come in a physical manner. If your parents see you genuinely want to learn to behave, they may lighten up on things like spanking as a form of punishment.

, Your parents may not see eye-to-eye with you on the issue of spanking. Unfortunately, your parents may firmly believe in the benefits of spanking to prevent misbehavior and teach you actions have consequences.Your parents may not agree to stop spanking completely. However, if you're mature throughout the conversation, and respectfully express your point of view, they may agree to not use spanking as a primary form of punishment.
If your parents are strict, however, there's a chance they will not want to change their behavior. Try to accept this. In a few months, you can bring up the issue again and see if your parents have changed their minds with time.

, In the event your parents stick to their spanking policy, avoid whining or complaining. If you approach the situation maturely, your parents are far more likely to take your concerns seriously. Throughout the conversation, maintain a mature tone.Your parents are more likely to listen if you remain calm. If you feel frustrated by something that's being said, hold in your emotions for now. Later on, you can punch your pillow or go for a long walk to get out your frustrations.

, One way to prevent spanking is by living up to your parents' expectations. Work on staying organized. This can keep you up-to-date on school assignments, as well as your household chores.Make a list of things you'll need for school and for the coming week. You can do this on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. For example, say you have a book report coming up. You'll need the book your reading, a notebook to take notes, and pens and pencils. You will also need supplies for the final copy, like a cover for your report.
Do a little organizing of your room. Have a separate space for toys, DVDs, computer supplies, and so on. You can use old boxes to help you organize the important items in your home.
You can ask your parents for a calendar in your room. You can use the calendar to mark important dates for school. Mark when tests are coming up and when assignments are due.

, Make sure you do what's expected of you every day. If you stay on task with your chores, your parents will have less reasons to punish you.Try making a list of the chores you have to do each day. You may be expected to clean your room on Saturday, or to do the dishes after dinner on Friday. Meet your parents expectations for your behavior on any given day of the week.
Prioritize how you'll get things done. For example, plan on always doing your homework after school so you know you won't be up late working. You can also incorporate time for small breaks throughout the day to keep you from becoming fatigued. For example, after an hour of math homework, agree to give yourself 15 minutes to listen to music.

, If you have a big task that you need to do, like organizing your room, make a plan. If your parents see you're being responsible and taking initiative when it comes to your chores, they'll have less reason to punish you via spanking.Break big tasks into small chunks. For example, say you have to organize your room. You could break your room down into four sections and plan to tackle one section at a time, taking breaks in between.
Making plans in regards to staying up to date on chores and other obligations can prevent disagreements between you and your parents. This can greatly cut down on the incidents of spanking.

, If you tend to be an emotional person, this can cause outbursts. You may lash out when you're angry, yelling at your parents or fighting with your siblings. These actions could result in spankings. If this is the case, try talking to your school counselor and ask for help developing healthier ways to deal with your emotions. If you can use what you learn to cut down on outbursts, this can result in less spanking.Some strategies your school counselor might recommend include:



Getting more physical exercise. When you're feeling angry or stressed, try going for a walk or a run instead of lashing out.

Writing down your feelings. When you're feeling angry, get a pen and paper and vent in your diary rather than yelling at a family member.

Taking a break. If you're arguing with a parent or sibling, and you begin to get hostile, take a break. Walk away from the situation and take some time to calm down. Go to your room to be alone and read a book. You can better address the issue when you are calm.

, In rare cases, spanking can be a symptom of child abuse. If your parents use spanking heavily, to the point it greatly pains you, you may be in an abusive situation. Learn to recognize the signs of abuse so the situation can be addressed.Spanking may come with other forms of physical violence if you are in an abusive situation. Your parents may also hit, kick, choke, or otherwise physically harm you if angry. These actions may leave marks like bruises or scratches.
Verbal and emotional abuse may also happen in conjunction with physical abuse. Your parents may yell at you, call you mean names, put you down, or threaten to leave you or kick you out. While parent/child arguments are a normal part of growing up, if your parents are constantly berating you in a manner that makes you feel threatened, you may be a victim of emotional abuse.

, If you believe you are being abused, talk about this with a trusted adult. An adult should be able to help you find the resources necessary to cope with the situation.Who you feel comfortable telling will depend on the situation. You may have another adult relative, like an aunt or uncle, you feel close to. You also may be close to a teacher in your school or the parents of a close friend.
Let the person you choose know you need to talk about something in private. If you're unsure whether the spanking qualifies as abuse, simply tell the adult what happened or has been happening. The adult should be able to asses the situation and offer you the necessary help.

, You may not have an adult you feel you can trust in this situation. If you do not know a lot of adults besides your parents, call the hotline 1-800-4-A-CHILD. A crisis worker will be able to help you assess the situation and get you the help you need.If you don't have a cell phone, you may have to wait until your parents are out of the house to use the phone. Make sure you choose a time when your parents will be gone for awhile, as the conversation could be lengthy.

Spend time with her.,
Keep her updated on your life.,
Take her advice seriously.,
Forgive her.",How to Stop Upsetting Your Mom1," As you get older and your life gets busier you will find that you spend less and less time with your mom. Although this is a normal part of life, you should still make time to connect with her. When you are spending time with your mom, be sure to give her your full attention and minimize distractions.If you are still living at home, designate an evening each week to spend time together. You could make dinner together, take a walk, or play a board game.
If you are grown but live close to your mom, consider scheduling time to connect every month by going out for a meal or coffee.
If you are grown and have moved far away, try making an effort to connect with your mom with consistent phone calls or emails.;
, It is often easy to remember to talk to your mom about the bad things that are happening in your life. However, you shouldn’t forget to also share the good details as well. This will help your mom feel more engaged and connected to you.Update her on your relationships and let her know who your friends are.
Keep her updated on your progress at school or work.

, Sometimes you may ask your mom directly for advice. Other times her advice may be unsolicited. Regardless, you should listen to your mom’s advice with an open mind. Even if you don’t do exactly as she suggests, let her know that you have taken her opinion and wisdom into consideration.Your mother will appreciate that you value her opinion and respect her enough to hear her out. If you don’t do this, it is likely to make her feel like you do not care about her or take her seriously.
Understand that if you are still living at home, you might have to listen to your mother in certain situations.

, It is hard to forgive someone when you are hurt and angry. However, if you do not forgive and move on, that hurt and anger will continue to affect you and your relationship with your mother. If this continues for a long period of time, it will cause even more hurt and anger which makes it even harder to forgive and move forward.Let go of petty things.
Forgive her for the bad things that might have happened in your childhood.
Understand that she is not trying to ruin your childhood or make you upset. She just wants what is best for you.

Think before you speak.,
Be an active listener.,
Tell the truth.",How to Stop Upsetting Your Mom2," Don’t react impulsively to things that your mom says that might make you angry or sad. Take a moment to pause and think about what you want to say before you respond. Consider how your words are going to make your mom feel.Take a deep breath.
Ask yourself if what you want to say is really worth saying.

, Don’t just hear what your mom is saying to you, actually listen to her. In order to actively listen you must stop thinking about what you want to say. Focus all of your attention on your mom when she is talking to you.Get rid of any distractions like your cell phone.
Make eye contact and face your body towards your mom.
Don’t interrupt.

, Honesty is the key to a trusting relationship between you and your mom. If you are consistently caught in lies, there is a good chance that your mom will never believe you, even when you are telling the truth. The truth may upset her, but it is still best to tell her before she finds out from someone else.For example, if your mom asks you how your grades are, be honest with her. If you keep telling her that you have straight A’s and then she receives a report card with a couple of D’s, she is not going to be happy.

Avoid arguing or bickering.,
Be respectful when you fight.,
Learn to compromise.",How to Stop Upsetting Your Mom3," Whining, arguing, and back-talking are some of any parent’s biggest pet-peeves. Resist the urge to argue or bicker with your mom over little annoyances. Choose to let the little things go instead of creating a huge argument. When you do feel that you need to state your case, do so respectfully and calmly.For example, if your mom is lecturing you about forgetting to take out the trash, there’s no need to argue back. Just apologize and move on.
Say that your mom heard a rumor that you skipped class, and it isn’t true. When she confronts you, do not scream or yell at her. Instead, remain calm and explain that you did not cut class and that she could always check in with your teacher if she needs more reassurance.

, Keep in mind that you might have a different opinion than your mom. That doesn’t mean that either one of you are wrong. Don’t let your emotions get carried away if you aren’t seeing eye to eye with your mom.Remember to breathe and think before you speak.
Understand that if you aren’t an adult, your mother does get to make the final decision.
If you are an adult, it is inevitable that sometimes you will argue and even raise your voice. Be careful not to raise the same argument over and over. Say it, and then let go of it.

, Throughout your childhood and your adult life, you will learn that you will not always agree with your mom. When this happens, you might have to come up with a compromise. Compromising can help prevent an impending fight.Keep in mind that it is not about who is right and who is wrong.
Keep an open mind.
Be ready and willing to change your mind.

Choose a good time to talk to your parents.,
Listen to your parents’ point of view.,
Explain your point of view.,
Use “I” statements to express yourself.,
Remain calm.,
Stay on topic.",How to Settle an Argument with Your Parents1," It's best to talk to your parents when they are relaxed and calm. If they are under stress from other things, they might extend their frustration to you. Similarly, you should also be calm and relaxed so that you can speak respectfully to your parents. If you get agitated and express your frustration to the them, you are unlikely to get them to see your point of view.

Ask your parents if it's a good time to talk. For example, say, ""I really want to talk to you about something when you have a free moment."";
, Listening to your parents’ case will show them that you respect them. It will also allow you to understand their objections to your requests. Focus on the key points of why they disagree with you, and address those concerns in your argument. This will reinforce the idea that you were listening and respect their opinion, as well as allow you to directly address your parents’ main concerns.For example, if your parents’ think that going out every Friday night will interfere with you spending time with the family, you might address their concern by saying something like “I know that family time is important, but I need time to be myself, too. Plus, I will be home every Sunday afternoon for family dinner.”

, After you have listened attentively to your parents, offer your side. As you explain your argument, validate their concerns, but show them why their concerns don't outweigh your side.

For example, say, ""I understand that you want me to have a 9:00 p.m. curfew for my own safety, but I'm old enough to stay out later and have proven that I'm responsible on nights that you have let me come home later.""
Emphasize what you've done that should reduce their concerns.

, “I” statements are a wonderful way to express things in the correct perspective. By saying this is what “I” think or what “I” feel, you avoid placing blame on the other person. This makes your parents’ more likely to listen to your point of view, and helps prevent them from becoming too defensive.An example of expressing yourself through an “I” statement would be to say something such as “I feel like I get to go out much less than other people my age,” rather than saying “You never let me go out as much as my friends go out.”
You may need to take time to reflect on your feelings and why you are feeling this way.
Explain your feelings to your parents in a respectful manner, and repeat them if you don't feel that your parents understood the first time. For example, you may say, ""I feel really hurt that you don't think I'm responsible enough to participate in the decision-making process.""

, Avoid letting your emotions get the best of you. Slamming things, yelling at your parents, or other angry outbursts will only escalate the situation. While you may think you are expressing how strongly you feel about the issue, you are really just reinforcing the idea that you are not mature enough to have an adult conversation with your parents.Instead of raising your voice to talk over your parents, listen carefully to what they are saying and then reply in a calm tone with something like “I understand your concerns, but let me explain my side, please.”

, Avoid bringing up any past arguments or disagreements. It will only serve to distract you and your parents from the issue you are trying to work out currently, and will make your parents defensive. You should also avoid involving other people, such as family members or friends, in the argument to support you. Only include another person in the discussion if they are directly related to the discussion.For example, you should not call your grandmother and have her tell your parents to let you go out tonight.
Do not bring up last week’s discussion about doing dishes as a focus on whether or not you can go out tonight. Things like “You always do this to me. You were awful to me last week about the dishes, and now you’re being awful to me about going out with my friends!” will only escalate the argument and divert the conversation.

"
"
Avoid personal attacks.,
Offer ideas that are mutually beneficial.,
Keep your requests reasonable.,
Find the middle ground.,
Resolve the conversation before ending it.",How to Settle an Argument with Your Parents2," Personal attacks will put your parents on the defense and make it hard for them to see your side of the argument. These attacks will also show that you aren’t handling the situation in a mature and responsible way. Instead of making personal attacks, stay on point and be clear about what you want to get out of the conversation.Attacks like “You are the worst parents ever! I hate you!” have no place in any argument. Instead, try things like “I know you think that this is the best decision for me, but I disagree.”

, A compromise should benefit both sides. By offering legitimate compromises, you show your parents that you are trying to be responsible. You also present an opportunity for them to gain or achieve something that helps them. This shows that you understand their position, and are willing to work with them.You might say, for example, “I know that you are afraid that my grades will suffer if I play a sport, but I will commit to studying an extra hour every Saturday and Sunday if you let me play.”

, If your curfew is at 8:00 and you’d like to be allowed to stay out later, you should ask your parents to make it 9;00, or maybe even 10:00. Asking your parents to go from a curfew of 8:00 to midnight is not a reasonable request. This kind of jump is unrealistic and does not put any burden on you to show your parents that you can be out a little later and still be responsible.

, Sometimes your parents are unwilling to budge from their decision. In those cases, you may be able to get part of what you want if you're willing to look for the middle ground. Offer a few suggestions for things that can get you closer to what you want while still honoring your parents' wishes.

You might say, for example, ""I understand that you don't want me to stay overnight for Rachel's party because you're worried we'll get into trouble. What if I stay until midnight, and then you pick me up? I could also check in via text and have Rachel's mom call you.""

, Avoid getting angry or fed up with the conversation before a resolution has been reached. For example, if you are still discussing the exact time of curfew, it will not benefit you to end the conversation just because your parents say “Midnight is out of the question.” It eliminates the possibility of reaching a compromise that would up your curfew to 9:00, 10:00, or even 11:00. It also shows that you aren’t mature enough to handle being told no, and may reinforce your early curfew."
"
Understand your parents’ perspective.,
Let the argument go.,
Start making your case for the next argument.,
Avoid future arguments.",How to Settle an Argument with Your Parents3," Your parents are accustomed to making all decisions for you in the way that they feel is best. For over a decade, you had little to no input on day to day care and decisions. As you are getting older, that starts to quickly change. Your parents need time to adjust to this, and you need to understand their position.For example, you might not agree that having a curfew is necessary at all, but this does not mean that your parents are wrong for instating a curfew.

, Ultimately, your parents usually make decisions based on what they think is best for you. Even if you disagree, you need to acknowledge that their decision is not a way to torture you, but is instead intended to help you be a successful adult. Even if the argument doesn’t swing in your favor, you have to let it go and avoid bringing it up next time you disagree with your parents.For example, after arguing over the time of curfew, you should not continue to be mad at your parents the next day.

, By accepting the outcomes of this argument gracefully, you are showing your maturity. Treat your parents with respect, even when you disagree, and you that respect will usually be returned. Building a track record of being mature and respectful to your parents will make it easier for them to trust you, and in the future, try to let you make more decisions for yourself.An example might be to say something like ""I still do not think that I need a curfew, but I understand why you want me to have one, and I'll follow the rules.""

, To avoid future arguments, you need to keep the lines of communication open. Talk to your parents about your wants and needs before you get upset. Keep any requests you have reasonable, and be willing to compromise from the beginning.


For example, if you'd like to stay out after curfew on Friday night because there is a school dance, explain the situation to your parents. Calmly mention that the dance runs until after curfew, and that you'd like to be there and will come straight home after.

,, Parents hate hearing swearing from children; in fact most adults probably won't like you if you cuss. Even if the parent swears in front of you, do not join in.
, Don't be too shy, or you will leave them uncertain about you. However, don't be too outspoken. If their opinions differ from yours, respect that and avoid getting into opinionated arguments., You'll look respectful if you ask for things and ask if it's okay to use facilities in their home.

That means that I would like some privacy when it comes to my possessions. I understand that you are just trying to keep me safe. I also understand that you may feel like I'm trying to hide something from you that I'm doing wrong. I'm not. I really just want my space to do my own thing.""

You might say something like, “I really think that if you asked me a bit more nicely about my schoolwork, I would be able to talk to you about it more.”;
, If your parents are nagging you about your work or grades, you probably aren’t doing so great with these things. Agree that you will work harder to do better.


You might start a conversation by saying something like, “I’m sorry I haven’t done as well as I could have lately. I promise to start working harder and trying my best to get better grades.”
There are many reasons to work hard in school, and making your parents happy is just one of them. Working hard in school will get you ready for the future and for college, make you proud of yourself, when you get better grades and learn new things, and it could lead to more options for jobs and careers in the future., Use a computer to create and print one out, or write it down by hand. Post it in a place where you and your parents can both see it, and they can see as you mark off your progress.


A schedule can serve as a record of all the work you have already finished. Not only will it feel good as you check off things on the list, but it can help you feel more organized and not lose track of things you still need to do.Make sure you keep to your schedule after you have made and posted it. It won’t help you if you don’t actually use it!, Rather than having your parents always coming to you with nagging concerns, go to them first. Make time throughout the week to let them know how you’re doing and what’s going on with your schoolwork.


This check-in might sound something like, “Hey Mom and Dad, I just wanted to let you know that I have a test this week, and I’m a little nervous about how I might do.” Or, “I’m feeling a little overwhelmed with my assignments in math, so I’m going to ask my teacher for some extra help.”
This check-in could be something you put on your schedule to do every few days. Don’t make it too formal or just about grades; let them know what’s going on in your day-to-day life, too., If you keep that line of communication open between you and your parents, they will have less reason to nag you about schoolwork. Let them know about things in school as they happen.

Write the grade down when you receive it, and this way you parents can be involved and see how you’re doing., You might feel angry or irritated when they nag you about your schoolwork or your grades, but resist the urge to lash out or argue. Instead, react calmly and respond thoughtfully.

If you need money for the tutor, discuss it with your parents before booking one. Ask at your school first to see if there are any free tutoring services they can offer.

, You might not be the best test taker, and that’s okay. There are study strategies you can try that might help you score higher on tests.


Take effective notes in class and spend time each day looking them over, rather than only looking at them before a test. This will help you remember the material better over time.

Plus, your parents will see you taking this step to do better in school and might be less inclined to nag you., This might seem like a no-brainer, but every little assignment counts. Missing even one homework assignment could negatively impact your grade. Make sure you are turning all assignments in on time.


Use your schedule to write down all upcoming assignments and keep track of them as you complete them and turn them in. Then, use your grade board to record your scores on these assignments.
If your parents see you doing your homework, they will have less of a reason to nag you about it. Show them you are capable of doing your work without being told to.

, Some teachers might be more open to this than others. Also, some teachers may not be allowed to offer extra credit to only one student.


Your teacher might be more willing to offer you extra credit if they can see you are genuinely working hard and doing your best through the entire school year or semester. Don’t do poorly the entire year and hope to rely on extra credit points to boost your grade at the end., It’s very easy to put other things in front of your schoolwork, like your social life or extracurricular activities. But, make sure you prioritize your academics ahead of everything else.


Think about each assignment separately. If you have a long paper due, for example, don’t wait to start it until the last minute. Make it a priority to begin working on it well ahead of the due date.If you put school first, you will likely start to do better, and your parents will have even less reason to nag you about your work or your grades.

, After school routines are important to establish so that you get in the habit of doing and completing your work. Spend time each day working on your assignments.


Routines can help build healthy and strong study habits. Once you spend a few weeks in the routine you create, it will become second nature, and you won’t even have to think about it.
If your parents see you getting into the habit of doing your work and working hard, they won’t have to spend time nagging you to get to work.

, Working to make your relationship with them most positive can really help when it comes to their nagging about school. Talk and spend time with them more often than only when they want to nag you.

I appreciate everything you do for me.”

This trust is an important part of your relationship, and it might allow them to give you a little more space.If you tell your parents you are struggling and why, they might be able to help you. It might seem like all they want to do is nag you, but they could potentially help you succeed if you let them know what’s going on.

, Don’t wait for them to come to you and ask questions. Go to them and let them know what’s going on, both in school and in your daily life.


Your posted schedule can also help keep them in the loop. Let them know when you make a new one, and ask them if they have anything to add to it, like appointments or events.
Dinnertime is a great opportunity to talk about your day, what you’re working on, and how things are going.

, Your parents are only trying to make sure you are successful, healthy, and happy. Understand that they might have different ideas for how you should achieve these things.


Respect is a key aspect of any healthy relationship. Respect your parents, show them that you do, and they will be more likely to show you the same., It might seem like all they want to do is nag you, but their concern is coming from a good place. Before you cut them off or get mad, hear them out.


It might be tempting to jump in and interrupt your parents with your own ideas and arguments, but try to let them finish before you do so.
Actually listen to your parents, rather than simply waiting for your turn to talk. Listen actively, and respond. Try restating what they have said to let them know you are listening: “Mom, I understand that you think I have not been doing as well as I could…”

, Every person looks at things in a different way. Because your parents are older, they will have different perspectives on issues than you do.They are looking at your schoolwork as an important aspect of your life, one that might determine things about your future. Consider their perspective, and if you aren’t sure where they’re coming from, ask them.
Put yourself in their shoes. If you had a child who was doing poorly in school, wouldn’t you be concerned? You might want to know what was causing your child to struggle, and want to help them.

, It’s important that you be self-reflective in situations like this. This means you must look at your own efforts and decide if you really could be doing better in school.


It might seem difficult, but becoming more self-aware is fairly easy. Try to be more aware of your thought process, and how you react to different situations. Try not to act out of a strong emotion, and take more time to think things through. It’s easy to blame your problems and flaws on outside factors. You might blame your bad grades in school on distractions like your job, sports you play, or any other number of things. But before you do that, take a moment to think about what is really holding you back from doing well in school, and consider that it might only be yourself.
Ask yourself: “Am I doing the best I can? Am I really trying? Have I asked for help?”

, You might be quick to assume that all your parents want to do is nag you, but they’re most likely nagging you because they care, and want you to succeed.


Instead of getting mad or irritated, understand that they are your parents, and their first priority is you. They want you to succeed, and they want what is best for you. They have your best interests in mind, even if it is difficult to see that in their actions.

Be polite to your parents. Clean up after yourself, say “please” and “thank you,” and listen to their rules. If your mom sees you being good, she might be less likely to want to give you chores., Try to have a positive, open relationship with your parents. Sometimes parents can be frustrating, but try to be on good terms with them. You might not agree on everything or completely understand each other, but you should respect and love each other. Ask your parents to do something with you or go out of your way to spend time with them. Having a good relationship with your parents will make asking for fewer chores easier.

, Don’t complain about being bored. If all you do is lounge around the house, whining about being bored, your mom is bound to give you chores. Stay busy and don’t complain. Your parents will be impressed and will probably give you less chores.

Understand the mentality of a Mom:;
,
Your noticing girls may make her sad: A mother knows that a boy really noticing girls is a sign you are growing up.,
Your Mom might be proud, too: Her little boy's growing into a man!,
Mom may also feel uncomfortable: Noticing girls means you aren't a little boy anymore, but may not know how to deal with it.,
She may feel one of these feelings, or any combination.

,
If she embarrasses you in public, politely ask her to stop.,
If she gets all weepy and/or emotional: Be mature about it as much as you can.,
If you have siblings, tell your mother if you're worried they will make a scene.,
If your siblings do give you a hard time: Don't act embarrassed about the fact you now like girls--you'll ruin all their fun.,
If all else fails, ask your mother if she would prefer it if you liked guys!,
Sit down and spend time with your mom.",How to Stop Your Mom from Making a Big Deal That You Like Girls,", For her, it's one more sign you are getting older and will leave the house in a few years. She loves you and this may makes her a bit sad.

, And that will mean happy things down the road like your senior prom, your first girlfriend, your wedding, and maybe having grandchildren one day.

, She might tease or act ""all weird"" because she doesn't quite know what do about this.

,, In private, tell her what she's doing that is making you uncomfortable--she may not actually know you were embarrassed. Tell her yes, you are noticing girls, and you don't want her to make you feel weird about it. If she's a good mother, she'll try to avoid embarrassing you.(Note: Mothers will embarrass you from time to time no matter what. Sorry, it's true. Fortunately, everyone else's mother does too!)

, This will be uncomfortable but it's about her, not about you. Remind her you're still her boy, you love and need her. She might initially get even more emotional, because she'll get all happy that you love her, but at least she'll think you're the sweetest, most thoughtful son in the world.

, Brothers and sisters have a way of using the fact you like girls to be pests. Your mother should stand up for you, as there's nothing wrong about thinking girls are neat.

, When they make fun of you for wanting to kiss a certain girl, say something like: ""Yeah, she is really cute, and I'd like to kiss her.""

, (Bear in mind, if you like guys too, or just guys, this is perfectly normal; there are likely plenty of articles on this site to help you deal with this.)

, Growing up is the hardest part of any parent's life, so doing something like watching TV with her or do a small activity with her will help her adjust while reassuring her that you haven't forgotten about her. Remember, she's the girl that has been there from day one and will always love you.

Define your passions.,
Develop your career plan.,
Organize your thoughts.,
Practice the conversation.",How to Tell Your Parents You Don't Want to Follow in Their Footsteps1," If you make money your top priority, you are likely to end up in a career that you hate. Instead, you should focus on doing things that interest you personally. If you can start these things as a career right away, that’s great. If not, make time for hobbies or volunteering to find things that fulfill you.Some common themes that people seek in their careers are the ability to be creative, the power to set their own schedule, financial stability, etc.;
, Once you find things that you enjoy doing, you can start thinking about how they can be utilized in a career. You can start by typing in an online search, or going to local businesses that you think could use your skills. It is important to seek careers that utilize your unique talents, as this will set you apart from others and fuel your drive and passion.For example, if you love to write, but are not interested in writing novels, you could explore companies that need writers. You can write content for web pages, advertisements, and a whole range of applications if you make it a priority to find those jobs.
Part of this plan should be planning for setbacks. If you anticipate your parents will be upset by your choice to follow a different path, their disapproval may cause certain complications. For instance, they may decide not to fund your college tuition if you choose to become a writer instead of taking over the family business as they had hoped. Figure out how you would handle these setbacks by looking into scholarships and student loans, etc.
You can learn a lot about any field by reading literature in your chosen field and by studying the most successful individuals in that field. You can start by reading biographies, or taking an internship under a respected professional in the field., You know why you want to choose this career, but your parents may not. Use any extra materials you can find to make your point. You can get handouts detailing your career. Make sure that you include salary ranges, employability, and benefits that come with your chosen career. Use this information to figure out the main points of your conversation and to make an outline. You can take the outline with you to the conversation, or just practice it beforehand., This conversation can often be hard to have. Beyond getting your thoughts organized, it can be a good idea to practice the conversation with a friend or another relative. You could also write down any important points that you want to make, especially if they are hard to bring up."

Talk to your parents.,
Ask your parents directly if they've been in your room.,
Ask your parents to respect your private space.,
Give your parents practical tips for respecting your privacy.,
Give them reasons to respect your bedroom space.,
Design a 'knock before entering' doorknob sign.",How to Stop Your Mom from Snooping in Your Room1," Parents typically snoop because they are worried that you are not telling them enough about your personal life. If you sense your parents are worried about you, try to have open conversations with them. This doesn’t mean you have to tell them everything but, rather, that you should be truthful and open with them. In this way, you can make sure your parents don't have a reason to snoop in your bedroom.Initiate conversations with your parents about your school or work day so that they feel included in your life. For example, if your mom asks, ""how was your day?"" you might share an anecdote or a story that you heard in class.
If your parents ask you about a new club or sport you are involved in, try not to shrug off the question and instead tell them something about it. For example, if they ask about your new soccer team, you might say, ""soccer practice was exhausting but I learned some new stuff about defence,"" and tell them what you learned in some detail. This will make them feel more a part of your life, and decrease their desire to snoop around your room.;
, By asking in a respectful and direct tone, you can hopefully get a straightforward response to your question. If your parents have not been snooping in your room, you have nothing to worry about. If they have been snooping, you can move forward with the conversation.


For instance, you can ask, ""have you been looking around in my room?"" If they say ""yes,"" you will know you need to move forward with requesting some privacy. If they say ""no,"" you might want to look into other explanations such as someone else snooping in your room or the possibility that a pet dog or cat has been in the room.

, By initiating open and clear communication, your parents will know about your need for privacy and will therefore be more likely to respect it.You might explain, ""I need my bedroom space to be private so that I can work on my projects in peace and have some space and time for myself. I am sure you can understand this need. It would be great if you could stop snooping around in my room so that I can keep this space to myself.""

, You might ask your parents to knock before entering your room, so that you can be prepared for their entrance. You might also ask your parents to seek permission before looking into your personal items, such as a gym or school bag.

, For instance, you might offer a specific example of a school project or hobby you are working on that cannot be disturbed for some reason.

, Place the sign on the outside of your bedroom door handle. This will remind visitors of the need to knock before entering.If you search 'knock before entering' in google images, you will find lots of possible design ideas for your sign."

Choose the right time.,
Pick a good place.,
Bring up the topic.,
Stay calm and respectful.",How to Tell Your Parents You Don't Want to Follow in Their Footsteps2," You want to make sure that your parents have the time to sit and talk to you about your decision. Starting the conversation with too little time, or when people are stressed or emotional, is not a good idea. Try setting a time to talk to your parents when there will be no distractions, and you can be fully prepared for the conversation.A good time to bring up this kind of conversation would be after a family dinner. Bringing it up while a parent is on the phone or working is not a good time.

, Just like timing, placement of the conversation can directly impact how well your parents listen to you. If you know that a parent will be easily distracted at home, try going out for a walk. If you think that your parents will have a hard time processing the conversation in public, have the conversation at home or in another private space.


The middle of a supermarket is probably not a good place to start this conversation, but it might be a great idea to talk about it in the car during a road trip.

, Keep calm and collected, and tell your parents that you need to talk to them about something. If you don’t feel that you can bring it up, or if you are sure that your parents will not listen, you might try writing a letter or an email. They will not be able to interrupt you as they read your note.Approaching your parents calmly and respectfully is important. Starting off with something like “Mom, can I talk to you about my future,” shows that you want to include your parents and that you are willing to open up to them and hear them out.

, Choosing a good time and place can start the conversation off on a good note, but these conversations can often be a point of tension. If you feel tension starting to build between yourself and your parents, it’s okay to take a few minutes to relax. The conversation can even be put on hold until another day to let everyone process what has been discussed so far, and come back with an open mind.Arguing and yelling things like “I hate you,” at your parents will show that you are not handling the situation in a mature way. This will make it harder for them to listen to what you have to say and respect it. Try approaching their concerns in a more respectful way like “I know that you think being a doctor is what’s best for me, but I disagree.”"
"
Be honest with your parents.,
Make your points clear.,
Actively listen to your parents.,
Be respectful of their response.",How to Tell Your Parents You Don't Want to Follow in Their Footsteps3," Your parents will likely know if you are lying to them. If your dream is to become a teacher and you tell them that you can earn $100,000 per year, you are only going to make the conversation more tense. It will show that you either do not know the facts about your chosen career, or that you don’t respect your parents enough to be honest with them. Either way it will be hard for them to trust you with this decision.Using materials from reputable sources is a great way to discuss the details accurately.
For example, if the salary range of your career is lower than what your parents are used to making, you can discuss it with them by saying “I know that this is less than you make, but the flexibility of my job will allow me to do more traveling than you were able to do. That is important to me.”

, This is important for your parents. They may not understand why you don’t want to carry on the family tradition that they intended to pass down to you. By being direct about what your needs and desires are, you make it easier for your parents to process.This is a good time to tell them about your career plan and the life you envision for yourself. This way your parents will see that this is not just a passing fancy, but a well thought-out plan with clear objectives, goals, and a timeline.


Instead of saying something like “I think I might want to consider being a teacher after I graduate college,” be direct and say, “I want to go to college to become a teacher.”

, Communication is a two way street. If you make a genuine effort to understand your parents’ point of view, the will be more likely to return the favor. After you say what you need to say, it is your turn to listen. Do not interrupt or argue with your parents if they disagree with your decision.Saying things like, “I understand that your career is important to you, but my passion is somewhere else,” will let your parents know that you are considering their thoughts and feelings.
Respecting your parents’ point of view does not mean that you have to act on it.

, Arguing and yelling at your parent is not a good way to handle any disagreement. They are entitled to their opinion, just as you are. In the end, most parents just want to make sure that their kids are doing what is best for them. Keep your voice down, listen to their side, and show your parents the same respect that you expect from them.Your parents may not agree with your decision. In this case, calmly say something along the lines of “I understand your concerns, but it is my decision to make, and this career is important to me.”

Make sure everyone agrees to the specificities of the 'do' rules.
Compose 'don't' rules concerning privacy, such as 'never enter a bedroom, aside from your own, without knocking'. Make sure everyone agrees to the specificities of the 'don't' rules.

, A list of family ground rules can help family members remember to respect household rules, including with respect to privacy., Privacy is something that we need to communicate clearly and negotiate throughout our lives at home and at work.Try discussing your need for privacy at school, work or other areas of your life. If your parents have a broader understanding of your privacy needs, they may be able to better help you meet these needs.

Choose a good time to talk.,
Communicate what you need.,
Defuse potentially difficult conversations.,
Ask him what you can improve on.,
Remain calm.,
Respect his decision.,
Understand his perspective.",How to Stop Fighting with Your Father1," You and your dad might be fighting because you both choose bad times to have serious discussions. Avoid hitting him with heavy topics as soon as he gets in from work, as he may want some downtime. Opt instead for right after dinner when he is not busy or on the weekend.If he wants to talk to you about something when you are stressed, ask him politely if you can talk in a few minutes instead. Use those few minutes to do something that relaxes you, like taking a shower.;
, Parents appreciate when their kids show signs of maturity like confidence and directness. Let your dad know from the get-go what you need from him.Say “Dad, I want to talk to you about something. I just want you to listen for right now. I don’t want advice, I just want someone to talk to.”
You can also say “There is a field trip coming up with school and it’s overnight. Can I talk to you about that? I would really like to go.”

, Sometimes, you may not need to make a request of your dad, but instead confess something you did wrong or something that’s been bothering you. In these cases, approach him with calmness and humility and with possible solutions.For instance, if you have recently gotten a speeding ticket, say “Dad, I did something bad today and I need to let you know. I was speeding on the way home and got a ticket. But I already talked to my supervisor and he said I can pick up extra shifts every weekend this month to pay for it.”

, Mention to your dad that it bothers you when the two of you fight. Admit the part that you play in the fighting but also ask him what he needs from you. He might be stressed at work only to come home and find the dishes piled high and you playing video games. See if he needs more help at home or more respect in general.

You can say “Dad, we’ve been fighting a lot lately and it really upsets me. I was wondering if there’s anything that I can do to prevent this or anything that you need from me?”
Let him know what you need from him, too. Say “Dad, I really want our relationship to improve. It’s hard for me to come to you sometimes because I know you’ll yell at me. Do you think that you could do that less?”

, You might feel that your dad is very unfair or even cruel to you. Remember that though you cannot control your father, you can control yourself. Even if he yells at you, don’t yell back. Don’t walk away, interrupt him, or yell. If you have done something wrong, apologize. If not, simply sit calmly until the fight is over.Breathe deeply during this process, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
It’s okay to show your emotions, but don’t let them consume you or cause you to do things you’ll regret.

, Once your father has decided something, honor that. If you do so, he will likely be more likely to trust you in the future. Do try to find ways to compromise, but know that it is his decision in the end.For instance, ask your dad if he will be willing to let you stay out an hour later on Friday night if you wash his car and mow the lawn.
If your father ever tells you to do something that is harmful or illegal, tell someone. Find an adult you trust like a teacher so that they can get you help.

, In most cases, fathers are only doing what they think is best for their children. When your father makes a decision that you don’t agree with, consider his point of view. Even if you don’t think he is right, it will help you to be able to understand.For instance, your dad might have you on a 10PM curfew, while your friends are allowed to stay out later. Your dad might be concerned about drunk drivers, drugs, or he may not trust your friends.

Keep a list of all the cleaning that you need to do and always keep your room tidy. Have these tasks completed before your father gets home each day.Be sure to do them to the best of your ability so that he doesn’t have anything to argue with you about.

, If you see your dad outside struggling to rake the leaves or bring in the groceries, help him. It can be hard on a father if he has too many responsibilities to juggle, so work to ease his burden. Small acts of service can help to improve your relationship., If you are a teen or preteen, complete your homework as soon as you get home from school. Your dad likely has a lot of other things to worry about, so try to ease his burdens as much as possible. If you need help, ask him some time after dinner once he has had a chance to relax., If you are the older sibling, help out with your brothers and sisters. Offer to babysit so that your parents can go out on a date night. If you see that they need something, get it for them so that your dad can have a break sometimes., If you are living on your own, your dad might miss you. He might feel also that he is the only one who ever reaches out and that your communication is one-sided. Make an effort to call your dad and visit him more so that he knows he’s important to you.

You might even establish a group text with him and your other siblings so you can chat throughout the week.

, If you tell your father that you are going to do something, do your best to keep that promise. If you both feel that you can trust each other’s word, you may have a more positive dynamic moving forward., If your father should ask you a question, tell him the truth, no matter how much trouble you might be in. Your father may not like what you did, but he will respect your honesty. This will also help him trust you more.

Express your appreciation for him.,
Have family dinners together.,
Take an evening walk.,
Do something you both enjoy.",How to Stop Fighting with Your Father3," In addition to conflict resolution with your dad, work to also tell him how grateful you are for him. If your dad feels appreciated, he is less likely to start fights with you.Say something like “Dad, thanks for always being there for me. And thanks so much for going to all of my games this season. It means a lot.”
You can tell him in person or write him a note.

, Know that your parents aren’t the only ones who can set family time; you can, as well. Suggest that you all have dinner together as a family at least twice per week. Don’t use your cell phone at all during this time. Talk about each other’s day, instead.You might even consider playing a game like Spades or trivia during dinner.

, Ask your dad to go on a walk with you around the neighborhood after dinner. This will give you some quality alone time and a chance to talk. Walk to the park to shoot some hoops or just sit and chat., You might feel that you and your dad are polar opposites, but there is probably something that you're both interested in. You might both enjoy documentaries, video games or cooking. Whatever it is, spend some time doing those things together."

Be the bigger person.,
Get some space.,
Try to compromise.If something that you do annoys them, make an effort to stop.,
Focus on a resolution.,
Avoid bringing up issues during times of celebration.,
Avoid trying to make your parents choose a side.",How to Stop Fighting with Your Family1," Try to rise above the disagreement and show your level of maturity. Consider how important the issue is that you are fighting about. If it’s a serious matter that is truly affecting one of you, then you should sit down and give each person the opportunity to express themselves.Say something to the effect of “We’re sister/brothers. We shouldn’t be fighting like cats and dogs. Let’s take a moment to talk about this. You go first.” Being willing to let the other person talk first can go a long way of showing that you want to resolve the problem.
If the issue isn’t that big of a deal, however, let it slide without a big fuss. Siblings have little spats between them. It doesn’t mean you don’t love and care for one another.;
, Sometimes, others get under your skin because one of you is already irritable or anxious. Be willing to recognize when you are tense and take a moment to collect yourself before trying to sort out an argument. It can actually help to recognize when you need a break ahead of time. This can prevent you from saying words you’ll later regret.Go somewhere by yourself for a short time to gather your thoughts and calm down. It can even help to leave your house or wherever you are and visit a friend.

, Help them out, and show them that you're genuinely making an effort to get along. It's normal and sometimes necessary to change some tiny aspect about yourself to get along with people—siblings are no different.


Choose a time and place to talk when you have both cooled off. Think about how much you’re willing to bend to compromise. Be truthful in sharing your thoughts and opinions (without being offensive) and be willing to listen to the other person’s side of things to.
Once the two of you make an agreement, uphold your end of the bargain. It may also be a good idea to check in with your brother or sister regularly to see if they are satisfied with the progress you two are making.

, While it's tempting to try to lay blame and to make your voice heard, resolving the issue is what's most important. Think about what you'll enjoy from a healthy relationship with your sibling moving forward rather than trying to ""win"" an argument with them. Understand that you each need to bring something to the table and work together, so don't try to make the process about getting what you want.

Apologize for what you've done to hurt your sibling. Say, ""I'm sorry I hurt you,"" or ""I didn't realize that not coming to your birthday would upset you, but I'm sorry that I missed your special night.""

, Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and family events are not times to discuss your issues with your sibling. Bringing up these issues will create a feeling of negativity that can ruin the event for everyone. Additionally, your other family members who aren't involved in the issue should not have to hear about the dispute or be involved in working it out. Instead, focus on celebrating the event with your family.

If you feel that your issues with your sibling will interfere with your enjoyment of the event, schedule a time to talk to them about the issue so that you know that your grievances will be aired, even if it's at a later date. Write down what you want to discuss so that it isn't on your mind during the celebration.
Remind yourself of the good memories that you are creating for yourself and your family. You don't want to look back on this event with negative feelings.

, It’s common for siblings to want to pull mom and dad into a disagreement to determine who’s right and who’s wrong. This is unfair to your parents and your sibling(s). Unless the fight has turned potentially dangerous, try to exercise your conflict resolution skills without involving your parents."

Keep your cool.,
Use “I” statements.,
Practice active listening.,
Remember that they love you.",How to Stop Fighting with Your Family2," If you are getting upset with a parent, take a time-out. Politely excuse yourself and walk into another room or outside for a breath of fresh air. Do some deep breathing exercises to stimulate your body’s natural stress relief response.


Inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Hold it for 7 counts. Then, exhale the air through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat this technique until you start to feel calm again., Be respectful and use language that minimizes your chances of offending your parent(s) and getting into trouble. If you use statements that start with “you,” they can seem argumentative. “I” statements give you the chance to express how you feel and respectfully disagree with your mom and/or dad.


Try this: “I feel mistrusted when you follow me in the car. I try my best to follow the rules, but it doesn’t help if you don’t try to trust me.” Or, “I’m feeling really pressured about having to go to your alma mater for college. Can I have more time to think this over?”

, One of the main reasons why you may fight with your parents is the neither of you feels heard. If, by this point, you have been allowed to express yourself, return the favor by listening to their points-of-view as well. Refrain from using any sarcasm when something is said that you don’t like or agree with. Follow these tips to listen effectively:Put away any distractions, such as turning off phones or TVs
Turn to face your parent(s) and make occasional eye contact
Reflect open body language by uncrossing your arms and legs and leaning toward the speaker
Wait until the speaker is done before replying
Make clarifications by asking questions to ensure that you got the correct message

, If you’re a teen who finds yourself arguing with your parents, you may feel as if you are at war. No matter how difficult your relationship is with your parents and how rarely you see eye-to-eye, they love you and probably have your best interests at heart. Although it may feel as though you are on different sides, they just want the best for you."

Recognize that all families have problems.,
Find someone outside of the conflict to confide in.,
Perform regular self-care.,
Consider going to family therapy.,
Have patience.",How to Stop Fighting with Your Family3," While television sometimes portrays ideal families that don't have issues, that is not a normal representation of life. Many normal families have issues involving stress, misunderstanding, frustration, hurt, anger, and disconnection. Having an argument with a family member is a normal part of life that is bound to happen even in the healthiest of families. Even though it's normal, you may still experience negative feelings such as sadness, hurt, anger, and frustration.

Arguments may arise due to someone's poor treatment of a family member, because of a longstanding unresolved issue, or due to other family dynamics.
Because you learn how to handle stress and conflict from your family, unhealthy behaviors can persist through generations. You all must work together to overcome conflicts and to change poor coping strategies.
If your family has issues with mental illness, substance abuse, or other chronic issues, consider entering therapy to discuss how you can make changes for yourself. If your family members are willing, consider going to therapy together.

, Leaning on an unbiased third party can help you cope with fighting in your family. Make sure the person you confide in will listen to you without taking sides or breaking your confidence. Vent to them when something goes wrong, and let them help you sort out your feelings.


Talking to someone who is not involved in an argument can help you vent your frustrations. However, another advantage of confiding in a friend is the ability to get some perspective. That person may be able to spot when you are being unreasonable and advise you on how to make amends when you have taken an argument to far., When there is turmoil in your family, you must attend to your own mental and emotional needs to cope. You may not even notice how tense and stressed you feel after fighting with your family, but your mind and body are certainly experiencing the effects. Stress can cause you to make rash decisions and even become physically ill. Counteract this stress by treating your mind and body good.Do something that relaxes and soothes you. This can include going for a run, taking a warm bubble bath, playing with your dog, watching a movie with friends, or getting a mani-pedi.

, Someone with professional training might be able to find the source of the problem and help you and your family solve these issues. Going into therapy together can help you all communicate and work together to come up with solutions to your issues. Family therapy is usually mediated by a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) who will have specialized training in family dynamics as well as awareness of how different cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs affect how people approach family conflicts.Family therapy is usually done over a brief period of time and focuses on helping your family communicate better. It can also help identify and resolve disruptions to your family cohesiveness.

, Learning better ways to share your thoughts, feelings, and opinions without hurting your loved ones is a skill that takes time to develop. Try not to be upset when things don’t change overnight. In the meantime, look for small indicators that you and your family are learning to resolve conflict in a more healthy manner.

, If an issue is pressing and you need some time to think about it, or just to cool down, back off before anyone loses control.

, Take responsibility for situations when you are able to. If there is something you can do about a situation without involving your mom, try to deal with it yourself. If you want a new pair of shoes, and don't think she will buy them, look for a job or other source of income, or save up and buy them yourself.

, If you are frequently arguing about a particular chore, do it in a timely manner, and your mom won't have to fuss at you, which in turn may make you cop an attitude.

, Don't always complain you don't get what you want. You should consider both how much you do get, and how able she is to provide what you want. Often, we do not consider how well off we are, nor do we consider how hard parents work and scrimp to provide what we have.

, Even if you are dead set on getting what you want, you may be better off compromising than losing an argument and having hurt feelings.

, Keep your problems with your siblings, peers, teachers, and others out of your attitude with your Mom. If you are mad or upset with someone else, your Mom does not deserve to take abuse from you because of it.

, Remember that your Mom probably wants what is best for you, and, in fact, may know better than you do what that is.

, Therefore complaining about yours won't help at all. But you can also ""swap"" and tell each other about your day.

, Make sure to listen to what she has to say.

, When she asks you to do something, do it; don't give her a chance to complain.

Assess the reason for the stubbornness.,
Apologize.,
Take slow deep breaths.,
Excuse yourself.,
Remain level-headed.,
Approach your parent at a good time.,
Spend time with your parents.,
Show your love.,
Be open with your parents.,
Avoid loafing.,
Vent your feelings to a friend.,
Try to avoid trigger topics.,
Take your parent's perspective.",How to Stop Fighting with a Stubborn Parent," Ask your parent about the reason for the stubbornness. Be sure to ask in a polite manner. You could try saying something like ""I think I would be much less upset if you could let me know your side of the story. Why is it that you are saying no to this?""


If this causes your parent to become angry, consider letting it go and moving on or trying again once your parent as calmed down.;
, Sometimes it just isn't worth fighting even if you think you're right. If you assess that this is the case, then try apologizing. You don't have to lie and be sorry for disagreeing with your parent's opinion (which might well be legitimate), but you can still sincerely apologize for fighting with your parent. There are a number of ways to apologize:


I was angry and I shouldn't have called you that bad name, I'm sorry if I hurt you.""
I wasn't thinking about things from your perspective, I'm sorry for fighting with you.""
I'm really sorry about saying that mean thing.""

, If you are in the middle of a fight and want it to end, try to slow down the tempo of the situation and your own reaction to it. You can do this by taking some deep breaths.


Breathe in through your nose, counting to five, hold for two seconds and then exhale through your mouth., One way to end a fight is to leave the situation. Let both tempers dissipate by taking some time away from each other. Be sure to be polite when you excuse yourself from the conversation or it may backfire and escalate the fight.


For example, you could say ""I think we will just keep fighting if I stay here, I'll have to excuse myself, let's try talking again later, please, once I'm more calmed down.""Avoid putting the blame on your stubborn parent or this may just cause him to dig his feet in more firmly as a defensive reaction to your accusations.

, A stubborn parent in a fight is more likely to be calmed down if you yourself remain calm. You will be more likely to end the fight if you stay cool headed rather than getting stubborn and upset yourself.Although it can be difficult to remain level-headed in a fight when you are likely upset, try your best. It may help if you don't fight on an empty stomach, when you are already feeling crummy and may have less self-control., Sometimes when you try to approach a touchy subject, odds are you're not going to get the answer you'd like. Ask them or bring up the problem at a time they're in their best mood and you will be most likely to get the response you are looking for.


Try to get a sense of when your parent is most likely to be in the best mood. Is it in the morning or at night? Is it on the weekend? Is it when the sun is out?

, Do some activities together or ask your parent how the day went. It is easy to forget to spend time with your parents, which can reduce your bond, and might in turn make conflict more.There are a number of activities you could participate in together:


Take your dog for a walk.
Play video games together.
Watch a movie together.
Play a board game together.
Go shopping together.

, Walk up to your parent and give a big hug. Tell your parent how much you care. Although telling your parent is important, you can do more than that by demonstrating your love:


Mow the lawn.
Do the dishes.
Wash your parent's car.
Write a letter or thank you card.
Cook a meal for your parent.

, Tell your parents how you feel and update them about your life. In doing so you they may be more likely to see things from your perspective, which might make them less stubborn.You could tell you parents about your day at school or work.
You could tell them about something you are excited for and why.
You could talk about things in your life that you are worried about.

, No one likes it when a relationship seems unfair and unbalanced. Although it is true that the relationship between you and your parents is unbalanced in that they are supposed to do more things for you (i.e., raise you and provide for you up to a certain age) than you are for them, this doesn't mean that you should sit around and do nothing or not help out when you can! If your parents see you working hard they might be more likely to not be so stubborn, which will lead to less fighting.Be sure to keep your room clean.
Be sure to do the chores that are assigned to you.
Try not to make too many messes, or clean up after yourself if you do.
Work hard in school or at your job.

, Talk to a close friend about how your parent makes you feel.She may be able to offer advice or will, at the very least, be able to offer social/moral support.


You may find that by blowing off steam with a friend, you are less combative or likely to fight with your stubborn parent.

, If you know that there are some topics that your parent never backs down on, such as whether you can borrow his car, try your best to avoid this.Think about what other options you have. Maybe you could take a bus or a taxi or ask a friend to drive.

, Maybe there's a reason that he or she keeps saying no. Try to put yourself in your parent's shoes and consider why your parent might be acting stubborn.


Try to remember that in most cases, even if it seems like your parents are misguided, they are probably trying to protect you. At the very least, even if you think they are being stubborn, you can appreciate that they care.

Set a goal and write it down.,
Work on alternate ways to express your emotions.,
Reward yourself.,
Apologize if you slip.",How to Stop Cussing Around Your Parents or Other Adults1," If you want to stop swearing around your parents and other adults for good, then you will need to put it in writing. Writing down a goal and looking at it a few times per day is the best way to start making it happen.Try to be as detailed as possible when you write out your goal. Who do you want to stop swearing around? What do you need to stop saying? What can you do or say instead of swearing? How will you reward yourself when you succeed?
Keep your goal in your wallet or purse so that you can pull it out and read it a few times each day.;
, Swearing is a powerful way to express emotions and that is why some people may find it hard to stop.Take a moment to think about when you tend to swear the most. For example, do you swear more when you are angry? Excited? Anxious? Is there a particular topic of conversation that makes you swear? Do you cuss a lot while watching or playing a certain sport? Identify your reasons and work on an alternate way of expressing your emotions.For example:


If you tend to swear when you get angry, try taking a walk when you start to feel angry.
If you tend to swear when you accidentally hurt yourself, try substituting made-up words instead.
If you tend to swear when you are watching a sporting event, try getting a noisemaker and use it in place of swearing.

, If you avoid swearing around parents and adults for a set period of time, that accomplishment may be enough of a reward. But you may also find it helpful to set a reward for yourself.For example, if you go 30 days without swearing around adults, then maybe you can splurge on a new video game or t-shirt. Pick something that you know that you can buy for yourself, but don't buy it until you reach your goal.

, Chances are that you will slip sometimes, and that is normal. Forgive yourself if you make a mistake and make sure that you apologize right away. Explain to people that you are trying to stop swearing so much, but sometimes you slip.Try saying something like, “I’m sorry about that. I am trying to pay closer attention to my language, but sometimes I slip.”

Give yourself a time delay.,
Disguise bad words with added words, syllables, or sounds.,
Replace cuss words with fake cuss words.,
Expand your vocabulary.",How to Stop Cussing Around Your Parents or Other Adults2," Even if we are planning to do or say something, your brain is capable of canceling the action in the quarter of a second before the action happens. You can take advantage of your brain’s natural ability to cancel words and actions by getting into the habit of pausing before you say anything. If you are about to swear, then you have the option to cancel that action., If a swear word starts slips out, you can cover it up by adding on an additional word or syllable, thus turning it into an acceptable expression. For example, try turning “Sh__” into “Shiitake Mushrooms” (pronounced shi-TAH-kay mushrooms). This can be helpful if you swear without meaning to and you need to cover it up in a hurry.Doing this is kind of funny, and it might make parents laugh instead of getting mad at you.
If you can’t think of a way to disguise a swear word, then try clapping your hands or making another loud noise at the same time.

, When you feel like you need to swear, you may find it helpful to use use milder words to satisfy your urge. For example, you can say things like, “Fudge,” “Heck,” ""Sugar,"" or “Frick.”, Some people swear as part of their regular vocabulary, which can make it hard to stop. If swearing is a staple in your vocabulary, then try learning a new word each day and see how many times you can use it.


For example, you might learn the word “antediluvian,” which means that something is out of date or old-fashioned.Then if you became frustrated with your computer, you could say something like, “I hate this antediluvian computer!”

"
"
Find a buddy.,
Start a swear jar.,
Wear an elastic band on your wrist.",How to Stop Cussing Around Your Parents or Other Adults3," People tend to have more success at accomplishing goals when they have a buddy.If you have a friend or sibling who has the same problem as you, then ask if he or she would like to team up with you. You can help keep each other accountable and encourage each other when you do well.

, If you are really serious about stopping, put 50 cents or a dollar into a jar every time you swear in front of an adult or parent. Commit to giving that money away to a friend or sibling. This will negatively affect your wallet. It is an effective way of punishing yourself to stop swearing.If you lack willpower and will end up cheating and spending the money yourself, give control over the jar to a friend, sibling, or even a parent.
As the jar fills up, think of all the junk food, games, and other awesome stuff you could have bought with the money.

, Each time you swear in front of a parent or adult, pull it back and give yourself a hard snap. Doing this will teach you to associate cussing with stinging pain, which should make it easier to stop. Also consider asking a friend or sibling to snap the elastic if you cuss. Just remember that you asked them to do it!Don’t wear an elastic band that is so tight it will cut off circulation.
Avoid a super thick elastic that could break the skin.

Remind yourself verbally. Tell yourself that you respond to conflict calmly and with courtesy. Always use positive self-talk to boost the behavior you wish to use instead.;
, If you have someone you can trust, tell them about your goal. Be aware that telling someone won't work for everyone. For some people, the objective works best if it is a secret.


Don't tell someone if you think they will respond negatively.
Pick the one person you know will understand and encourage you.

, If you feel a fight coming on, immediately leave the situation. This will give you the necessary space to calm down, cool off and think clearly about how to approach the matter in a calmer way, later.


If you can, tell the person you were going to fight with what is going on. Tell them that you need some time to yourself to calm down.
If the fight is too far along to explain yourself, just leave. You can apologize later.
Go somewhere safe.
Calm down.

, Be responsible for your own words and actions. Apologizing is actually a really good learning tool, as you don't forget how it felt.


Apologize only when the other person has calmed down.
Be brief and sincere.
If they accept your apology, say thank you and move on to another topic.
If they reject you, leave again.  Apologize once more, at another time, but don't pester them with apologies. (No one likes to hear ""I'm sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry..."")

,


Tell yourself, ""It's happening again. I have to go.""
Leave.
Don't go back until you are calm and so are they.
Don't worry that by backing down you have let them win.  The winner is the one who leaves and recognizes that fighting is worthless.

,

Why did you get angry?
Why do you think they got angry?
What could you have done differently?
What could they have done differently?
How long did the fight last?
What did you fight about?
How important was (is) the fight to you?
Do you think you will continue this fight in the future?

, If your parents are yelling at you, don't yell back. Stay calm and lead by calm example.


Wait until they are done talking (unless you are getting too angry; then leave immediately).
Tell them calmly and softly that you don't like it when they yell at you.
Tell them that since you are making an effort to change your ways, you expect them to do likewise.
If all else fails, say, ""You're upset right now. There's nothing I can do to change that. I'm going to go somewhere else.  Come find me when you are calm."" Then go away.
Don't look back.

, If your anger issues become too much of a problem, it may be time to seek professional help.

,  Everyone has something they struggle with. Tell yourself, ""That was wrong. I'm going to try to fix it. And I won't do it again."" Recognize that you are doing your best.

If you have questions about an assignment, ask for help. Your parents will be happy that you’re showing initiative.
Understand homework policies. It’s important to discuss with your parents any questions you have pertaining to their homework policy.
Be able to answer questions about location, time, if friends can come over, etc. Here are some questions to get you started:

Time: What time should homework be started and how late is too late to begin working on it? Are breaks allowed?
Place: Where can homework be done and is the TV or music allowed to be on while doing homework?
People: Can friends come over to do homework?

;
, So many of today’s issues stem from technology. Whether it’s being used too much or it’s used inappropriately (which includes using it at inappropriate times, such as during school); technology can be the source of many problems and disappointments.


Turn off your phone at school. Though it's already a rule at most schools, make sure your phone is off during the day.
When it comes to social media; there are some significant obstacles for both parents and teenagers. While social media can be beneficial, it has also proven to have some horrible costs.Part of doing well in school is learning to get along with your peers. Using social media in a way, which negatively impacts another person at school is something you want to avoid.

, It should go without saying that showing up to school is the first step in doing well at school.


Many schools already have strict policies in place to prevent students from skipping school, so make sure you're following the rules.
Whether it's showing up on time or not leaving early, it's important to be present at school.

, While you may not agree with it, you should know if your parents have a curfew and what time you’re expected to be back. Discuss any repercussions for breaking curfew.


It’s important to understand both the rules and the consequences for not following them.
If you’re still not seeing eye to eye on your curfew ask your parents to consider two different curfews - one for school nights and a slightly later one for weekends.Remember that your parents are looking out for your safety. If you need further clarification as to why they have a curfew in place, politely ask them to explain it.
Show up on time, if not a few minutes early. If you aren’t going to be back in time due to an unexpected issue or something beyond your control, let your parents know.

Be honest. Don’t make up excuses as to why you’re not home if you’re just trying to spend more time with your friends. Your parents will catch on!

, Though it may not be your favorite thing to do in your spare time, more than likely, your parents expect you to do chores. Whether it’s cleaning your room or taking care of the family pets; you should understand what’s expected of you.


The question of who has ownership of a teenager's room has long divided parents and teenagers.It’s time to sort this matter out with your parents by understanding their view of your room. How often should it be cleaned? Is some clutter allowed?
Understand the timeline for completing your chores. If you’re asked to care for the family pets, for example, discuss how often they need to be fed and walked.
In the event you’re too busy with school work or after school activities, you should find out if there is any flexibility when it comes to your chores. If so, know who should take over your responsibilities and how far in advance you should ask for help.
Do your chores without being asked. Whether it’s cleaning your room before mom asks or refilling the dog’s food bowl before dad mentions it, start doing your chores without being asked.
It might help to add chores to your afternoon routine. You could start by doing your homework and once the assignments are complete, you could work on your chores for a half hour or so. That will still give you plenty of time at night, plus it will make your parents happy!

, As an adolescent, it's important to have some respect for your parents’ ground rules. Remember, it is their house.Encourage your friends to follow house rules as well.


Regardless of whether it’s taking off your shoes in the house or sitting down to eat at 6:00 PM every night; don’t feel uncomfortable about asking friends to follow the rules when they are over. Your parents will greatly appreciate you taking the lead.

, Even if you don’t have a significant other now, at some point you will. It’s important to understand your parents rules to avoid disappointing them.


You should discuss when and where it’s appropriate to entertain your significant other at home.
Discuss what kinds of dates are appropriate for your age.

, Though there are many reasons for abstaining from drugs and alcohol; often kids choose to abstain out of fear of disappointing their parents and/or as a result of their parents' positive influence in their lives.Even more importantly, both are illegal. Stay out of trouble with the law AND with your parents by abstaining from drugs and alcohol!

, It may happen daily, weekly or even monthly, but whenever it occurs be sure to show up to family meals.


Dinner provides families with the opportunity to share stories, relax and recharge with the goal of developing a sense of who you are as a family.Don't skip meals in favor of hanging out with your friends. They can wait the extra hour to see you.

, 3,700 texts a month or 125 per day are sent and received by teenagers.Chances are, a lot of those messages are received while you're at home.


Put the phone down, turn off your music and really spend time with your family.

, Spending time together provides you with better opportunities for sharing quality experiences.Spending time together helps to foster open dialogue and better communication. The more time you spend together, the easier you’ll find it to converse with your parents.
You'll also create some great memories together that you can talk about for years to come.

, Asking parents for money is a downright hassle. At least that's how half of teens (49%) feel.Take it upon yourself to look for babysitting jobs or rake your neighbor’s leaves.

Having financial independence will help you to feel better about yourself.

, There's nothing a parent loves more than seeing their child happy. What's more, you'll feel a sense of pride in your accomplishments.


Keep it within the confines of the law and the house rules. For example, if you love to travel don't take it upon yourself to go on a road trip without permission. Try planning a weekend excursion with your family instead. If you're in college, you could sign up for the study abroad program.
For high school aged kids, if you enjoy theatre, try signing up for school plays. Perhaps you enjoy drawing, so talk with your parents about adding an extra art class to your schedule.

, Though it's not the norm, there are parents who have unreasonable expectations or who are emotionally abusive. Learning to be proud of who you are and what you've accomplished is important for developing a sense of self, apart from your parents.

Don't lose control.,
Speak carefully.,
Watch your body language.,
Listen to your parents.,
Know when to stop pushing a subject.,
Don't suddenly walk away.,
Do not act aggressively.,
Apologize for misbehavior.",How to Stop Being Rude to Your Parents1," Often times we behave rudely because our emotions get the best of us. If you find yourself in a situation with your parents where you keep getting angrier and angrier, finding a way to calm down, collect your thoughts, and keep yourself from losing control is critical.


Stop and count backwards from 10 before continuing.
Take a few slow, deep breaths.
Relax your body.
Step outside the room for a few minutes and take a break.Go get a drink of water.
Ask to continue the discussion at another time when you are more together.;
, What you say and how you say it can play an important role in how people perceive your actions. If you know that you have to talk about something that is a touchy subject, try writing out what you say and imagining what their responses might be. You can even act out how the conversation might go in private so as to better prepare yourself in the event something is said that might bother you.


It is okay to pause to think or even to tell your parents you need a moment to think.
Do not try to be clever and sass back at your parents as this will only create a hostile atmosphere which could turn into a heated argument.
Avoid name calling, cursing, sarcasm, and raising your voice above all else. Try to approach the discussion as a mature adult so that you will be treated as such.Avoid statements that start with ""You,"" like ""You always,"" and ""You never,"" which can sound like accusations and make people defensive.Instead, try to use sentences that use ""I feel"" to express yourself, like ""I feel like you don't trust me because you won't let me stay out after 10 o'clock.""

, Body language refers to all of the non-verbal communication that we make with our bodies and not our mouths. Your body can communicate aggression, anger, and disrespect even when your voice and words don't. Since it makes up about 50% of the message that you send to other people, it's very important to know what not to do in order not to send rude or aggressive messages!Don't roll your eyes.
Don't make vulgar hand gestures.
Don't plug your ears or repeat after them mockingly.
Don't glare or scowl at them.
Don't clench your fists, invade their personal space, or otherwise act aggressively.
Don't cross your arms in front of your chest because it tells someone you're defensive or not listening.Try to keep yourself relaxed.

, Even if you think you already know what they're going to say or you don't agree with what is being said, really stop to listen to what you parents are telling you. Ignoring them or trying to talk over them is only going to make the situation worse. Knowing how to listen to another person is just as if not more important to the communication process as speaking.

, If your parents indicate that a subject is no longer up for discussion, let it go. Continuing to push them after they have told you to quit is only going to make them irritated, and it will likely not win you any points. Just think how you would feel if someone continued to bother you about something after you asked them to stop.

, While it is okay to need and ask for a break in the conversation and to get some space, you should never leave without saying so first. It is important to ask for permission because if you walk away with no warning, your parents may think you are trying to further disrespect them by turning your back on them and ignoring what they're saying.

, Most people know that it's not okay to hit or kick other people, but this also extends to other aggressive acts, like slamming doors or throwing or breaking things. Not only could someone get hurt, you will most likely get into serious trouble. If you find yourself regularly getting so angry that you completely lose control and want to hit, kick, or break things, you may need to talk with your parents about seeking anger counseling.

, In addition to not wallowing in bad feelings, it's important to make amends with your parents if you behave rudely. Even though you may disagree with them, your parents still care about you. When you are rude to them you may hurt their feelings in addition to being disrespectful.


An apology usually starts with an expression of regret for a specific action, such as ""I'm sorry for rolling my eyes at you."" It then acknowledges why the action was a bad thing or the other person's feelings, like ""I know that when I did that, it made you angry, and that was wrong of me."" Finally, it should express your intention to change. ""I'm working on changing my behaviors. I promise to try not to do that again.""
Apologizing for doing wrong is a mark of maturity. Not only will it help mend any broken ties between you and your parents, it will show them you are trying to be an adult, and likely it will impress them.
Although a verbal apology is usually more appropriate considering your close relationship, if you find it easier to do so you can always put it in writing.

Make sure that when you say it you actually sound like you mean it. An insincere apology is just as bad if not worse than not receiving one at all.

Get home first.,
Answer the phone first.,
If you attend a school that doesn't do either of the above, consider yourself extremely fortunate.,
Once you find out the date of your detention and the time, make a plausible excuse to your parents.",How to Stop Parents Knowing About an After School Detention," Most schools tend to send a letter home to your parents, explaining about your detention. If you happen to be one of those schools, try to get home every day before your parents do. That way, you'll be able to check the mailbox for any letters from school that will drag you into the danger zones. If you do find a letter from the school, dispose of it immediately.


Don't dump the letter into the trashcan at home, as your parents may easily discover it. Instead, toss it into the dumpster where your parents would never go rummaging through. This erases any risk of your parents finding the letter in the trash. Plus, the walk to the dumpster shouldn't be far and it's good exercise for you!






Make sure the school letter contains the reason for your detention, and not something else. It would be really bad if that letter was informing your parents about a scholarship for you, or something else.





;
, Preventing your parents from finding out about your detention gets slightly trickier when the school phones your home to speak to your parents. To get out of this, be the first to snatch the phone up and pretend to be your parents.


It's best to choose one of your parent's voices to practice beforehand. Make sure you've gotten extremely good at it before trying it. Listen to your parent speak and take note of the speed, the pitch (high or low) and the tone. All of these are very important when it comes to developing your voice to sound like your parent's voice. It doesn't have to sound exactly perfect, but well enough that the school phoning your home will be fooled.






If you're a guy, it's obviously your father's voice that you will disguise yourself with.






For girls, the whole ploy would crash and burn if you went after your father's voice, so stick with your mother's voice.







, Go up to your teacher(s) and get the date of your after school detention from them.


Asking them with a polite tone and the proper words would help, especially when they see that you're having a good attitude about it. Having a bad one will probably turn them off and they may consider increasing your time in the detention.







, Be sure it's something that you would normally do, or something that actually goes on (ex: a club); otherwise, your parents may get suspicious.


For example: if you know your math teacher is available after school for free tutoring lessons, tell your parents that you'll be in his/her lessons for a little while. Or, inform your parents that you'll be trying out a sports club that is an half-hour or hour long. If your parents ask how it went, tell them you didn't really like the club you picked, or that you think your math teacher was or wasn't good with tutoring.

Recognize rude behaviors.,
Empathize with your parents.,
Put your decision in writing.,
Figure out why you act this way.,
Find other ways to satisfy yourself.,
Reward good behavior.,
Ask your parents for help.,
Don't beat yourself up.",How to Stop Being Rude to Your Parents2," Think back to your interactions with your parents, whether they were actually arguments or regular conversations. Did you refuse to listen, roll your eyes, yell, call them names, or curse at them? All of these actions are considered rude, but there are likely others.


Ask yourself, ""If someone did that to me, how would I feel?"" If you think you would be offended, chances are what you did was rude.

, Being able to understand other people's feelings, including directly opposing viewpoints, is an important skill that takes effort to develop.Ask yourself, ""If I was my mother/father and I was on the receiving end, would I have been angry? Would I have felt hurt? What would I have done if someone treated me that way?"" This will help you understand why they reacted the way they did and help you to be less angry.

, Being able to see your decision written out will make it feel more concrete and real.It also means that you can put the written declaration somewhere you will frequently see it, like on your mirror, your laptop, or in your pocket, to serve as a reminder to you.


Make your written statement specific and descriptive. Write about which exact behaviors, such as rolling your eyes or mouthing off, you recognize in yourself that you need to avoid. Don't be afraid to add more things if you realize later there was something you forgot.

, Everybody does things for a reason whether they know it or not. You can think of this reason as your ""pay-off"" or motivation. Ask yourself, ""What am I getting out of acting this way?"" Your reason could be anything from a feeling of control in your relationship, relief from frustration, retaliation from having your own feelings hurt, or maybe even you're hoping to look cool in front of friends or siblings.

, Once you've identified what you are actually getting out of your rude behavior, you can start thinking of alternative ways you can achieve your goals. Once you no longer need to rely on being rude to satisfy your needs, you will be less likely to depend on it.


If you're feeling angry, instead of insulting or swearing at them, yell into a pillow later or make up words or fun phrases you can use in conversations that aren't swears, like ""that hoovers,"" or ""great goofy goblins.""If peer pressure is making you act a certain way, ask to have discussions with your parents privately so you can be rational.

, It's important to reward yourself for behaving appropriately. This validates you when you do well so that you do not feel like you are constantly failing. It is also additional incentive to continue to do well in the future.


A good reward could be anything from a slice of cake to a nice hot bubble bath to some small thing you've been wanting for a while.
Eventually, you should start weaning yourself off of rewards. Remember, the point here is to be good for the sake of being good, not so you can treat yourself to nice things!

, The whole point of changing your ways to be less rude is for your parents' sake, so obviously their opinions and feelings matter. Your parents can help you with this process by providing meaningful positive and negative feedback.Just explain to them what you're trying to do, and ask them to communicate with you when you do something right and when things go wrong.


Ask your parents to praise you and specifically state what you did right at appropriate times, like if you didn't raise your voice in a discussion about not being allowed to go to a concert over the weekend.
Encourage your parents to avoid ""You"" statements like ""You're being rude"" and instead use ""I feel"" statements to communicate their feelings when something goes wrong, like ""I feel hurt when you make nasty faces at me like that.""

, Everybody makes mistakes, and chances are that even after you make the decision to change, you're going to mess up. Feeling sorry for or excessively angry at yourself is just a waste of time and energy. Endlessly regretting things or hating yourself won't help you to improve. Instead, reflect on what went wrong, what you can do to make sure it won't happen again, and move on.

Keep in mind that the answer may not be what you hoped for.",How to Persuade Parents Not to Move," What are your reasons for not wanting to move? What will you lose in the move? What might you gain? Taking the time to think through all of these things will make it easier to talk to your parents about it.Spend some time alone thinking about your reasons for not wanting to move as well as what a move might be like. You may want to make notes of some of the things that you think of so that you can use them in your discussions with your parents later on.;
, Your parents probably have some good reasons for moving, but you may not know about them. If you do not know why your parents have decided that you need to move, then ask your parents to explain the reasons to you.


Try saying something like, “I think I might feel better about moving if I knew why we had to do it. Could you please explain it to me?”
Some common reasons why people move include a new job opportunity, financial difficulties, disliking a neighborhood, or the need or desire for a bigger (or smaller) home., Learn whether or not they want to move, what their perspective is, and how staying and moving will impact your whole family. Finding common ground may help you to feel better about the situation and it can also help to strengthen your case to stay put.Try saying something like, “I am really upset about the idea of moving. How do you feel about it?”

, Once you have learned more about why your parents have decided to move and how the other members of your family feel about it, you should make a list of pros and cons for the entire family.To make a pros and cons list, get two sheets of paper and draw a line down the center on each one.
At the top center of the one sheet write “Stay” and at the top center of the other one write “Move.”
Then at the top of the left column of each sheet of paper, write “Pros.” On the right side, write “Cons.”
After you have created these two sheets of paper, fill in the pros (positives) and cons (negatives) sides of each paper with as many reasons as you can. Be sure to include the pros and cons that you learned about in your conversations with your parents.
Share the lists that you have created and invite your parents and siblings to add onto them so that they will be complete. Try posting the lists on the refrigerator or in some other high traffic area so that your family members can read through the reasons and add other reasons as well.

, If the move is due to a financial reason, then it might be possible for you to contribute in some way that will make staying possible. For example, if you are old enough to have a part-time job, then you could offer to contribute your wages to paying bills. Or if you have hobbies that cost a lot of money, then you might volunteer to give those activities up to help save some money., Having suggestions and alternative strategies will be key if you want to convince your parents to stay. Look into as many alternatives as possible before discussing your feelings with your parents.


Research cheaper places to live, jobs in the area, or whatever it is motivating the move. Finances are often at the core of the decision to move.
Consider how much longer you plan to live in that home (for example whether you’re finishing school within a few months or a few years). If you are less than a year away from being able to live on your own, then talk to your parents about delaying the move.
Look into alternative strategies for keeping the residence. If your parents are interested in selling your family home and moving and you are independent. Renting or taking up residence can convert the residence into an income stream, though managing the property is often a difficult and expensive task and selling the property while not residing in it has tremendous tax implications. , Before you present your reasons, research, and alternative solutions to your parents, take some time to practice what you want to say. Try practicing in front of your mirror or ask a friend to listen to your presentation.


When you practice, remember to stay calm and control your emotions. Avoid crying or getting angry.
If you are worried that you might forget something, make notes for yourself on index cards.

, Your parents will be more willing to listen if you choose a time to talk when they are in good moods. You may know when the best time to present your case would be, such as after dinner or on a lazy Sunday morning. If you are not sure when your parents would be most willing to listen, ask them.For example, you might say something like, “I was hoping we could talk about something, but it might take a while. When would be a good time for both of you?”

, Dressing up is a well-known strategy for looking professional and getting the upper hand in a conversation, especially if you are dressed better than the people you are addressing.Your parents may also be impressed because dressing up shows that you have put in extra effort and that this is an important conversation to you.


Try wearing your best shirt with a pair of khakis or a dress that your mother picked out for you.

, As you share your reasons for not wanting to move, make sure that you throw in a couple of compliments for your parents as well. Flattery, as long as it is sincere, is an effective way to persuade people to do what you want them to do.For example, you might say something like, “I appreciate how hard both of you work to give me a great life and I know that you made your decision with me in mind.” Or, “I am so lucky to have parents who are successful and intelligent. I hope that you both know how much I appreciate you.” Try to think about what your parents might want or need to hear from you.

, It is important to demonstrate to your parents that you have given the idea of moving a lot of thought and that your desire to stay put is not just based on an emotional response to the idea of moving. Therefore, it is best to stay calm while you present your point of view and avoid any argumentative tone or whining.If you feel yourself becoming emotional about something, don’t panic. Emotional displays can be helpful to an argument, but only in moderation. Emotional displays are also more effective if used near the end of your presentation.For example, if you shed a few tears when talking about how upset you would be if you had to move away from your best friend, then that is okay. If you cry during most of your presentation, then that may work against you because your parents might interpret that as irrational behavior.

, A great way to persuade people that you are right is to hold off on one of your best points until you are almost finished. That way you can build up a strong foundation and top it off with one excellent reason. Structuring an argument this way also helps to build interest in what you are saying., Just as it took time for you to craft your argument for staying put, it will take your parents some time to process everything that you have said. Let them know that you understand that this is not an easy decision and that you respect their need to think things through. It is also a good idea to thank them for listening to you and for considering what you had to say.


Try saying something like, “Thank you for listening to me. I understand if you need some time to think about what I have said. Please take your time and let me know when you want to talk again.”

, It is possible that your parents will have an immediate response to what you have shared. In this case, give your full attention and listen well to what they have to say.


Demonstrate that you are listening by nodding your head, keeping good eye contact, and occasional making a neutral statement such as “yes,” “I see,” or “go on.”If one of your parents says something that does not make sense to you, try repeating what they have just said to allow them to clarify. For example, you might say, “It sounds like what you are saying is that moving is our best option, but that does not mean that it is going to be easy. Is that what you mean?”

, If a week or more passes and you have not heard any response to what you shared, then it is okay to ask your parents if they would like to talk again. They might have just gotten busy or they might not be sure about the best way to approach you. By taking the initiative, you will demonstrate that you want to continue the conversation.


For example, you might say something like, “If you are ready to talk, I was hoping that we could talk some more about the move. Is there any time this weekend that would work for you?”

, Despite all of your hard work, it is still a possibility that your parents will not see things your way. It may be hard for you to hear a no, but it is important to respect your parents’ decision.Try to remember that the choice to move is not meant to make your life harder, it is most likely about making your life better.

Expect that you might have consequences beyond the scolding.,
React calmly to any consequences.,
Ask your parents how to handle similar situations in the future.",How to Stay Calm when Your Parents Are Scolding You Badly2," Sometimes parents feel that a good scolding is enough to get their point across. Other times they resort to longer lasting methods such as grounding. If you are being scolded for something that your parents take very seriously, keep in mind that there may be an additional punishment.


For example, if you came home way past your normal curfew, then your parents might ground you for a week and also reduce your curfew to an earlier time.

, Try not to get upset or complain about the consequences that your parents decide on. The angrier you get, the more likely you are to make things worse for yourself.Remember to take deep breaths if you feel like yelling or showing your anger in another way.


If you truly think that the punishment is unfair, then try saying something like, “I understand that you want me to learn from this experience. However, this punishment will cause me to miss out on some of my best friend’s birthday party. Is there any way that we can compromise so that I can still attend?”

, Allowing your parents to discuss better choices with you will help tremendously. If they feel that you have made a bad choice, they will want to stop you from doing it again. The more receptive you are to talking it out and hearing their point of view, the less they feel the need to scold you.Try saying something like, “I want to make sure that this never happens again. What do you suggest that I do to avoid a similar situation?”

Do not make excuses for physical abuse.,
Know the difference between scolding and emotional abuse.,
Learn to identify sexual abuse.",How to Stay Calm when Your Parents Are Scolding You Badly3," Physical abuse is not discipline. It is a way for a parent to assert their dominance over a child or teen and instill fear. This is usually done out of anger and frustration.You can recognize physical abuse easily because it is any physical contact (e.g., hitting, biting, pushing, etc.) that causes physical injury or pain.Keep in mind that certain physical punishments are not considered abuse. For example, some parents spank their children as a way to punish them.

, Scolding is a form of discipline that can be used to verbally point out when a child does something wrong. This can be taken to an abusive extreme in some cases. Emotional abuse is present when a parent constantly belittles or shames a child. This impacts the child’s self-esteem and can damage future relationships and create lasting psychological problems for the child.For example, it would be reasonable for your parents to scold you if you ran up a huge bill on your cell phone. However, it would not be appropriate for them to call you names or to accuse you of being the source of their financial problems.

, Sexual abuse is any sexual contact between a person under eighteen and a person over eighteen, or between a much younger child and much older child. If there is any sexual aspect to the “scolding” or “punishment” this is sexual abuse. You should seek help right away.For example, if your parent touches you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, then this might be considered sexual abuse.

Sometimes, we find that our frustration can stem from different triggers and may not even necessarily be about the task at all.


For instance, if you have gotten into an argument recently with your parents, perhaps you still have some lingering resentment from that. What they have asked you to do may not be unreasonable, but you should talk to them about your feelings.
Or, however, perhaps you are frustrated about having to complete more chores because you feel that you have very little free time. Assess how much time you have aside from homework and chores and see if you think your parents are being fair with upping the requirement.;
, Take some time to write out your thoughts through compiling a list of pros and cons about the thing that your parents are making you do and the consequences if you don’t do it. This will help you assess whether or not having a talk with your parents is necessary or if you should just bite the bullet and do as you’re told.


For instance, if your parents are now requiring that you go to tutoring after school, consider the positives and negatives. For the positives, your grades will likely improve and you will have a higher GPA. A negative is that you will likely have less free time. In this instance, it would seem that tutoring would be more advantageous for you than would staying home and it might not be worth it to fight with your parents about it.

, Though you may feel too angry to speak to your parents about this issue currently, seek out the advice from an adult you look up to or who knows your parents. They will be able to give you unbiased information that may help change your perspective on your parent’s decision. They may also be able to give you advice on how to get your parents to change their minds.


Consider talking to an aunt, uncle, or grandparent.

, Remember that parenting is the hardest job on the planet. Your parents are making decisions for you based on their own childhood experience. Parents also typically act in the way that they see as best to assure your safety, health, and success. Think about the difficult decisions and sacrifices they have to make on a daily basis for you.Remember that though your parents will not always be right, they still deserve your respect and obedience.

, After you have taken the time to think about what you have been asked to do constructively and critically, think about whether or not you want to drop the issue. If you feel that your parents are being reasonable and what they are asking you to do will likely help you in the long run or make you a better person, be mature and do it. There is no shame in giving in as long as you are giving in to something that is good.

, However, if you still feel that your parents are being unfair and you have strong reservations about doing as you’ve been told, you must begin preparing what you will say to them about this issue. Typically, it is best to focus your argument around three main points to give them enough to think about, but not bog them down with grievances. For instance, if your parents are requiring that you play a certain sport that you no longer want to play, you might have the following three points in opposition to their wishes: the sport takes time away from your academic studies, you no longer enjoy playing the sport and it feels like a chore, and you would prefer spending your time doing another hobby or participating in another sport.
Your parents will appreciate if you have developed thoughtful and logical reasons for not doing something.

, Now, you have arrived at the time where having a discussion with your parents is necessary. Tell them that you have something you’d like to talk to them about and you wanted to find the best time for them. They will appreciate you for being respectful of their time and for not bombarding them with an argument.Pick a good time to ask them and do not ask right after they have gotten off of work. Parents typically like to have a few moments to themselves after a hard day at the office.
You could say something like “Hey mom and dad, can we talk for a minute? There’s something that’s been on my mind that I wanted to discuss with you.”

, Once you finally do sit down to have your chat, make sure you are as open and as honest with them as possible. It will do you no good to bend the truth or misrepresent your feelings and you will have regrets later for your lack of honesty. If your parents ask you a question about your feelings, be open with them. Remember that they love you and want to make you happy. Trust them with your truth.For instance, if they ask you if you think they are being fair, don’t say “yes” if you really believe in your heart that they aren’t.
Instead, you could say “I know you are looking out for me and doing what you think is best and I love you for that. But it doesn’t feel fair to me that I have more chores than my brother, especially since he is older than me.”

, One thing that parents respond most negatively to is having their child disrespect them. If you do so, any hopes of negotiations or getting your way will likely go out of the window because your parents will not want to hear anything else you have to say. Stay away from raising your voice at them or being argumentative. Also, be prepared for the reality that they might not let you have your way even after this heartfelt discussion.Never call them names or tell them you hate them. This will create new problems between you.

, When you are having these discussions with your parents, try to appeal to them from a logical standpoint, and sprinkle in emotion here and there for effect. They are your parents so they love you very much, but they are also striving to do what is best for you, aside from their own emotions and feelings.


For instance, if they want you to change schools because your behavior has been bad, consider saying something like “changing the school won’t help; it’s me that is the issue. My friends don’t make me act out nor do my teachers. Give me the chance to work on myself first before you make the decision to move me.”

, During this conversation, you may feel stressed, especially if you feel that your parents are not understanding your perspective. However, you must try to not get yourself worked up because it will be hard for you to articulate yourself thoughtfully and persuade your parents. Also, do not wave your arms around wildly or employ other aggressive body language tactics.


Breathe deeply during the conversation. Sometimes, when we are stressed, we tend to breathe less and that can contribute to feeling more stressed in general.
Sit with your legs and arms uncrossed. Keep hand movements to a minimum.

, Don’t be whiny or argumentative with your parents; this will not be successful for you. During this discussion, even if you are young, try to be as mature as possible, remembering to consider your parent’s perspective. Remember also that at the end of the day you are the child and they are the parent., In discussions with your parents, come prepared to discuss alternatives with them to the thing they are asking you to do. You can also brainstorm some alternatives with them if they are willing to compromise with you.


For instance, if your parents want you to go to a new school, but you don’t want to, think about ways that you can stay at your school but improve your experience and/or behavior. For instance, perhaps you can promise to stay after school for tutoring three times per week to improve your grades if that is the issue.

, Your parents may not in fact necessarily want to make you do something that you don’t want to do, but may feel that it’s in your best interest. Try bargaining with them so you can get your way at least temporarily. You could, for instance, sa “give me one month to change my behavior. If I don’t, then I will do as you ask with no hesitation. Please give me a chance to show you I can do better.”, Your parents are likely not as unreasonable as you think. All parents are simply looking for ways to make sure their kids are successful and healthy. Tap into this knowledge about your parents and find ways to get what you both want.


Perhaps they want you to change schools, but have they selected the school already? Can you have input on that? Ask them., If you are more responsible at home, they are more likely to listen to you and take your feedback into consideration when making decisions. Be a good steward of the tasks that they give you so that you will be deemed as trustworthy, dependable, and a hard worker in their eyes.


Do all of your chores without having to be asked and without complaining.
Do all of your homework and avoid conduct issues in school.

Keep your parent’s household rules.

, At the end of the day, after all of the discussing, seeking alternatives, and articulating your points, you may find that your parents still do not agree with you. They may still make you do the thing you have been dreading. Take some time to realize that this is okay. It’s not the end of the world. You have emerged from this process a better and more mature person. Honor your parents by being obedient to them."

Spend time with your mom.,
Work hard at school.,
Perform chores without being told.,
Demonstrate good behavior.,
Ask her directly.,
Begin your appeal early.,
Introduce the topic casually.,
Offer more reasons than merely opinion.,
Write a letter.,
Bargain with her.,
Be calm.,
Be grateful.,
Plan for the future.",How to Make Your Mom Let You Go Places," She really does care about you and would love to hear about what's going on in your life. Spending time with you will help her understand you better and trust you more. This will be important for when you ask her to go places.


Try talking to her about school, your friends, what you're feeling, etc.
Ask her to go to the mall, the movies, for a walk, etc.;
, As a teenager, your main responsibility is performing well in school, so if you're not already doing this, you've already given your mom a trump card to deny your requests. Hit the books to show her that you take your school work seriously.If you get a good grade, be sure to show her!
If you're not doing well in school, show her how hard you're trying by doing your homework where she can see you, or by signing up for tutoring.

, If you have chores assigned to you, don't wait to be reminded to do them. Get them done even before your mom expects them to be. This will show her that you are hard-working, responsible, and that she can trust you.Letting your industriousness surprise your mom is better than telling her how great you are for doing your chores. Let her find out on her own.
Go above and beyond. If your mom asks you to do something, do it -- and more. For instance, if she asks you to tidy your room, vacuum it, too. This shows how you're taking initiative, and she'll appreciate that.

, This goes for at school and at home: if you want your mom to trust you to go places, act mature and respectful.You don't have to be perfect, we all mess up sometimes, but try your best.


Be polite and say ""Please"" and ""Thank you.""
Don't get into fights at school.
Respect your mom's friends by listening to them when they speak and politely engaging them in small talk.

, Approach your mom with a calm disposition and without whining. Appeal to her reason first, and only to her emotions as a last resort.


Ease into your appeal by phrasing it with words like, ""I was wondering if..."" or ""Would you consider letting me go to..."" Don't be blunt and phrase it like ""Mom, I want to go to...""
Make sure your mom is in a good mood when you approach her. If she's in a bad mood, wait until it subsides, or do something nice to make her happy -- but do it out of care, not manipulation.Include all the details about where you want to go: who will be there, how long you'll be there, how you're getting there and home. The more you can offer in terms of details, the more comfortable your mom will feel about it.
Remember to keep the drama to a minimum: once you've lost your cool and are shouting, your chances of success are minimal., If you want to go someplace on Friday, start your appeal to mom on Monday.You don't want her to feel pressured or rushed into giving an answer. Otherwise, she'll probably say no because she doesn't have time to think about it., Don't just come right out with the question, ""Can I..."". Be diplomatic. Introduce the topic in conversation, but don't linger on it. You're just planting seeds of thought.For example: if you want to go to the mall, you can bring up the time when you two went together, how fun that was, how your friends are thinking of going, and how you'd like to go again.
Another example: if you want to go over to your friend's house, you can mention that your friend brought up the possibility of hanging out later in the week, and that she/he was going to ask her/his parents. See what your mom says, but don't state it as though you're presuming you will be able to go.
If you just can't help yourself, and you do ask if you can go, don't push for an answer if your mom is hesitant. Let her think about it.Not being insistent and stubborn is a sign of maturity, and your mom will notice this.

, One reason why your mom might say no to your request is because it's just your opinion pitted against her authority. To anticipate this, do some research relevant to your request and be prepared to cite it.Although it involves some extra work, creating a PowerPoint presentation or an informational sheet about where you want to go will impress your mom and show her that you've really thought this through.If you make an informational sheet, leave it where your mom can find it and read it on her own time., If you're not comfortable asking your mom face-to-face, a letter is a thoughtful way to let her know what you want to do. Think of your letter as a persuasive essay, covering the reasons why you think you should be able to go. Don't just rely on your own opinion: do some research and include some other, informed opinions in your letter, too.


In your letter, be sure to address your mom's concern for your personal safety, as this will be one of her reasons to say no.
Make the tone of your letter loving and earnest: tugging at your mom's heartstrings too much might make her feel manipulated.
Include lots of details about the circumstances of why and where you want to go. If you leave no questions in her mind, then she's likely to feel more comfortable with letting you go., Tell her that you think you're ready for more responsibilities around the house, as well as being allowed to go somewhere.Bargaining will probably only work if you're already meeting your other obligations, such as your chores.


Make sure that you can and will follow through with whatever you bargain with. If you don't, then you'll lose your mom's trust.
An example way of phrasing your bargain is, ""Mom, now that I'm years old, I was hoping you could begin trusting me with my responsibilities and independence by assigning me other roles around the house, and perhaps letting me go places, such as this week.""
Another example of phrasing your bargain is, ""Mom, now that I'm older, I was hoping you'd trust me to go places, such as this week, and in exchange for your trust I'd start taking on more responsibilities around the house.""
When coming up with bargaining ideas, consider all that your mom has to do every day. Taking some of the load may be appreciated and considered thoughtful.

, If she refuses, find out why she's said no and respond accordingly. Do not ever throw a tantrum or start whining about how unfair your mom is being. Only bratty children do that, and that's not the impression you want to make.


An example way of responding to a ""No"" is, ""May I ask why you don't want me to go?""
If your mom pulls the ol' ""Because I said so"" card, don't flip out. If she's pulling that card, it's because she hasn't got a good reason. Give her more time to think.

, Whether she says yes or no, be grateful for either her trust, or her concern. This is a very mature way to behave, and she will be impressed.


An example way of responding to a ""Yes"" is, ""Thank you so much, mom, it means a lot that you trust me enough to go to .""
An example way of responding to a ""No"" is, ""I understand. I appreciate your concern for my safety.""

, If your mom finally gives you an absolute no, it's best to accept it gratefully and show your maturity rather than to flip out and show your immaturity. Ask her how you could improve or grow so that you could be able to go in the future. This question alone will impress her.

Demonstrate good listening skills.,
Maintain a positive tone.,
Steer clear of arguments.,
Ask questions.,
Talk to your parents about how they treat you.",How to Make Your Parents Stop Treating You Like a Kid1," Listening well is an important part of being perceived as an adult. Work on your listening skills to help your parents see you as a mature person.When you are listening to someone speak, maintain good eye contact, nod your head to show that you are hearing what the other person is saying, and use neutral statements to express interest, such as “I see,” “go on,” and “yes.”;
, Frequent complaining and a negative attitude may make you appear less mature to your parents. To prove that you are mature, do your best to maintain a positive tone at all times. When telling your parents about your day, focus on the good things that happened and minimize the bad. Also ask them how their day has been, and if their day turns out to have been not so good, show sympathy.Avoid whining or making critical remarks as much as possible. These behaviors are seen as a mark of immaturity.

, Do your best to avoid getting into an argument with your parents. Although you may still have an occasional disagreement with your parents, do not instigate an argument if possible. Instead, do your best to be agreeable and compromise with your parents if something seems unfair to you.For example, if your parents have requested that you be home by 9pm, do not complain or accuse them of being unfair. Try saying something like, “I don’t mind being home by this time most nights, but I was hoping to stay out a little later tonight. Would 10pm be alright?”

, If you do not understand the reasons behind something that your parents have asked you to do, then ask for clarification. Asking questions is a good way to improve communication and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Make sure that you phrase your question in a way that expresses what you need from them.For example, if you have a 9pm curfew, and you think it is unfair, try asking something like, “I know that you care about my safety, but I am still a little confused about why I have to be home by 9 tonight. Can you help me to understand why you want me home by then?”

, It is possible that you parents are not aware that they are treating you like a child, so you may need to just bring it up. Try talking to them about how they treat you and ask them if it would be possible for them to stop doing certain things.For example, you might say something like, “I appreciate how much you both try to help me, but I feel like I am old enough to take care of these things myself. Would you mind giving me a little more freedom to handle things on my own?”

"
"
Participate in household tasks.,
Get a job.,
Wake up earlier.,
Take good care of yourself.",How to Make Your Parents Stop Treating You Like a Kid2," One way to demonstrate that you are mature is to participate in household tasks without being asked to do so. This demonstrates maturity by showing your parents that you have selfless qualities and that you want to help out.For example, if your parents often ask you to load the dishwasher after dinner, don’t wait for them to ask. Just start doing it as soon as you finish eating your dinner. Seeing you take the initiative will make your parents see that you are mature enough to know what is expected of you and to do it without having to be told.
Going above and beyond your normal responsibilities is another good way to help your parents see you as a mature person. For example, if your mother normally does your laundry for you, start doing your own laundry.

, Having your own money to save and spend is another great way to demonstrate maturity.By taking on a full or even just a part time job you will be earning money that is yours to spend as you like. Maintaining a job over a long period of time is another great way to show that you are responsible and mature, so try to maintain the same job for as long as you can.Good money habits also demonstrate maturity, so do your best to save most of the money that you earn. Avoid making impulse purchases or spending money on things that your parents might consider wasteful.
However, if there is something that you want and you have saved enough money to purchase it without depleting all of your savings, go ahead and buy it for yourself. Your parents will be impressed that you worked hard and saved for something that you wanted instead of asking them to get it for you.

, Waking up early is a good way to demonstrate responsibility and maturity. People who wake up early also tend to be more productive.Try to wake up around the same time as your parents do and do something productive right away. Work on a project for school, go for a run, or help out with household chores.


Get into the habit of setting a daily alarm and waking up as soon as it goes off. Otherwise, your parents may have to wake you up and that may cause them to perceive you as irresponsible.

, Eating healthy, exercising, getting plenty of rest, and demonstrating an overall interest in your physical well-being is another great way to show your parents that you are mature. Some other ways that you can take good care of yourself include:


staying drug-freeshowering every day
wearing nice clothing
getting regular haircuts
brushing and flossing your teeth twice daily

"
"
Find your own place to live.,
Maintain a healthy distance.,
Be more self-reliant.,
Try not to care as much about what your parents think.",How to Make Your Parents Stop Treating You Like a Kid3," If you are old enough to move out on your own, then you may want to consider it as a way to improve your relationship with your parents. It may be difficult for your parents to see you as an adult until you have moved out of their house.


Before you do anything drastic, make sure that you are financially able to live on your own and that you are ready for the responsibility. Living on your own can be expensive and difficult.
If you are not quite ready to move out on your own, consider asking your parents if you can help out by paying for your own car insurance, paying one of the utility bills, or even paying them a set amount for rent. This will help to show them that you are mature and give you some good practice for living on your own., Whether you are still living at home or living on your own, it is important to maintain a healthy distance from your parents. Make sure that you keep an active social life with your friends, work hard in school and/or your job, and pursue hobbies and other interests that do not involve your parents., The less that you demonstrate your parents that you need their help, the more they will begin to see you as an adult. Try to avoid asking your parents for things if you can including advice, money, and stuff. If you have a problem, try your best to solve it on your own before going straight to your parents.Of course, sometimes it may be necessary to turn to your parents for help. If your parents do give you something or help you to solve a problem, be gracious and thank them for their help.

, Keep in mind that although you may behave like an adult and even be a legal adult, your parents may always view you as a kid because you are their child. Try your best to focus on yourself and not to be so concerned about what your parents think of you. Remember that your opinion of yourself is what matters the most."
"
Never look angry: The first thing mothers notice about you is your facial expression.,
Keep your voice steady: Yes, sometimes mothers say the most tactless and stupid things which make you realize how ignorant they are.,
Don't resort to violent physical behavior This means don't kick walls, don't bang your head on the table, don't slam doors, don't chuck objects hardly on the ground, and do NOT hurt your brothers or sisters.,
Do not whine or grumble: Right away your mum will assume you are tired - and tiredness is associated with moodiness.,
Do not behave embarrassed when you and her are in public: As I said before, mothers are sometimes ignorant.,
Escape when necessary: Your anger, irritation, impatience and frustration is building up in a sealed bottle, (not literally) and it's about to explode under the extreme pressure.",How to Not Appear Moody when You're With Your Mother (for Teenagers)," Isn't it obvious? When you hop into the car after a fantastic day they immediately ask why you look so happy. So try to keep a straight or calm face while talking to them. NO scowling, frowning, pouting or sulking. If you look like that, they'll most likely get mad and irritated and hey- the fight is on!;
, This will probably raise your temper and increase the urge to yell at them. Don't. Instead take deep long breaths and reply to their chatter calmly. Never sound impatient or become snappish because they will snap back and trigger the verbal attack. OH yeah, no swearing. Saying ""What the hell/what the EFF/Bloody hell/etc"" is not permitted here.

, Your mum will know you're venting your anger on the objects around you and what's more, she'll probably scream at you for damaging the furniture which in turn will set off the battle.

, Also don't sigh heavily too often or yawn loudly. Because this annoys exhausted mothers and make them snap at you - which will obviously prompt a row.

, Sometimes teens feel ashamed to present their mothers to their friends, and sometimes show obvious signs of embarrassment when with them in public. I want you to know that mothers are hurt deep down (did I mention that they are also sensitive?) when we do this. So, when she's at your school recital, or friend's house, or supermarket with you; do not brush her off with snappy remarks, do not attempt to walk away from her, don't rudely ditch her to be by yourself, & do not embarrass or humiliate HER about her ignorance - because it will get back to you at home.

, To word it easily; Your tolerance is at end, anytime now all your grumpiness will burst forth from you in one go. This is the time to GET AWAY. You've been doing so well at disguising your moodiness, and you really don't want to ruin all your efforts at the last minute. As you can't take anymore of your mother, make an excuse to get away ( Toilet, homework, computer, telephone-friend, walk, shower,... whatever) & slip away into your own company to deal with your moodiness alone. I know it sounds miserable- but hey! At least your mum will still give you your weekly allowance, permission to attend that sleepover, transport to and from school, and self-freedom.

Be honest about your plan.,
Be enthusiastic about what you want.,
Don't lie about what you're doing.,
Assure her you'll be home on time.,
Have a plan in place for anything that could go wrong.,
Bring up times when you earned her trust.,
Remind her that you only live once.",How to Talk Your Mom into Saying Yes1," A mom's worst fear is that you'll get hurt - that's the main reason moms tend to say ""no"" when you want to do something. But if you want to turn your mom's fear on its head, all you have to do is tell her all about your big plan and convince her she has nothing to worry about. Give her details about how safe it is and show her how you've already worked out all the details. Once she sees it isn't really risky, she'll probably say yes!


Always know what you are talking about. If, for example, it's a movie, then you should know the rating of the movie (M, MA, MA15+/ U, PG, 12, 15, 18 etc). If you're underage and you're seeing a more mature movie, don't mention the movie unless they ask. Just mention the type of movie, like comedy or thriller.;
, Tell her how what you want to do is going to really improve your life. If you want to go to a concert, you'll gain valuable life experience. If you want to be allowed to stay up late, tell her how you'll use that time to do something productive. If you want more time with your friends, tell her that your social life needs a boost. If you want a new pair of shoes, show her how shabby your old ones have gotten.

, It might work the first time around, but when your mom finds out you lied she's going to say ""no"" next time. You don't always have to tell the whole truth - you can leave out details that no moms need to know - but blatantly lying? Next time you want something, might as well not even bother asking!

, How you will reach home is going to be key.Tell her your plan for getting home and give her an exact time you'll be there. Remind her of other times you came home right on time without any problems.

, Moms love seeing their kids plan ahead. Think through what could happen and tell her you've already got it covered. For example, if your friend leaves without you, have a different plan for getting home.

, If you've already done things to earn your mom's trust, remind her.Talk about how well you've been doing in school, how much you've been helping around the house, how you always reach home on time and don't complain too much about the chores you have to do. If you've broken her trust, work to earn it back by doing what your mom tells you for at least a week before you ask her for something.

, Say ""Mom, remember that concert you went to that has changed your life? You were my age that year.""Talk up the fact that youth is fleeting and you'll only get so many chances to have fun before you grow up and leave the house. She'll start feeling emotional and nostalgic, which will likely lead to a ""yes"" before you know it.

Do well in school.,
Do your chores.,
Get home on time.,
Cook a meal or bake a cake.,
Be extremely nice.",How to Talk Your Mom into Saying Yes2," If you always do your homework and get decent grades, what's your mom's excuse for saying no? Exactly, she doesn't have one. Do your best in school and in your extracurricular activities so that your mom sees how much you deserve the treat you want.

, Take a bit off the load off your mom by helping her clean the house, do the dishes, mow the lawn, walk the dog, and all the other little things she does to keep the house running. If you're asking for something big, doing some extra chores doesn't hurt. Go above and beyond a few weeks before you pop the question.

, Being reliable is the key. If you deceive your mom and you're always late, she's not likely to give in when you want something. Do your best to get home when you say you will and be reliable in other ways. If you say you'll have your room clean by Saturday, have it done. If you say you'll feed the cat, do it without needing to be asked a second time. Your mom will notice how reliable you've been.

, Your mom will absolutely love it if you surprise her by taking over the kitchen and cooking something for her and the family. Get up early and cook some scrambled eggs and pancakes for breakfast, or use your free afternoon to bake up a cake or some cookies for everyone. It sounds weird but it really works.Just make sure you clean up afterward.

, Ask her about her day. She probably asks you about yours, so why not reverse it and see what happens? Your mom will be touched, and more likely to say yes. Take it to the next level by telling her about how things are going in your life and letting her in on what you've been thinking about. You will be shocked at how much more likely she'll be to let you start making more decisions on your own.

Earn money to pay for what you want.,
Compromise if you need to.,
Don't say ""everyone else is doing it"".,
Don't beg.,
Make her laugh.,
Don't forget to say ""I love you"".,
If that doesn't work, ask your dad.

",How to Talk Your Mom into Saying Yes3," If you want to go to a movie or you'd like a new game or toy, offer to do some chores around the house in exchange for the money you need to pay for it. Your mom might be so impressed at the offer that she'll go ahead and say yes.

, Say you really wanted to go to a party, but your mom is stubbornly saying no because she doesn't want you to be out that late. Why not offer to come home an hour earlier? If it goes well, maybe the next time she'll let you stay out as late as you want.

, Kids say this all the time, but does it ever really work? Moms don't care much about going along with the crowd. Only say this if you're asking for something that literally everyone else is getting to do, and have a list of people your mom respects who get to do it. Be ready to have your friends back you up if your mom says she wants to call them or their parents.

, It'll just make you seem immature, making your mom feel like she's making the right decision in saying ""no"". You've got to give her a good reason to say yes, and begging is just annoying. If you cannot get her to say ""yes"" in any way, a guilt trip might come to your rescue in the end. Use statements like ""No, it's okay. Love you mom."" and walk downstairs. Later she will come to tell you that you can go, because you just let it go like a mature person.

, Lighten things up by telling a joke or teasing your mom to make her laugh. Even if you're upset she's saying no, saying something funny can turn things right around. It shows your mom that you realize it's not the end of the world, and you're not going to throw a tantrum like a little kid. Who knows, her enhanced mood might make her change her mind.

, It works like a charm to make moms feel happy. Don't let it sound fake - say it like you mean it, even if you're feeling mad. The power of these three words cannot be underestimated!

Try to get away from danger.",How to Tell if Your Parents Are Abusive," There are several things to consider when you're trying to figure out if your parents are abusive. The biggest factors are generally why your parent struck you and how much force they used. Was your parent trying to teach you not to do something dangerous, like running into the street without looking? This type of punishment is sometimes acceptable, as long as it does not get extreme or excessive. Hitting you to take out frustrations is considered abuse, and so is hitting you too hard and with great force.Were you hit because your parents thought this would stop a behavior they don't like?
Do your parents ever hit you after they've been drinking alcohol or after hearing bad news?
Have your parents ever used an object to hit you, like a belt, tree branch, coat hanger, electrical cord, or anything other than an open-palmed hand on your behind?Do your parents ever lose control while they hit you? For example, does a simple spanking turn into slapping you in the face or punching you?
Do they ever pin you down and hold you there?;
, The laws on child abuse are very different, depending on where you live. In general, though, one of the biggest factors is often whether or not your parents' acts of violence caused any lasting physical damage to your body.Your parents may be abusing you if you have any of the following after your parents ""discipline"" you:


Cuts or scratches
Bruises
Bite marks
Burns
Welts (swollen lumps and bumps on your body)
Muscle sprains
Broken/fractured bones

, Neglect is a form of child abuse. It can be very hard to tell whether your parents are neglecting you, especially if you've never lived with any other parents or caretakers. There is also the question of how much money your family has — your parents may be struggling to keep you clothed and fed, not because they are neglecting you, but because they have economic challenges. Ask yourself the following questions to start to figure out if your parents are neglecting you and your siblings:

Are your parents always well-dressed and well-fed, but unwilling to get you clothes that fit properly or to make sure you have food?
Do your clothes and shoes fit you okay? Are they clean and warm or cool enough for the weather?
Do your parents keep you clean by having you take regular baths/showers? Do they make sure you brush your teeth and comb your hair?
Do your parents keep you and your siblings fed? Or do you often go without eating enough food?
When you get sick, do your parents take you to a doctor and give you medicine?
Are disabled children (you or a sibling) having their needs met? Are basic needs like food or water dependent on meeting a certain standard?
If your parents leave the house, and no siblings are old enough to babysit, do they have someone older come and watch you? Or are you left alone and allowed to play in unsafe places/situations? How long are children left alone?

, Any type of sexual contact between an adult and a minor is considered abuse. An adult might make threats or use their position of power (as someone most people normally trust, like a coach or teacher) to bully or frighten a younger person into having sex or other sexual activity.If your parents watch you undress (without helping you get dressed), take pictures of you without any clothes on, touch the areas of your body that are private in a way that makes you scared or uncomfortable, or pressure/force you to look at or touch their private parts, that is sexual abuse.


Sometimes being touched sexually can feel good, which can be confusing. The person doesn't have to be hurting you for it to be sexual abuse., Not all sexual abuse leaves a physical injury, but many acts of sexual abuse do leave bruising, bleeding, and other injuries. Sexual abuse can also cause sexually transmitted infections and even pregnancy in some cases.Common symptoms of sexual abuse include, but are not limited to:


Difficulty walking or sitting because of physical painBruises, pain, or bleeding from your penis, vagina, or anusPainful discharge during urination or other sign of an STD, frequent yeast infections or urinary tract infections, Parents should not be exposing you to pornography, or creating pornography about you. Some of this involves grooming, or exposing you to sexually explicit content, to make you more open to doing it. Or they may use videos/images of you for sexual use, by themselves or others.

Exposing you to pornography on purpose (videos, photos, books, et cetera)
Videotaping or taking photos of you naked, for sexual purposes
Writing about your private parts

, Sometimes a child is sexually abused by another child. When this happens, it is usually because the first child is reenacting abuse that was forced on them. Most children do not have an understanding of sex, so generally if another child forces you or a sibling to engage in some type of sexual behavior, it's usually a sign that the child was abused by someone.Talk to a trusted adult if you think someone you know is a victim of sexual abuse, just as you would talk to a trusted adult about your own parents abusing you.

, Your parent might yell at you to stop you from doing something dangerous or bad, but this one-time incident doesn't necessarily mean you are being verbally abused. But if you experience repeated name-calling, shaming, or threats, then this is considered verbal abuse or verbal assault.Your parents yelling at you or scolding you does not count as verbal assault. That type of discipline is usually appropriate and has a purpose, as long as it doesn't get out of hand.
If your parents are constantly screaming or saying mean things to you, even when you haven't done anything wrong, they are emotionally abusing you.
If your parents talk down to you, shame you, or make fun of you on a regular basis, they are emotionally abusing you.
Any verbal threats made towards you, your siblings, or other family members are also acts of abuse.

, If a parent gives you the silent treatment, tries to make you feel bad, or tries to cut you off from having other people in your life (like friends, uncles, aunts, and grandparents), this can also be emotional abuse.If your parent refuses to look at you, refuses to acknowledge you as their child, or refuses to call you by your real name, that is emotional abuse.
If your parents refuse to touch you, deny your physical/emotional needs, or say mean things to make you feel bad, they are abusing you.

, Isolation means cutting you off from friends, family, or other people who are important to you. They may isolate you from only certain people they disapprove of, or from people in general. This may be an attempt to stop other people from influencing you, so they can keep you under their control.Not allowing you to be friends with people, simply because the parent doesn't like them.
Not allowing you to have friends over, or visit friends' houses
Disallowing/ignoring your requests to leave the house or do an activity, even though they have the time/money to do so
Monitoring phone calls and other interactions
Criticizing people in order to alienate you from them
Pulling you out of clubs or even school because they don't like the people you're exposed to

, It is wrong for parents to belittle you, say they don't want you, or criticize your personality (as opposed to your actions). There's a difference between saying ""you hurt your sister's feelings"" and ""You're a mean and terrible person."" An abusive parent may make you feel unwelcome in the family.Saying they wish you were never born, or that they had aborted you
Name-calling
Saying they wish they had a different child instead of you, such as a boy instead of a girl, or a non-disabled child instead of a disabled one
Making fun of your looks or abilities
Wishing you would die
Talking about how bad/difficult/awful you are, either to your face or to someone else right within earshot
Talking about how you have ruined their life
Kicking you out of your home

, Corrupting means exposing you to something that is illegal or very harmful, and possibly encouraging you to do it.Encouraging you to steal, do drugs, cheat, bully, etc.
Giving you drugs or excessive alcohol, or doing this in your presence (letting an eight-year-old sip beer to know what it tastes like is okay; letting an eight-year-old drink the whole bottle is not)
Encouraging irresponsible promiscuity
Encouraging you to harm yourself or others

, Parents should be reasonable when holding children to standards. For example, four-year-olds should not be expected to do laundry, ten-year-olds should not be expected to care for younger siblings for the weekend, and many disabled children should not be expected to do the same things that their non-disabled peers can. Responsibilities and expectations should be based on a child's developmental level.Expecting you to do things beyond your developmental level
Making you care for a family member when you are too young or otherwise not able
Blaming you for others' behavior
Expecting you to do an unreasonable amount of household chores

, Being terrorized by your parents means feeling threatened or unsafe. Parents terrorize children to make their kids feel fearful.Putting you, a sibling, a pet, or a favorite toy in danger, as a punishment for something you did
Extreme, unpredictable reactions
Being violent to a person, animal, or object in front of you (such as throwing a glass against a wall, or kicking a pet)
Yelling, threatening, or angrily cursing
Holding you to high standards and threatening to punish or hurt you if you fail
Threatening to harm you, themselves, or others
Abusing someone else in sight or earshot of you

, Abusive parents may embarrass you or invade your privacy, and obsess over whether you are doing things they don't want. They may be the ""my house, my rules"" type.


Making you do something embarrassing
Looking through your phone, diary, or browser history
Removing the door from your bedroom
Videotaping your punishment to post on the internet
Making fun of you
Following you around when you are with friends

, Gaslighting is when an abuser tries to convince a victim that the victim's experiences aren't real, to make them doubt their own sanity. For example, maybe an abuser hits a victim and calls them lazy, then the next day says that the victim made that up. Gaslighting includes:


Calling you crazy or a liar
Telling you ""that's not what happened"" or ""I never said that""
Saying that you're exaggerating
Telling others that you are delusional, or otherwise unreliable and not telling the truth
Moving things around and insisting that nothing has changed
Saying ""you did that on purpose"" when you make a mistake

, The first step to reporting abuse of any kind is to talk to an adult you can trust. That adult can listen to you and help you figure out whether your parents are abusing you. Talk to a trusted family member (like an aunt, uncle, or grandparent), a close friend of the family, a teacher or counselor at school, or a trustworthy neighbor.


Tell the adult exactly what happened, and explain any circumstances surrounding the incident. Did anything lead up to it?
The adult you talk to should be able to figure out whether your parents are abusing you.
If the adult thinks that your parents are abusing you, she should then contact the police. If the adult tells you it's abuse but doesn't call the authorities, you should do so yourself.
A school counselor should know who to contact and how to make sure you are safe. She may also have training to help you begin coping with the abuse.

, If you know that your parents have abused you or are continuing to abuse you, you'll need to contact the police or other authority so that you can be taken to a safer place. You can call the police if you need help right away, or call a help hotline to report ongoing cases of abuse.

Call 911 if you think your parent is about to hurt you. Your parent might show signs that you know mean they're going to attack you — maybe it happens when they've been drinking, and you can smell the alcohol, and hear yelling. Whatever the signs may be, if you think you are about to be hurt, call 911. The police will be able to come to your home and stop your parent from hurting you right then and there.
Look up the phone number for your local Child Protective Services office. You can find this number in the phone book or by searching online — but make sure your parents don't know that you're looking up this number.
Call a crisis hotline. The Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 1-800-4ACHILD (1-800-422-4453).

, If you are in immediate danger and have called 911, try to hide someplace safe until help arrives. Lock yourself in a room away from your parent (with a phone, if possible).

You may also be able to run to a neighbor, friend, or family member's house."

Dyeing your hair could get you into some trouble with your parents and it will likely be difficult to hide from them. Consider if dyeing your hair is something you want to do despite any consequences you might expect.Consider your parent's reaction if they caught you with dyed hair. What might they say or think?
Think about how it might be difficult to dye your hair in secret and then keep it hidden.
Ask yourself if the new hair color is worth it.;
, It's more likely that you will be caught if you dye your hair an extremely different color than what your hair is normally. Try to dye your hair a color that isn't so different from your normal color to avoid being caught.Dyeing your hair slightly darker or lighter won't draw too much attention and may help you keep it hidden.
Drastically changing your hair color, especially to an unusual color such as purple, will be very difficult to hide.

, Some hair dyes are very long lasting, requiring you to wait for it to grow out, cutting it out, or dyeing over it. Other hair dyes don't last as long and can be washed out if needed. Consider using less temporary hair dye to lower your chances of getting caught and to allow you to remove it easily if you are.The longer your hair is dyed the greater your chances of being discovered are.
Temporary dyes can be removed by washing them out of your hair.
Permanent hair dyes cannot be washed out.

, Before you actually dye your hair you will need to select a style and color that you are most comfortable with. Certain styles or colors will be easier than others to keep a secret. Review the following examples of hair dye styles to get an idea of which one you might want to try:


A drastic change or unnatural color will be very difficult to keep hidden.
Getting a single streak of color can be a good way to dye your hair and keep it secret.
You might consider getting highlights. Highlights can give your hair a new look while still blending in, giving you the chance to keep them hidden.
Dyeing your hair a slightly different color than your natural shade can be a good way to keep your new color hidden.

, Once you have selected the new hair color you are interested in it's time to dye your hair. You can visit a professional hairstylist to dye your hair for you or try to dye your hair yourself with a store-bought kit. Both options have their pros and cons so consider which method would work best for you.


Dyeing your hair at home with a kit can be done. However, using a home dye kit can also increase the chance of undesirable results.
The chemicals used in hair dye can be harmful if applied incorrectly. Misusing a home hair dye kit can result in injury.
Visiting a hair stylist can get you great results but may cost more than a home dye kit.
Some hairstylists might require a parent's permission before they will dye your hair.

, Most hair dyes will have a distinct odor that most anyone can smell. If your parents use the bathroom after you are done dyeing your hair or even walk by the room there is a chance they may smell it. Cover up the scent or work to remove it to prevent anyone from smelling the dye.


Turning on a fan or vent can help pull the scent of the hair dye out of the room.
You may be able to use perfumes or deodorizing sprays to cover up the smell.

, After you finish dyeing your hair you will need to clean up your hair, scalp and the bathroom. Making sure that you clean up all evidence that you dyed your hair can help keep you from being caught. Fully clean up the area after you are done dyeing your hair.


Don't leave any dye packaging out in the open or on top of the trash.
Make sure none of the dye has dripped onto the floor, sink or has been left on any towels.
You may have some dye stains on your ears or scalp. Try to wash these off or cover them up until they fade.
Make sure the shower is cleaned up and there are no dye drops or stains left.

, If you have dyed your hair you will need to keep it hidden. By covering up your new hair color you can help avoid or at least delay getting caught by your parents. Try wearing some of your favorite hats, hooded sweatshirts, or bandannas to keep your newly dyed hair a secret.


If anyone asks why you are wearing a hood constantly you might try saying you've been feeling chilly lately.
Hats are easier to wear outdoors and may look more normal there, drawing less attention.

, You might want to try openly asking your parents about dyeing your hair. Even if you suspect that they might not allow you to dye your hair, you may be surprised by their answer. By asking your parents you will know exactly where they stand on the issue.Your parents may actually allow you to dye your hair.
You could also learn how seriously they feel about the issue.
If your parents are strongly opposed to you dyeing your hair you should consider this before dyeing your hair in secret.

, If your parents won't allow you to dye your hair even after you asked you might still be able to negotiate a compromise. Talk with your parents to learn if there are any options that you can both agree to when it comes to dyeing your hair.


There maybe another color that you are both comfortable with.
Your parents may agree to a temporary dye.
Try asking for something simple such as highlights or a color streak.

, If your parents agree to letting you dye your hair you should have help when you do so. Either have your parents help you or take you to a professional hair stylist to make sure your hair dye is applied correctly and safely. Getting some help will allow your new hair color to look the best it can."

Consider the things the parent says to their child.,
Understand that a toxic parent demands their child’s attention.,
Recognize that toxic parents are selfish.,
Remember that a toxic parent is very negative.,
Look for signs of explicit abuse.,
Give yourself a safe space to vent.,
Remember that it isn’t your fault.,
Reach out to people you trust.,
Leave if necessary.,
Distance yourself from the relationship.,
Understand that there may not be much you can do.,
Try to remember that they are human.",How to Identify Toxic Parents," A toxic parent will make their child feel bad about themselves. They might criticize their child constantly and harshly, and many toxic parents are dismissive of their child and the child’s accomplishments. A toxic parent is very negative and may often yell at their child. However, more sophisticated toxic parents may be more subtle in the way that they criticize and abuse their child. They may deliver criticism along with niceties or in a deceptively sweet way.


One classic example of this is when a child brings home a good grade on a test. The child might say, “Look! I got an A- on my math test!” A toxic parent might respond with, “Well, why didn’t you get an A+?” This undermines the child’s hard work and leaves the child feeling that the parent is disappointed in them.;
, Children of toxic parents often end up being the parent in situations where the toxic person wants the attention of their child. This is most likely to occur when the parent is feeling upset or worried about something. Unfortunately, most children are not ready to deal with the responsibility of their parent’s happiness, nor should they be.A parent’s biggest responsibility towards their child is to care for the child, not the other way around.

, A toxic parent isn’t able to set aside their ego when arguing with their child. Instead, they might give their child the silent treatment until the child begs for forgiveness. A toxic parent doesn’t care about how their child feels, they care about how they feel. This can be difficult for a child to deal with, especially at a young age because they don’t have the ability to understand why their parent is behaving this way.For many toxic parents, this also means that they feel they need to control everyone else. In order to be happy, a toxic person needs to get what they want, so they aren’t afraid to make other people (their children included) feel bad in order to get what they want. They also might not even be able to identify other people’s emotions and be unaware that their behavior is having a negative effect on other people.

, Everyone gets in a negative mood at some point or another, but a toxic parent rarely says anything positive. A toxic parent will usually take this to the other extreme. Nearly everything that comes out of their mouth will be a complaint about something. Many of those things will be a complaint about their child or children, and they won’t be afraid to let the child hear it.Negativity breeds negativity. A child who grows up around a parent who is constantly negative will likely develop the same attitude. On top of that, they will feel bad about themselves because they heard so many negative things about themselves from their parent.
Keep in mind that some toxic parents will be perfectly pleasant with everyone except for their children.

, Though it may not always be the case, a toxic parent is likely abusing their child verbally to some degree. In some cases, this may be constantly criticizing the child, or it may be more complex mind games that make the child feel that they are a bad person. In some cases, the abuse may go further. A toxic parent may physically or sexually abuse their child.Hitting a child in any way (including spanking) is physical abuse.When it comes to children, any form of sexual touching is considered sexual abuse.If you suspect that the child of someone you know is being abused, you should contact the authorities, even if you aren’t sure. Some signs to watch for include sudden changes in behavior, extreme withdrawal, acting out or attention-seeking, appearing disheveled or unclean, and wearing clothing that is not weather-appropriate. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to a situation such as this. You can contact the police, child protective services (CPS), or the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) if you need help finding the right people to contact.
If you are a child who is being abused, tell someone. You can tell a teacher at school that you trust, or you can call the police. If you are too afraid to do either of those, you can also call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233). They also have a website where you can live chat with someone if you don't want to call. The website is http://www.thehotline.org/help/.

, When you have to live with a toxic parent, it can be really difficult to deal with the emotions that come with that. You might feel very angry about the situation. Having a place to let off steam is a good way to deal with the negative emotions that come along with that. One great way to do this is by journalling, but make sure to keep your journal in a secure location where your parent will not find it. You can do this is a written diary, or you can type a document on the computer if you prefer. In the journal, you can write anything you want.If you want to, you can use the journal to identify negative patterns that might help you deal with your toxic parent. Write down events that affect you, and think about how you might be able to deal with these types of events in the future.
In the journal, try to write down positive things about yourself, too. If your parent is making you feel bad about yourself, it is important to give yourself reminders that you are not a bad person. You might make mistakes, but so does everyone else. Each day, try to write down one thing that you did that was good. It may seem silly, but it can have a huge impact on the way you see yourself. You can also ask friends and family members to add to this list. It can be uplifting to hear positive things about yourself from other people. Just make sure to avoid any family members who your parent may have influenced with a narrative about you because their view of you may be skewed.

, Toxic people are often very difficult to be around. They seem to have a talent for spreading negativity and often leave everyone feeling bad about themselves. Unfortunately, many toxic people are the way they are because they grew up around toxic people. The way your parent behaves is not your fault. You should be proud of yourself for recognizing that your parent is toxic. This gives you a chance to break the cycle because you understand that your parent’s negativity has nothing to do with you.


You should also remember that the only person you can control is yourself. As a child, it isn’t your responsibility to keep your parent happy; however, you are not living in a healthy parent-child relationship. In this case, the only thing you can do is take care of your own behaviors and your reactions. Thus, it might be helpful to write down ways in which you can handle situations in your journal. Write down past reactions, too. How might you have reacted better? This is not an exercise in self-loathing, rather it is a proactive way to try to give yourself a bit more control over the situation., You could try to talk to your toxic parent about your feelings, but it may not do much good, especially if they don’t recognize their own toxicity. The next best thing you can do is to reach out to a trusted adult friend or family member who can help you deal with the situation. Reaching out to a counselor is another good option and you can provide your parent with a “safe” reason for wanting to talk with a therapist. Whoever you choose, talk to them about how your parent makes you feel, and ask if they have any advice.This is also a good idea because another adult may be able to act as a mediator between you and your parent. Having another adult present if you want to talk to your parent can be helpful because the parent is less likely to simply brush you off, saying that you are a kid and that you don’t know anything.

, Unfortunately, if you are under the age of 18 and living with a toxic parent, you may just have to deal with the situation as best you can. However, if you are living with a parent who is abusive in any way (emotionally, physically, or sexually), you need to leave immediately. There is no justification for abuse, and there is no reason that you should stay. Go to a friend or trusted family members house. If you have nowhere to go, try going to a neighbor’s house.If you are being abused, you should contact the authorities immediately. If you are afraid to call the police, you can also contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by phone at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233). You can also go to their website at http://www.thehotline.org/help/ to chat with a representative. This is completely confidential, and they can give you advice on what to do, where to go, and who to call.

, When it comes to dealing with toxic parents (or toxic people in general), the best thing you can do for yourself is to distance yourself from them, whether you are the child of that person or an outside person. It may not be possible to cut off all contact with them, but you can do your best to stay out of their path.If you are over the age of 18, you are legally an adult. You can leave your parent’s home and never look back if you want. If you do hope to maintain a relationship with your toxic parent, you could consider explaining to the parent why you’re distancing yourself. This might encourage your parent to get the help they need; however, you should also be prepared for a parent who has no interest in changing.
Make sure to evaluate whether or not cutting off your relationship with the parent is worth it or if you would miss the relationships that you might lose in the process, such as with your other parent and/or siblings. It may be worth it to stay in the relationship to better maintain these other relationships.
In some cases, it may be best for you to cut off all contact with your parent. Especially if it is clear that they have no interest in doing anything differently. Go out and find people that treat you well and make them your family. Many people find friends that they treat as family. This may be painful, but in the long run, you will likely be happier and healthier for it.

, Whether you are a child of an abusive parent or someone close to the family who sees what is going on, it is important to realize that there may not be much you can do to change the situation. The only person that you have any control over is yourself. A toxic person will only change when they recognize the error of their ways, and if they are ready to put in the work to change the way they think and behave. Unfortunately, not many people have this kind of self-awareness.If you are a close family friend, you could try talking to the toxic parent about what your concerns, but this will be a difficult conversation, and the parent may end up just pushing you out of their lives. If you suspect that the child is being abused, it is safer for everyone involved if you contact CPS or the police about the matter, rather than trying to deal with the matter yourself.
Keep in mind that emotional abuse can be hard to prove if there is no physical or sexual abuse as well. Keep a list of anything you have observed as evidence that emotional abuse is occurring.
If you don’t think you can talk to them about it, you could try being the child’s ally. If it is appropriate, you can give the child the encouragement they need to feel loved and appreciated. Having at least one person in their life that is positive will be better than nothing.

, It can be really difficult to feel any empathy for a toxic person. Indeed, they make it very difficult. Try to remind yourself that this toxic person is a human being, who is likely in a lot of pain, whether they realize it or not. Remember that this pain they are feeling has nothing to do with you. Remembering this can give you a dose of compassion that might make it just a bit easier to deal with them when you have to.That said this doesn’t mean that you have to stick around dealing with them all of the time, nor is it an excuse for their behavior. If you are becoming depressed trying to deal with a toxic parent, it is OK to walk away. Your own well-being should be your top priority.

Your parents probably don’t do all of these things, but it’s important to pinpoint exactly what kind of behavior they are exhibiting that is bothering you. Common behaviors include:


Undermining. For example: ""I thought you might mess up the order, so I bought it for you.""
Insulting. Example: ""You look fat in that dress""
Underestimating or writing off.Example: ""You're probably not going to be a good sprinter.""

Blaming.Example: ""It's your fault your coworker was harassing you – you always wear sexy shoes.""
Making excuses for someone. Example: ""It's alright to eat junk food. You had a bad day.""

Making unfavorable comparisons. Example: ""Your cousin Jimmy is always on the honor roll. Why aren't you?""
Hostility, threats, or verbal abuse.
Ignoring someone.;
, Think about your parents’ behavior in the past and try to figure out what kind of negative treatment it is. It might be helpful to make a list of specific incidents where your parents behave in a negative way.


This will help you pinpoint the negative behavior so that you can talk about it more clearly.

, If your parents’ negative behavior is fueled by their love for you and their desire to see you succeed, then you are in a better position to have a conversation with them about how their negativity makes you feel. If your parents don’t have good intentions, this conversation might be more difficult.


Negative behaviors driven by good intentions can include things like trust issues, being overprotective, or coddling.

, Sometimes negative behavior is because of a misunderstanding or due to a personality conflict. These types of negative behavior are usually resolvable with a little communication and effort. But if your parents are abusing you, you might need to take more drastic action.


Abuse includes physical abuse (hitting, kicking, using physical force to restrain, etc.), verbal abuse (insults or cursing that make you feel bad), and emotional abuse (anything that doesn’t make you feel safe and loved – this can be from abandonment, threats, etc.).If you think you are being abused, you should tell an adult you trust. Another family member, a teacher, a school counselor, your pastor – these are all good options.

You can also call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline for help (1-800-422-4453).But make sure you don’t falsely accuse your parents of abuse. There is a big difference between parenting/punishing and actual abuse. And an accusation like that could get your parents in serious trouble.

, Try to pick a time when they are in a good mood. If you start a conversation like this when they are already angry, it will not go well for you. If necessary, ask your to schedule a time., It is important to be open and honest. Tell you parents clearly what you want to talk to them about by making an observation about their behavior that bothers you.


For example: ""Mom and Dad, I've noticed you make disparaging comments whenever I talk about my college plans.""

, You need to provide examples of their behavior that hurts your feelings so that your parents can’t dismiss your observations right off the bat. You can refer to the list you made of instances when they behaved negatively toward you if you find it helpful.


Say: ""For example, you told me I shouldn't join the science club because you think I'm bad at Biology.""

, It is important not to make this conversation all about placing the blame on your parents.You need to take responsibility for your part, but also tell them about your feelings. Explain why you're hurt because your parents may not be aware of how their behavior affects you. Discuss your feelings, but don’t get overly emotional.Use ""I feel..."" statements. For example: ""I feel hurt and devalued when you compare me to Cousin Jimmy. I feel like you're saying my hard efforts are no good.""
Defend yourself. Say: ""I'm confused when you scold me for making a mess. I always pick up after myself, and my room is organized.""
Ask why the parent is doing the behavior. They may have a misguided idea, and think they're doing the right thing.

, Ask nicely, and if possible, provide an alternative.Tell your parents how it makes you feel and that you would like for them to try to stop making you feel that way. Give them an alternative solution to their current behavior.


For example: ""I would like you to stop blaming me for the behavior of my little brother. I'd rather you address his problem with talking back rather than claim that I'm setting a bad example when I'm clearly polite.""

, Sometimes it is hard for people to hear that they are making mistakes or hurting someone else – especially for a parent to hear that from their child. If your parents get upset, make excuses, or become defensive with you when you try to talk to them, be sure to remain calm. Let them say what they want to say, but remind them that this conversation is about how their actions make you feel.

, It may take your parents a little bit of time to process this new information about how their behavior makes you feel. You’ve been thinking about it for a long time, but it might come as a sudden shock to them. Give them some time to adjust and figure out how to change their behavior on their own.

, If your parents refuse to acknowledge the problem or change their negative behavior, it might be time to seek outside advice. Ask your parents to attend a counseling session with you or talk to the pastor at your church together. Sometimes having another adult to listen objectively can really help solve the problems.

, Think about times that your parents have acted negatively toward you and consider if their behavior is warranted by some past action of yours.Even if you have changed, you might need to work on showing them that you have changed.


For example, if you used to sneak out a lot, but have changed your behavior, your parents might be suspicious of your whereabouts and constantly think that you're up to no good. Since their suspicious are founded on previous truths, talk to them about it.
Say something like, ""Dad, I know I snuck out a lot last year and got into trouble. I realized that was really dumb, and I've cleaned up my act and stopped hanging out with those people.""
Keep up your responsible behavior to show that you're serious., Think about the circumstances under which your parents treat you negatively and try to determine if there is a specific cause behind it. If there is a misunderstanding, address this.


For example, if your parents get annoyed when they think you're not listening, say: ""Mom, I know you think I'm not paying attention because I'm looking at this book, but I really am listening to you.""

, If your parents treat you negatively every time a certain thing happens, try to figure out what this thing is. Maybe they see something that you’re not aware of and you need to learn how to prevent these situations in the future.For example, if your parents become negative every time you get a phone call from a certain person, ask them about it. Maybe they overheard a phone conversation in the past that they didn’t approve of and they are worried about you. The only way to clear up any confusion is to talk about it.

"
"
Make sure you understand what they're angry about.,
Apologize.,
Listen to them and don't interrupt.,
Avoid yelling!,
Choose your words carefully.,
Accept the consequences, at least on the outside.",How to Help Your Parents Understand Your Point of View in a Fight," If you don't understand what you did wrong you won't be able to argue your point. If you need clarification, don't be afraid to ask. Asking why they're angry is not at all shameful, but actually makes you seem like you really care from your parents point of view.


Go over the choices you made that led to the reason they're angry at you. Instead of trying to justify them, try to see what negative consequences each of them came with.
Understand that what might seem little to you may seem much larger to your parents, who's main purpose in life is your welfare.
Try to see it from their point of view. Once you understand what you did wrong, ask yourself a few questions that might help you understand your parent's feelings. Does it make sense to you? Can you see how someone could be angry about what you did? Put yourself in their shoes and try to see where they're coming from.;
, It is not weak and does not show weakness to be able to apologize. Try to mean the apology. If you find it hard to apologize meaningfully think of yourself as apologizing for making them angry, not for doing whatever your did. If you can apologize it shows them that you are mature enough to do so, and they will calm down.


Restate what you did wrong in your apology. By saying what you did wrong it shows that you are aware of what choices you made, not only that you regret them.
Allow them to hold on to it. Just because you apologized doesn't mean they have to forgive you right away. Understand and accept that sometimes an apology isn't enough to be forgiven.
Restate the negative consequences of your actions in your apology. Show that you understand that doing the wrong thing brings negative effects, like broken trust or resentment. Sometimes just saying you're sorry isn't enough to heal a relationship, and showing your parents that you understand that will help them be more willing to hearing your side of the story.

, Listen to what they say and then when they have finished say ""I understand what you're saying, but..."" It does not help you at all to talk over them, it just causes them to raise their voice. Then you raise you voice to be heard again and pretty soon everyone is yelling.


Don't justify your actions. This means that you cannot blame anyone else for what you did, only yourself. Don't make excuses.
Explain the reasons for your actions. There is a difference between making excuses and explaining yourself. Talk to your parents about what you were thinking when you made the wrong choices, but don't try to prove to them that what you did wasn't wrong.

, Yelling intensifies emotions. The last thing you need right now is for your emotions to be running higher than they already are. When you yell at your parents it can seem like you're being disrespectful to them, even though you're just trying to be heard. When you're parents yell at you in can be hurtful and feel insensitive, when they're just trying to be heard. Believe it or not, you can have a serious conversation without raising your voices.


A good way to keep from yelling is think of it like a game. No matter how low your parents are talking, make it your goal to talk lower. This ensures that you will never be yelling, even if they start.
Never do anything that may seem disrespectful to keep yourself from yelling, like coughing, eating or turning around so you don't have to face them. Though these methods may help you restrain from raising your voice they also might be perceived as you not caring and being disrespectful.

, Begin your argument with these words: ""I understand why you're angry, and I understand how you could be angry about that, but..."" Then begin arguing your point. When you do this, don't try to argue a point that isn't worth it. If you know you can't win, then don't even try. If its worth it then choose your words with care. Find a few reasons your parents should supports what you did, or not be angry about it.


Like previously noted, don't try to justify your actions. Don't try to convince your parents that you didn't do anything wrong, just try to show them that all children, teenagers, even adults make mistakes.
Bring them into the conversation. Ask them to share stories about when they made mistakes that they regret or that made their parents angry. Causing them to experience a nostalgic memory might help soften them up a little, and remembering their own mess ups will help them see that what you did was normal.
Don't lie. Lying doesn't help at all, it only holds the fight off for a few weeks. You will always be caught in a lie, it is inevitable. Tell the truth, even if it means you will get in more trouble. Everything will be over quicker.

, If your parents punish you say ""I understand."" Wait till they are out of the room before you have any large reaction. It won't help you at all to have a tantrum or start sobbing. If you stay calm for the whole fight it will impress them and make you seem more mature. They will restrain from fighting again, or will at least speak to you like a more mature adult next time you fight.


Often parents yell or threaten harsh consequences because they're nervous. Subconsciously, it can be hard for them to deal with your tantrums. By being more mature and accepting the consequences they give you it will show them that they can talk to you about your mistakes without worrying about your reactions.
Don't punish them. The worst thing you can do is give them the silent treatment or blow them off. Listen to them, understand them and accept it. Next time, they'll go easier on you because they remember how mature you were the last time you fought.
Give them time to get over it. Understand that they won't forgive you as soon as you apologize. You made a mistake, and that was your choice.

Ask them about their life experiences.,
Join in on a hobby.,
Cook them a meal.,
Go to church with them.,
Share your life with them.",How to Show Your Parents You Love Them1," It’s sometimes difficult for a child to remember that their parents have lives, too. What’s more, it can be hard to believe that their lives didn’t always revolve around you and your siblings. Sitting down with your parents and asking them about their lives shows you care and take an interest in them. You may even learn something about them you never knew before.


You can begin the conversation by saying, “What was it like for you growing up?” Or you could say, “I think it’s really cool you went backpacking across Europe. What was that like?” The most valuable thing you can offer your parents is your time, and they will really appreciate your doing so.;
, A great way to bond with your parents and demonstrate affection is by doing something they are interested in. If your parents have interests or hobbies, participate with them. Activities are much more enjoyable when you have someone doing them with you, especially when it is your child. They will appreciate you showing interest in what they like and the time you’ve taken to engage with them.


For instance, if they enjoy sports, strike up a game with them. If they attend a book club, ask if you can join. Spending time with them while they are doing something they love will create happy memories for all involved., There’s a good chance your parents have been cooking for you your entire life. Now is the chance to turn the tables. Give them the night off and cook a meal from the heart—even if it’s macaroni and cheese!


Don’t worry if your meal isn’t perfect. Your parents won’t mind if your cuisine isn’t five-star. They will only appreciate the time and effort you put into meal., If your parents attend religious services, one of the most thoughtful ways to show you love them is to attend services together. There’s something special about sharing your faith and worshipping with others, especially parents and your children. This heartfelt gesture will surely be something they remember for a long time.Make it a weekly thing, if possible, to attend devotional or other spiritual meetings with your parents. You can even learn meditation together.

, Parents, particularly after children become teens or adults, often feel excluded from their children's lives. Make an effort to include your parents in what's happening with you. This could be by sharing essays or projects you did at college, inviting them to the kids' birthday parties, or asking them for advice about dating.


Introduce them to your friends.

, Calmly approach your parents so that you can talk about the problem. Your goal is to determine why your parents took your phone away. If you don’t know why your phone was taken, you will not know the best way to get it returned.


Give yourself time to cool off. Do not talk to your parents when you are angry with them for taking your phone.

, When your parents talk to you about what you did wrong, make sure you are truly listening to them. Avoid thinking about what you want to say in response.

Avoid worrying constantly about your children.,
Give children the opportunity to take small risks.,
Watch from afar.,
Limit telephone contact.,
Start letting your children make small decisions.,
Avoid labeling your children.,
Let your children choose their own interests.,
Encourage your children to form their own opinions.,
Allow your children to do things on their own.,
Don't answer every cry for help.,
See if your child can solve his own problems at school first.,
Focus on listening.,
Stop protecting your children from consequences.",How to Stop Being a Helicopter Mom or Dad," While it is understandable that caring parents would be concerned about bad things happening to their children, worrying too much can be extremely damaging. The first thing you need to do if you want to stop being a helicopter parent is to relax and accept the fact that you will never be capable of protecting your children from all of the dangers in the world.This may be easier said than done, so a good first step is to stop letting your kids know that you are worried about them. Try to avoid constantly asking them questions about whether they can handle things or how they are coping. This is likely to create anxiety for them.;
, Kids who are too confined to ""safe spaces"" miss out on many developmental opportunities. If you want your children to learn how to navigate the world, they need to be able to step out of their comfort zones sometimes.This may mean allowing them to try skateboarding, even though they might fall and scrape a knee. It may also mean allowing them to go out for a short time without your supervision.
It's fine to protect your children from taking big risks. For example, if your child wants to ride his bike on the highway, it's reasonable for you to intervene.
If you teach your kids about how to protect themselves from dangers, you should feel much better about allowing them to take risks. For example, you may teach your children how to safely cross a street, or to always wear a helmet when riding a bike.

, There's nothing wrong with wanting to keep an eye on your children to make sure they're safe. After all, there are real dangers in the world that you need to protect them from! Luckily, you can keep an eye on them without being a helicopter parent; simply take a few steps back and give them a little extra space. It helps if they don't know that you are always watching.This works best for younger children, especially when they are playing with their peers, like at a playground. As your children get older, you may have to let them out of your sight more often.

, If your children are older, you need to set boundaries regarding the amount of contact you have with them. For example, if your children are in college and are calling you to let you know how every class went, they need to learn to be more independent.If your children do not live with you, try talking to them a few times a week instead of a few times a day.
Consider letting your children call you instead of calling them.
This applies for younger children also. You do not need to be calling or texting them while they are at school.

, When encouraging your children to start making decisions for themselves, you can start very small. For example, you may want to let your children decide what they want to wear to school instead of choosing their outfits for them. The more accustomed they are to making small decisions for themselves, the better prepared they will be to make more important decisions.Consider asking for your children's input on family decisions as well. For example, if you are planning a family vacation, you may want to ask them where they would like to go instead of choosing the destination by yourself.

, Labeling your children can cause them to feel a lot of unnecessary pressure to live up to your expectations. Instead of telling them what they are or what they should be, give them the freedom to explore different paths. For example, avoid telling your children that they are ""the smart one"" or calling them things like ""the future scientist.""Try not to be hyper-focused on your children's future success, especially if they are very young. This will only cause undue anxiety.

, Instead of choosing the extracurricular activities that you think will give your children the best competitive edge, allow them to choose which activities they will participate in. Likewise, you should allow your children the freedom to choose their own classes in school, rather than telling them what classes they need to take.If your children don't seem interested in trying new activities, you can still encourage them to do so. Try looking for opportunities that will allow them to test out a new activity without making a big commitment. For example, instead of signing them up for six months worth of dance lessons, pay for the classes individually and allow them to decide if they want to continue dancing after they have tried it a few times.

, It's healthy for children to think for themselves and form their own opinions. They might not always agree with you, and that's okay. Let your children know that you respect their individual opinions and that you encourage them to be independent thinkers.Be respectful when they express opinions that differ from your own, and teach them to be respectful as well. Differing opinions do not need to lead to an argument!

, Helicopter parents often swoop in and do things for their children, even though the children would have been perfectly capable of doing it on their own. This increases dependency and deprives kids of the chance to try things for themselves, so give them a chance to figure it out.If you're having a hard time with this, start with small things, like letting your children dress themselves or make their own lunches. Once you get more comfortable with them doing everyday activities on their own, you may feel better about letting them deal with more complicated situations on their own too.
If you know that your children do certain things for themselves when they are at school or with the babysitter, hold them to that same standard of independence when you are around., If your children are used to your helicopter parenting, they may be accustomed to running to you for help whenever something is challenging or doesn't go their way. This will not help your children learn and grow, so avoid running to their aid right away.If your children are in immediate danger of any kind, help them right away!
It may help to count to ten in non-emergency situations. For example, if your child asks you to help him with a puzzle, tell him you'll be there in a minute. Then count to ten, while he takes some more time to work on it himself. He might just figure it out without your help.

, While there's nothing wrong with contacting the school to help resolve an issue, you should always ask yourself if your child would be able to handle it without you first. If the answer is yes, allow your child the opportunity to deal with the situation before you intervene.For example, if your child is having a problem with another child at school, do not intervene right away. However, if your child is being bullied, you should intervene right away.


This is especially true if your children are in college. You should only contact the school in extreme situations.
Some signs of bullying include coming home from school with injuries, losing personal belongings, having frequent headaches or other complaints, not wanting to go to school, losing friends or withdrawing, feeling helpless, losing self-esteem, talking about running away or committing suicide., You probably don't want your children to think that you don't care about their problems because you aren't offering to help solve them. Luckily, they don't have to feel that way at all; you can still be supportive without being overbearing. The next time your children come to you with a problem that you think they can handle on their own, take time to listen to how they are feeling about it instead of immediately offering to help. They may just need some time to talk through the issue and figure things out.If your children seem stuck, consider asking, ""What do you want to do about this?"" instead of, ""What do you want me to do about this?""

, Helicopter parents often want to protect their children from being hurt or feeling bad about themselves, which often means that they intervene in order to shelter them from the consequences of their own actions. This kind of parenting prevents kids from learning from their mistakes, so let your kids experience negative consequences.Instead of protecting your kids from consequences, talk to them about what they can do to solve their problems. For example, if your son got a bad grade in math class, ask him what he is going to do to improve the grade instead of calling his teacher to complain about it.
If this is hard for you, start with something that has relatively low stakes. For example, if your daughter cannot wake up on time to make the bus, you may not want to choose a day when she has a final exam during first hour to stop bailing her out and giving her a ride.

Tidy up the home.,
Offer transportation.,
Handle repairs.,
Pay for what you can.",How to Show Your Parents You Love Them2," If you live at home, make sure you take an active role in keeping it clean, particularly your room. But your parents will appreciate if you do the laundry, clean the dishes, and generally pick up after yourself and others. Helping to keep the home clean shows a lot of respect and it takes some of the load off of your parents.


If you don’t live at home, stop by once or twice a week to help out. Do a couple of loads of laundry or dishes, run the vacuum around the house, or cut the grass for them., You were probably the recipient of your parents’ taxi services for most of your life. Now, you can return the favor. Offer to take them to where they need to go, especially if they are aging and driving has become difficult for them. Even if they are still able to drive well, having someone offer to chauffeur them around is a sweet gesture.


Remember to stay respectful, especially if your parents are older. They may not like the fact that they need help driving. Asking their permission to drive them around, instead of telling them that you are, can make a big difference in how your offer is received., As your parents age, they may be unable to take care of their home as well as they could before. Instead of having them call a handyperson to make household repairs, offer to do them yourself. If you are unable to, hire someone yourself so that your parents don’t have to spend the money.


Your parents may not be forthcoming about what they need help with because they don’t want to burden you. As such, you may have to ask them directly how you can help. If they still won’t tell you, you may have to do some inspecting of the home yourself, or ask other family members if they know if something needs to be done., Your parents have likely been paying for you for a long time. If you have the means, treat them when you can. Taking them out to dinner or paying for a vacation together is a great way to thank them for what they’ve done and to show your affection.


If you have elderly parents who are on a fixed income, pay some of their bills if you are able to. Or you can pay for groceries, expenses for their pets, or whatever you can to take some of their financial burden off of their shoulders. Or, if you notice they are struggling, attempt to work out a plan with them to help manage their finances."

Tell them often that you love them.,
Write it down.,
Give them a hug.,
Make them a present.,
Call them.",How to Show Your Parents You Love Them3," You may assume that your parents already know you love them. Even if this is true, it’s nice to hear those three little words. Tell your parents you love them whenever you can. You may be amazed at how happy it will make them., Although telling someone how much you mean to them in person is great, there’s something about putting a pen to paper. Write your parents a letter thanking them for all that they have done for you. Having it on paper allows them to look at it whenever they want to remember your thoughtful words. It may also be easier for you to express yourself in this way, rather than saying it to them face-to-face.You could also write a poem or short story to express your gratitude and love. They will likely appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this gift for them.Another option is to send a nice e-card with a personal message if you are not the creative type.

, Touch is the most basic form of communication among humans. As a baby, your parents comforted you when you cried. As a growing child, they may have nursed your bo-bos or caressed you after a nightmare. Unfortunately, touch as a form of affection is often lost as children grow older. Offer your parents a hug to show your love.


The act of hugging releases a bonding hormone that reduces stress and helps fight off physical illness. Hugging your parents more often could actually benefit their health., No matter what their age or their children’s ages, parents usually love homemade gifts. They understand that it takes more time and consideration into making a present than it does to purchase one. Even if the present is less than perfect, they will still appreciate the gesture.


You could paint your parents a picture, make them a card, take a portrait of them and put it in a frame, or even create a sculpture. Or, you can just dedicate an entire day to spend with them one-on-one., If you’re away at college or otherwise living outside of the home, don’t forget to connect with your parents. A simple phone call once or twice a week to check in and let them know how you’re doing shows just how much you care about them.


Your phone calls don’t have to be long. A few minutes of your time is often enough. However, ensure that you are engaged in the conversation. Calling them when you are spending time with others, driving, or are preoccupied in other ways makes it seem that they are secondary. Give them your full attention and they will appreciate that you put them first.Talk with your parents to decide how much telephone contact you all are comfortable with. Some parents may not enjoy talking on the phone as much, while others might like a weekly chat.
Be sure to check what times work for them.

Determine the owner of the phone.,
Correct your wrongdoing.,
Consistently meet your parents’ requests.",How to Get Your Phone Back when Your Parents Take it Away2," If you do not pay your phone bill, you must understand that the phone is not yours. Make an effort to respect the rules that have been put in place. If you are unclear about these rules, discuss them with your parents.

, Your parents are likely to give you a set of expectations that must be met in order to get your phone returned. Work diligently to meet these expectations.


For example, if your phone usage costed your parents a lot of extra money, they might request that you pay that portion of the bill. Find odd jobs and chores that you can do to earn some extra money to pay off that debt to your parents.
If your parents took your phone away because of poor grades, study every night to ensure that your grades improve. Show your parents your next test grade to prove that you are taking your grades seriously.

, You need to prove to your parents that you take their concerns seriously and will not repeat your mistake. You can prove this to them by repeatedly meeting their requests, instead of simply meeting them when you get in trouble.


This will also prevent your phone from being taken away in the future.

Use your phone at responsible times.,
Avoid exceeding your monthly phone plan.,
Respect your parents’ boundaries.",How to Get Your Phone Back when Your Parents Take it Away3," Once you get your phone back it is important to use it properly. Have a discussion with your parents on when you can and cannot use your phone.Discuss a phone curfew. Decide on a location that your phone will go at night to be charged. Determine if this curfew is different on weekends or weekdays.
Avoid using your phone when you are at the dinner table, in class, or driving. By understanding these basic phone etiquette rules, you are demonstrating responsibility to your parents.

, If you do not pay your phone bill, you may not totally understand your phone plan. Your phone bill will be considerably more expensive if you exceed your phone plan. Discuss this plan with your parents.Figure out if you have unlimited minutes or a cap on your monthly minutes.
Determine how many texts or picture messages you can send per month.
Know how much data you can use and how to avoid going over your data limit.
Ask your parents if you have any roaming or international calling restrictions. It might cost more to make calls or send texts out of your state or country.

, When your parents set boundaries for your phone usage, respect those boundaries. This is key to preventing your phone from being taken away again. Use your phone responsibly.

Keep an open mind.,
Discuss where to go from here.,
Consider going to counseling.,
Validate their presence in your life.,
Be there for them.,
Keep realistic expectations.",How to Repair Your Relationship With Your Estranged Parents," As difficult as it may be to come to terms with, the first step to reconciling with your estranged parents is acknowledging the part you may have played in losing touch with them to begin with.Don’t blame yourself for the rift that developed, but be willing to acknowledge and accept that some of the blame may be yours for the time you’ve spent apart.
The only way you and your parents will be able to reconcile is if you are each willing to shoulder some of the responsibility.;
, It can be difficult to empathize with the pain of estranged parents. You may still have some very difficult feelings to work through, and when something or someone hurts you, it can be difficult to see beyond our own pain.Remember that sometimes the decisions we make when we’re hurt aren’t always good ones.
Losing touch with a child can be especially painful, even if they don’t act like they’ve been hurt. Remember that not seeing the pain doesn’t mean it wasn’t there.

, Understanding what your parents were going through when you stopped communicating can help you forgive them, and appreciating what they may be experiencing now will make it easier to find common ground when you meet.Your parents may have been experiencing a low point in their lives when you stopped talking. Remember that parents are nothing more than people, and people struggle with internal and external challenges.
All of the feelings of fear and anxiety you have about reconciling with your parents are probably going through their heads too.

, This is an important step that you will need to come to terms with at your own pace. You parents may have done things that truly hurt you, but by trying to consider their perspective and acknowledging that they have felt pain regarding losing you may help you to overcome the desire to blame them. Remember that blame won’t solve anything now, only love can.Acknowledge that you and your parents all share at least some responsibility for losing touch, but that doesn’t mean blame needs to be assigned.
Instead of placing blame, focus on the future and how good it will feel to have your parents back in your life.

, While seemingly simple, choosing a place to meet is important because you want to make sure everyone is comfortable and that you can speak without time constraints. Depending on how you and your parents feel, you may choose to meet at one of your homes or maybe a restaurant for dinner.Ask them if they have any preference as to a place you can meet. Depending on the nature of your relationship they may prefer a public place over one of your homes.
Meeting at a restaurant offers everyone the ability to leave when they wish, instead of waiting for others to leave their home. That way if things get uncomfortable, you can excuse yourself.
Try to choose a time and place that won’t limit the time you can spend talking so you aren’t forced to end your conversation earlier than you each wanted.

, You may be tempted to simply act cordial when you meet with your parents for fear that you may lose touch again if you demonstrate any negative feelings. While it’s important to be polite, you need to be able to voice how you feel in order to begin the healing process.Use “I” statements like, “I felt abandoned when you left.” This keeps your emphasis on you and how you felt.
Avoid making accusatory statements like “you never cared.” Instead say, “I felt like you didn’t care.” This allows for the possibility that you can only fully appreciate what was going on inside your mind and that you’re willing to hear what was going through theirs.

, You might regret some of the things you said or did before losing touch with your parents. If that’s the case, tell them so. Saying sorry can make you feel significantly better, and it can help make your parents feel more comfortable as they begin to understand that you are willing to accept a share of the responsibility.No one wants to feel attacked, and by acknowledging that you made mistakes and that you’re sorry for them, you invite your parents to do the same.
Apologizing can make you feel better too. If you’ve felt guilty about something for many years, apologizing can feel very freeing; like taking a weight off of your shoulders.

, You may have an idea of what you hope will be said, or things you hope will happen when you meet with your parents, but try not to place too much emphasis on what you hope will happen. Instead allow things to progress naturally without being disappointed that they didn’t live up to your expectations.You may be surprised by some of the things your parents have to say. Keeping an open mind will limit the chances of feeling let down that things didn’t progress exactly how you’d hoped.
Everyone processes their feelings in different ways, and sometimes it may take a little longer for some people than it does for others to come around.

, After meeting with your parents, you may want to bring up what comes next before you leave. You may want to set a time and place where you can meet up again. Saying you’d like to continue to see one another can help you and your parents both understand that you hope to end the time you spent without each other in your lives.Your parents may be surprised and pleased to know that you’d like to see them again and that your meeting isn’t simply a one-time thing.
Remember that healing will take time, both for you and for them. Setting up another time and place to meet in the future will give you each time to process what has gone on and come back again fresh.

, If you and your parents feel it is necessary, you may want to seek out the services of a family counselor that can help you and your parents work through some of your more difficult feelings.


Counselors can offer suggestions for things you and your parents can do to reconnect after so many years apart.
Working with a counselor can help ensure your conversations don’t stray into unproductive or hurtful territory like blaming one another and not trying to understand each other’s feelings.

, Giving your parents validation for their presence in your life can help strengthen the new bonds that you are creating. Ask them for advice on things they know a lot about, or let them help you with a project around the house.


Giving a productive reason for continued interaction with your parents can help you establish new and beneficial emotional connections with them.
Your parents likely want to help, so by making subtle gestures like simply asking their opinions on what new car to buy, what color to paint your living room or where to get a good deal on a new grill can make them feel like they’re bringing something positive to the table.

, As your new relationship develops with your parents, remember that positive relationships are two way streets. You may want your parents to be there for you as they haven’t been in a long time, but they may also be struggling with emotions that they aren’t sure how to deal with.Be patient and understanding when your parents open up to you about their struggles.
Say things like, “I’m here for you, that’s what family is for,” to emphasize the bond you are recreating with them and that it’s a relationship you are willing to work to maintain.

, Remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither are good relationships. There will be challenges, hurt feelings, and maybe even arguments as you work to re-build your bond with your parents. Allow your relationship to develop as slowly as it needs to, and allow your parents (and yourself) an opportunity to take a step back and process your feelings at your own pace.


Don’t expect everything to feel better right away. Long standing emotions take time to dissipate.
Your parents may not respond as quickly as you do, or you may have trouble overcoming some feelings that they don’t. Respect that each of you will have to process your new relationship in your own way.

, There is a wrong time for you to have this conversation. You need to be in a state where you don't think you're going to explode at her with rage, but instead will be able to discuss what changes you would like her to make in a calm and mature manner, as this way she will not be able to have a go at you for trying to deal with the situation.

Staring blankly at your parents as they speak will likely upset them. You should nod and display appropriate expressions, so they know you are listening, and not tuning them out.
Ask questions to clarify and check your understanding. This will demonstrate that you are processing what they are telling you. For example, you could say something like, ""I'm hearing you say that you're angry that I stayed out past curfew without clearing it with you. Is that right?"";
, When it is time for you to talk, use the whole message formula to avoid misunderstandings. Start your statement with an observation of facts. This is usually a description of a behavior. Then explain what you interpret that behavior to mean and how that makes you feel. You should finish with what you would like to happen to focus the discussion on resolution.For example, ""I ditched school to hang out with friends. I knew it was wrong, but I was thought it would make me seem cool. I was afraid I would be teased and embarrassed if I didn't go with everyone else. I would like some help coming up with good ways to resist peer pressure to better handle this kind of situation in the future.""

, Your feelings about what your parents or the situation may affect your communication. The same sentence said in different tones can mean wildly different things. Feelings of frustration may result in a sarcastic tone or shouting before you even realize it.Try to remain objective and focus on communicating your message rather than your emotion.


If your parents do comment about your tone, apologize and explain your experiencing frustration trying to clearly communicate your message.

Talk to your parents.,
Listen to your parents.,
Apologize for violating their trust.,
Ask your parents what you can do to regain their trust.,
Trust your parents.",How to Get Your Parents' Trust Back1," Tell your parents how you feel. It is possible that your perception of their feelings about your actions is not the same as their actual feelings about your actions. Be proactive and ask them to sit down and talk with you, possibly in a neutral space free of (electronic and other) distractions such as a neighborhood park.;
, To really have meaningful communication, you need to both talk and listen.Try to put yourself in your parents’ shoes and really understand what they are saying as they talk to you. If they say something that confuses or offends you, ask them about it. Once the lines of communication are open, you and your parents can start rebuilding your trust relationship.

, A sincere apology can go a long way to making your parents trust you again. The best apology acknowledges your wrongdoing, restates what happened clearly, acknowledges the nature of the hurt or harm done, asks for forgiveness, and proposes a means of avoiding the error in the future.Try not to expect anything in return. Though it would be nice if the apology immediately fixed everything, that is unlikely to happen. It’s possible that your parents may not know the best way to respond to your apology.
The words you use are less important than speaking genuinely.
Another part of apologizing is forgiving yourself.

, The most obvious way to figure out how to get your parents’ trust back is simply to ask them what you can do. They may not have an answer ready, but tell them that they can think about it and let you know at a later time.


Be honest in your response to their request. If they seem to have an unreasonably long list of things for you to do, tell them (without whining) that you think you would have trouble being successful at meeting their expectations. Offer a compromise instead.

, Trust builds trust, and trusting them will help encourage them to trust you. In fact, you may find that you do not feel like you trust them right now; it is normal to feel that way. Trust is a two-way relationship, not a one-way feeling, so you will need to work on trust on your end as well. "
"
Admit your wrongdoing.,
Apologize to your parents and others you may have hurt.,
Make amends wherever possible.",How to Help Your Parents to Forgive You2," You may not believe your behavior was completely in the wrong, so instead of looking at the situation as a whole, focus on specific aspects. You may not have done everything wrong, but it isn't likely you did everything right. Find areas of improvement and own them. Your parents will appreciate your ability to admit you were wrong as a sign of maturity. This will help them forgive you more quickly.


Do not argue fault or try to deny wrongdoing. Your parents may see this as immature and take even longer to forgive you.

, Showing remorse is important to help anyone forgive. When giving an apology, acknowledge the hurtful behavior, why it was wrong and how it affected others.This will demonstrate you understand what you did wrong and validate your parents' feelings.


Try structuring the apology stating the effects of your behavior first. This will show others you are most remorseful about hurting them. For example, ""I'm sorry worried and disappointed you by sneaking out. My behavior was irresponsible and inconsiderate; I assure you it won't happen again.""
Always be sincere when apologizing. Insincere apologies will probably be interpreted as sarcasm and make the situation worse.
If you struggle with personal apologies, try writing it in a letter.

, Make a genuine effort to compensate the offended parties. Depending on what happened, this may not be possible, but a good faith attempt is usually enough to buy considerable goodwill with parents.


You might consider working off debt or providing physical labor to help restore damaged property.

Identify ways to respond more appropriately in future situations.,
Get involved in activities that are incompatible with the behavior your parents are upset about.,
Talk to your parents about your future goals.",How to Help Your Parents to Forgive You3," Parents may have a hard time forgiving because they are concerned you may make the same mistakes again. Demonstrating that you learned from your mistakes and developed ways of avoiding repeating them will help your parents to let go of the past.


If you are struggling to identify more appropriate responses, ask your parents to help you. They will appreciate that you are making the effort to improve, and it's another opportunity to make them feel heard.

, Show them you are responsible by studying to earn good grades or getting a job. Remind them how great you are by taking on a leadership role at school or in the community. Involve yourself in activities they would be proud to tell others about and reduce their concern about how you're spending your time. Parents forgive more quickly when they can focus on your new achievements, rather than past failures.


Consider volunteering to serve others in your community to really make them proud. You can find lots of volunteer opportunities online., Help them forgive you by distracting them from your past behavior and focusing on future possibilities. Set goals for 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years from now, with action plans to achieve them.


Your 6 month goals should be reasonable. Set goals for improving grades, saving money, and/or improving you physical and mental health.
Your 2 and 5 year goals should be complex but attainable, a good example might be to graduate college.

Stay calm.,
Be brave, clear, and honest.,
""I really want the ability to choose how I express myself, and this is comfortable for me right now.,
Encourage better communication.,
Show mutual respect.,
Use “I” statements.",How to Get Your Parents to Stop Yelling at You for Swearing1," If you are speaking about a sensitive topic with your parents be calm and try not to raise your voice. In emotionally charged conversations it can be easy to let emotions get the better of us. If you start yelling, your parents are likely to start yelling, too. Avoid using sarcasm, name-calling, interrupting, and especially swearing. This is important to you, show that to your parents by taking the conversation seriously. If you (or your parents) are struggling to stay calm, try these tips:


Take a deep breath, or several deep breaths. Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Count to five or ten. Counting can help reduce any intense feelings.
Remind yourself why you want to have the conversation in the first place and that anger may only result in yelling.;
, It can be difficult to talk to parents about certain topics, especially if it is something they disagree with. Remind yourself that you are standing up for something you want. Speak clearly about what you want and how you feel, and be honest about why. Stay on the topic of swearing, try not to let the discussion lead into any other arguments or problems between you and your parents.Here are some examples:


""Mom, Dad, I'd like to talk with you about swearing. Do you have time to talk now?""

, I understand it is not comfortable for you, so what can we do about that?""

""I would really like it if we could make an agreement or a compromise.""

, In addition to what you are doing to change the way you communicate, encourage your parents to communicate with you more effectively as well. Chances are, they are as frustrated as you and would welcome some suggestions for changes. A good start is to tell them how their yelling makes you feel and offer alternatives to yelling for them.


""I feel frustrated and angry when I get yelled at for swearing, because...""
""When you are yelling at me, It's like I'm getting in trouble for expressing how I feel.""
""It's difficult for me to not yell back when you yell at me. It may be easier for me to be calmer if you are calmer.""
""Instead of yelling, would it be possible to calmly remind me of our agreement or ask me what is wrong?""

, You want your parents to listen to you and respect your choice, without yelling, so you should be willing to do the same. Really listen to what they are saying, it may help you understand where they are coming from as well as help you navigate towards getting what you want. Also, as stressed as you might feel realize that your parents may be just as stressed as well. Accept that both your experience and their experience are valid, and give each other a break. Here are some ways you can show respect in addition to actively listening:


Make eye contact.
Be polite. Say ""please,"" don't roll your eyes, and try not to interrupt.
Show gratitude. You can always say ""Thank you for talking to me about this, I know it can't be easy for either of us.""
Ask questions for clarification. If you are confused about something, ask ""I don't understand, could you explain that a little more?"" This will help avoid assumptions.
Respectfully disagree. Instead of yelling ""No, you're wrong!"" try saying ""I hear what you are saying. From my point of view, though, it seems different because...""

, Instead of saying “You curse all the time, why can't I?” Try wording it, “I feel like I should be able to curse around you if you can curse around me. I feel like that is fair.” Using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements keeps others from feeling like they are being blamed and helps you communicate how you are feeling. "

Spend time with your family.,
Demonstrate responsible actions.,
Show that you care.,
Perform reparations.,
Demonstrate your readiness to change.Showing that you are willing to change in a small way—such as making your bed every day like your mom always asks—can prove that you are willing to change in a big way, which may be necessary for trust-building.

",How to Get Your Parents' Trust Back2," Spending more time with your family benefits your trust relationship in several ways. First, your parents won’t be suspicious about how you’re spending your time if it is with them. Second, spending time with people helps you understand and communicate with them better, which can help your relationship. Third, your parents will be reminded of your great qualities, like your sense of humor, instead of focusing only on the trust violation.

, Do your chores. Pick your brother up from school on time. Offer to help with the dishes after dinner. Showing responsibility for everyday things can help your parents think of you as a responsible person. This alone may not be enough to rebuild trust, but combined with other things like open communication, these small steps can help.

, Demonstrating to your parents that you care about them, yourself, and your relationship is an important element of your two-way trust relationship. Showing that you care may take on many different forms, but doing and saying things that you know will make the other person feel good is a place to start.

, If you have hurt anyone aside from your parents as part of the trust violation, apologize and try to make it right. If you asked your parents what you could do to regain their trust, do what they said to do, even if it seems silly. Even if it seems like, for example, washing your dad’s car may have nothing to do with regaining his trust, you are showing that you are willing to do what it takes.

Control your emotions.,
Understand your parents’ expectations.,
Follow the house rules.,
Avoid the cause of the breach of trust.",How to Get Your Parents' Trust Back3," Often the situations and experiences that disrupt a trust relationship are motivated by rash or emotional decisions.Trying to act rationally and control your feelings may help you become more trustworthy. If you do not feel like you can control your emotions on your own, consider meeting with a therapist to discuss strategies for coping., If you know what your parents don’t want you to do, it is easier to avoid doing it. If you are unsure about their exact rules or expectations, ask them. If your violation of trust is recent, you should be extra vigilant about any activities that may be considered off-limits.

, You live with your parents for a limited amount of time. They likely have rules or expectations about what should and should not be done while you are living under their roof. Stick to those rules, even if they seem unreasonable to you.


Remember that you will eventually have your own home and you can live the way that you want to live later.
Even if it seems like an eternity before you move out of your parents’ house, the time will pass and you will be able to move on eventually.

, If there was a specific person, habit, activity, or event that broke you and your parents’ trust relationship, avoid it at all costs. If you feel that you need help avoiding it, ask for help.


In the case of something like substance abuse, you may need professional help to fight an addiction.
If there is a particular friend who leads you to make bad decisions, it may be time to move on or take a break from that friendship.

Regain trust after lying.,
Come back from breaking specific rules.,
Alleviate hurt feelings.,
Recover from damage to property.,
Accept financial responsibility.",How to Get Your Parents' Trust Back4," If you violated your parents’ trust by lying to them, particularly if you have had a history of lying, then you need to make a practice of being completely honest all of the time. Demonstrating a commitment to complete honesty will enable you to rebuild trust. Unfortunately, this may take a long time.

, If the nature of your trust violation involved breaking a specific rule that your parents have set, such as no underage drinking or being home by a certain time, communicate with your parents about the house rules.


It’s important that you understand what the rules are, why the rules are in place, and how to follow them.
An open dialogue with your parents about these can help you make better decisions in the future.

, If you have hurt someone, you should make reparations. If you have hurt your parents by doing something that disappoints them or makes them sad, then try to understand their emotions.


Putting yourself in their shoes and thinking about how you would want someone to apologize to you can help you know what will heal the wounds.

, If your transgression involved damage to property—for example, if you wrecked a car or vandalized public property—you need to do what you can to repair the damage. This may mean doing what you can yourself—painting over spray-painted graffiti, hammering out a dented car panel, or cleaning toilet paper out of trees. However, it may also mean offering to pay for the cost of repairs, as with a car accident.

, If you have done something that has cost someone else money, you should offer to compensate the injured party financially. Even if this means giving up your entire paycheck for several weeks, accepting financial responsibility can go a long way towards showing that you understand the consequences of your actions.

"
"
Be ready to compromise.,
Advocate for yourself.,
Plan ahead for the conversation.,
Bring agreements or suggestions.",How to Get Your Parents to Stop Yelling at You for Swearing2," Compromise means you will not get everything you want, and your parents will not get everything they want, but you will both get parts of what you want. Be willing to meet your parents halfway. You will be able to agree to a compromise where your parents yell at you less or not at all, and your parents will feel their wishes are more respected.

, The goal is to get your parents to stop yelling at you. Whatever the agreement is, your parents will expect you to uphold it. You should expect the same from them! In the agreement, advocate for it to include your parents not yelling at you. Try:


""If we agree that I will limit my swearing, I would also like to agree that I will not get yelled at if I occasionally make a mistake.""
""Let's talk about what we both can change to make it better.""
""Instead of yelling, could you agree to try something else instead?""

, It might be helpful to think about who you are going to talk to, when, where, and get a good idea of how to start the conversation ahead of time. This will help show how important it is to you and that you are taking it seriously.


Who? Think about if you want to talk to just your Mom, just your Dad, or both at the same time.
When? Pick a time when both you and your parents are calm and content. Make sure not to choose a time when you or they are tired, angry, or have just fought as it might make the discussion more difficult and your parents more likely to yell.
Where? Think about where you would be comfortable talking to your parents. At home? Going out to eat?

, When thinking about a compromise, consider what you are willing to agree to and what you think would be fair. Be considerate and get creative!


Having a ""swear jar"" where you have to put in money or take a chore from everytime a swear is used or you get yelled at for slipping up. If you have to put money in, maybe make a reward that if you don't swear for a month, you get to take the money back!
A set amount of swear words you are allowed to use per week.
An agreement for use of certain words and not others.
Being able to swear in certain places or in front of certain people.
What consequences will there be if you the agreement is broken by you or your parents, and what rewards if you are successful.

"
Limit swearing or stop all together.,
Figure out why you are swearing.,
Replace your swearing.,
Apologize, if you slip up.",How to Get Your Parents to Stop Yelling at You for Swearing3," Try cutting back on swearing in front of your parents, at least. Breaking habits is difficult at best, but it is possible to practice a new habit over the unwanted one and change it. While this may not be the most desirable solution it will help avoid yelling and punishments from swearing.

, Thinking about why you are swearing and who the swearing is directed at could be very helpful. If you are swearing at your parents, their yelling could just be a defense. If you are swearing about something else, you might be able to get your parents to understand what you are going through and be more on your side. Here are some possibilities:


Are you cursing at your parents? If so, why? If it is the result of conflict between you and your parents it may be from frustration, feeling like you are not being heard, feeling like you don't have the independence you want, changes, etc. Are you cursing around them about other things? Maybe there is something going with your friends or with school. Talk to your parents about it.
Are you in pain? Swearing is a common response to physical and emotional pain. , It might help to replace your swears with alternate words, blanks, or beeps. You can begin by looking at why swear words are swears in the first place. A better understanding of the swear words may help you come up with alternatives for yourself.


You can try replacing your swearing with alternate words that mean the same thing. For example, replace “hell” with “heck” or ""damn"" with ""darn."" You could even try cursing in other languages.
Find the alternate swears that are used in movies or TV shows for censorship. Pick your favorite and use that. “Son of a nutcracker!” from Elf, for example.
You can also research swearing that used to be considered swears but aren't anymore. Sensor yourself with leaving the word silent, using just the first letter, or putting in a “beep” or a “bleep.” For example, “What the h is going on?” or “What the bleep!”

, Chances are, you will slip up because changing habits is hard, and that's okay. Give yourself some time and a little slack, but if you violate the compromise you made, apologize. It will go a long way to possibly avoiding punishments and to keeping the communication open. "

Set up regular times to see each other.",How to Rebuild the Relationship with Your Dad After a Remarriage," Before you try to mend your relationship with your father, decide whether you truly want to overcome what came between you. If you feel you dad was abusive or neglectful to you after finding his new partner, you may decide you do not want a relationship with him.No matter what happened between you and your dad, only you can decide what is right for you. There is no wrong answer so long as you know do what is best for your long-term emotional health.;
, Many times when parents divorce or split up, children often feel that they are partially to blame for the separation. Though having children can make a marriage undergo changes, you are never at fault for problems between your parents. Children are, in fact, typically the reason many couples on the brink of divorce often choose to stay together.


Recognize that your parents’ relationship likely had its own share of issues and you have and had no control over correcting them.

, You may have negative feelings for your father after he has remarried or perhaps you just feel uncomfortable about the situation in general. Regardless, it can be especially difficult if you are dealing with it alone. Reach out to people you trust and can lean on for support during this difficult and strange time. Siblings, if you have them, can be particularly helpful as they have the best and closest insight into how you are feeling.


Perhaps your sibling has found a way to make peace with these recent changes. Ask them for advice on how to adjust your perspective. You might say to them “Mom and dad not being together anymore is already difficult enough for me, but with dad remarrying, it almost feels like too much. I feel pretty upset about it. How are you feeling?”
If you don’t have siblings, reach out to other relatives or to your close friends. Mentors can be helpful, as well.

, Remember, that though your parents are older and hopefully wiser, they are humans, too with feelings and emotions just like you. Perhaps you feel that your father rushed into this marriage or that he hurt your mom in some way. You must, however, refrain from judging your dad for his actions. Passing judgement will only deepen the rift between the two of you.Your father likely knows some bad things that you have done or things he has not agreed with. Think about how he handled those things. If he still loved you and didn’t shun you, work to reciprocate that with him.

, You may feel very hurt and upset with your father and these feelings will not go away overnight. Be patient with yourself and don’t expect to wake up one day and feel completely okay with this new family dynamic. Give yourself some space to deal with these feelings.


Be patient with your father, too. He has entered into a relationship that is new for him and he wants to enjoy it, but also maintain his relationship with you.

, Your dad, though he has done something to upset you, is still your dad. In order to move forward and rebuild your relationship, you must forgive him for whatever wrong you feel that he has done to your or your family. Forgiving your dad is the first step in reconnecting with him. The four steps of forgiveness are: think about why you’re hurt, acknowledging how it changed you, think about why your dad has remarried, and decide if you want to tell your dad you forgive him.Remember that forgiveness is more for you than for him. Carrying around anger is harmful to your own emotional health. Once you let go of that, your life will improve and you will feel greater happiness.
Forgiveness doesn’t meant that your feelings will immediately change about the situation; only time can change that.

, Realize that your dad has gone through some pretty big changes in his life, just like you have. Whether he lost your mom to death or divorce, he has had to make some big adjustments. He probably won't seem like ""the same guy"" to you at first, but he’s still your dad.


You may feel that your dad is different now and this could be true. Consider whether your dad is different in a negative way or if he is just responding appropriately and normally to his newfound happiness.
Remember also that everyone needs someone, even if your dad no longer feels that that person is your mom. If your mom and dad are divorced, there is still time and hope for her to meet someone new and find happiness again, as well.

, Once you have assessed your feelings, reach out to your father and set aside some time to have a conversation with him. You can either call or text him to let him know that you’d like to meet soon to chat about your relationship and moving forward.


You can begin the conversation by saying “Hey dad, I know our relationship lately has not been the best, but I was hoping we could get together soon to talk?”
Meet in a quiet place where the two of you can talk. If you don’t feel comfortable going to his home, try a park or quiet restaurant.

, One of the biggest mistakes people make when discussing serious topics is holding back their true emotions to either end the talk quicker or to avoid discomfort for the person they are talking to. Though these may be helpful in the moment, in the long run, they are detrimental and they only serve to silence your emotions. Be very honest with your father about how you feel, the concerns you have, and any lingering issues. It may seem stressful in the moment, but you will feel better if you get your feelings out.Remember that your father cannot make you feel better or improve your relationship unless he knows how you feel. Being open and honest is the only way to start rebuilding trust.

, Perhaps you feel that since your dad has remarried, that you are no longer important or a priority to him. Though this is probably not true, it does not negate that you feel that way. Tell your father exactly what you need from him in order to feel happy, secure and loved.You might say something like “Dad, I know you are married now and have to spend a lot of time with your new wife and I get that. But I need you, too. I miss spending time with you and I would like to be able to see you at least a few times a week and go to the movies like we used to.”
Remember that, though your dad knows you, he cannot read your mind. Tell him what you need from him and then be patient and give him room to deliver on those expectations.

, While it is important for you to explain what you need, remember to be reasonable. If you set impossible standards, your dad will always disappoint you and your relationship will never be fixed. Start by trying to navigating small expectations before moving onto larger ones, and always be honest with yourself about what you need and what you can do without.For instance, it’s realistic to expect your dad to call you every day or every other day, but perhaps unrealistic to expect calls constantly throughout the day, especially if he’s working.
Talk to your father about your expectations. His may differ from yours, and it is important to seek compromise so that you both get what you need from the relationship.

, Sometimes, situations can feel too painful for us to repair through having a conversation. Perhaps your father betrayed your mother or was abusive and you are having a difficult time dealing with that coupled with his new marriage. Sometimes, you may feel that you need a little more guidance, clarity or support. Consider consulting a therapist to help you talk through your problems.

, Though things may feel rocky right now despite having forgiven your father and spoken to him, you have to remember all of the wonderful times that you’ve enjoyed with him. Though this new marriage is huge and definitely impacts your life, don’t forget about all of the thousands of others ways that he has impacted your life and made it all the better.Get out the photo albums and take some time to look at them with your dad.

, Once you have gotten the difficult conversation out of the way, it’s now time to move to a more positive and joyful dynamic. Take some time to think about all of the fun things you and your dad used to do, no matter how simple, and invite him to do those things with you. This will help the two of you reconnect while having fun together.


If you and your dad used to go to the beach a lot, as him to go with you to catch some rays or ride some waves.
You might even do something like play board games together.

, Though this may be the most difficult part of the process, it is inevitable. Your father’s new spouse is an important part of his life and the better your relationship with them, the better and the easier the relationship you’ll have with your father.


Ask your dad if you can tag along with them sometimes if they’re going to lunch or to the park.
See if you can spend some time with your dad’s spouse alone, just the two of you. Having a talk with them could be helpful for you and you might like them more than you expect!
Remember that liking your dad’s new spouse is not an insult to your mother; it is a show of love to your father, and is an important part of healing your relationship.

, If your father and mother were married and recently got divorced and you now live with your mother, you might feel that you miss seeing your dad regularly. This may be the main cause of your frustration with him. Talk to him about setting up regular visits between the two of you so you don’t miss out on that crucial time with him.


Perhaps you can even start a new tradition together like always watching a movie together on Sundays.

Apologize in person.,
Be sincere.,
Tell the truth.,
Don't try to talk to her in the heat of the moment.,
Choose a good time.,
Don't wait too long.,
Listen to what she says.,
Don't pull other incidents into the topic at hand.,
Don't use excuses about what you did.,
Try to fix the mistake.,
Apologize in writing.,
Understand that forgiveness takes time.,
Know she's not perfect, either.",How to Get Your Mom to Forgive You After You Do Something Stupid1," No matter what, don't try to apologize by text or email. Talking to someone in an emotionally charged situation is difficult, but owning up to what you did will help her to see you are sincere.;
, Use a respectful tone, and say your apology in a clear voice. Mumbling implies that you aren't owning up to what you did.


If you don't know how to begin, say something like the following statement: ""I am truly sorry that I upset you. I know I shouldn't get into fights with George. I let my temper get the best of me, but I really want to do better. I hope you can forgive me.""

, Sometimes, you'll want to lie but don't, but you'll only be caught further if you do it again.. You'll be in even worse trouble then, and you'll have a harder time getting your mother to forgive you.

, Let her cool down a little bit. Approach her later when she's had a chance to think. Most importantly do not argue, it only makes things worse.

, Don't try to apologize while she is distracted by something else, like cooking dinner. Catch her in a quiet moment, and ask if you can talk to her for a minute.Understand if she doesn't want to listen to you. She may not be ready to hear what you have to say. Wait awhile, and ask again.

, That is, you have to own up to what you did in a timely manner. If you wait too long, your mother will think that you don't feel ashamed for what you did.

, Truly listen, and try to take in why she thinks you did wrong. The only way you can apologize for what you did is to understand why she's mad. Therefore, put yourself in her shoes. She's trying to help you grow as a person, so try to see it her way., Don't bring up what your sibling did or what's happened in the past. You'll only remind her of other bad incidents and make her angrier.For instance, don't say, ""But Tracy stayed out last week and didn't get punished! Why are you mad at me and not her?"" Bringing up the past incident will only stir up more feelings. Instead, say something like, ""I know you're angry, and I really shouldn't have stayed out late. I'm truly sorry.""

, Excuses undermine the apology because they make it look like you are passing the blame to someone or something else. You need to accept that you did something wrong if you want your mother to forgive you.


For example, instead of saying, ""I didn't stay out that late, and besides, it was only because I was trying to drop off my friend."" say something like ""I know I stayed out too late, and I'm sorry. I'll try to manage my time better next time by leaving the party earlier.""

, An apology goes a long way but attempting to fix the situation is even better.For example, if you broke something, try to fix it or replace it. If you yelled at your sister, be extra nice to her, and show her you care.

, This step may seem contrary to ""Apologize in person,"" but you should apologize in writing in addition to apologizing in person. Also, you shouldn't use email or text for this apology. Write your mother a handwritten letter about your mistake and how you can do better in the future. A handwritten note takes some thought and time, and your mom will appreciate your thoughtfulness. If you are a good artist, you could also embellish your letter with a couple of small drawing you know she'll appreciate.


You could write something like the following: ""Dear Mom, I know you're upset that I got into a fight with Jane. I know you want us to have the relationship that you never had with your sister, and I appreciate that. I love Jane to bits, even though she drives me crazy sometimes. I am the older one, and I should be more mature when she tries to annoy me on purpose. I understand that relationships take work, and you're only trying to prepare me for the ones I have in the future, as well as help me to develop a strong, lasting relationship with Jane. I'll try to keep the peace in the future; really, I will. I love you bunches, and I hope you can forgive me. Love, Joy.""

, Sometimes, your mom may forgive you quickly, but other times, it may take a while. In fact, some psychologists say there are stages to forgiveness, just like there are to grief. Your mom may go through denial, bargaining, anger, and depression before acceptance and forgiveness, though she may not go in order or even go through all those stages. Regardless, remember you must work to earn her forgiveness and trust back., She's made mistakes, and she may even be angry at you longer than you deserve.


Sometimes moms are mad for other reasons. It's not always just your fault. Just like you may take out having a bad day on your sister, your mom may let her emotions get the better of her when she's had a bad day (or week!), too.

Determine whether you need professional help.",How to Get Your Parents to Realize You Are a Teen Now," Prepare in advance for this meeting by developing a list of what you want to talk about. For example, are there certain restrictions you’d like lifted, like an early curfew or a prohibition on seeing more grown-up movies? Or is there something you’d like to be able to do, like choosing your own clothes or going out with friends?


It may be helpful to talk this list over with a trusted adult, such as a teacher or coach, before approaching your parents. That person will be able to give you an adult’s perspective on what you’re asking. Take their advice into consideration as you revise your list.;
, You want to set the conversation up to succeed. The most important thing is for you and your parents to have a thoughtful, respectful dialogue. If the conversation becomes a heated argument, you will have undermined your own goals.


The car is often a good place to have a conversation. You don’t have to maintain eye contact, and you can always use the passing scene or what’s on the radio to transition naturally to less intense topics.Avoid bringing up difficult topics late at night, when everyone is tired.
Try to talk to your parents alone, without siblings around.

, Describe why each of these requests is important to you and what you hope to get out of it. In addition, explain how you will keep yourself safe even with increased independence.


For example, you might say: “I’d like to be able to hang out at the mall with my friends until 9 p.m. on Fridays. I really like spending time with my friends, and I often don’t have the chance to socialize with them during the week because of homework and after-school activities. I’ll keep my phone with me so that you can check on me while I’m out, and I’ll come home at the time we agree.”

, Hearing them out shows that you respect them. Even if you disagree with something they say, you can respectfully ask for clarification and explanation, and then listen to what they have to say. Demonstrate that, while you might push back on some things, you are not simply brushing off their advice and requests.Reflect back what you are hearing. This helps to ensure that you are correctly understanding what your parents are saying. For example, you could say: “I hear that you worried that I’ll drink or do drugs with my friends if I’m hanging out with them at night. Is that right?”
It might be helpful to talk through possible scenarios with them. For example, if your parent says, “I’m worried that I won’t know where you are late at night,” you might talk about different approaches. For example, you could give your parents a detailed itinerary with alternate people to contact if for some reason you don’t answer your own phone.

, What signs of maturity are your parents looking for? Do you have particular patterns of behavior that worry them? Even if your parents are not yet willing to grant your requests, they might be willing to agree to a plan: if you demonstrate a certain level of maturity over a certain time, then they will will reconsider.

, Parents are often affected by memories of their own decisions as teenagers. They might be haunted by the risks they took or the bad choices they made.Ask your parents about their experiences. Be ready to listen empathetically, paying special attention to what their stories reveal about their fears. Talk about the choices you are making and how your own life is similar to or different from theirs.

, If your parents refuse to budge or even to listen to your requests, consider asking for help from a teacher, religious leader, or guidance counselor. They may be able to explain to your parents that your need for greater independence is developmentally appropriate. And, they will be able to shed a different light on you and how you behave outside of the home.

, You’ll need to revisit these topics over time.If your parents agree to try even one thing on your list, the conversation was a success. Your job now is to show that you can handle the increased independence and responsibility, so that they will consider other requests favorably later on.

, Follow the agreements that you make with them. Never lie to them about how you are going to use the increased independence you’ve negotiated.


If you have a cell phone, answer your parents’ messages and calls. They might reach out more frequently at first, while they adjust to your increased independence. Be patient.
Don’t be late. If you are supposed to be home by 10pm, aim to be home by 9:45pm – that way, you have a buffer in case you’re held up by a slow bus, for instance. If you can’t help being late, get in touch with your parents as soon as possible to let them know the situation.

, The ability to delay gratification in order to keep your word to someone else is an important sign of maturity.It also demonstrates that you are developing a good character.

, Don’t let your emotions or desires run away with you, so that you make bad choices or speak irresponsibly. This is an important part of showing that you can make good decisions.It’s natural to get angry sometimes, for example, but don’t fly off the handle. Make a plan to calm yourself down. If you feel your blood boiling, take a deep breath, count to ten, or excuse yourself to go outside or to the restroom.
Your brain is set up to seek out more dangerous, risky behavior during this time in your life.While this is a natural part of adolescence, your parents also need to see evidence that you can rein in your desires and take care of yourself.

, Never do illegal drugs. If you are old enough to be in a sexual relationship, practice safer sex, including using condoms or other forms of barrier protection., For example, most parents monitor what websites their teenagers visit and how they use social media.These limits are part of your parents’ job.


Don’t compare your parents to your friends’ parents. No one likes being pressured by these sorts of comparisons. And, it’s likely that you don’t know the whole story, even about your friends’ lives. Instead, focus on your own relationship with your parents.

, Your parents will trust you more if they see that you are capable of treating others thoughtfully.


Sign up for a regular volunteer gig. If you are able to be steady and regular in your volunteering, your parents will see that you are responsible as well as generous.
Be kind to your younger siblings. Try to relate to them from an adult perspective, rather than as a fellow child.

, Parents are often more distressed than their teenagers by bickering or minor, day-to-day arguments.They may still be troubled by a conflict that you have almost forgotten about.


If your parent still seems upset about an old conflict, don’t dismiss their feelings. Instead, ask them what is still bothering them, and listen thoughtfully to their answer.

, Teenagers and parents often frame conflicts in different ways. Teenagers are more likely to emphasize personal choice, while their parents are more likely to focus on underlying issues of right versus wrong. For example, you might see your messy room as just one way to live, while your parent might see a certain level of dirtiness as fundamentally wrong.While it can be frustrating, try not to tell your parents that their way of seeing things is completely wrong. Instead, focus on practical issues: how often do your parents expect you to do your laundry? Will your mess bother them less if the door is shut?

, You are likely to be more emotional at this phase of your life. In addition, you might tend to see emotion in others, even when it’s not there.Practice reality testing: ask your parents calmly how they feel about something, or even ask them directly: “Were you angry at me when I came in just now?”

, It’s helpful for them to see you out in the world, navigating different situations with maturity and grace.


For example, inviting your parents to go on a hike with you might help them to feel more open to allowing you to go on an overnight camping trip later on.

, Teenagers naturally seek out stronger connections with their peers than with their parents.If you let your parents get to know your friends, however, it will be easier for them to be open to letting you spend time with them later at night or in more independent ways.

, If you are able to talk seriously and openly about adult issues such as sex, relationships, and your future, you will have a better and more adult relationship with your parents.Asking their advice about relationships and preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections can help your parents to see that you are approaching this issue maturely. In addition, you’ll learn from their own experiences of sex and romance.


Use an example from a television show or magazine article to raise a particular topic.
Write down questions you want to ask.
Send a text message or e-mail to break the ice. You can use this message as a way to set up a time to talk later, when you will be both be able to concentrate on the conversation.

, Some conflict is normal during this period of your relationship with your parents, but frequent, very intense fights are a sign that something is wrong.If you can’t stop fighting with your parents, ask a trusted outside adult for help and guidance.

Maybe you could set your phone with an alarm to 30 minutes before you're supposed to be home, and ask her to help you remember to set it when you're going out.

, Don't go and make big decisions like moving out or running away. You're probably mad that you're in trouble, and you may even feel like your mother doesn't care about you.

, She's only trying to help, and if she wants to talk to you, take the time to listen. Respond to what she's saying and take the time to think about it. You can even reassure her that such an incident will not repeat at the end of your talk, so she knows you thought about it and your apology is genuine.

, When you do answer her questions, don't get an attitude about it. Just answer calmly, directly, and truthfully.


For instance, if your mom says, ""What were you thinking?"" don't say, ""I don't know, obviously I'm an idiot"" in a sarcastic tone. Try something more along the lines of ""I guess I wasn't thinking very clearly. I'll try to do better next time.""

If you think that's the case, stop asking them why or they will just say no for sure.;
, Are you constantly asking for money? Do you want to go on a trip with some friends? Don't ask for a CD just because you happened to see it or a doll just because you think you want it. If you do see something you want and you don't have the money, wait a few days and see if you still want it. Your parents will be more willing to say yes if they know that you have thought about it. (You may want to wait until your birthday, Christmas or Hanukkah, depending on what you celebrate in December every year)

, If your parents say, ""I'll think about it"" or ""wait until tomorrow"", then wait until they have had time to think about it and kindly ask what their thoughts are when they aren't busy doing something.

, If you want a car, make a list of all the responsibilities that you will be able to take on if you get a car.

Extend your forgiveness.",How to Forgive an Abusive Parent1," Prepare yourself to have a conversation with your parent about the abuse. Don’t attempt to have this conversation in person if you feel unsafe around your parent. If your parent has been physically abusive in the past, consider calling them or sending an email instead.

If you think your parent will be defensive or evasive about the topic, you might also choose to contact them indirectly through another method.;
, Clear the air with your parent by bringing up the abuse with them. Tell them how you feel about it and how it affected you.You could open the conversation by saying something like, “Dad, I need to talk to you about something. It’s always really hurt me when you put me down and call me names. I want to have a better relationship with you in the future, but I need you to stop treating me this way.”

But, I want to move on from there. I don't want the past to hold me down forever. I forgive you, and I would like us to work on having a positive relationship in the future.""

Ask questions.,
Talk about cultural similarities.,
Correct your parents respectfully.,
Expose your parents to new cultures.",How to Get Your Parents to Accept Your Friends from Other Cultures1," Ask your parents about their cultural beliefs and opinions. Your parents’ answers may explain why they feel the way they do about other cultures.If you can get your parents’ to explain their concerns, you can address those concerns. Then you can get your parents to accept your friends from other cultures.


For example, you might ask your mom, “How do you feel about people from different ethnicities? Do you think there are major differences? Why?”
Or, you could try, “Dad, why do you feel the way you do about people from other cultures?”;
, When you look only at the differences between cultures it can create an ‘us versus them’ mindset. It may be easier for your parents to accept your friends from other cultures if they can see the things that the different cultures have in common.Make a point of showing your parents how your friends’ cultures are similar to your own.


For example, you might point out that your Baptist friend comes from a large family just like your Muslim family.
You might try something like, “Lucas has lots of aunts and uncles like me. Even though there are differences in our families, we all like to have big family dinners!”

, They may have some misperceptions about other cultures that you want to clear up. Making fun of your parents, calling them culturally insensitive, or being disrespectful when you correct them will only make your parents defensive.You can get your parents to accept your friends from other cultures if you gently and calmly explain cultural facts to your parents.


For example, if your mom says, “But, all those people are trouble” when you tell her your friend is Hispanic, don’t get upset and call her a racist.
Calmly explain that there are good people and bad people in all cultures.
You might say, “Mom, you’re right. Some people are trouble, but ethnicity doesn’t automatically make someone bad. It’s the choices they make.”

, The more experience your parents have around people of different cultures, the more your parents will understand about different cultures.Try to include your parents in cultural events in your community so that they will have an easier time accepting your friends from other cultures.


Visit a museum that has cultural artwork on display or attend a cultural play, music performance, or other cultural event.
Introduce your parents to foods from different cultures. For example, make your salad Mediterranean-style by adding tabbouli, olives, and fresh cracked pepper.
You might also mention that your friend is interested in your family's culture, such as by saying something like, ""Jake is really interested in learning more about the food we cook at home."" Or, ""Sarah took a survey of religion classes and she's really interested in Judaism now.""

Ignore your siblings’ behavior.,
Be the mature one.,
Talk with your parents about your sibling’s behavior.,
Hang out with your sibling sometimes.",How to Get Out of Trouble with Your Parents2," Your sister or brother might tease you or do annoying things. If you get in a fight, you might get into trouble with your parents. Chances are, your sibling is trying to get your attention or they are bored. If you ignore the behavior, they will probably stop and go onto a different activity. This keeps you from fighting and keeps you out of trouble with your parents., Sometimes, you might be treated unfairly by your parents, and your sibling might get better treatment. They might get to stay up later or they might get to watch a movie that you don’t get to watch. Instead of getting mad and getting into a fight, show your maturity by accepting that you don’t always get what you want and that you can handle it. This will keep you out of fights with your parents.

, If your sibling is really testing you or getting into your stuff too much, talk calmly with your parents. Explain to them that you’re trying to be patient with your sibling but you also need your own space and privacy. Your parents will value your maturity.

Make a pledge to yourself to keep your phone bill under control, for example, and track your usage for the month. Point out in a humble way that you have changed your behavior. Show them your phone bill when it is well under your limit.

, Sometimes it’s not worth using energy to fight over something small. When you constantly fight over things, from what to eat to when you have to be home, you and your parents get “battle fatigue.” Choose the most important things to put up a fight over, and let the smaller things go., If your parents don’t understand things you like to do, give them an introduction to these things. Take them to the new skate park, for example, or have them listen to your new music. Tell them what you really like about an activity or hobby. Getting them involved in your life will help them understand you better., You might want to spend more time with your friends, but spending quality time with your parents is a good way to connect. Schedule a few times a week to have short conversations when you can catch up and tell your parents about your day.

, If you get into trouble because of bad grades, try to make changes in how you are doing in school. Schedule the same time every day to do homework. Set up a study group a couple of days before a test. Hopefully, this will improve your grades, but at the very least, your parents will be able to see how hard you’re trying to improve.

Accept the past for what it was.,
Choose to focus on the present.,
Look for ways to have positive experiences with your parent.,
Understand that your parent may never change.",How to Forgive an Abusive Parent2," Be honest with yourself about what happened to you and how it impacted your life. Don’t try to ignore your past or sweep the abuse under the rug. To heal and reconcile with your parent, you’ll have to acknowledge the abuse and work through your memories.You may feel all kinds of emotions bubbling up when you think about the past, and that’s okay. Don’t judge yourself for what you’re feeling.

, Take a deep breath and commit to living as well as you can in the here and now. Make up your mind to salvage what you can of your relationship with your parent, even though they hurt you in the past. Don’t waste your energy dwelling on things that neither you nor your parent can change., Connect with your parent in small ways to improve your relationship with them. Keep your interactions at a level you’re comfortable with. For instance, you could have a fifteen-minute phone call with them every week, or you could invite them out to lunch now and then.


If your parent isn’t willing to accept that they were in the wrong for hurting you, you may not be able to interact with them in a positive way.
You’re not obligated to see your parent if they’re still abusive towards you. Remember that you can’t fix the relationship by yourself.
Keep your expectations reasonable. An occasional visit with your parent won’t make up for years of abuse. However, it will give you a foundation for a more positive relationship in the future.

, Unfortunately, many abusers continue to use the same tactics all their lives. Don’t be disappointed if your parent slips back into old habits or refuses to admit they did anything wrong. You can’t make them change, but at least you’ll know you did your best."

Be compassionate to yourself.,
Think about your parent’s own upbringing.,
Find common ground with your parent’s shortcomings.",How to Forgive an Abusive Parent3," Accept that the abuse was not your fault and that you didn’t deserve to be hurt.

Part of being self-compassionate is believing that you’re worthy of love and help, so open yourself to other people’s kindness as well as your own.

, Take a look back at your family history and think about what kind of childhood your abusive parent had. Consider whether they were mistreated or abused themselves. If so, they may have thought it was normal to treat their own child the same way.

A family history of abuse doesn’t excuse abusive behavior, but it can help you understand why your parent acted the way they did.

, Think about all of your abusive parent’s flaws, and consider whether you’ve experienced those same flaws in your own life. Empathizing with your parent might be the last thing you want to do, but it can help you see them in a different light and move closer to forgiveness.For instance, if your parent couldn’t control their anger, ask yourself whether anger has ever gotten the better of you.

Set limits on your relationship with your parent.,
Prioritize your well-being.",How to Forgive an Abusive Parent4," Forgive your parent for your own benefit, not theirs. Do it so you can reclaim your life and let go of any poisonous anger you’ve been holding onto. Don’t expect an apology or a better relationship from your parent after you’ve forgiven them., Forgiving your parent doesn’t mean you think their abusive behavior was OK, and it doesn’t mean you would let it happen again. Let go of your anger and bitterness, but don’t downplay how the abuse affected you., If you want to keep your parent in your life, do it on your own terms. Decide how often you’ll see them and let them know how you want to be treated. Be prepared to defend your boundaries or distance yourself if your parent challenges you.For instance, if you’ve told your verbally abusive mother that you won’t talk to her if she starts saying cruel things, you may have to hang up the phone on her a few times before she starts respecting your wishes.
If your parent refuses to put any effort into changing the relationship, your best option may be to cut them off. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to make them part of your life., Give yourself the love and support you wish you had gotten from your parent. Take care of your physical, mental, and emotional health. If you still struggle to cope with your feelings, consider talking to a counselor or therapist.Some important aspects of self-care include meditating, eating well, exercising regularly, finding creative outlets, and participating in your religious or spiritual community.

Recognize that they are not fighting because of you.,
Stay confident.,
Contact the authorities if you feel there is an imminent threat of danger to anyone in the house.,
Remind yourself that this issue will end.",How to Get Over Your Parents Fighting2," Go into your room, put on your headphones and crank up the stereo if you must. The further away you are from the ""line of fire"" (verbally speaking) the less likely you'll be emotionally drained from the experience.

, This is true even if your name comes into the conversation. In this case it has more to do with a disagreement between parenting styles and little to do with any misbehavior on your part. Remember that it was never or now your fault.

, Don't let this issue get in the way of how you feel about yourself. Try to say a couple good things about yourself before you go to school or anywhere.

, It's difficult for a child to call emergency services but if violence erupts, it's the best option. The authorities can remove you and your siblings from the home until everyone has calmed down.

",How to Get Over Your Parents Fighting3," It's quite normal for your feelings to run the gamut from anger to sadness and back again to a stressful situation. Allow yourself to feel these emotions in an appropriate manner such as crying, screaming into a pillow or even something creative such as writing a poem or painting a picture can help.

Be honest.,
Take it slow.,
Mention your friend’s culture casually.,
Try introducing your friend's parents to your parents.",How to Get Your Parents to Accept Your Friends from Other Cultures2," Don’t try to hide your friendship from your parents.They’re parents, after all, and they will find out anyway. When they find out, they may have problems with the friendship because you weren’t upfront with them. Also, it may hurt your friends’ feelings to know that they are a secret from your parents.


Lying about your friends will just cause your parents not to trust you.
Remember that your parents just want to make sure you’re safe. The more your parents know, the more comfortable they will be with your friends in general.
If you are hanging out with your friend Dean, who happens to be White, and your mom asks who you’re with, then tell her.

, You probably want your parents to immediately like your friends, regardless of their culture. But your parents may need time to get used to the idea of you having friends from other cultures.Don’t just surprise your parents and bring your friends over for a sleepover. Gradually introduce your parents to your friends.


For example, you might start out just mentioning that you have some new friends without bringing up culture. You might say, “Hey, mom, I made new friends at work today.”
Talk about your friends a little more each day. Then you might let your parents talk briefly with your friends on the phone, and then have an in-person meeting.
Slowly work up to your parents actually meeting and spending time around your friends.

, If you make your friends’ cultures seem like no big deal, it will help your parents accept your friends better. Instead of making a big deal about having a friend of a different culture, mention it to your parents calmly and in a matter-of-fact way.


Telling your parents, “I have a new gay friend” will have your parents focusing on the cultural differences and not the other good qualities about your friends.
Instead, try saying, “One of my friends is great at singing! He performs publicly, he’s gay, and he might perform at the talent show next weekend.”
You could say something like, “I met a girl at soccer practice that’s really nice and cool. She’s Jewish, a great goalie, and her mom makes jewelry.”

, It might help your parents to accept your friend if they get to know your friend's parents as well. Try introducing your parents to your friend's parents in a casual environment, such as at a school function.

For example, you might introduce your parents to your friend's parents at a soccer game. Try saying something like, ""Mom, dad, these are Joey's parents."" Then, allow them to chat on their own.
Over time, your parents will have other opportunities to get to know your friend's parents and this may make it easier for them to accept your friend.

Highlight the good points.,
Stay out of trouble.,
Be patient.",How to Get Your Parents to Accept Your Friends from Other Cultures3," Depending on your parents’ beliefs and opinions, they may have strong negative opinions about other cultures. Pointing out the good things about your friends may help your parents accept your friends.It can help your parents realize that people of other cultures can be good people and do good things.


For example, let your parents know that your friends make good grades or volunteer in the community.
You might say, “Dad, my friends are the reason I’ve improved in Chemistry. We study together and they explain the parts I don’t understand.”
Point out when your friends do something you know your parents would admire or value. For instance, “Mom, my friends volunteer at the children’s center every weekend.”

, Getting into trouble at the same time that you are trying to get your parents to accept your friends from other cultures will not help. Your parents may use your behavior as justification for not accepting your friends of other cultures. Your parents may say that your friend’s culture is a bad influence on you.


Continue taking care of your responsibilities. Go to school, do your work, and participate in activities the way you always have.
Don’t start doing things like staying out late or being disrespectful to your parents. They will probably blame your friends and won’t let you see them anymore.

, Your parents may have held their views about culture for their whole life. Don’t expect them to change these views and become more culturally tolerant overnight. Be consistent and patient with your parents. Talk to them and gently correct them on cultural issues whenever it’s appropriate.Be prepared to have several conversations with your parents about cultural issues. Always remember to remain calm when you have the discussions.
Give your parents time to get used to you having someone from a different culture in your life, and theirs.
You can even say things like, “I know you’ve felt this way for a long time. But I’d like for you to try to hear what I’m saying and think about it a little.”

Rehearse what you want to say before you say it.There’s no way to change your parents’ minds if you don’t at least attempt to explain your thoughts on the matter.,
Plan to bargain.It might seem strange to negotiate with your parents, but you need to provide them with some incentive to consider your ideas.,
Stay calm and maintain your composure.,
Accept the fact that you might not change their minds.Chances are, if your parents have placed heavy restrictions on you, they’re not going to immediately change their minds after one conversation.",How to Get Freedom with Overprotective Parents as a Teenage Girl1," If you believe that your parents are treating your unfairly, you should be prepared to present your case.


Before you talk to them, write down exactly what topics you want to cover. Do you want your parents to let you go to the homecoming dance with your friends? Make a list of the best reasons you should be allowed to do so. Do you want to start wearing makeup? Prepare a detailed argument for why you are ready. If you can’t come up with any good reasons, don’t expect your parents to find your case believable.
Choose carefully the words you want to use to open the conversation. Don’t start off with an accusation, such as, “Mom, you never let me do anything fun! That needs to change.” Instead, try to say something such as, ""Mom, I know you're afraid to let me go into public without you being there, but I'd like to go to a movie with my friends on Friday night. I was wondering if there was anything I could do to earn more freedom."" Approach the situation with humility and respect, and your parents will be more likely to listen to what you have to say.;
,


Is there anything you can offer to your parents in exchange for them loosening their rules? If they won’t allow you to see a movie with your friends on Friday, you could promise to vacuum the house on Saturday if they’ll permit to you to go. Think about what tasks your parents hate doing. Could you do them? If so, you might have an excellent bargaining chip.
Be ready to negotiate what your punishment should be if you fail to hold up your end of the bargain. If you tell your parents you’ll be home at 10:00 p.m., and you come home at 10:45, what should the repercussions be? If you say you’ll wash the dishes for a week but stop after three days, how should you be penalized? Come up with some possible punishments before you approach your parents with your offer. Show them that you can take responsibility for your actions.
Offer a compromise. If you aren’t allowed to go to a movie that starts at 9:30 p.m., maybe you could see the 6:30 p.m. showing instead. If they don’t want you to go to a party at a friend’s house, promise to text them every 30 minutes. It would be annoying, but at least you’re getting a chance to prove yourself.
Be careful not to go into this conversation as if it’s a negotiation between equals. Ultimately, you’re not in control of this situation, and you will have to abide by whatever your parents decide. You don't hold the power in this situation, and you don't want to seem demanding and arrogant.
Pick words that will communicate the appropriate tone. Don't say, ""Mom, I'll vacuum the house on Saturday morning, but you're going to have to let me go to the movie on Friday night."" Instead, you could say ""Mom, I'd really like to go to the movie Friday night. I know you hate vacuuming the house, so would you consider letting me go if I promise to do it Saturday morning?"" If you can propose to do something that will make their lives easier, you’re giving them an incentive to consider your offer.

, If you want to be treated like an adult, you need to be able to communicate like one.


Try to approach your parents in a calm and thoughtful manner. Approach them when they are relaxed – perhaps after dinner – and politely tell them that you’d like to talk. Once you have their attention, explain why you feel as if the limits being placed on you are unfair.
When your parents offer their reasons for setting limits on you, remain composed and cordial while maintaining your position. If you lose your temper or storm out of the room, you’ll just be giving your parents reasons to believe that you’re not mature enough to handle more freedom. , You might have to settle for giving them something to think about later.


Remember, you don’t have to win this argument to make your point. At this stage, you want your parents to think about what you’re saying and to be happy that you could approach them in a considerate manner, even if they don’t agree.
Be prepared for your parents to react badly. Given that you are questioning their parenting skills, they might even get angry that you had the audacity to confront them. Especially if your parents refuse to budge, you should handle this situation with maturity and poise. In doing so, you might impress them and cause them to question whether they are being too strict.

Ignore it.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Think of a comeback.,
Find strength in numbers.",How to Get Your Dad to Stop Picking on You1," Sometimes, the best way to deal with someone messing with you is to ignore it. Your dad may thrive off the response he gets from you. He may think it's amusing to see you annoyed, so try to not indulge him.When your dad starts picking on you, just pretend you do not hear him. If he persists in picking on you, simply walk away.
Acting like you don't care may bore your dad. If he thinks it's funny to see you get mad, he'll lose interest if you just ignore his behavior. This can be a good way to get him to stop in the moment.;
, You can also try telling your dad to stop. It's possible your dad does not realize he's bothering you. It's also possible your dad has never been confronted about his behavior before, so he doesn't think he needs to stop. Try standing up for yourself in the moment and see if your dad stops picking on you.Be assertive without being aggressive. Do not raise your voice, but simply say in a stern manner, ""Stop talking to me like that.""
After you ask your dad to stop, walk away from the situation.
While this can be a good technique, if your dad has a temper, you may want to take a different route. You do not want to escalate the situation.

, You can also try thinking of a comeback to the teasing to make it clear you cannot be intimidated. If your dad makes fun of your hair, for example, say something like, ""Thanks for sharing"" and then walk away. Try to look relaxed when the teasing occurs, so you appear unbothered by your dad picking on you.As with confronting your dad, however, be careful. If your dad has a temper, you do not want to risk making him angry and potentially escalating the situation.

, If you have siblings, strength in numbers can help you stop getting picked on. Try to stick around your siblings when your dad is around. You and your sibling can work on ignoring or standing up to your dad together. He may feel uncomfortable if he's outnumbered."

Follow the rules.It’s natural to test your boundaries when you’re a teenager, but breaking your parents’ rules isn’t going to convince them that you’re ready for more responsibility.,
Show respect and have a good attitude, even if your parents’ rules don’t change.Don’t be a brooding, angry teen.,
Be persistent.,
Don’t be secretive.Remember, your parents’ worst fear is that you’ll put yourself in a dangerous situation where they won’t be able to protect you.,
Don’t lie.If you say you’re going to the mall after school, don’t end up at a friend’s house with no explanation.",How to Get Freedom with Overprotective Parents as a Teenage Girl2,"


Even if your parents’ rules seem silly or overly restrictive, those rules will likely stay in place or become even stricter if you can’t follow them. If you can show them that you respect their rules, they might be more likely to trust you to handle more freedom.
Communicate to your parents that you understand that they love you and only want what’s best for you. Once your parents see that you appreciate their concern for you, they’ll be more likely to listen to your explanations for why you believe you can handle more responsibility. You could say, ""I know you only want to keep me safe, but I'm hoping we can figure out a way where I could be safe and still get to do some things with my friends. Can we talk about it?""

,


If you create a tense and angry environment at home, your parents probably won’t want to reward your behavior by changing their rules. Be a pleasant and easy-going person, and your parents will be more likely to consider things from your perspective.
Don’t try to wear your parents down by making their lives miserable. They’ll resent you, and you won’t respect them when they cave in.
It’s natural that you’ll feel frustrated and angry from time to time. When you do, try to express yourself in a calm and reasonable manner instead of rolling your eyes or stomping out of the room. Don't make sarcastic comments about how their rules are ""stupid"" or ""unfair"" or how you wish they'd be more like your friends' parents.

, Don’t give up the first time your parents refuse to change their rules. Instead, set your mind on proving to them that you can handle more responsibility by keeping their rules and continuing to make well thought-out, careful arguments.


Be clear about the fact that you still wish your parents would relax their rules. When your parents won't allow you to do something that you think you should be permitted to do, reassure them that you will follow their rules because you respect them. But also remind them that you still believe you could handle more freedom and that you're trying to earn their trust. While you shouldn’t constantly complain about their overprotective behavior, you also shouldn’t hide your feelings.
Instead, make a plan to revisit the topic once every few weeks. Mark down a date on a calendar, and keep track of the days since the last time you had a serious discussion with your parents. Once you’ve made progress in being respectful and following their rules, you will have a track record that you can point to in proving that you deserve more freedom.
As always, be very tactful in how you approach your parents. For instance, instead of saying ""I've done a good job following your rules. Now it's time for you to change them for me,"" you should say something such as, ""I was wondering if we could talk. I've been doing my best to respect your rules, but I still feel as if I'd like to have a little more freedom. Is there anything I can do to earn your trust?""

, You don’t want to give them reasons to believe that you’ll abuse their trust if they allow you to make more of your own decisions.


If you go through life hiding things from them, they’re only going to assume that you’ll also hide your motives from them. If you give your parents the impression that you have a secret life that you don’t want them to know about, that will only increase their anxieties about what you’ll do once you’re away from them. You should try to keep the lines of communication as open as possible.
It’s not wrong to keep some things private, of course. You’re allowed to keep some thoughts to yourself. But you shouldn’t give them the impression that you’re living one life at home and another when you’re away from them.

, If you say you’re going to a friend’s house to study for an exam, don’t spend the evening watching Netflix at a different friend’s house.


If your parents can’t trust your word, they won’t trust you to keep any promises that you make to them. It’s hard to argue that you deserve more responsibility if you already struggle to keep the rules that you’ve been given.
Be honest with them. Even if you mess up and do something that you know will make them angry, they’ll be happy that you respect them enough to acknowledge your mistake. If you lie and cover it up, they’ll expect you to do that in the future, as well.

Talk to a family friend or trusted adult.Emotions run high when you’re a teenager, and you might not perceive your situation correctly.,
Keep a journal and write about your feelings toward your parents’ rules.,
Think about the rules from your parents’ perspective.,
Don’t forget that this situation is only temporary.",How to Get Freedom with Overprotective Parents as a Teenage Girl3," As hard as it is to consider, it’s possible that your parents are actually treating your fairly and with the right amount of caution.


Do you have a trusted aunt, uncle or grandparent with whom you could discuss your situation? Do you think your high school guidance counselor could offer you some advice? If you don’t feel like you could talk to other adults because you’re afraid they’d end up siding with your parents and agreeing that you currently have the correct limits placed on you, that might indicate that your parents actually are being fair. If that’s the case, you need to be honest with yourself.

, You’ll feel better after writing down your thoughts without fear of offending anyone, and you’ll be able to reread your journal over time to see how well you are following your parents’ rules and behaving in a mature manner.


Your journal will provide a written history of how you and your parents are negotiating your rules. If you are truly following their guidelines and behaving as they want you to, you will be able to show them that you've kept your word. This will allow you to produce evidence for your argument and help you prove that they can trust you with more freedom.

, Consider why the rules are in place and what your parents believe those rules are accomplishing.If you had a teenaged daughter, would you allow her to go to a party at a friend’s house with no adults around? Would you allow your 14-year-old daughter to go on dates with no adult supervision? Your parents were once the age you are now, and it’s very possible that they got away with behavior that they don’t want you to repeat.
If you can’t see any reason for the rules, ask your parents to explain them. For instance, you could say, ""I know you want to keep me safe, but I was wondering why you think allowing me to go to a movie on a Friday night would be putting me in a dangerous situation."" They might have reasons that they’ve never mentioned to you or that you haven’t considered, and you might be able to ease some of their fears.
For example, if you want to attend a movie with a group of friends but your parents are afraid someone might pose a threat to you, you could say ""I understand your fears, but I would be with a group of girls my age, and we'd be in public the whole time. If anyone was threatening us, we'd call for help and leave that situation.""
Remember that your parents have a reason for their rules. Even if their rules seem unreasonable, your parents put them in place because they want to protect you, and the reason they want to protect you is because they love you. Someday you might thank them for it.

, You’ll be out on your own someday, and you’ll be free to make your own rules. Even if your parents’ are placing ridiculous limitations on your behavior, you will be an adult soon. If you have no choice but to suffer through this period of your life, you can use this time as an opportunity to learn discipline and patience.

Talk to another adult about the issue.,
Wait until your dad is calm to discuss the issue.,
Open the conversation honestly.,
Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings.,
Listen to your dad's perspective.",How to Get Your Dad to Stop Picking on You2," If your father is making you uncomfortable, you may want to talk it over with another adult. Your other parent, for example, may be able to help mediate the situation so you feel more comfortable. If you're unable to talk to your other parent, try talking to another relative, such as aunt or uncle, or the parent of a friend.Another adult can help you sort out your feelings. If you want to talk the problem over with your dad, another adult can help you figure out how to best bring up how your dad makes you feel.
Tell another adult exactly how your dad is picking on you. You can also tell them how the behavior makes you feel. For example, ""I don't like it when dad yells at me when I don't do my chores. The way he talks to me makes me feel insecure and scared and I wish he would stop.""

, This is especially important if your father has temper problems. Confronting your dad in the moment he's picking on you may backfire. He may get angry and double down on his aggression. Wait until your dad is calm to raise the issue.Do you know a time when your father is generally in a good mood? This may be a good time to talk with him. For example, maybe your father is always in good spirits when he gets home from bowling with his friends.
You may want to let your dad know you want to talk ahead of time, so he has a head's up. If your dad has a busy schedule, he may need to carve out some time to have a discussion. You can say something like, ""Dad, I need to talk to you sometime this week about something that's bothering me. Can you let me know when is good for you?""

, You should let your dad know exactly how you feel about the way he treats you. Be honest and give precise details. It's important your dad understands how you feel about the situation.Avoid sounding accusatory. Do not open the discussion with something like, ""Dad, I hate how you're always yelling at me."" This will make you sound hostile, and your dad may become defensive.
Instead, start with something like, ""Dad, I don't feel like we always get along as well as we should, and I don't like that. I would like to work on fixing this.""

, It can help to use an ""I"" statement when telling your dad how his behavior affects you. This is a statement phrased in a way to emphasize personal feelings. This way, it feels less judgmental. Instead of offering an objective assessment of the situation, you're merely saying how the situation makes you feel.An ""I"" statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feeling. Then, you state the action that led to that feeling. Lastly, you explain why you feel the way you do.
For example, you may be inclined to say something like, ""You yell all the time about my grades because you think I'm stupid. It's really mean because you know I try hard."" This sounds very hostile, and it could put your dad on the defense right away.
You can use an ""I""-statement to better express that feeling. For example, say something like, ""I feel hurt when you yell at me about my grades because I feel like you're saying I'm stupid, when I'm trying my best in school.""

, Give your dad a chance to talk as well. You want to hear his take on the situation, and understand where he's coming from. While it is never okay to make a child feel uncomfortable or hurt, your father may have reasons for behaving the way he does. Understanding him better can help you empathize, and make it easier to forgive your father and move forward.Listen to what your father has to say. He may have many reasons for picking on you. He may be stressed at work, or he may simply not realize how the behavior was making you feel. For example, your father may say something like, ""I thought it was just lighthearted teasing. I didn't realize it was hurting your feelings.""
If your father is receptive to what you are saying, he will hopefully offer an apology and an explanation. The two of you can move forward towards a healthy relationship.

Your dad may talk to you in a way that is traumatizing. He may ridicule you or curse at you. He may call you things like ""stupid"" or ""worthless."" He may also do things to scare you, like placing a pet or a sibling in a dangerous situation.

, It's important you tell someone about abuse, as it can be very damaging over the longterm. Emotional abuse may also eventually turn into physical abuse. Tell another adult relative, the parent of a friend, or a trusted teacher or counselor at school what is going on. These adults should be able to find you the resources you need to get away from an abusive situation.If you do not have an adult you feel you can trust, try calling Childhelp USA. This is an organization that seeks to help children who are being physically or emotionally abused by a parent. You can call at (800) 4-A-CHILD.

Cultivate a positive outlook.",How to Deal With Your Step Mom1," Many people find talking to professionals about hard things can be helpful. Professionals have seen many different kinds of stepparent situations before. They’ll likely have practical suggestions on how to cope. A counselor or therapist that focuses specifically on children and teenagers can be a great resource for you.Professionals are people who aren’t personally involved with your situation, and who have years of expertise in helping people get through hard times.
They are outside the relationships that bind your family and can often help you understand your situation in a new way.;
, The advantages of talking to your friends and family members about your stepmom is that you’re likely spending time and talking to them anyway - you don’t have to schedule a special time or go out of your way. Your friends and family will have a personal investment in your happiness.Because your friends and family won’t be neutral about the situation with your stepmom, their advice might not be as helpful. The best advice often comes from people without a personal connection to the situation.
It’s best to have a combination of people, including friends, families, and professional counselors to help you.
If you are part of a faith community, consider asking an adult in this community for support. Many times priests, rabbis, ministers and others have training in counseling in addition to their religious education.

, If you are unsure how to relate to your stepmom, ask your dad if you can sit down and discuss it with him. It’s best if you explain your frustrations clearly, without getting angry. Most likely, your father will have some good ideas. You might need to talk to your counselor or friend about the best ways to approach him. Consider the following:


”Dad, I’m feeling confused and sad. It’s a lot harder to adjust to having a stepmom than I thought. Do you have any good ideas?”
”I’m not sure how to treat my stepmom. She’s not my real mom, but she’s also not just your girlfriend anymore. What do you think I should do?”
”I wanted to talk to you about some of the changes that are going on in our family. I’m feeling uncomfortable with my stepmom and I’m not sure what to do about it.”

, Everything you say and do has value. When you understand that you are an important member of your family, you’re more likely to realize that your opinions matter. If you are feeling unappreciated or undervalued, then speak up and let your parent and stepmom know.It’s natural to desire a sense of safety and security. This comes when you have a feeling that you are seen and valued.
Most people want to feel like their emotions and ideas are important to the people in their household. If you don’t feel like this is true for you, find someone you trust to talk to.

, Are you making things worse in the household by being antagonistic towards your stepmom? It’s natural to get defensive when you’re struggling to accept your new family dynamic. If you’re making rude comments, or being disrespectful, you might be making the problem worse. When you are sad, frustrated or angry, it is easy to get caught up in these types of behaviors..


Picking fights and being angry makes it harder to focus on homework or fun things, like activities with friends and family members.
Arguing with your stepmom won’t bring your father closer to you. It may actually make things worse between you.
You don’t always need to agree with your stepmom, but try to keep your opinions as respectful as you would like hers to be towards you.

, Although having a hard time letting go is a natural reaction, continuing to dwell on the past will only cause more pain and prolong the adjustment period. Instead of thinking about what you're leaving behind, focus on accepting this situation you’re in right now and creating a positive future.One way to practice acceptance is to refocus your attention on something positive. Instead of dwelling on the trouble you’re having with your stepmom, find ways you can get more involved with your school or community even as your family is changing.
Try a new activity – drama, rock climbing, volunteering at a soup kitchen, whatever sounds interesting to you.
Getting out of the house, meeting new people and having new experiences will help keep you from resenting your stepmom all the time.

, Journaling helps you reflect on things that happen during the day. It’s a great self-teaching tool, because it often shows you new things about yourself. If you’re struggling with your stepmom, setting aside at least 20 minutes every day to write in a journal will likely help you handle your feelings.Journaling allows you to consider how changing your thoughts or behaviors might have brought about a different outcome.
Some people find that once they’ve written down the day’s events, they also spend a few minutes writing about about the lessons of the day, and brainstorming alternative ways to react to stress, handle relationships and recognize and appreciate life’s positive moments.
It’s a healthy practice to always write down at least 3 things in your daily journal that you’re grateful for. This helps your attention from becoming overly negative.

, Clinical studies show that people who exercise at least an hour per day are more likely to feel positive and respond well to life’s stresses. Moderately intense exercise is one of the highest recommended forms of coping.Moderate exercise means that your breath should be quicker than normal.
Running, brisk walking, swimming laps, or hiking are ways that you can exercise on your own. Playing team sports like basketball, soccer, volleyball or other sports all are great ways to include social exercise in your daily life.
Try to include strength-based training several times per week. Strength training includes weightlifting, gymnastics, push-ups and other resistance exercises.

, When you notice yourself complaining, try to balance this with a positive statement. Try to pay your stepmom a compliment every day, no matter how small it is. Even if you feel worried or upset, you can try to find something good to focus your attention on.Try to notice what you’re saying to yourself. For example, if your internal dialogue with yourself (“self-talk”) is filled with negative statements about yourself or other people, you might want to try and change this.
Negative thought patterns are easy to fall into, and hard to remove. If you’re struggling with negative feelings, talking to someone you trust, such as your dad, a counselor or another adult, may help.

Talk to your stepmom directly.,
Learn how to cope if your concerns are ignored.,
Choose your battles carefully.,
Start fresh.,
Offer your help.,
Spend time with your stepmom.",How to Deal With Your Step Mom2," It’s not unusual to have a stepmom. You probably even have a friend or two with a stepparent. Getting advice from someone your age who is in a similar situation can prove to be very valuable.Feeling as though you aren't the only one adjusting to a stepparent will make you feel less anxious about the situation.
Try to identify with another kid’s situation, rather than focus on what’s different about your families. Even if your friend’s situation is different from yours, she’s likely to be sympathetic to what you have to say.

, Starting a conversation about what is bothering you will help you get to know each other better. Sometimes resolving a problem together can make people feel closer to each other. This can help ease the tension and resolve the problems between you. Approach her with your concerns in an honest and nonjudgmental way.Some suggestions for starting the conversation are:


”I’m sad and angry about how things are going. Can we talk about it?”
”I want us to have a better relationship. Can we discuss how we could maybe do that?”
”I know you’re different than my mom, but it really bothers me when _____ happens. How can we fix this?”
”I’m not used to your way of doing things yet. I was wondering if we could talk about what you think house rules should be.”

, Unfortunately, not all parents listen to and respect the fact that their children have valid opinions. This is known as an authoritarian parenting style, in which ""it's my way or the highway.""Feeling unheard and being told to fall in line and simply accept your new situation ""because I said so"" can be extremely frustrating. If your dad and stepmom aren't listening when you say you're struggling, you may need to take other steps to deal with your stepmom.


Talk to the school counselor about your feelings.
Consider asking a mediator to be present when you talk to your dad and/or stepmom. A trusted grandparent, aunt or uncle, counselor, or family friend can help you communicate and compromise. Your dad and stepmom might be more willing to listen if there is another trusted adult present., Try to be as agreeable and helpful as possible. However, when you really need to get your point across strongly, do so with honesty and conviction. Your opinions do matter.


While you may wish things could go back to the way they were, your family's dynamics have changed considerably. Be aware that some things must be different. Try your best not to fight every small change.When you feel you need to speak up, you absolutely should. Try to be direct and leave out any sarcasm, and you will have a better chance of being heard.

, It’s never too late to try to resolve things with your stepmom. Let her know that you don’t like how things have evolved and you’d like to start again. If necessary, apologize to her, and mean it. This might be the start of a whole new relationship.""I’m sorry for the way I acted. Can we try to start over?""
”I don’t like how our relationship has worked out. Can we try something new?”
”I know you’re not my mom, and you aren’t ever going to be, but sometimes I just get mad about the whole situation. Can you work with me to try and move past it?”

, Sometimes actions speak louder than words. Ask your stepmom if you can help her with chores or grocery shopping. Offering your help is a great way of letting her know you’d like to make things work.


If you can tell she’s had a difficult day, offer to help her around the house, or take the initiative and start folding the laundry.
If you drive, offer to go grocery shopping for the family.
Collect the laundry baskets and do the laundry, or take the trash out when you notice that the can is full.
Feed the family pets, or clean out the cat’s litter box even if it’s not your turn. You could offer to make dinner for the whole family once a week.

, Going to a movie together or taking a walk will encourage conversation and help build a closer bond between you. If she asks you to join her in an activity, say yes. Often, getting out of the house and into a new environment will have a way of dispelling tension and offer a new perspective.Try to relax and be open-minded. You might find that you have areas of interest in common that will help your relationship.
Even doing little things like watching television together or playing video games with her can help your relationship improve.
If you’re uncertain how to do this, consider doing activities with a larger group of people. For example, going on a rafting trip or taking a class together might be fun.

Be patient with the progress.,
Consider the possibility that you may never like her.,
Keep your calm.,
Don't try to force a change.",How to Deal With Your Step Mom3," A new family is being created and it takes time for everyone to get used to it – stepfamilies have their own dynamics and are different from a biological family.Blending a family successfully doesn't happen overnight. It takes time, and sometimes it never happens as you hope. Everyone is adjusting and it will continue to evolve. Clear, open, and honest communication is vital for success.Your dad may be eager for you to get along with and accept your stepmom, or become one ""big, happy family,"" but this is probably unrealistic.If you feel your dad is pushing you, tell him you are open to the idea of a relationship with your stepmom, but it needs to happen slowly.

, Sometimes people are just so different from each other that it makes it difficult to build a relationship. When personalities clash it can make it almost impossible to find common ground to get to know each other.


If you do your best to be kind and respectful, you won’t be making the situation worse. In the meantime, look for any common interests you might have as a way to improve your relationship.
It's okay if you want to spend more time with friends or other family members right now. If you are invited to do things with your stepmom, it's okay to say you don't want to. Just try to do so in a respectful way.

, If your stepmom is difficult, rude, or bossy and continues to behave the same way after repeated attempts to keep the peace, it might be best to ignore her. Focus on yourself and what you can change within yourself to better adapt to her.


If your stepmom is rude to you, try not to take it personally. Take the power out of her rudeness by choosing to treat it as her problem, not your problem.Try to remember that you have a choice in how you react.
Don't let your stepmom's mood disrupt your day. The best way to diffuse difficult behavior is to stay friendly and helpful, rather than getting angry.
Joining in the drama will escalate the situation.

, Remember that you can't change someone's behavior. In fact, trying to get someone to change their behavior can often make things worse. Sometimes, you just need to accept that their negative attitude is not your fault.You might try to giving your stepmom some space and put your focus elsewhere.
If you need to, spend time playing sports or doing activities that get you out of the house. Hang out at your friends' houses and minimize your contact with your stepmom.

Instead, try to use a tone of voice that’s friendly and respectful. Your parents are more likely to be able to respond in a respectful way when approached in this way.It can be very hard to keep your tone of voice respectful when you’re feeling upset. Rather than taking it out on your parents, try venting your frustration in another way.
When you don’t feel like you can talk calmly, it’s okay to take a break. Go on a run, cry in your bedroom, punch your pillow - whatever helps you feel calm.;
, Talk as clearly as you can about what your feelings are. Sharing your feelings, thoughts, and ideas with your parents may not be easy, but it will help your parent feel like you’re really trying to connect with her.Give as many details as you can to help explain your point of view. Grounding your feelings and ideas in real life situations may help your parent understand your perspective better.
Your parent is more likely to be able to be helpful if she genuinely understands your point of view.

, Your parents might be worried about your safety, your reputation, or your future. Usually, your parents’ frustration comes from their desire for you to live a happy life, even though it might not seem like it at the time. Before you respond to your parents’ criticism with anger, stop for a moment. Take a deep breath, and remind yourself to consider their point of view.If you can see your parents’ point of view, say so. This will help your parents feel more understood.
Your parents will be more willing to listen to your point of view if you’re willing to listen to theirs.

, If you’ve got the reputation for being honest with your parents, they’ll be more willing to trust you to tell them the truth. If you act overly dramatic, if you lie to them, or if you sometimes hide (or stretch) the truth, they’re less likely to believe you - even if you’re telling the truth.It can take a long time to regain your parents’ trust if you’re caught lying.

Empathizing with the difficulties of parenthood can help you better understand and therefore please your own parents.


While parenting can be a fulfilling task for many, it can also be stressful especially during the early years. Your parents worked hard to raise you, so show them love and appreciation in return.Psychological studies indicate parents are happier when they view their children as center to their lives, and the idea of being a parent as a key part of their identity. If you feel this is the case with your parents, keep that in mind. While you may have your own life, social group, and romantic interests to keep track of, your parents probably still view you as an essential component to their happiness. Try to understand this and keep them filled in on your personal and professional life. They're as invested in your happiness and success as you are.;
, Regular communication is key to keeping your parents happy and making them feeling included in your life and your decisions.


Talk to your parents when you've having a problem, but also talk to them when that problem is resolved. Your parents like to feel needed, even if you're an adult or young adult. Talking to them to vent or ask for advice helps them feel included in your life and decisions. However, do not only open up when something is wrong. This will feel like a one-sided relationship. Make sure to stop by and talk once the problem is resolvedFill them in on your day-to-day life when you see them. Talking need not always be in response to a major life event or emergency. Simple chatting is also key to a strong, healthy relationship with your parents that will keep them happy.If you live at home, make sure to talk to your parents at meals or after work or school. Answer their questions with more than just a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer and ask them about their day as well. Communication should go both ways, and your parents will feel happy if they feel like you're invested in knowing about their lives as well., If you've moved out of your parents place but are still in the same town, find time to visit.


Having a weekly dinner is a helpful way to assure regular visits. You can go out to eat or volunteer to cook. Your parents will appreciate having a meal prepared rather than having to go to the trouble themselves.Another great weekly ritual can be a movie or TV night. If there's a show you all enjoy, you can plan on taking time to watch it together each week. If there's a movie theater nearby, you could make a point of seeing a show every Sunday afternoon or Tuesday night.
Spontaneous visits can also be a great way to please your parents. If you find yourself with nothing to do on a Friday night, stop by your parents place after dinner. If you know your dad has a long lunch break Wednesdays, stop by the house to say ""Hi.""

, Your parents will appreciate you occasionally helping them out with chores or other tasks around the house.


Do some basic household chores. Try to do so without being asked first. Something simple, like taking out the garbage or doing the dishes, can be a big help if your parents have had a busy day or week.
When fall or spring rolls around, volunteer to help out with the yard work. Bagging leaves, mowing the lawn, and watering the garden are all tasks your parents might need help with, especially if they're getting older.
Pay for meals once in awhile. If you're financially secure, try to pick up the bill for a family dinner now and again. Even if your parents don't need to save money, they'll appreciate it on principle. You're doing something nice for them to show them you care., If you live far away, your parents probably miss you. As previously mentioned, a lot parents view the role of a mother or a father as central to their identity. When their child is suddenly far away, they might feel lost. Keeping them filled in on your life, event at a distance, can combat such feelings.


Try to have a regular time you call each week. Pick a day and time that's convenient for both of you. If you know your parents always stay in on Tuesdays, for example, try calling Tuesday nights after dinner. If Sundays are a low key day, schedule a weekly phone call on a Sunday afternoon.Share photos when you can. Mailing or e-mailing your parents pictures from your day-to-day life can help them feel included even though you're far away. If your parents have smart phones and are text-savvy, occasionally sending them a picture or video of something fun you did over the weekend can be a great way to keep them engaged in your life., Technology can be a great way to please your parents long distance. Teaching them how to use modern technologies like e-mail, social media, and Skype can help them stay connected to their children long distance.


A computer with a camera equipped is the first step to enhancing your parents' lives via technology. Video calling through technologies such as Skype and Google are great ways for your parents to see you, your home, and your surroundings even from a distance. You could consider buying them a web cam for Christmas and finding time around the holidays to install it and teach them how to use it.Facebook can also be a great resource for long distance parents. Hearing from you via a social media platform is a fun and convenient way to maintain communication. If you get busy with work one week and miss a phone call, they can see what you've been up to by scanning your Facebook profile. If your parents are comfortable with setting up a Facebook profile, you can help them do so.If you do not have time to teach your parents everything they need to know about new technology, there might be adult education classes you can help them enroll in to learn the basics of computer skills. If you have older parents, in their 70's or 80's, this might be a good option as people of this age group tends to have less experience with computers, the internet, and e-mail than others., If your parents are getting older, it can be hard for them to get out of the house. This can lead to increased feelings of loneliness, especially if their kids have moved away. Finding ways to help them get out can help them stay happy.


If you can't be there yourself, you can buy tickets to events they enjoy in their area. Buy them a ticket for a local play or concert, for example. You could also buy the gift certificates for restaurants, bars, or salons in the area you know they enjoy.Enlist other family members. If you have a cousin or sibling who lives at home, enlist their help. Ask your brother if he has time to take your dad golfing over the weekend. Ask your cousin if she could drive your mom to the salon for a manicure. Even if you can't be there, you can find a way to get your parents out of the house., As parents get older, they might feel obsolete. If their children have moved away and they're retired or nearing retirement, they may feel that they are no longer needed. Making sure they know how much you appreciate them can help lessen such feelings.


Mention the ways in which they've influenced you. If your dad always kept the dishes and kitchen clean, tell him you've taken up that habit yourself. If your mom had a particular recipe you enjoyed, tell her that you make the same food on a regular basis. If your dad's decision to go into medicine inspired you to be a nurse or doctor, make sure he knows this.Ask your parents for advice. You do not have to take their advice, but coming to them during difficult circumstances and asking for help or guidance can help your parents feel needed and important.

, While it's great to want to please your parents, understand that if you grew up with particularly controlling or high pressure parents you may have fallen into a habit of people pleasing. People-pleasing can have negative effects longterm.


People pleasers often bend over backwards to accommodate other people. In the process, they lose sight of their own needs and wants. When your feelings of pleasure and self-worth are completely rooted in the approval of others, you end up not knowing who you are and become totally unable to nurture or care for yourself.Oftentimes, people become people pleasers due to high-pressure parents. If your parents imposed strict expectations on your growing up, you may have learned that your value comes from what others expect of you. Carrying the desire to please into adulthood can have negative effects.
People pleasers tend to have an intense fear of failure and rejection. They tend to be more high stress than others. This increased level of stress results in people-pleasers becoming less organized and productive than other people. People pleasers are also more easily affected by loneliness as their self-worth is rooted in making others happy., If you feel your desire to please your parents is rooted in compulsive people pleasing, there are ways you can get beyond this personality trait.


Getting beyond people-pleasing is a gradual process that takes a lot of personal effort. You need to acknowledge you're too much of a people pleaser and work at consciously getting to know yourself and giving yourself the time and care you need in addition to the people around you. Patience, restraint, and discipline is important to this process.It is helpful to seek out a therapist as you try to work away from people pleasing habits. A therapist can help validate you and your feelings and help you work away from destructive patterns. You can usually find a therapist through your insurance provider. Many big cities have low or no cost clinics available for people with poor coverage or without insurance. If you're a college student, many colleges and universities provide free counseling to students.

, If your parents expect too much of you, you can have a frank talk with them about your need for some independence.


Plan what you're going to say ahead of time as your parents may become defensive. It can help to write out your issues or make an outline to follow during the conversation.
Be reasonable. Tell your parents you're happy to keep them up-to-date on your life, but you need them to understand you need to make decisions for your own sake and not theirs.
If you live at a distance, sometimes it's easier to simply omit information. If you might be up for promotion, for example, don't say anything until you know one way or another. That way, your parents cannot pressure you with an onslaught of questions and advice.

Always try your level best.,
Take their ideas into account.,
Do the right thing.,
Be a good person.,
Be responsible.",How to Make Your Parents Proud of You1," How are you going to make your parents proud if you don't put in 100% effort? Try your hardest at anything and everything - sports, schoolwork, jobs, projects...show them that you're not slacking off. Have an enthusiastic attitude towards everything - it'll get you a lot further than you may think.;
, For example, say you want to cut your hair and dye it red while they want you to just trim it. You don't have to do exactly what they say, but at least try to take their ideas into account. You could keep your hair the same length, or trim it a little more than they would like. Apply this attitude for everything. Don't let them take over you, but make sure you at least 'show' them that you are considering their suggestions.

, Your parents probably won't be too proud of you if you're locked up in jail for several different crimes. In contrast, they may be upset or angry with you. You don't have to turn into a total goody two shoes, but make sure you know the limits and don't push them. Keep within the rules - whether at school, work, or the law. Before you do something, always think whether it's the right thing or not, and if your parents would be proud of you.

, You may stick to the rules, try your best, and take their ideas into account, but after all that you still may be an unpleasant, selfish person. That won't make your folks proud now, will it? So try to be a good person at heart. Be as generous, nice, and thoughtful as you can. You don't have to be anywhere near becoming a pushover or a goody two shoes, no, to be a merely good person at heart will suffice.

, Don't be so immature that your parents constantly have to keep an eye on you. It's great to have fun, but know when to stop and be responsible. It ties in with doing the right thing - again, always stay within the boundaries. Be trustworthy and reliable. If you're going to baby-sit, baby-sit. If you're going to do your homework, do your homework. If you're going to wash the car, wash the car. You can always party, but make sure you know when you've stepped well over the line!

Bring a change of clothes.,
Don’t get caught drinking.,
Do well in school.,
Develop good relationships with other adults.,
Don’t take criticism personally.",How to Not Get in Trouble With Your Parents2," Using rude language with your parents is almost always a guarantee of trouble. Fortunately, it’s very easy to avoid getting into trouble this way. Just use polite language, whatever that might mean in your family.Most parents like to hear “please” and “thank you.” They appreciate compliments. When you use polite language, your parents are less likely to look for your bad behavior.
Using polite language even when you don’t feel like it is an important social skill that will come in handy when you’re an adult.
Even when your parent is saying something that you disagree with or which is upsetting, try to keep your calm.

, A lot of fights between teens and their parents start with disagreements about clothing choices. If you want to avoid getting into an argument, just wear the clothes your parent wants you to, and bring a change of clothes in your backpack.Consider whether your parents’ concern is for your health and safety.
If you really want clothing that your parents can afford, learn to shop for discounts and sales.
Sometimes a compromise is possible. For example, you might choose to wear a short skirt with leggings, rather than bare legs.

, A lot of young people start experimenting with alcohol as teens, which can cause them to get in trouble with their parents. If you’re planning to drink alcohol, make plans to do it safely. Stay with people you know and trust.Never drive a car if you’ve been drinking at all, and never allow a friend who’s been drinking to drive you.
Be aware of the hazards of binge drinking. Binge drinking is considered having more than 4 drinks (for a female) or 5 drinks (for a male) at least once within a 2-week period. Heavy binge drinking is considered 3 or more binge drinking episodes within a 2-week period.
Consider talking to your parents about your desire to experiment.

, If your grades and conduct in school are good, chances are you’ll be more able to avoid getting in trouble with your parents. As long as your school reports are consistent, your parents are likely to overlook any smaller misbehaviors on your part.Spending time developing organizational systems for yourself will be helpful. If you don’t have to rely on your parents to tell you what to do, keep you on top of deadlines, you’ll be less likely to get into arguments with them.
Developing good study skills for yourself will help with your grades, and improve your relationship with your parents.

, If you can build strong relationships with supportive teachers, you’ll be on the track to doing better in school. You may also find that the teacher will have insight for you in how to not get in trouble with your parents.Perhaps you have another relative, such as an aunt or uncle, who can help you when you’re struggling to get along with your parents.
Not every conversation with an adult has to be deep and serious. Talking with an adult like you do with your friends can be a good way to start.
Try to find things that you have in common with the adult.

, When someone offers you criticism, you can usually find something useful in it, as long as you don’t get caught in the trap of defensiveness. If you can communicate your perspective honestly, you might learn something from your parents’ feedback. To keep from taking criticism personally, try this helpful strategy: Write down what they said in one column, then allow yourself to write down what you don't agree with in a second column.
In a third column, allow yourself to think about what part of what they’ve said might be right.
You don't have to talk to your parents about this process. It's just for you to think about.

Don’t overgeneralize.,
Try to figure out the disconnect.,
Don’t get mad about consequences.",How to Not Get in Trouble With Your Parents3," One quick way to light the fuse of an argument is to say that your parent always or never does things a certain way. It might feel that your parent never lets you go to a friend’s house, but is that true? Even if it’s true for a particular friend, you’ve probably spent some time in your life with your friends.By overgeneralizing, you’re essentially telling your parent that she’s not a good parent. That’s not going to make her feel good.
Stick to your own perspective. Telling her that you’re angry and disappointed that you can’t go to your friend’s house might bring better results.

, When you feel like your parent is picking a fight with you, don’t argue back. Instead, try to sort out what your parent might really be trying to say. If your mom wants you to go to church with her, it’s probably important to her that you share her faith tradition. If your dad wants you to dress a certain way, he might be concerned about your reputation. Your parents are probably just trying to get you to value the same things they value.
You can choose your own values as you grow up, and you can live the life you choose.
By understanding that your parents’ anger may be based in fear that you might be choosing different values, you can afford to cut them some slack.

, When your parents ground you, or take away privileges (like phone or computer), they’re usually trying to make sure you experience pain as a consequence for something you’ve said or done. The purpose of the painful consequences is to keep you safe - so that you won’t do the thing again. If they didn’t care about you, they wouldn’t bother making consequences for you.It’s important to realize that your parent might be wrong - and that’s okay. They are doing the best they can.
Remember that this consequence is temporary. It will pass.

Look down at the ground when they scold you.,
Don't talk back.,
Tell them your side of the story when they calm down.,
Admit your mistakes.",How to Make Your Parents Proud of You2," This will show your parents that you're actually ashamed of your behavior and that you're really thinking it over, determined not to do it again. If you smirk at them, give them a defiant stare, or look bored or annoyed, then they'll be even more angry at you. Though nobody likes being scolded, you should show them that you understand what you did wrong. If you're able to do that, you'll make them proud, even if they're still angry. It may be hard to believe this, but your parents don't like to scold you all the time either.

, When your parents are angry about something you did and are in the middle of telling you why they're disappointed, it's not the time to talk back, interrupt, or generally be disrespectful. Sure, you may want to tell them your side of the story, but you don't want to interrupt them when they're trying to tell you something. It's for your own good. Remember, there's a time and a place for everything.

, If you feel they don't understand the situation, give them some time to cool off before you go and tell them what you really think. If they ask you to tell them your side on the spot, that's fine, however if they look frustrated or need some space, give it to them instead of continuing a conversation they don't want to have. They'll be proud of you for recognizing that they want to be left alone and will be more receptive to the fact that you realized they need some private time.


When they look ready, you can calmly and politely tell them your side of the story.

, Nobody's perfect, and it's much better to admit you've made a mistake than to be in denial or be mean and petty about it. If you say you're sorry, look your parents in the eyes and promise not to do it again and really mean it. That will definitely make your parents proud. They don't expect you to be perfect, but what they do expect is for you to accept responsibility when you're in the wrong. This is a big part of being a mature individual with self-knowledge.

, Find out what you are good at, and join a club or team that supports that endeavor. It is good to have hobbies, and having something that your parents can hang on the wall like a certificate or ribbon will bring them much happiness.


Remember that you do not have to be the best. Do your personal best and push yourself to grow in whatever you are doing, but do not try and be perfect. Your parents will be happy just knowing you are trying your hardest.
Try out multiple things. One year you might go out for the volleyball team and not make it. Try and join the art club. You might find your passion in something unexpected.

, If you are an adult living at home, it can be difficult to balance your independence with your parents authority. Make it easier on yourself by honoring that they have the final say within their own house. This will ease any tension and keep your parents happy.Help them around the house. You are an adult and should pull your own weight. Wash clothes, do yard work, or clean up the kitchen without having to be told.
Respect house rules. If you know your parents would be uncomfortable with you doing something in the house, then opt to not do it. If they do not like your significant other staying over, then do not invite he or she over after a date. If they do not like alcohol in the house, only drink when you are not home, etc.

, You will not always agree with your parents way of doing things, but you must respect it. Do not force your way of doing things on them in their own home. This will just create problems. If you feel yourself getting frustrated, leave the situation before it escalates.Talk to you parents after you have cooled off. If you try and talk to them during the heat of the moment, it could become a big problem. Wait until everyone has calmed down before you try and resolve any problems.
Take responsibility for your wrongs. It is easy to blame the other person for doing something to you, but you also must consider how you contributed to the problem. You have to be mature and own up to your mistakes. Being able to do this will keep a happy relationship between you and your parents.

, Your parents spent many years raising you. Now, they probably want some time to themselves. A healthy sense of space from you will keep your parents happy while parenting you as an adult. If they are in a main room watching TV, let them have their alone time. Go to your room and shut the door so they can have their full privacy.Get out the house so they can have it to themselves. Being able to relax when nobody is around is a treat that they might not be given often.

, You are at a different time in your life, as are your parents. As an adult, you can enjoy a relationship with your parents that is not centered around them caring for you, but in getting to know each other on an adult level. Talk to your parents and learn more about them and let down your guard as well. Getting to know you this way will make them happy.


Try activities with them you would not have done as a child, like watching R-rated movies that can stimulate conversation or making them dinner. Since you live together, you will have plenty of time to spend together. Try and make it as fun as possible.
Learn to confide in them. As a teen, telling your parents about anything in your life probably seemed embarrassing and daunting.

Look at https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Friends-with-Your-Parents if you need more suggestions.

, Nobody is perfect, and living at home with your parents as an adult might pose some problems. You might do or say something you should not. Always apologize. Your parents do not expect you to always do everything right, and being able to own up to what you did wrong will show character and make them happy.Do not be defensive. Though you might have had your reasons for doing what you did, it does not make it right. Do not defend yourself to the point where you are not able to learn from your mistakes.
Be sincere. Showing that you are truly sorry and not just saying it because you have to will go a long way in making your parents feel as if you understand them. That always makes for a happier relationship.

, Your parents still want to talk to you. Call them to see how they are doing. Fill them in on your life. This gesture shows them that you care and understand that they care about you. It will surely brighten their day to hear from you.If you are busy, set up a weekly time for you to talk to them. Having a schedule will make it easier for you to remember that you need to touch base.
Text them. More and more parents are picking up their cell phones and texting. Sending them a quick, “How are you?” or funny picture during the day will let them know they are on your mind and still important in our life.
If you talk to one parent more than the other, see if you can talk to them both at the same time. That way, you can all connect at once and it will save everyone some time.

, There is nothing like face-to-face interaction with people. Your parents would love to give you hugs and see your expressions as you talk. Take time to go and sit down with them and you will see them smile.


If you live far away, video message. Buy a webcam if you do not have one on your computer, or download an app to your phone or tablet if it has a camera. Help your parents to install a program if they do not know how.
Take them out and treat them. Though a house visit is nice, try and take your parents out to keep things interesting. Try activities with them that you think they would enjoy like joining classes or finding events around your communities., Not everyone’s parents are mobile, or maybe they no longer enjoy driving alone. Pick them up and take them to their appointments, the store, or different activities they might be apart of. This will be much appreciated by them and give you time to spend together. Both of those will make your parents happy.


Turn off the radio if you are in the car. Use this as a time to connect with your parents by talking and catching up on your lives. Your parents will enjoy the conversation with you and it will help you to bond on a more mature level.
Make a day of it. Perhaps your mother or father has a few stops. Take them to every place, and maybe treat them to lunch or dinner. This is a great opportunity to spend time with each other and it would make your parents very happy if you take advantage of that.

, If you do not live near your parents, or even if you do, take time to write out a thoughtful letter and put it in the mail. It is quick to call them, but putting the thought into a hand-written note will be a nice surprise for them. If you need help writing a letter, look at https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Friendly-Letter for suggestions.


Email them if they are online. This is always a great way to contact your parents. Though it is not as personal as a letter, it is still thoughtful and would make them very happy to know that you are thinking about them.
Send pictures in your letters. That way, they can see your face and hang onto the image. If you have children or other family members you live with, send pictures of them as well. This will delight your parents to see how everyone is doing and how the children have grown.
Have your kids write letters or make pictures to send them. Your parents would love to hear from their grandkids. It would definitely make them happy to receive a handwritten note or drawing from your children.

, Receiving a gift always makes someone happy. That gesture of kindness, even when small, is enough to make someone’s day. Do this for your parents and see how happy it makes them.


Be on the lookout for small tokens if big gifts are out of your price range. Coming home with their favorite candy bar from a trip to the store is still meaningful and will make them feel special.
If you are out and see something your parent might like, buy it for them if you can afford it. If your mother likes clothes and you see a blouse that would flatter her, surprise her with the shirt even if there is no occasion.
Make them a gift. Hand-crafted presents are always nice. If you can knit, try making your dad a scarf that matches his winter coat or if you are great cook, make them a cake and take it over their house. Put in that extra effort to make sure they know they are loved.

, Give them a call or visit them on their birthday. Make sure they feel as if their day means as much to you as it does to them. It is important to show that you want your parents to feel as if they matter to you. That will surely make them happy.


Give them something personal to them. If you dad likes golf, buy him a free day at the course. Get your mother a gift card to a nice restaurant if she likes to eat out. Tailor the gifts to show that you really know your parents and want to make them happy.
Make it more than one day of celebrating. An entire birthday weekend of fun activities and attention is a great way to let your parents know you truly care and want to make them feel special.
Be creative. Nobody likes to get the same gift every year. Pay attention to your parents current interests. If your mom is starting to drink coffee in the morning, get her a coffee maker one year. Always getting her a sweater would be boring, and the variety would show that you pay attention to her.

, Do your best to make sure they are honored on this day. Go to church with them, take them out to eat, buy them a gift, or give them a card with special words in it. Let them know you are proud to be their son or daughter, you love them, and they are important to you. Making them feel this way will bring them great happiness.


If you cannot be with them on that day, send them a gift in the mail. Fruit arrangements or food baskets are a yummy way of showing your love from far away.
Make sure your children acknowledge their grandparents. Mother’s and Father’s Day are also for the grandkids. Get them involved so that the whole family is honoring your parents.

, Your parents are people, too. They want to be treated with thoughtfulness and consideration, same as you do.


If you are an older child, talk to your parents about some problems they may be experiencing. Offering emotional support should not be a one-way street. If your mother is worried about a health issue or your father has stress at work, hear them out and offer them encouragement and any advice you think is helpful.
Be appreciative of them. Chances are, your parents do a lot for you and you should be grateful of that. Let them know that appreciate all that they do. Tell them regularly and show it in how you treat them.
Do not take advantage of them. It is easy to have a bad attitude with your parents, but it does not make them feel happy when you do so. Do not take advantage of their kindness, patience, and generosity with you. That will cause tension in your relationship.

",How to Make a Tropical Themed Date Night for Your Parents," If you have a pool, maybe you could set it up beside the pool. Or you could set it up in the garden.;
, You could do a pineapple shaped invite, or a palm tree, or a coconut. Anything tropical!

, Make sure it's a time that suits your parents, but don't give away too much! If they ask you why you want to know, just tell them that your best friend was going to give you a call on that day and you wanted to make sure you had nothing on.

, Tell them about your plan for the date night. Just make sure you don't try to give them the invitations say, when they're doing the vacuuming, or typing an email, etc.

, If you have an iPod, you could download some songs onto it that are sort of Hawaiian.

, Next time your mom goes shopping, ask her if you can come along too and explain that you need to get some food and things for the date night. Hopefully she'll agree. If she doesn't, just see what you've got at home.

, If your mom said yes to you getting what you need for the date night, then look in the party section of the shop. Get little umbrellas (decorations that go round the stem of a wine glass), drink stirrers (you can get them in the shape of palm trees), and most importantly, straws. Also get the ingredients you'll need for the food you'll be making, and maybe even a bunch of roses for your dad to give to your mum at the end of the date night!


Get the decorations that add to the theme. While you're out, ask your mom or dad if you can go to a dress-up store. Explain again about the date night and how you need to get stuff for it. If they say yes, go to the store and look for things like fake grass skirts and plastic leis. If you have any siblings, let them in on the date night plan as well.

, Hang them wherever the decorations would look most appropriate and add to the tropical atmosphere around the dining area.


If you have the date night up to a table, scatter shells on it; if your neighbours have a hibiscus bush, ask very politely if you could have maybe two or three hibiscus and explain what they're for.

, And you could even make a table number too. All you need to do is get a straw and cut two slits in it, then get a piece of cardboard and cut it into whatever shape you want. Decorate it, then write the table number on it. Slot it into the straw and push a wad of poster tack onto the bottom of the straw so that it can stand up.

, There are tiki torches and things like that, available at hardware stores. Little solar LED garden lights aren't expensive either and can look good. If you buy these lights before the date, they'll be all charged up and ready for when the night comes.

, All of you could wear grass skirts and have plastic leis and little notebooks to jot down your parent's orders. Remember that you need to have a chef and a waiter.

, Get sheets of paper and write all the menu items on it. Decorate.

, When your parents come to the date night, take them to their seats, say 'Aloha', and give them each a plastic lei.

Ask your mom to tell you about her life.,
Ask your mom how she’s feeling.,
Send her a quick text.,
Apologize when you know you've done something wrong.,
Put yourself in her shoes.,
Talk to her when you’re having problems.,
Develop some inside jokes and references.",How to Make Your Mother Happy1," One way to make someone else feel valued is to show them that you’re interested in them: who they are, what they’ve experienced, and what they think about. Asking your mom about her life will offer you the chance to connect with her, and will make her feel happy that you’re interested in what she has to say.


For example, if you’re just hanging out in the living room, you could turn to your mom and ask her what her favorite thing to do was as a little girl. You’ll probably get a few interesting stories this way!
Research even shows that families who share stories about their family history have closer bonds, and the children in those families tend to have more self-confidence. Asking your mom to talk about her history will benefit both of you -- it’s science!;
, Moms are just like anyone else: they need people to talk to. Asking your mom how she’s feeling shows that you’re paying attention to her and that you care about her happiness -- and that will probably make her very happy.


For example, if you notice that she seems stressed, you could say something like this: “You seem really stressed right now, Mom. Are you okay?”
Asking your mom about her day is another good way to engage with her. She probably asks you about what you did that day; why not return the favor?

, Even small acts of kindness have big payoffs. Sending your mom a quick text during the day that says you’re thinking about her will help make her feel appreciated and special. The more people feel cared for, the happier they tend to be.You don’t have to write a novel to make an impact. Even a short “Hi Mom! I hope your day is going well” is enough to show that you care about your mom’s happiness.

, Sometimes it’s really hard to apologize to your mom, especially if you feel like she’s on your case a lot. However, apologizing when you’re wrong and taking responsibility for your actions will strengthen your relationship and make your mom feel loved.


Good apologies incorporate the “3 R’s”: regret, responsibility, and remedy. This means you express regret for the hurt you caused, take responsibility for your actions without making excuses, and offer a suggestion for what you’ll do differently next time.
For example, if your mom points out that you forgot to take out the trash again, say something like “I’m sorry I forgot to take out the trash. I know that meant more work for you. I’ll put a reminder in my phone for Wednesdays so I remember next time.”, It can sometimes feel like your mom is your best friend one day and your prison warden the next. Instead of just thinking to yourself What is she doing?, try imagining what it would be like to be in her position. Exercising your empathy muscles isn't just good for your mom, it's good for you, too.For example, if she asked you about your day and you shrugged her off instead of talking, that might have hurt her feelings. If you’re too busy to talk at that moment, express that clearly by saying something like “Sorry, but I have a lot of homework to finish right now, Mom.Is it okay if we can talk later?” This shows that you do care about connecting with her, even if you can’t do it right then.
Moms can do things that embarrass you; in fact, sometimes it can feel like they specialize in it! Try to imagine why your mom is doing what she’s doing. It could be that she’s babying you because she wants you to feel secure, not because she thinks you’re immature. And hey, you can always ask her why she’s doing what she does.

, Many moms love to feel involved in their kids’ lives, especially when their kids invite them to share in their feelings and thoughts. If you’ve had a bad day, or you can’t figure out a situation at school, or you have a secret crush and don’t know how to approach him or her, ask your mom for advice. This will help make her feel like you value her opinion.


The opposite of this also goes. Even though your mom is probably happy to listen and help you with your issues, you also don’t want the only times you talk to your mom to be when you dump your problems on her. If you’re feeling great about something, or you have some good news to share, or you just saw a movie that you liked, chat with her about that, too.

, You probably have a lot of hilarious jokes with your friends, right? Maybe you went to see a movie one time and mispronounced a character’s name, so now it’s funny whenever you bring up that mispronunciation. Having that kind of “secret” humor just between you and your mom will help strengthen your bond and make both of you feel secure and happy in your relationship."

Spend time together.,
Talk to your parents about the things they do that upset you.,
Get help with unreasonable demands or behavior.,
Talk to your parents about the challenges you're facing.,
Remember that quarrelling is normal.,
Practice seeing things from your parents' perspective.",How to Love Your Parents1," Shared activities help build a sense of connection. Doing activities that you all enjoy can help you see other aspects of your parents. Your parents might be worried about being less involved in your life as you grow up, but inviting them to take part with you in a fun activity can set the groundwork for your future loving adult relationship.


For example, if you really like rock climbing, invite your parents to an easy climbing wall with you. This gives you the opportunity to teach them something, and they may be more supportive of your hobby if they've experienced it with you.
Or, you could offer to join your parents and learn more about one of their hobbies. Spend an afternoon at the art museum together, and ask questions about why they like it. Interacting with you on an adult level will help you to develop a more mature relationship.;
, If your parents don't know what's bothering or annoying you, they won't be able to try to change their behavior. Choose a quiet, unstressful moment to have this conversation, and be aware that you might have to revisit these topics multiple times. Your relationship won’t change overnight.


Plan in advance what you want to say, so that you won’t find yourself blurting things out. [[ It may be helpful to talk to another trusted adult in advance. They will be able to give you an adult’s perspective on your concerns, and let you know if your parents’ behavior is typical or more serious.

, Some parents really are overly strict or constantly critical. They may berate you for not always winning at your sport or push you into activities that you don’t enjoy.Other parents may be neglectful, focusing on their work or new relationships rather than their children. If you are facing these kinds of demands or issues, know that you need and deserve outside support from a counselor or therapist. Your doctor or a trusted teacher will be able to help you find that support.


It’s not up to you to fix your parents’ issues or problems. Your job is to take care of yourself and learn strategies for negotiating the difficult aspects of your relationship.

, Your parents are likely to have useful experience and advice about topics like sex, relationships, and growing up. Open dialogue about these topics will strengthen your relationship. Use an example from a TV show or an article as a way to break the ice.
Send a text if it’s hard to open the conversation. Sometimes it’s easier to begin a difficult topic by expressing yourself in writing.
Ask questions about your parents’ own experiences of being a teenager.

, Your teenage years are an emotional time. Arguing with your parents doesn’t necessarily mean you have a bad relationship.Apologize if you’ve done or said something hurtful.
Learn other ways to express your anger, such as writing in a journal or venting to a friend before talking to your parent.
Practice asking for what you need. If your parent is doing something that annoys you, try to explain your reaction calmly and suggest a reasonable alternative.

, Ask yourself: how would I feel if I were in their shoes? What might scare or worry me, if I were the parent of a teenager? Developing empathy will help you to feel compassion toward your parents, and to see when even their annoying actions are based in love for you.

Help your mom around the house.,
Make a meal for her.,
Take on more responsibility for yourself.,
Spend time with your mom.,
Remember important dates.",How to Make Your Mother Happy2," Gifts mean more when they show that you put some time and effort into them. They don’t have to be expensive, either; anything that shows that you thought about what would make your mom happy will probably have the effect you want.


For example, if your mom loves Star Wars, fold her an origami Yoda! While it’s also very cheap to make, this gift shows that you pay attention to her interests and will take the time to brighten up her day.You could also make your mom a “coupon book” with things she can redeem, such as “one breakfast in bed” or “one bad joke upon request.”
Mix tapes may be too “old school” for you, but you can put together a playlist of songs that remind you of your mom, or songs that make you happy when you’re feeling down. Share this playlist with her, and whenever she hears that song, she’ll think of you.

, Maybe your mom always slipped a note into your lunch telling you that she loves you and always will. Why not try it out yourself? You can even pack her lunch for her and leave it in the fridge so she doesn’t have to do a thing in the morning.

, Sure, it can be embarrassing to bring your friends home to your mom. You never know if she’s going to try to haul out your baby pictures or talk about that “cute”thing you did when you were 5. However, making your mom feel involved in your life will remind her that you care about her -- even when she’s embarrassing you.

, Doing chores can be stressful and a huge time-suck. Take some of the pressure off your mom by helping out with things you’re able to do. This works even better if you surprise her; for example, if she gets home from work and finds all the dishes done already, she’ll probably be really happy.

, Getting dinner together can be incredibly stressful. If you know your mom is having a busy week, tell her you’d like to cook dinner one night. Even if you can’t do it all yourself, offer to help her in the kitchen. You’ll learn some sweet cooking skills and get to spend quality time together.


Breakfast in bed is a tried-and-true classic. While many people save it for Mother’s Day, the truth is that your mom will probably appreciate breakfast in bed on any weekend!
Take time to figure out what her favorite foods are and make them for her. If she likes something that’s too complicated for you, or that you don’t know how to make, ask her to teach you how to make it a few weeks before you want to make it for her.

, It can be incredibly stressful and time-consuming for your mom to manage everyone’s schedules, especially if you are part of a large family. Keeping up with your appointments and outings on your own will help take the burden off your mom. A mom with less stress is a mom with more happiness!, Ask to hang out just the two of you, or suggest you see a movie that she’s said she’s really excited about. You can offer to play video games with her or just go on a walk; the important thing is to show that you’re interested in spending time with her.


Outings don’t even have to cost anything. For example, if you’re both animal lovers, suggest that you and your mom go to the local animal shelter and play with the animals. Many rescue animals need socialization, so in addition to making your mom happy, you’ll also be helping cats, dogs, and the occasional ferret.

, Nothing makes a mom feel more special than her children remembering her birthday or anniversary. Send her a heartfelt letter, card, or e-card that expresses how much she means to you.


To help you remember important dates, put them into your phone’s calendar. If you’re friends with your mom on Facebook (yeah, it happens!), Facebook will remind you about her upcoming birthday.

Keep reaching out.,
Say thank you.",How to Love Your Parents2," Tensions between parents and adult children often revolve around different ideas about lifestyle, financial choices, or decisions about running a household or raising your own children.

Some things you can do to improve your performance in school include:Taking notes in class.
Listening carefully to instructions.
Doing all of your homework and reading assignments.
Studying for tests and quizzes.;
, They might seem unimportant compared to your classes, but what you do outside of school is important too. Put time and effort into your activities and your parents will be proud of your dedication.


For example, you can practice your free throws until you can finally make the winning shot for the school basketball team, or practice your clarinet solo enough to help your band win a state competition.

, This is a great way to make extra cash and show your parents how hard working you are. Even if you can only work a few hours a week at the local sandwich shop, getting an after school job will be beneficial to you and your parents may admire you for it.


Try to do as many of the steps to get a job (the resume, application, and the interview) without your parents’ help, but ask them questions and for advice if you need to.

, Although you are only a teenager, it is important to start thinking about your career early. Even if you change your mind, your parents will be proud that you are already considering your future. Start thinking about what you want to do and how you want to get there and discuss it with your mom and dad.


For example, you might set a goal of becoming a lawyer, an accountant, a teacher, or an entrepreneur. Think about what your dream job would be and start working towards it.
Try to choose a career path that feels right for you. Don’t feel pressured to follow a career path just to impress your parents.

, Having resilience to bad times is an important skill that will make your parents proud and impressed. If you can handle your own problems that life throws at you without needing your parents, they will be very proud. For example, if you did not do well on your English test, don’t go crying to your parents about it. Work extra hard to ace the next one.One way to deal with disappointments is to treat then as learning experiences. For example, if you fail a test, then what can you learn from the experience to help you do better on the next test? Perhaps you can start studying earlier, talk with your teacher about the questions that you answered incorrectly, or join an after school study group.

, Your parents are not going to be impressed if you recklessly spend your money. Teenagers should know how to manage their own money before they leave for college. If you have to keep asking your parents for money because you keep running out of your own money, then they won’t be impressed. Your parents are going to be proud of you if you can handle your own money and expenses.Try to create a budget for yourself to manage the money that you have or earn each week. For example, if you get $20 per week, consider what portion if it you have to spend, such as for gas or to buy lunch. Then, decide what purchases are extras, such as buying a soda after school every day. Pledge to save this money instead of spending it.

, They might not always want to ask for help or they might constantly nag you about it, but put in an effort to make their lives easier. They may feel uncomfortable asking you to help them, but they will appreciate it and be proud of your knowledge.For example, you can do extra chores around the house to help out your parents. They will probably appreciate this after a long day at work.
You can also look for everyday situations to help out. For example, if you see your mom having trouble setting up the new Wi-Fi router or your dad struggling to record the football game, then offer to help them.

, Taking the initiative and doing things without being asked may also impress your parents. Try to start doing more things for yourself so that your parents will not have to ask you.Clean up after yourself and keep your room clean. For example, you can do your own laundry, clean up a mess you made in the kitchen, and make your bed every morning. Your parents will be proud that you can take care of yourself.
Take care of your own tasks instead of asking your parents to do things for you that you can easily do yourself. For example, you could sign up for the SAT’s on your own or study for your chemistry test without them reminding you.

, Be thankful that you have a roof over your head and food in the cupboards because of their hard work. Be grateful for the hard work they put in to raise you and give you the best life they were able to. They will be impressed and happy to know that you have noticed their efforts to be good parents.


Just saying something as simple as, “Mom, I just wanted you to know I really appreciate everything you have done for me,” will go a long way., As you get older, it is important to start building pride in yourself and to rely less on other people for validation. If you are proud of who you are and what you have accomplished, then the opinions of your parents and other people will not matter. Some things you can do build self-pride include:

Reflecting on things you have done that have made you feel proud.This can be something small, like finishing a long book or something big like winning an award. Try making a list of all of the things that make you feel proud of yourself.
Making a list of your strengths, special skills, and talents. Try writing down everything that you are good at, such as playing soccer, writing, painting, playing the trombone, dancing, etc. You can also include special skills and talents on this list, such as being outgoing, knowing how to build a webpage, or being good at math.
Praising yourself when you think you deserve it. For example, you might start telling yourself “good job!” whenever you finish a project or do something that you think is praiseworthy. This can be something as simple as completing your homework for the evening or as big as getting the highest score in your class on a test. Be sure to praise yourself for your accomplishments.

, It can be frustrating if your mom and/or dad never says things like, “Good job!” or “I am proud of you!” However, your parent might not be aware that you are frustrated by this. You may be able to change this by talking to them about it.

Try saying something like, “I know that you are proud of me, but I really need to hear you say it sometimes. Can you please start to tell me when you are proud of me or tell me when I am doing a good job?”

, You are no longer a little kid, your relationship with your parents is a lot more of a two-way street now that you are a teenager. Your parents will be impressed and happy if you try to have a good relationship with them. You might be tired of living with your parents and having to listen to their rules, but they are always going to be there for you so you should try to be on good terms with them.Try telling your parents that you value your relationship with them and you want to improve it. For example, you might say something like, “I know we have not gotten along as well lately, and that bothers me. I really want to have a good relationship with you.”

, You have known your parents your entire life, so there is bound to be a lot of built up anger. Try to start over with them. Don’t hold a grudge because of the one time when you were five your mom accidentally left you at the grocery store or when your dad overreacted when he caught you skipping school. It is time for fresh starts and a new beginning with your parents.One way to start over with your parents is to write a letter to them that you do not send. In the letter, you might express all of the things that you are angry with them about. Then, at the end of the letter, tell them that you want to have a fresh start and that you forgive them for these things.

, Sometimes it can be easy to get mad at your parents. You feel like you are too old to listen to them anymore and like they don’t respect you. Living with them can get tiring and as you get older you start discovering you disagree on certain aspect of life. In order to improve your relationship with your parents you need to work out conflicts with them respectfully.


Be willing to listen to their point of view. It might be hard not to get caught up in your own side of the issue, but pay attention to what they have to say too.
Stay calm when you are disagreeing. Don’t start screaming at your mom that you hate her because she is trying to tell you how to dress. Calmly say, “Mom when you try to tell me how to dress it makes me feel like you don’t trust my judgement.”Know that you don’t always have to be right in arguments. Think about how important what you are arguing about actually is. If it is not a big deal, let them be right sometimes., Your parents are going to be very impressed if you put in the effort to do things with them. If you both love Thai food, make it a weekly date or go bowling together twice a month to bond and improve your relationship. If you suggest doing something together your parents will be very happy that you want to spend time with them.Be the one to suggest doing activities together: “Dad, the new Star Wars movie is out. Do you want to see it with me?” or “Mom, we should get brunch together tomorrow like we used to do when I was little.”

, You may not agree with them but your parents will be impressed if you listen to and respect their rules. If there is something you really don’t agree with calmly discuss a compromise but otherwise listen to them. If you respect their rules they might even start making them less strict.


No matter how tempting it might be don’t sneak out passed your curfew or invite your girlfriend or boyfriend over in the middle of the night, don’t do it. This shows you don’t respect your parents or their rules and they won’t be impressed.

, If you are struggling with something turn to your parents for guidance. This shows them that you respect their knowledge and capabilities. They will be impressed that you are able and willing to ask for help when you need it and flattered that you thought of them for help.


Even though it might be hard to swallow your pride and ask, it is as simple as: “Mom, I am struggling with my history homework can you help me?” or “I want to break up with my boyfriend, but I don’t know how to.”

, No matter how much you might think golf is the most boring sport in the world, if your dad loves golf, ask him about it or even go with him sometimes. Ask your mom how her job is going and about the latest book she is reading. Showing your parents that you care about what they care about shows that you respect them and they will be impressed.

, No matter what their view points or weird quirky behaviors are, love them for who they are. Don’t try to change them. You can’t control somebody else. The only thing you can control is yourself, so if you want better interactions with them change your behavior and hope they reciprocate.Try to get passed some differences that might be due to a generation gap. Try explaining to them the importance of generational things in your life (like why you constantly need to be on Snapchat). If they don't understand still, respect that you come from different backgrounds., It might be tempting to zone out when your parents are going on about something you could care less about, but take the time to listen to what they have to say. If you care about their lives and the things they tell you, they will be impressed.

This especially applies to their careers and personal backgrounds.
This is key to successfully engaging in conversation with them later.;
, Once you know a little about them, the rest is cake. If your friend's mom started a business, plan a way to ask her about it in the context of your own professional goals. Find ways to relate to your friend's dad's sports and hobbies.


This tip will make conversation very easy later. With luck they'll do 3/4 of the talking!
This is also key to making you seem relatable - the more of themselves they see in you, the more likely they are to like what they see!

, This isn't saying to dress like its a job interview, but it is suggesting that you leave your FBI (Female Body Inspector) shirt at home. Be clean and presentable. Don't wear anything suggestive or provocative. If you choose to wear a scent, make sure that it is mild.


Don't overdress, or they'll think that you are putting on a show for them. But definitely don't underdress.
If in doubt, dress slightly up. Wear a button up (that could be unbuttoned) when a polo would have done. Wear a polo when a tee shirt would have been acceptable.

, Proper eye contact is key to establishing a connection and rapport between people.Breaking eye contact or nervously looking away can be seen as having something to hide or lying.


Don't lock eyes for too long though. Maintaining overly long eye contact is usually regarded as being either sexual or confrontational.

, Use ""Sir"", ""Ma'am"", and ""Mr./Mrs. +Lastname"". While they may instruct you to address them by their first name, don't take this for granted. Unless they give you permission you should always address them with proper deference.


Even if they give you permission to use their first name, consider mostly using the standard proper terms.
Correcting yourself by starting to say Sir or Ma'am and then using their first name is a good way to endear yourself to them. ""Sir- excuse me, I mean John..."" etc.

, Shake hands and give hugs when appropriate. Don't be overly touchy with either your friend or their parents, but avoiding contact altogether will make it appear as if you are unsure of yourself and uncomfortable.

, ""Please"", ""Thank you"", and ""I'm well, thanks, how are you?"", go a long way, and are a lost art.Hold doors, excuse yourself, and defer when appropriate. Remove your hat when entering the house, and remove your shoes as well if your hosts do. If you are complimented on your good manners, score even more points by giving credit to your parents or authority figures for raising you properly.


If you are unsure of what to do (for example, whether to remove shoes or not), simply ask! They'll see you as conscientious and thoughtful.

, This seems simple, but really isn't. Sit up, don't slouch. Watch out for crossing your arms, as this can make you appear standoffish or defensive. A proper, inviting posture will ensure that your friend's parents feel like they can connect with you., This is where your homework comes into play. Knowing your friend's parent's backgrounds and interest can be crucial at this point. Ask them about their careers and interests. Try to draw parallels to your own, if possible. You have several objectives when engaging in conversation.


You want to distinguish yourself in a positive way from most other people your age.
You will work to establish common ground with your friend's parents.You'll allow your friend's parents to do most of the talking - they'll like it and it makes your job easier!

, While you should avoid ""humblebragging"" this doesn't mean you shouldn't talk about yourself in a genuine way . Show that you are confident in yourself by being unafraid to talk about your interests, goals, and accomplishments.


Your friend's parents are probably very interested in learning more about you. You are friends with the most important person in the world to them!

, Your friend's parents will be wondering what makes you and your friend close. Don't be afraid to show them (provided that it is positive). Talking about a shared love of sports or music is good. They want to know that the two of you connect in a healthy and meaningful way.

, This is especially true of friends in their childhood and teen years. Parents of children and teens are always worried that their child's friends are going to be a bad influence, but good influences are very valuable.Demonstrate responsibility and an awareness of long term concerns beyond immediate gratification.

, While this is true of all friends, this is especially true of potential romantic partners. Your friend's parent's want to see their child's potential partner as someone who helps and complements their child, bringing out the best in him or her.

, This is the simplest of things, and if you truly are friends it shouldn't be hard at all. Demonstrate that you care about your friend's feelings. Defer to your friend if necessary and give your friend's parents a way to see that you have your friend's best at heart.


Talk about how you met, or what makes your friend stand out.
Bring up the future, and discuss plans that you and your friend are trying to make.

Most of the the time, parents choose to get divorced because they fight with each other, because their feelings about one another have changed, or because of a serious issue in the relationship, like infidelity or substance abuse. There's no reason for you to feel guilty at all!You may be even more likely to blame yourself for the divorce if your parents get you involved in their conflicts or if they seem to hold it against you for caring about the other parent. No matter what they say or do, it is important to remember that you did not initiate these conflicts and that you have the right to love both of your parents.
If your parents ever say something to make you feel like the divorce is your fault, talk to them about it. They may have not really meant what they said at all. Try to keep in mind that this is a stressful time for your parents and they are not perfect.;
, No two kids feel exactly the same way about their parents' divorce. You might be confused, angry, sad, or even glad, if your parents fought a lot. No matter how you are feeling, it's important to validate your emotions. There's no reason to feel guilty about how you are feeling., Don't forget that your friends and family members are there for you during this difficult time. Reach out to people who you are close to for support. You may even know people who have been through a similar situation.If you have siblings, they are going through the same thing that you are going through, so be there for each other.
You may not want to talk to all of your friends about your parents' divorce. Choose one or two close confidants who will understand your situation and be compassionate. Chances are some of your friends have also dealt with a divorce.

, Talking to your parents about the effect that their divorce is having on you can make a big difference. Remember, if they don't know what you think or how you feel, they can't help you cope with those thoughts and emotions.Let them know how you're feeling and what you're worried about.
If you have questions about how the divorce will affect your future, ask! Even if your parents don't know the answer, this will give you the opportunity to have an open conversation about what will happen next.

, Even if you don't have any friends or family members who you can talk to about your parents' divorce, you don't need to deal with your emotions by yourself! There are many resources available to adolescents who need some help getting through this tough stage.You may want to talk to a social worker or psychologist. If you don't know one, ask your doctor for a referral.
Your school may have counselors who are available to talk with you about personal issues.
There are also support groups specifically designed for children and adolescents who are dealing with their parents' divorces. You may be able to find a group at your school or in your local community.

, No matter how you are feeling about your parents' divorce, it's important to confront those emotions instead of trying to bury them. When people suppress their emotions, they often turn to destructive behaviors, like abusing drugs and alcohol or overeating, to help them cope. These kinds of behaviors will only make the situation worse.If you are struggling with self-destructive behavior, it's important to get professional counseling right away. You need to learn healthier ways to deal with your emotions so you will not feel the need to harm yourself.

, Your parents' divorce may have created more stress in your life than you've ever had to deal with before. If so, you may not be well-equipped to handle that stress, so it's important to look for ways to cope. Everyone is different, but most people are able to find enjoyable hobbies that help them get through tough times.Journaling helps many people sort through their feelings and relieve stress.
Physical activities like playing sports or going for walks are excellent for reducing stress.
Other hobbies may also relieve stress simply by getting your mind off of your parents' divorce. Try doing an art project or socializing with friends.

, More than likely, you will end up splitting your time between your two parents after they divorce, whether you spend an equal amount of time with both of them or live primarily with one and visit the other. Talk to your parents about how this will work. They may already have a plan, or they may want your input.You and your parents will need to come up with a schedule that allows you spend time with both parents, but does not interfere too much with your other responsibilities and commitments.
Tell your parents how you really feel about the custody arrangement, especially if something about it isn't working for you. They may be willing to make adjustments to the schedule to help make it easier for you., In some cases, a divorce may mean that you need to move to a new home, maybe even in a new school district. This can seem catastrophic for many young people, but it doesn't have to be the end of the world.Try to look at the situation in a positive way. You can see it as an opportunity to meet new people and try new things.
While you should definitely try to make new friends if you're moving to a new area, you should also keep in touch with your old friends. Even if you don't get to see them every day anymore, you can keep in touch with them over the phone and on social media, and they can offer you a lot of support as you adjust to your new life.
Try not to be angry with your parents for forcing you to move. Instead, work on building your relationship with them. They may be able to offer you a lot of support if you stop shutting them out.

, Divorce often causes financial hardship for both parents. You may find that your parents have to work more or are not able to afford as many luxuries as they were when they were married. While this may be an adjustment for you, try to understand that they are doing everything they can to provide you with the best possible life.Try not to worry too much about your family's finances. If you have specific concerns, such as how your parents will pay for your college education, don't be afraid to bring up the subject with them.

, One of the more challenging adjustments for many children of divorce is learning to deal with their parents' new boyfriends and girlfriends. Some parents start dating shortly after a divorce, while others may wait longer. If your parents have not started dating yet, it may help to prepare yourself for the reality that it might happen. Try to remind yourself that you want both of your parents to be happy, even if that means getting into a relationship with someone besides your other parent.If your parents re-marry, you may find yourself living with a step-parent, and maybe even step-siblings. If this happens to you, do your best to get to know your new family members and form a relationship with them. While it may not always be easy, being welcoming to them and trying to find common interests will make the transition much easier.If you're ever uncomfortable with someone who one of your parents is dating, or if you have questions about how the relationship will affect you, don't be afraid to talk to your parent about it. When doing this, be kind and respectful instead of accusing your parent of trying to hurt you by dating.

, If your parents don't want to see each other, it may be tricky to coordinate events that they used to go to together. Take some time to sit down with your parents and discuss ways that both of them can continue to attend important events.For recurring events, like sports games, you may arrange for your parents to alternate their attendance. This way, both of them will get to see you play and there will always be someone there to cheer you on, but they will never have to be at the game together.
You may have to arrange to do some things twice. For example, it may work out better to have two separate birthday parties with each of your parents instead of trying to have them both come to one party.
In some cases, you parents may have no choice but to attend the same event. For example, if you are graduating from high school, they will probably both want to attend the ceremony. In this case, talk to them ahead of time about being civil to one another and arrange for them to sit separately.

, You will have a much easier time dealing with your parents' divorce if you can remain a neutral party. It's important to remember that your parents' issues are between the two of them, so you do not need to get involved.Try to maintain a relationship with both parents. Even if you live primarily with one parent, make an effort to stay in touch with the other one.
If your parents try to make you choose sides, let them know that you want to maintain a healthy relationship with both of your parents.

, Some divorced parents are not able to interact with each other without fighting. If this is the case for you, your parents may be creating a lot of stress and tension in your life. While there's nothing you can do about how your parents feel about each other, you can ask them to refrain from arguing in front of you, talking negatively about each other to you, or using you as a go-between.Make it very clear that you do not want to be caught in the middle of their arguments.

, In some cases, parents rely on their children for emotional support during difficult times. This may not be a problem, but if you feel burdened by it, it's important to talk to your parent about how you feel. You should not be expected to be the rock if you are having problems dealing with the divorce as well.If a parent depends on you for support more than you are comfortable with, try to think of other people who he or she may be able to confide in. If there are no close friends or family members for the parent to talk to, suggest professional counseling.
Try to keep in mind that the divorce is just as hard for your parents as it is for you. They may need help dealing with their emotions, just like you might.

Alcohol is the most commonly used drug, and the disease of alcoholism is a cause of suffering for millions of families. Even if you're not convinced that your parent's problem is very serious, it is important to be able to spot signs and understand the impact of heavy drinking on a person's life more generally.;
, Being aware of how your parent's drinking affects you can help put things in perspective. For example, some teens who live with alcoholic adults become afraid to speak out or show much emotion because they fear triggering a parent's drinking. Answer the following questions to get a better sense of your involvement:


Do you worry about how your parent drinks?
Do you have money problems because of their drinking?
Do you tell lies to cover up for their drinking?
Do you feel that if the drinker cared about you, he or she would stop drinking?
Are plans frequently upset or canceled because of the drinker?
Do you ""tread lightly"" with your parent to avoid setting off a drinking episode?
Have you been hurt or embarrassed by a drinker’s behavior?
Do you search for hidden alcohol?
Do you feel like a failure because you can’t control the drinking?

, Write in a journal about your feelings toward your parent's excessive drinking. This way you will be more able to talk about you and your feelings instead of them and their wrongdoings when you address the parent. If you have a good grounding in how you are affected by the drinking, you will be less likely to back down if your parent tries to deny your concern.


To imagine how the talk will proceed, you may want to translate these feelings into a letter addressed to your parent. Writing in letter form will help you see what your inclinations are so that you can decide whether or not you are taking the best angle possible.

, The responses that come from being confronted about problem drinking are often predictable. This is because there are only a limited number of ways that to protect oneself from the truth of having a habit that harms others. Seeing in advance where your parent might take the conversation will help you present your worries with more confidence. The following are responses that you might hear:


“It’s just a phase. I’m only drinking more now because I'm upset about ___.”
“Leave me alone, it’s none of your business.”
“My doctor says it’s okay.”
“I’m nervous these days and I need the alcohol to calm me.”
“It doesn’t matter. Nobody cares if I live or die anyway.”
“I just drink because I’m lonely.""

, Often times, sincere promises to cut down or to stop drinking altogether do not pan out. This might happen even if your parent wants to heed your encouragement. It can be incredibly difficult to temper an addictive habit. Protect yourself and make sure you don’t take it personally if your parent cannot ease up as you both intended. This can be a sign that they will need extra help to realize the goal of drinking less.


Don’t expect change to happen overnight or without any emotional turmoil. If you are aware that this could be a process and not just a one-time talk, you need to prepare yourself to support slower improvement than you had hoped for. Support in daily life, even if you think the issue has mostly gone away, can be key to sustaining the change.

, Because alcohol dependency is such a widespread problem, several organizations offer confidential support groups and meetings for people living with alcohol dependents. One organization, Al-Anon is designed to support the family and friends of alcoholics. There is even a group specifically geared toward young people called Alateen that is specifically geared to young people. Alateen is not only for children of alcohol dependent parents, it can also help teens whose parents may already be in recovery. Attending a meeting before addressing your parent can also help give you a better sense of how to approach the situation.

, You don't need to have the perfect speech prepared because the most important thing is that you express your concern with care, gentleness and respect. These general guidelines will help you avoid common pitfalls of confronting a parent about their drinking:


Don’t strike up the conversation while your parent is drinking. If you know he or she typically starts in the evening, make it a point to bring it up earlier in the day.
You might open with something like ""I've thought a lot about something that I'd like to bring to your attention. It is difficult for me to talk about, so please be patient."" This way you are presenting the issue as a mutual struggle rather than an accusation.

, Resist using dramatic gestures like pouring a bottle of liquor into the drain. This will only make it seem like you are being forceful rather than concerned and can end up making your parent exasperated and unreceptive to what you're saying. Instead, focus on the damage that the drinking is causing in the present. Bringing up old memories can quickly spiral into a ""who can remember past events best"" game and causes unnecessary pain to your parent. Be sensitive to how much your parent can handle.


Avoid a confrontational approach. Make sure that you do not preach, moralize, or judge the problem. If your parent denies that they drink too much, do retort by saying something like, ""You may not be drinking much by others' standards, but the amount is still enough to cause disarray in our family that troubles me greatly.""
Also, you'll want to balance the conversation by mentioning positive characteristics that you cherish most about your parent. Contrast these by saying, for instance, ""When you drink, I miss your silly side. You never crack jokes to me when you drink like you used to when I was little.""
Stay away from the words “alcoholic” or “addict” since they carry a heavy stigma. Even if you don't mean it, using these words may make your parent feel so ashamed that they give up on themselves and continue drinking in greater privacy.

, Present only the facts of what you have observed about your parent's behavior, such as, “I’ve noticed that you drink almost a full bottle of wine over dinner” instead of, “You’re drunk all the time!” Keep the emphasis on what you notice and what you are feeling. This way it doesn't matter whether or not the parent has a problem according to some outside standards--they will see that you are concerned and cannot argue about your feelings.


Also, talk about the effect of alcohol or drug use on whatever you parent cares about the most. Think about your parent's age and their current priorities so that you can show how these things (i.e. mobility, memory loss, others' opinions) are being affected.

, You will be tempted to hear their anger and unwillingness and to respond in kind. Do not do this. Make sure your parent knows that you love them no matter what, and that your concern is coming from this love.


For example, you might tell your parent, ""the reason your excessive drinking bothers me in the first place is because of how much I love you.""
If they respond by saying, ""You don't still love me when I drink?"", remind your parent--""I do, but it becomes difficult to embrace or express it when I am upset with our home life...especially when I think a solution is in sight.""

, No matter how your parents tries to justify their drinking, stay centered on what you know to be true: their drinking is affecting you and your relationship. Because of the pain of admitting there is a problem, parents may be unable to see the truth about a situation.Problem drinkers may also try to blame someone else since this is easier than taking responsibility on their own. So, even when facing accusations about your own role in a parents drinking, know that you are not at fault. Another common tactic is for parents to try to minimize the problem by trying to convince you that their drinking habits are normal--within the boundaries of what anyone trying to loosen up would drink.
It is easy to take a parent's word that their drinking is only as heavy as it is temporarily.Avoid joining in by accepting excuses or feeling at fault for their actions. This will only prolong your parent from really feeling the consequences of their behavior.

, To increase the likelihood of really cutting back, agree with your parent on ways that they can monitor their drinking. You might try setting a limit with them--maybe you'll only buy one bottle of liquor for the house per week.Or, come up with a code word that will signal your parent to watch their drinking in specific moments (like when the parent must drive, or is having company over). Make sure the limit is reasonable to you and your parent, and that the code word is memorable.

, Depending on the severity of the problem, it could be very difficult for your parent to drink less alcohol. You may want to suggest that they see a therapist or join a support group for others trying to be more mindful of how much they drink.


A great list of resources for help with drinking can be found here


, It can be very empowering to help a parent effect a major change. But, putting too much pressure on your parent can cause them to feel stunned, guilty, and even angry about the role reversal. If your parent is already getting help or has cut down on their drinking significantly and you are still nervous, it might be a signs that you are too focused on changing their drinking habits. This can create another reason to drink--now they are feeling guilty and emotionally triggered.

, While cutting out an addictive substance, it can be helpful to start up new hobbies or activities that are engaging and fun. As a way of showing your support for the change you hope to see in your parents, suggest an activity that you can do together as a replacement for a night of drinking. You might try a game night, movie night, or even a more hands-on activity, like craft-making or camping.

, Keep in mind that obsessing over whether or not your parent is drinking will just add pressure to the situation. Try to take some time to yourself by focusing on activities away from your parent, knowing that you've done what you can to encourage them.

If a parent tries to drag you into an argument, be honest and say that you don’t want to choose sides. This is your right.;
, Having a place to go will spare you from having to see and hear these intense exchanges. Here are some different options to consider:


Hang out in the backyard if you have one.
Go to your room if it’s private and you can’t hear the fighting.

, If you don't have a safe spot in your own home, go somewhere else. Try a neighbor that you're close to. You can also try another family member or a friend, if they're in walking/bicycling distance, or if you drive.

, If you can’t leave the house, at least keep yourself occupied so you don’t have to witness the fighting. Something with volume you can turn up may be your best option. Use headphones if you have them. Additional things you can do:


Finish homework. Use the opportunity to take care of yourself and your responsibilities.
Read a book, especially if the noise level is low or you can wear headphones.
Play video games. These can be great to take your mind off the argument.

, Even if your parents sometimes argue ‘’about’’ you, avoid thinking that you’re the cause of the dispute. You can’t ‘’make’’ them fight, they choose to do it based on ways of interacting they’ve learned in the past. Nothing you do is enough to force them into having an argument.

, One great way to protect yourself from the stress of parents fighting is to develop your own relationships. Research shows that strong social support is good news for your health.It's even possible to develop positive relationships if your parents haven't been the greatest role models. It may take a little work, but as long as you focus on important aspects like communication and trust-building, you can escape the cycle of harmful relationships:, If your parents are separated or divorced, there are steps you can take to make their fighting easier on yourself, such as:


Ask your parents to consider your feelings. Divorce and separation can really shake up your life. When it comes to who you're spending time with, where you're staying, what school you're going to, and other issues, ask your parents to include you in the discussion.Avoid worrying about the divorce itself that much. The main source of harm for you is parental conflict, regardless of whether your parents are divorced or not.Spend your energy dealing with the conflict.

, Sometimes parents don’t even realize the effect they have on their kids. Be sure to express your feelings to your parents when the argument is over. Avoid bringing it up during the argument, which may only make things worse if they feel guilty. They may also blame the other parent if emotions are high.


Try to be calm while expressing yourself. Avoid egging them on or trying to guilt trip them. Your aim is to help them understand what you’re feeling so they will reconsider their actions. You're not trying to get payback.

, Psychologists have known for years that a secure attachment between parent and child is important for healthy development. Recent research suggests that perceived security between caregivers is also significant. Unresolved conflict between parents can cause anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems.

, Other kinds of fighting hurt everyone involved, damaging relationships and creating feelings of insecurity. Here are the characteristics of different kinds of fighting:


Good: compromise. Good fights end with people agreeing to do something differently in order to make things better. For example, if they think dinner should start at different times, they can compromise by choosing a new time that they can both agree on.
Good: positive statements despite having a difference of opinion. Disagreeing doesn’t have to mean disliking each other or not appreciating things about each other. For example, one of your parents might say, “I’m angry that you forgot to take out the trash, but you normally do a good job helping out around the house.”
Bad: personal insults. For example, name-calling and insulting each other’s ability to be a good parent/partner are harmful ways to handle conflict.
Bad: stonewalling, or refusing to acknowledge the other person. The silent treatment can be just as bad as yelling, because it leaves unresolved tension in the air and teaches poor communication skills., This reasonable request can help spare you from the emotionally damaging impact of your parents' arguments. Your parents fighting in front of you disrupts the stability of your home environment. It also teaches you that it’s okay to engage in “bad fighting” with people as a way of trying to resolve conflict.Tell your parents that it would be less painful for you if they took arguments to their room or another private place.

, Parents who have difficulty expressing their needs without engaging in “bad fighting” can benefit from seeing a professional therapist. Couples counseling can help people address many different issues they may be having, such as:Communication difficulties and not understanding each other.
Practical issues such as finances.
Conflicts about how to raise children.

, There's actually nothing wrong with having a disagreement. Expressing differences of opinion is healthy in a relationship. Bottling emotions up can cause more damage in the long-run than the occasional dispute. Fights only become problems when they happen consistently and the emotions involved are really intense. As long as your parents make up after fights and don't have them too often, you probably don't have anything to worry about.

, It's important to have sources of support other than your parents, who may be too tired or frustrated after a fight to comfort you and explain what's going on. If you're close to an older sibling, approach him or her and ask if you can talk about your parents arguing. Tell your older sibling if you're worried about anything in particular, such as a potential divorce or one of your parents being hurt. If you have a close friend that you trust, you can approach him or her as well. They may not be able to fix the problem for you, but if he or she is a good friend then they will listen and be there for you.

, School counselors are trained to deal with personal problems such as coping with parents fighting.They are at your disposal if you attend a school that has one. You don't have to tell them anything you don't want. You can say that you're dealing with family conflict and need someone to talk to about it. If you're not sure how to get in touch with your school counselor, or if your school even has one, ask one of your teachers.

, It's common to worry about your parents' relationship if you see them having an intense fight. Not all disputes lead to splitting up, though. A lot of the time, fighting has more to do with having a bad day and being frustrated than anything serious. Everyone loses their cool now and then, but it doesn't always mean that something bad is going to happen.If you're worried, you can bring this up with your parents and ask them to reassure you.


Parents may fight over personal habits like cleanliness, financial spending, and other details of daily life. Even if it gets heated, these kinds of disputes are common and can be a healthy way to let off steam.

, It's okay to be angry at your parents for fighting. As their child, you may feel like it's their responsibility to keep you safe and away from harm. If they have intense fights, it's normal to feel unsafe and frustrated. Here are some activities you can do to channel this anger:


Play sports. Anger can actually be useful in something like football or baseball. Use that extra energy to push toward the end zone or hit a home run. Violence doesn't help, though, so don't take it out on the other players.Open up about your frustration. This can be done with any of the people mentioned earlier: parents, siblings, friends, or counselors. Research suggests that commonly recommended techniques like ""punching a pillow"" don't actually work, but exploring your feelings with someone who can help you process them is a more effective kind of venting."

Remove yourself from the situation.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Go for a walk.Physical activity can help you calm down, and this is a good way to get away from the shouting.",How to Deal With Your Parents Shouting at You2," Shouting makes people angry, so revisiting the problem in 20 minutes or even the next morning is sometimes the only way to calm down.If your parents think you are just avoiding them, tell them you need a break.


Say, “Can we please talk about this in a half an hour?”
Ask politely, “Please, can I sit in the other room for a few minutes?”
Tell them, “I really want to talk about this tomorrow.”

, Regain control of yourself by breathing deeply. The best way to do this is to go in a different room away from your parents. Sit in a chair with your back straight, and breath in through your nose for 5 or 6 seconds. Then, hold the breath for one second, and breathe out slowly for 7 seconds. Repeat this 10 times., Be sure to ask your parents for permission—don’t just run out of the house.

Don’t be immature even if you really want to.,
Look your parents in the eye.,
Explain the situation from your point of view.,
Listen to your parents.,
Tell your parents they hurt your feelings when they shout.",How to Deal With Your Parents Shouting at You3," Immature behavior includes mimicking your parents, talking back disrespectfully, or trying to make your parents even more angry. The urge to snap back at your parents while they are shouting can be almost unbearable, but don't do it. This will only make them angrier and make the situation worse. Keep your comments to yourself, and wait for them to stop shouting.

, Face-to-face communication is much more effective than looking off to the side while someone is talking to you. If you look your parents in the eye, you seem much more honest and genuine about whatever you are saying.

, If there is something specific you did wrong, such as fail a class or lie to your parents, now is the time to apologize and explain yourself. Be sincere and honest about what you did wrong and how you will improve in the future.


Don’t make excuses for something you did.
Taking responsibility for your actions is a very adult thing to do.
Admitting you are wrong can sometimes get your parents to stop shouting; they will appreciate the honesty.

, Chances are, if your parents are shouting, they’re really emotional and upset about something. Once you’ve explained yourself, listen to your parent’s side of the story. They are most likely very concerned about something, and listening will help you understand them.

, When things settle down, tell your parents you feel hurt when they shout at you. They might not know this, and they might not even notice they’re shouting.


Say, “I feel hurt when you shout at me.”

Figure out what is causing your parents to shout.,
Change your behavior.,
Compromise with your parents.",How to Deal With Your Parents Shouting at You4," Often, you will already know why your parent is shouting at you. If you didn’t clean your room, acted in a disrespectful way, or did something wrong, identify the behavior. Sometimes, you genuinely won’t know why your parents are shouting, so try asking.


Say, “Can you tell me why you are shouting?”
Ask, “What did I do wrong?”
Get advice: “How can I change my behavior?”

, Once you figure out why your parents are shouting at you, before shouting is necessary, change your behavior so your parents approve of it. This is the safest tactic and the most beneficial in the long run. Most parents will appreciate you trying to act differently.


For example, if your parents shout when you don’t do your homework, do your homework every day.
Clean your room if they are shouting about you being messy.
If your parents say you have an attitude, try to be more respectful.

, If your parents shout about something you really do not want to change, just compromise with them. They might shout about the way you dress, the color you want to paint your bedroom, or even the food you eat.Compromising a little bit can go a long way.


Tell your parents something is important to you: “I really want to paint my walls red because I think the color is beautiful.”
Offer a compromise: “Ok, what if I eat healthy for two meals a day instead of only one?”
Ask them to meet you in the middle: “I really don’t want to wear baggy jeans. Can’t I wear tight jeans some of the time?”

Reconcile and forgive your parent.,
Give your parent the opportunity to grieve.,
Ask their opinion on matters rather than choosing for them.,
Allow them to do as much for themselves as possible.,
Present ways your parent can give to or help others.",How to Improve Your Relationship with an Ailing Parent1," If you have been estranged from your parent for a while, then you may need to reconcile with them first. This will involve getting in touch with your parent and taking small steps to rebuild your communication.


You may start by just calling your parent to talk for a few minutes. Then, you might follow up by calling a few days later or by arranging to meet the parent for lunch or coffee.
Go slowly to rebuild communication and trust between you and your parent.;
, Coping with a terminal illness or physical decline can be a dramatic change from one’s previous life. As a child, you may want to immediately jump into action, deciding left and right what’s most appropriate for your parent’s care. Take time first to address the emotional upheaval that your parent (and, potentially, their spouse) is experiencing.Offer to listen to your parent’s concerns. Acknowledge the loss by saying “Dad, I can only imagine how hard this must be for you.” Don’t try to fix the situation. Simply be there.

, Don’t assume you know what’s best, or make choices for your parent. If Mom or Dad is capable of considering medical options, then allow them to do so. It’s their health and well-being on the line. And, while you may feel you have the answers, it’s technically up to your parent what they decide in terms of treatment or end-of-life choices.Be present with your parent during discussions with their health care providers. That way, you can clarify an understanding on both sides to make sure your parent understands the process and that the doctor understands your parent’s desires. You may also want to offer to help your parent find a counselor, a support group, or to ask their religious leader to visit.
Try to describe medical diagnoses and treatments on the level of your parent’s cognitive abilities. Say, “Mom, the doctors are saying that the only option for treating your cancer is chemotherapy. This involves taking radiation that tries to kill the cancer cells in your body. Do you want to learn more about this?”

, Don’t close off your parent’s choice to maintain some autonomy and dignity in their life.Even with a chronic or terminal illness, there will be some activities that your parent can do on their own. Give them the freedom to do what they physically can. This sends the message that you consider your parent to be capable and helps them maintain their identity.


For instance, if your mom was always fond of knitting, make sure she has her kit at the retirement home or in the hospital. That way, she can participate in her favorite hobby as much as she’d like to and is physically capable.
Other ways to inspire continued autonomy might be allowing your parent to do tasks on their own, but with supervision. Dressing, cooking, and cleaning—all of these chores may be done with slight modifications. You can stay in the room to assist as needed.

, Constantly requiring help from others can be a major hurdle for sick and aging parents. It’s difficult and upsetting to acknowledge that Mom or Dad can’t do all they once did. And, they may experience denial about this reality.


To help your parent feel worthy—and strengthen your connection to them—give them a chance to help out whenever possible. This enables your parent to sustain a sense of well-being and usefulness. So, ask your parent to watch one of the grandchildren for an hour. Suggest that they volunteer at a local community center a few days per week. Or, if your parent is financially well-off, encourage them to select a charity to which they can contribute."

Understand how technology has changed our expectations.,
Look for extenuating circumstances.,
Know that some people simply communicate more.",How to Deal With Your Nosy Parents1," Communication is easier than ever with the onslaught of cell phones and social media outlets. While this is not necessarily a bad things, as people are becoming increasingly social and more connected, it has changed the way we communicate and what information we expect to know about others.Communication used to be confined to certain times and places, but with social media and cell phones we can stay in touch with loved ones wherever and whenever we want. We've come to expect an onslaught of information immediately.Social media fuels nosiness in that it invites certain questions. Posting online about your job, travel plans, interpersonal relationships, and your own emotional state fuels curiosity. If your parents are already nosy, consider either blocking them on social media or using filtered settings to limit what information they can see.;
, Is there a reason your parents are particularly nosy about you and your behavior? Are they equally invested in your siblings and other relatives? If not, there might be a reason they're focusing their attention on you.


You might not be communicating effectively. Oftentimes, people think they're being as open and honest as ever but due to communication barriers they are not fully aware of they've recently changed how they communicate. Has there been a sudden change in your situation? Are you busier than you used to be? More stressed? Dealing with more information than usual? If there's been any change to your situation, you might be putting up communication barriers that are making your parents push for more information.
Has there been a major life change recently? New babies, marriages, divorces, and moving from place to place triggers parental nosiness. While your parents might think they're being helpful with their constant questions, it may read as nosy to you.

, Your parents might not think of themselves as nosy. Many people simply have a greater need for communication and are more open about their own lives, emotions, and needs and expect the same in return.


Some people are compulsive communicators. This means they talk and ask questions because they don't know any other way to interact, and quiet time makes them nervous.People with anxiety issues often talk more without realizing it. If your parents are the nervous type, this might be a habit they picked up over time to deal with excess stress. Knowing exactly what's going on and nitpicking for information provides temporary relief from anxiety inducing thoughts.Extroverts communicate in a different way. While it's a myth that extroverts are bad listeners or that they talk too much, if your parents are far on the extrovert side of the scale they're more likely to try and draw out information by asking leading questions. They're not trying to be rude or nosy. This is simply how they process information."

Your mother stores or uses chemicals or equipment for preparing drugs around you
Your mother sells or gives drugs or alcohol to you or another child
Your mother gets high and is unable to care for you
Your mother has you around people who sell drugs;
, Unfortunately, there's not anything you can do to stop your mother from using drugs, and that is not your responsibility anyway. Your mother is an adult and is the only one who can make choices for herself. But, you can talk with an adult who may be able to intervene on your behalf. Think of someone you trust and feel comfortable talking to--it can be a coach, the school counselor, a religious leader, an aunt/uncle, or a grandparent.This person may be able to break through to your mother and explain how her behavior is affecting you. This person may also be able to offer you temporary care and support during this confusing time.

, An intervention is a face-to-face meeting facilitated by a professional mental health provider that allows family members and friends to share their feelings about the addiction. Your mother may not realize how negatively her drug use is affecting everyone. Staging an intervention may help your mom recognize that she needs help and that she has the support of those who love her.To stage an intervention, ask a trusted adult to help you contact a psychologist, addictions counselor, social worker, interventionist, or psychiatrist to coordinate the meeting.
Any family members and close friends may be allowed to attend. The group will determine a possible course of action to help your mother get help. You all might look up treatment facilities and generally learn more about addiction in order to understand what your mother is going through.

, If you find yourself in a situation where your mother needs immediate help or support, call the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Helpline and Treatment Hotline at 1-800-234-0246. Or, call 911 or your local emergency department.

Addiction is a disease. Even your mother, on her own, cannot stop the vicious cycle of drug addiction. She needs professional help to get better.
Blaming yourself isn't healthy or helpful. Instead, take the time to do self-care and nurture yourself. What you are going through can be devastating, but taking care of yourself can help you better care for her.

, More than 30 million Americans are fighting drug and alcohol addictions.This means that there are millions of teens or young adults like you who may have a mother with a drug problem. You are not alone. There are many resources to help you get through this.

Exercise
Get a hobby

Volunteer in your local community
Turn to your spiritual or religious faith
Turn to new role models, such as teachers, coaches, or group leaders
Join the D.A.R.E. (Drug and Alcohol Resistance Education) group at your school

, Dealing with your mother's drug use on your own may cause you to deal with your emotions in some unhealthy ways. Instead of trying to deal with your feelings on your own, share your thoughts and feelings with people you trust. Don't bottle up your feelings.


Feeling shame or embarrassment about your mother's addiction is a common response that keeps many adolescents from speaking up.Carefully screen your friends to decide who will be less judgmental and most supportive of you. You may start the conversation by saying something like ""So, the other day, I found drugs in my mom's room. I don't know what to do...""
Prepare yourself for the consequences if you talk to an adult at your school. Teacher or school counselors will not be able to keep it a secret. They are generally required to report such information to the local authorities in order to protect you.

, People who are hooked on drugs may try to hide their behaviors or minimize the drugs' effects on them. You can identify whether your mother has a serious problem that demands professional attention by looking at these physical signs:Changes in eating patterns (a lot more or a lot less)
Weight loss or gain
Bloodshot eyes with pupils bigger or smaller than normal
Decline in physical appearance (e.g. not combing hair, not bathing regularly, or changing clothes)
Strange smells on breath, body or clothing
Shaky hands
Poor coordination or balance
Slurred speech

, Your mom's behavior may also be drastically different than it was before. You may notice your mom:No longer going to school or work
Asking for money from you or other family members
Hanging with different friends and at different houses or locations
Getting into trouble with the police, neighbors, or landlord
Acting suspiciously (e.g. hiding things, keeping her door locked, or sneaking out)

Acting tired or sad
Seeming like they have a different personality
Being afraid or paranoid without reason
Acting hyper or giddy

A drug addict can become dangerous and completely unreasonable. She may get extremely angry or even be physically violent if you destroy her drugs. Plus, she will become desperate and go to any lengths to obtain new drugs.If you want, you can wait until another trusted adult is in the house and tell this person about what you saw. Let an adult take the responsibility for dealing with any drug paraphernalia. Doing so yourself could put you in danger.

Prepare yourself for the process of unburdening.As the family draws together to support a dying parent, unresolved conflicts may arise.,
Practice active listening.,
Offer validation.,
Have a discussion about their end-of-life wishes.",How to Improve Your Relationship with an Ailing Parent2," In fact, your parent may choose to undergo a process of unburdening to cope with grief and relieve feelings of guilt. Your parent may find emotional and spiritual relief by discussing their regrets and fears.


Anticipate this possibility, and be ready to listen. Withhold your reactions or judgments regarding any confessions or surprising revelations that come to light during this time. The process of unburdening is a form of closure for your parent—don’t take it personally. It’s about them, not you.

, The best thing you can do for your parent as he or she considers the imminence of death is to be an active and willing listener. Refrain from trying to fix or resolve issues for your parent. Minimize your own comments and simply allow them to unload whatever emotions, thoughts, or memories they may be experiencing onto you.


Active listening is listening to understand, rather than listening to reply. Be an active listener by turning to face your parent, keeping your body language open and inviting (e.g. arms and legs uncrossed and at your sides), and offering encouragers such as nods or prompts like “Oh?”Active listening also includes summarizing (e.g. “It sounds like you’re saying…”), reflecting (e.g. “It seems like this is a really important matter to you.”) and using silence to slow down the interaction.

, Validation is a terrific way to improve your communication and build a better relationship with your ailing parent. Validation merely tells the other person that you accept what they are saying. It does not imply agreement or approval.Using this technique will come in handy during the process of unburdening because it is unlikely that you will agree with or feel comfortable with everything you discuss with your parent. But, doing this allows you to show support for their point-of-view.
Let’s say your mother confesses that she never wanted children. She wanted to be a painter and travel the world, but she got pregnant by accident. You can validate this confession by saying “I can tell this must have been hard to tell me. You must feel some level of regret or loss about the life you could have had. I can see why you might have felt this way, but I am glad you chose to have me.”

, Before your parent becomes too ill, sit down with them and your siblings to have a discussion about their personal wishes regarding their healthcare and legacy. This helps ensure that their wishes are followed at critical moments, and also puts all the siblings and other family members on the same page.


Call a family meeting and start by saying “I think it’s important for us to talk about your wishes…If you were on a respirator would you want to be left alive? Do you want to donate organs? Do you have a living will? Do you have a burial plan? Let’s talk about this so we don’t have to fight about it later.”"

Remember their healthier days.,
Spend quality time with your parent doing activities you enjoy.Perhaps there is not much that you can do about your parent’s deteriorating health, but you can present the gift of quality time.,
Manage your stress in a healthy way.,
Get professional help when you need it.",How to Improve Your Relationship with an Ailing Parent3," Keep in mind that although your parent is sick, they are still the same person they once were. They have the same needs and passions. Although a terminal or chronic illness may change the dynamic of the parent-child relationship, you can still preserve that memory by accommodating the person your parent used to be.If your dad was a huge history buff, plan a trip to a Civil War reenactment. Or, purchase him a subscription to a historical magazine. Helping him past the time with his usual passions will help him maintain a connection to the younger, healthier version of himself.

, Depending on your parent’s physical abilities, you can improve your relationship by helping them get back in touch with hobbies they once enjoyed but discarded. Or, you can just show up and spend time with them talking or reminiscing.


Look through old photo album. Bake cookies for the neighbors. Take photos. Get manicures and pedicures. Read a book or watch a movie. Allow your parent to teach you their painting or weaving skills. Just be with your parent and appreciate the time you have.

, Being a caregiver to an ailing parent is challenging. It’s important for you to schedule in regular self-care to combat the frustration and fatigue that comes with watching a parent deteriorate. Taking care of your own health and well-being will put you in a better mood so that you can strengthen the bond you share with your parent.Eat well-balanced meals throughout the day. Get regular exercise. Sleep 7 to 9 hours each night. Start a gratitude journal. Join a support group. Take relaxing bubble baths. Call a friend to vent or take your mind off things. Ask a sibling to stand in for you while you take yourself out to lunch or to a movie.
Avoid unhealthy methods of coping such as using drugs or alcohol, emotional eating, gambling, or excessive shopping.

, Asking for help goes beyond splitting the caregiving responsibilities with your siblings or other relatives. You need to have self-awareness and recognize when you need a break or respite from this stressful situation.Getting professional help may involve hiring a trained caregiver such as a sitter or nursing assistant to be with your parent a few hours each day.
Getting professional help may also involve consulting with a mental health therapist to discuss your own emotional experience. It may be very upsetting or confusing to witness your parent’s physical and/or mental decline. Talking to a professional can help you sort out your feelings and develop productive ways of coping.

Tell the truth, but omit uncomfortable details.,
Deflect questions.,
Understand the power of ""because."",
Accept their nosiness.",How to Deal With Your Nosy Parents2," Oftentimes, to deflect nosy questions our default is to lie or skew information to try and reduce the listening party's interest. For example, you and your significant other decide to ""take a break"" or ""open things up"" and you don't want to explain this relationship gray area to your folks, so you simply say the two of you broke up to deflect incessant questions. Lying like this is not a good strategy. It's better to be honest while omitting any information you're not comfortable sharing.


Once you lie, you create a situation where you have to keep track of false information. It's usually not sustainable longterm, as we forget the details of fabricated stories. If you get caught in a lie, this will only fuel your parents nosy nature as they now think you're hiding something.If your parents question you about a subject you'd rather not talk about, be honest without giving out any information you're not comfortable sharing. This way, your parents will feel you're keeping them informed on your life and you'll get the benefit of privacy. In the hypothetical scenario involving your significant other, for example, you could say something like, ""Yes, we're still seeing each other but things are simmering down a bit.""

, A great way to subtly avoid your parents nosiness is to deflect the questions. This can effectively communicate you're uncomfortable without openly stating as much, which can cause undue confrontation in certain situations.


Try to change the subject. Gloss over an unwanted question by giving a non-committal answer and bring up another subject quickly. Many nosy people are nosy because they have no filters themselves, and will gladly share information about their own lives with ease. If this is the case with your folks, they will likely be glad to take the opportunity to discuss their own lives.Use humor to deflate the situation. If your parents are asking you for information you're not comfortable giving out, some light humor can distract them from their line of interrogation. If they ask, for example, ""How much are you making at that new job?"" try something like, ""Half of what I'm worth.""At social gatherings, like events surrounding the holidays, use excuses to get away from unwanted nosiness. Excuse yourself to use the restroom, get more food, or grab another drink., The word ""because"" is powerful in that it often serves as a deflection in and of itself. Social experiments have shown when someone uses ""because"" in a sentence, listeners are less likely to pry even when what follows because is vague.


In one study, a young woman at a crowded public library asked people ahead of her in line if she could cut in front of them. While 60% of participants let her cut with no explanation, 90% let her go when she said ""Could I cut ahead in line because..."" and then followed with an explanation. This percentage remained the same whether the circumstances were specific (""Because I have class in 10 minutes and I need to copy some flyers for my presentation"") or vague (""Because I need to make copies."").Use ""because"" when talking to your parents. If you don't want to offer excess information, a simple ""because"" followed by a vague declaration may actually deter them from pressing for information. For example, ""I'm going out tonight because I'm hanging out with a friend"" or ""I quit my job because I was unhappy there.""

, Some people are simply nosy. If this is the case for your parents accepting that fact is important. It might not lead to less prying on their end, but if you accept the situation for what it is without expecting things to change you will at least feel less stress.


What exactly make their questions nosy? Ask yourself this and try to empathize with your parents. Do you live far away? Do they not know the people in your life well, such as co-workers, significant others, and friends? If so, their nosiness might be rooted in an insecurity over losing touch with you as you grow. Try to be understanding of their situation. This will make you more empathetic of their needs and wants and, therefore, less irritated by their questions.
How much do your parents share with you? Nosy people, as stated, are often more open about their own lives and don't understand why certain questions cause discomfort. If your parents are chronic over-sharers, they might not see their questions as nosy at all."
"
Be honest with your parents about why their questions bother you.,
Remind your parents that you are okay.,
Set specific boundaries.",How to Deal With Your Nosy Parents3," Oftentimes, people do not realize they're prying. Being open about how you feel can help lessen the onslaught of questions.


Schedule a time to talk so you're prepared to communicate your needs effectively. If you're nervous, write up a list of issues you want to discuss with your folks.
Try to stay emotionless while making a plan to confront your parents. A lot of the time, if we're nervous we let our emotions take over resulting in making excuses to avoid the situation. Be diplomatic in your approach.Start with love. That is, do not go in blaming your parents or open up with a laundry list of everything they've done wrong. Start off with something like, ""I know you guys love and miss me a lot, and I really miss you two, and I appreciate you wanting to know what's going on in my life."" From there, you can explain why their questions bother you.
Explain why. As we've stated, nosy people often fail to understand other people's boundaries. Tell your parents why discussing certain subjects with them causes you discomfort so they can empathize with your situation as well.

, Nosiness if often rooted in worry or concern. Reminding your parents that you are doing okay can deflect prying before it begins.


Tell your parents you will sometimes make mistakes, but that's okay. Remind them that sometimes messing up provides valuable learning opportunities. This will let them know they do not need to know every detail of your life, as errors in judgment are inevitable part of growing up.When you do talk, bring up the positives in your life. Even if it's just a small detail, like having read a great article online or gone for a nice walk after work, if you sound happy and healthy on the phone you're parents will be less likely to worry something's wrong.
Let them know you have a support system. Sometimes, life is difficult and if your parents know you're going through a break up or you just lost your job their nosiness will be heightened. If you're not doing stellar at the moment, bring up friends and loved ones to your parents and tell them how they're helping you cope. Anything that makes your parents feel more secure in your well-being can deflect nosiness.

, Your parents need to know what subjects are absolutely off-limits and if deflecting and avoiding the questions aren't working, it's time to be upfront.


When the opportunity arises to state your boundaries, take it. If your dad is grilling you on the date you had last Friday, say something like, ""I appreciate your interest, Dad, but I'm not really comfortable discussing my love life with you.""
State your case in a way that doesn't make your parents feel left out. Let them know if any major changes occur in your life, they'll be the first to know, but that many day-to-day details are off-limits for nit-picky discussion. For example, in the above scenario, try following up with something like, ""But, don't worry. If it gets serious, I'll tell you all about her.""

Manage the situation.,
Remove yourself from the situation.,
Help the situation.,
Talk to them about it.",How to Deal with Stressed and Overly Emotional Parents1," If your parents are being overly emotional or stressed, it is generally easier to manage the situation instead of engage in it. If you need to get something specific from them or talk to them about something specific, try to be direct with your questions or within your discussion. If you avoid responding in an emotional way, your parents may be more likely to respond in a similar fashion. Even if they don't, you will be less likely to gain stress from the interaction if you just attempt to manage them instead of engaging in their emotional, stressed behavior.


For example, if your parents are raising their voices at you, don't raise yours back. Calmly try to continue the conversation without making it worse.;
, If your parents are too stressed and you can't handle it, remove yourself from the conversation or situation, if possible. If your parents are stressing you out, go to your room or another room of the house. Don't do it in a disrespectful way, but try to remove yourself from the situation so you don't make it worse or become stressed yourself because of their overly emotional behavior.


If you are in a situation where you can't get away from them, try to remove yourself from the conversation. This can be done by telling them that you don't want to talk, respectfully telling them that you are removing yourself from the conversation, or simply ignoring any stressed or emotional behavior they exhibit in your presence., If you see what is causing the stress or emotional behavior in your parents lives, try to help with it if you can. There may be some situations where you can't help, such as personal issues with their relationship or their relationships with others, or in some cases money troubles, but there are other situations where you can help. Even removing just a little of the pressure can help deescalate the situation to where your parents may calm down.


For example, if you see that a messy house is making your parents stress out, try picking up around the house or washing the dishes. Or if you are old enough to get a job, find a job and start buying some of your own things or giving your parents a little bit of money to help with things., If your parents are too stressed and emotional for your to deal with, talk to them about it. Have concrete examples of how they have acted that has stressed you out or been too emotional. Don't blame or accuse them of horrible behavior, just explain to them that they have been overly emotional and stressed lately and that it is interfering with your life. Most parents may not even see how they have been acting or know how it is effecting you.


Make sure you do this calmly. Even if your parents fight back with harsh words or can't see what they've been doing, make sure you stay calm. You can only do so much in these situations. Once you've told them, it is up to them to change it. If it still doesn't change over time, try having the conversation again with additional examples of their actions."

Make the first move.,
Redirect the fear.,
Make choices.,
Forgive.",How to Deal With Your Mother1," You may feel justified in expecting your mother to reach out to you, but don’t be afraid to initiate contact. Your mother may want to reach out to you but not know how, or she may share similar feelings of fearing rejection. If you keep waiting for her to make the first move, don’t be surprised if your relationship remains stuck.Before you decide to reach out, decide what you want to discuss first, and how you want to discuss it. Come in with a mindset of problem-solving, not accusation.;
, Instead of internalizing anger and fear, realize that you don’t of have react. Ask yourself, “What can I do to de-escalate this situation?” It’s not your responsibility to manage her emotions, nor is it your job to make her anger or frustration your problem.Acknowledge her emotions without taking them on by simply saying, “I can tell that you are upset.”

, If your mother tries to corner you into making decisions or make you feel like you don’t have a choice, call the bluff.Remember that you always have choices, regardless of how powerless someone makes you feel. When you reach your point of no return, be firm on not giving in.


Verbalize to your mother that you do have choices, and they are up to you to make. Thank her for her perspective, but feel free to make your own choice.

, Don’t hold onto resentment. Forgiveness doesn’t mean excusing her behavior, pretending a situation didn’t happen, or letting her ’off the hook’.Forgiveness allows you to free yourself from holding on to any resentment or negative feelings toward your mother. And the sooner you are able to forgive, the faster you can begin repairing the damage.

Pick a safe time and space.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Communicate your needs and wants.,
Do not minimize your parents' perspectives.",How to Deal With Overprotective Parents1," The first step to addressing overprotective parents is to have a frank conversation about your concerns. To assure the talk goes as smooth as possible, pick a safe time and space to talk.


Choose a location where both you and your parents feel comfortable. If you live at home, the living room or kitchen table might work. If you've already moved out, choose a neutral location like a quiet coffee shop so no one has the home team advantage.Eliminate distractions. Turn off the TV. Put away your phone. Do not choose a location that is noisy, like a bar or restaurant. In order to have an effective conversation, distractions should be minimal.Pick a time where there aren't externally enforced restraints. Do not choose right before work or bedtime, for example. Select a timeframe where there's plenty of time to talk so all parties involved feel like they're saying their piece. In the early evening, just after dinner, might be a good time.;
, It's important to avoid blame when having a difficult discussion. Try to use ""I"" statements. That is, begin your sentences with the words ""I feel"" first. This way, you're focusing on your own feelings and emotions rather than passing an objective judgment about the situation.


When communicating your feelings about the situation, make it apparent you're discussing your own perspective and not enforcing an objective assessment of the situation. For example, do not say, ""It's really overbearing when you guys check up on me every five minutes when I'm out with my friends."" This will make your parents feel like you're ignoring their side and making assumptions about their actions.
Instead, say something like, ""I feel stressed out when you guys call and text a lot when I'm out. I feel like you don't trust me when you do things like that."", Remember, you cannot expect your parents to read your mind. When having a difficult conversation, it's important to be as transparent as possible about your wants and needs.


Ideally, what would you like to come out of this conversation? Do you want your parents to, say, minimize how much they call when you go out? Ask fewer questions about your academic performance or career plans? How can your parents effectively back down? Think about what you want before beginning the conversation. Have some concrete goals and needs to express to your parents.Express your goals in a way that is firm but non-judgmental and respectful. For example, say something like, ""I would really like it if you could give me some space when I'm out with my friends. I don't mind following a curfew, but I would appreciate not having to answer texts and phone calls every half hour.""Express appreciation for your parents. The good news about over-protective parents is that they simply want to love and protect you, and they can learn to express their caring in a more productive way. Let your parents know you appreciate that they love you and want the best for you.

, While it can be very frustrating to deal with overprotective parents, you cannot minimize your parents' point of view. If you're trying to have an honest, effective conversation, consider their perspective.


Feelings, especially feelings provoked by anxiety, are subjective. While you may think it's unnecessary that your parents worry about a small cold turning into pneumonia, allow them to express this feeling without judgment. Acknowledge that you understand they worry about you as their child.The key to understanding your parents is to identify why they feel the way they do. Try to understand the issues driving their overprotective nature. If they worry about your health, for example, did one or both of your parents lose a family member or friend to unexpected illness? Your parents likely have a very good reason for their fear, possibly based on their own experiences. While it's important not to let your parents fear dictate your life, understanding the root of a fear can help you better address it in the future.For example, in Finding Nemo, the dad Marlin lost his entire family, his dear wife and all his children — all except one little egg. As a result, Marlin is extremely overprotective of his only son, Nemo. Marlin's traumatic past gives him an overwhelming fear of something bad happening to Nemo, so to be overprotective makes complete sense to him, even though it is ultimately not good for his son's development.

Take some time apart.,
Examine your role in the fight.,
Try to see things from her perspective.,
Envision a role reversal.,
Go to her and apologize.,
Tell her that you have tried to see things her way.,
Try to make her feel respected.Talking back, having an attitude, or refusing to listen can come off as disrespectful to your mom.,
Communicate your own feelings in a respectful way.,
Discover a common interest.",How to Deal With Your Mom After a Fight," Let your mother settle down, and give yourself time to think everything over. Get out of the house if you can, giving both of you the space you need to cool down. Spend time with friends or go for a walk to clear your head. If you are grounded and not allowed to leave home, try other methods to calm down, such as listening to music or talking to a close friend on the phone.;
, Chances are, if you and your mom had a disagreement, you may have said some ugly things to her. Can you see aspects of the fight that were your fault? Did you break a rule? Say a curse word? Get bad grades in school? Or, are you upset with her because she won't give you permission to do something?Think about your role in the fight and try to identify at least three things you know you did wrong. This will help you to build a genuine apology for her later.
Sometimes fights happen when we are in a bad mood, tired, or hungry. Were any of these conditions relevant in your case? Did you fly off the handle with your mom simply because you have a bad day at school?

, Now that you have a better understanding of the fight and what may have gone wrong, try to view it from your mom's perspective. Was she tired from coming in after work? Is she sick or not feeling well? Did you blindside her with an accusation or offensive statement when she was preoccupied?


For years, counselors have used a strategy to help people identify when they need self-care and avoid any heated discussions or decision-making. The acronym is HALT and it stands for hungry, angry, lonely, and tired. Taking a good measure of your own and your mother's mood state in the future can prevent unnecessary disagreements., Oftentimes, teenagers and young adults may not understand their parents' train of thinking on certain decisions. The parents say ""no"" and that's all you hear. You don't see the underlying rationale for the decision. To help you better understand your mother's actions, imagine yourself in her shoes talking to your own child.How would you have reacted in a similar fight with your child? Would you have said ""yes"" or ""no""? Would you have tolerated your back talk or snide comments? Would you have listened to a counterargument when your child's safety was in question?
Thinking about parenting from this point-of-view will help you to develop greater empathy for your mom, and also give you some insight into her decisions.

, After both you and your mom have gotten some distance from the fight, seek her out to apologize. By now, you should have a new level of appreciation for her position as your parent. Go to your mom and ask if now is a good time to talk (being mindful of the HALT states).


If she welcomes you to talk, start by saying you're sorry. Use one or two of those behaviors you identified as wrong to verbalize your apology. It might sound like this, ""I am sorry I waited until the last minute to tell you about the money I needed for school.""
Next, include a remedy to the issue. The remedy might sound like, ""I will try to give you advanced notice in the future when I need money for school things.""

, Express to your mom that, after some deep thinking, you realized that you were inconsiderate or inappropriate during the fight. Give her a few points about the things you noted about your own behavior that were not helpful to the argument.Your mom will probably be astounded that you took the time to consider her perspective. She may even view you as more mature.

, Even if you don't think you did any of these things, your mom may have felt slightly disrespected after the argument. Do a few things to acknowledge your respect for her. Show respect by doing the following:


Try to listen and pay attention when she speaks.
Stop texting on your phone when she is talking.
Acknowledge all the things she does for you.
Share things with her that are happening in your life.
Ask her opinion about important topics.
Refrain from interrupting when she's talking.
Do chores/tasks without her having to ask.
Refer to her by the name she prefers (i.e. Mom or Mother).
Avoid the use of curse words or confusing slang phrases in her presence.

, Chances are, the fight may have left you feeling unheard. After you have listened to your mother and shown her that you can see things from her perspective, try to help her understand yours. Use ""I"" statements to take ownership for your feelings while minimizing the chances that your mom will get offended. Then, state your needs to your mom without putting down her position or beliefs.


Consider that you and your mom were fighting about how often you've been going over your friend's house. You can say ""I have been spending time with Whitney because she's really upset over her parents' divorce. I understand your concern. It would be great if you could work with me so I could be supportive of my friend and still get homework and chores done here."", You might wonder what this has to do with getting over a fight with your mom. Well, finding an activity that you two share can help you to forge a closer bond with her and enhance the way you communicate with her. Spending time with your mom in a relaxed state, such as while watching a movie, going for a run, or gardening, may help you to see her as a person with many facets, just like you. As a result, you may earn a greater sense of respect and love for your mom."

Consider whether it really is favoritism by looking at all sides of the issue.,
Make a list with examples of how they show it and how it makes you feel.,
Approach your parents when both of you are in good, calm moods.,

End the discussion if the tone becomes angry.,
Don't blame yourself or your siblings.,
Work for yourself, not your parents.,
Begin a private journal to vent in.,
Become more independent.",How to Deal With Parents That Show Favouritism," Your parents may relate differently to your sibling, and and act differently around them, but not favor them. They may not realize that they make you feel as though they favor your sibling.;
, This can be a mental list or a real list, which you will use later to speak to your parents. Try to come up with specific examples to back up what you're saying.

, Ask if you can speak with them about something important, and make sure your tone is non-accusatory.

, Remember not to get angry, or use the examples as accusations. Once you get angry, they may clam up and stop listening. You want this to be a discussion where you both can share your sides of the story, not an argument about what they're doing wrong.

, Some parents don't want to listen, and will become angry if you explain that you feel they are playing favorites. If they don't listen and get angry, or if you feel yourself angry, prevent the discussion from becoming an argument.

, Jealousy can make it hard to avoid blaming your siblings, and anger can make it had for you to avoid blaming yourself. However, blame does not fix this problem, and tends to make you focus too much on anger you may feel.

, Avoid seeking their approval for everything, and have pride in yourself. This will help you see that not being the ""favorite"" does not mean you are not as good.

, Sometimes, the anger will get to you, and you will need to vent. Don't worry, just get your feelings out so you can allow yourself to move on from them.

, It can be tough to deal with parents that shower your sibling in gifts and money, yet give you a hard time when you ask for something. If you're old enough, look for a job to earn things for yourself. Spend more time outside of your home in a more accepting and supportive environment.

Support the parents.,
Pay attention to the parents.,
Take notes.,
Make reflective statements.,
Let them know you are here to help.,
Legitimize the parent's worries and concerns.,
Comfort the parents.",How to Deal with Stressed and Overly Emotional Parents2," Parents today have a lot to stress about. Raising children while juggling all the other demands of life in today’s economy and culture can most certainly take its toll. Parents can get overwhelmed and, as a caretaker of their child, you provide assistance to them and their stress as well. Youth work is all about teamwork, and helping support parents essentially is helping support their child. It can be very helpful for parents to have someone they trust and who has real knowledge about their child just listen to them talk.


Sometimes the best thing you can do to help stressed out parents is to provide a safe space for them to get their emotions off their chest and to give them the support they need., There some methods you can employ, other than simple support, that will help you actively listen to parents when they talk to you. Whether you are on the phone or in person, plant your feet firmly on the ground and remain present. Keep your breathing calm and focused, lean in to the conversation, and truly be there for the parent. Stay as grounded as possible in your interactions with them so you can stay as focused as possible on their conversation.


In order to create a safe space, you have to be safe person who is paying attention and taking their concerns seriously. Be present for them. The parents will notice if you are really engaged in what they are saying. If you are really engaged, then you can handle their need to purge their emotions and stresses. , Another active listening technique is to take notes. If you are not on the phone, ask the parent if they mind if you take notes. Explain that you just want to make sure you are fully absorbing what they are saying so that you can work with the rest of your team to help find solutions to their concerns and help take some of the burden off of them. This will let them know that you truly care about their concerns and their child as well. , Sometimes when parents are overly emotional, it can be difficult for them to stay focused. Use statements like that start with things like, ""What I am hearing you say is,"" or, ""I can hear from your voice how stressed you are."" These statements will let them know you acknowledge their stress.


You can also use validating statements such as, ""That must be really difficult"" to help the parents truly understand you are listening and taking their stress, emotions, and concerns seriously. , Sometimes people are uncomfortable when they get stressed. The parents may also find it challenging for them to feel so emotional and want to avoid seeking help. Assure the parents that you are there to help, you are there for their child, and you are there for them. Let them know it is part of your job to offer support and ask them if there is anything you can do to make them feel more comfortable talking and expressing themselves.

, Don’t offer advice, minimize the parents stress and emotions, or suggest any kind of quick fix. The first step is to listen, and let the parent say what they need to say, beginning to end. Try to avoid interrupting them while they are describing their issues to you. Remember, they are the parents, and respect that their experience with their child may be different than your experience as a teacher or caregiver.


By withholding judgment and solutions, you can learn more about the family dynamics, other aspects of the child in question, and behaviors that may not present at school or day care. By using your listening time to also gather information about the child, the parents, and family dynamics, you will have a better arsenal of ideas of what can be done to help the parents and child. , While you are listening, after you reflect to the parent how upset and stressed they sound, encourage them to try to breathe and relax. This will help to dissolve the situation and put the parents at ease.


By reinforcing that they are not alone and you are actively listening, you can help de-escalate the parent’s emotional state so that you can better help them.

"
"
Reassure the parents.,
Ask reflective questions.,
Validate the parent’s situation.,
Empathize with the parent's feelings.,
Assure that you are here to help.,
Suggest breathing exercises to help destress the parents.,
Ask for guidance from the parents.",How to Deal with Stressed and Overly Emotional Parents3," Sound, logical advice and planning is great, but when you feel stressed and overwhelmed, most of the time you want to be heard and feel validated. After this, you can think more rationally about the issues that you are dealing with. Keep this in mind while you are dealing with stressed out parents. Giving them your attention as well as validation and reassurance can go a long way in lowering the emotional intensity so that solutions can eventually be discussed.


Keep reassuring the parents that you value their worries and opinions.

, Reflective questions are questions that start with why, what, who, or when. Try to avoid questions that are black and white or just yes or no. Reflective questions validate the experience the parents are having. It also makes it easier for you as the listener to gather as much information about what is going on with the parent and begin to think about possible solutions. Reflective questions also allow the parent to explore their own feelings and why they are stressed.


Sometimes talking through a stressful time with someone the parent feels is a professional can really help the parent feel supported.Try questions such as ""What can I do to help with this situation?"" or ""What exactly do you think is causing this issue for your child?"" These require long, in depth responses that the parents can answer. These questions will also help you figure out the exact problem and figure out what to do to fix it.

, Holding back all judgment, focus on the fact that the feelings the parents are having are very real for them. Make statements that validate their emotions. Validate how difficult it is to be a parent in general as well. Validating the parent and their emotions can also help calm the parent down. If you feel like someone is listening to you and understanding you, it helps you feel less defensive and more open to talking about options and solutions.Tell them something like, ""I understand your frustration with this situation,"" or, ""I can see the stress and upset that this event has caused you.""

, Allow yourself to feel what the parent is feeling and try to put yourself in their shoes. Humans have a unique ability to empathize with others, and if you are working in childcare or youth work, you most likely are familiar with how much empathy can mean to another person. The parents that are stressed, emotional, and reaching out for help need your empathy too. Remember that youth work is really family work, and by empathizing with what the parent is going through, you are not only supporting the parent, but you can also empathize better with the child and their home situation.


Even though you are not at the solution stage yet, by truly empathizing with the parent, you can begin to form questions of your own about what you would do in that situation, which will help you create an action plan. Keep those questions in the back of your mind and stay focused on listening, validating, and empathizing with the parent., When parents get overly stressed, it can be really helpful for them to know they are not alone, and that other adults are here to support them. You are in a professional position and represent someone who they feel they should be able to trust with their children. Make it very clear that they are not alone and that you are listening.


This will help validate their feelings and show that you empathize with them so that you can be supportive. Tell them that this is a part of your job that you are ready and willing to do.Assure the parents with phrases such as ""I am here to help you with every concern you have,"" or, ""I understand your frustration and I am here to help you until you are satisfied with the result.""

, If you have listened attentively, presently, validated, and empathized but the parent you are dealing with is getting more upset and escalating in their emotions, gently suggest that you both engage in deep breathing. Even if you are on the phone with a parent, ask them to place a hand on their belly and breathe deeply into it. Express to them that you are doing deep breathing too in order to help dissipate the emotion and stress. Also tell them that you want to be calm and centered enough to help them.


Do not rush this step. Allow plenty of time for the parents to vent and speak, but also realize when it’s time to calm down and start being productive.
Be conscious of your time and energy as well. If thinking about solutions is not appropriate because the parent is just too emotional, try to set up another meeting or phone call when you can talk again.

, If you are not sure how best to help the parents, ask them what the best way is for you to help them. Give them the power and control, which may also help ease their stress levels while you are talking to them. Ask what they need from you in this moment to best serve them, their distress, and their child. This can help them focus, feel nurtured, and also feel heard and as though they have a voice.

"
Address the problems separately.,
Ask for a list of concerns.,
Give support to the family.,
Offer outside solutions from the problems.,
Ask the parent directly how you can help.",How to Deal with Stressed and Overly Emotional Parents4," Start helping the parents one step at a time. Knowing that there is help on the way and that you are on their team can help the parent feel secure and supported.Depending on what the concerns are, try to address each of the stressors individually and cohesively.


For example, if their child is acting out at home, address what can be done from your side as the caregiver or teacher, and what the parent can do at home to complement the actions you are taking when the child is in your care., Ask the parents to create a log of the issues and concerns that they are having and how the child is involved. Ask the parents to try to notice times, events, situations, and people that are causing the stress and emotions. This way, you can get a better idea of what types of services and interventions will best fit what is going on with the family. This exercise can also help you to notice similar events with the child when the parent is not around.

, If the parents are stressed because of housing, economic, or financial concerns, use the resources you have in your community or place of work to help support the family through this time. Give the parents as many options as you can about services, welfare programs, and school programs for families struggling with poverty.This may not offer an immediate solution, but it can help decrease their stress in the long run.

, If there are clear instances of family loss, abuse, substance abuse in the household, divorce, or other stressors that are directly related to the current issues, be proactive in finding programs and counseling that will benefit the child. Contact the school counselor for suggestions, or ask your supervisor for referrals for counseling.


Most urban communities have free programs for children who have been victims of abuse. As a youth worker, you should have access to resources for when family situations such as trauma arise.
Assure the parent that you are on their side and will make every effort to find the resources to get their child the help they need.
Involve the parent and listen to their perspective. By developing a team-like environment, not only will the parent benefit by feeling involved and empowered, the child will also benefit by having multiple perspectives and strategies at home as well., Keeping the parents involved will help them feel less powerless, and in turn this will help reduce the feelings of stress and lower the emotionality. Present yourself as a part of their team, and as a someone who wants to support them and cares deeply about the wellbeing of their child. "

Refute her attempts to control your decisions.,
Ignore her criticism.,
Deal with her anxiety.,
Handle her over protectiveness.",How to Deal With Your Mother2," Your mother may try to control your life, who you spend time with, where you go, or how you do things. She may try to get her way with everything, and show her complete dissatisfaction when you go against her wishes. If you want to make your own decisions without the backlash of your mother, be resolute.When making a choice, don’t allow her opinions to seep in.


If you’re purchasing an item, say, “This suits my needs and it is what I need.”
If you’re doing something she thinks should be done differently, say, “I will do it this way, which works well for me.”

, Remember that just as much as you make mistakes, your mother does, too. When she is quick to criticize your boyfriend, living arrangements, or parenting skills, it’s okay to admit that you are doing your best and that you will likely make mistakes.If she points out a mistake, it’s okay to own up to it. “Yes, Mom, I did make a mistake. The important part is that I learned from it.” A succinct comment can put an end to the topic.


When your mom says something critical, respond with, “Thank you for your input, Mom. I’m doing my best to handle it.”
You may want to have a discussion about her criticism if it really bothers you. “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but I feel criticized by you often. I really want a relationship with you, but it is hard for me when it feels like you want to criticize the way I live my life.”

, Remind yourself that being a parent is hard work, and that nobody chooses to suffer from symptoms of anxiety. Regardless, it can be annoying and frustrating to be the object of your mother’s anxiety. Remind yourself not to blame your mother for her anxiety; it’s not pleasant to experience anxiety.Talk to your mother and let her know how you feel. You can say, “I don’t like it when you worry so much about me. It makes me feel like you don’t trust me.”
If you think your mother may suffer from an anxiety disorder, gently bring this to her attention in an effort to seek help. “Mom, I notice you spend a lot of time worrying. I want you to know what it feels like to fully enjoy your life, and I think that going to therapy can help you with that.”

, As a young child, you had no choice but to follow your parent’s demands. but as you mature, you gain more and more control if you allow yourself to have control. Your mother may not want you to have more control, but ask yourself, “Am I in control of my life or is my mother in control?” It’s unlikely you can end your mother’s control while still pleasing her.Changing the way you interact may mean that she becomes upset that she is no longer controlling you the way she would like to.


It’s up to you to allow her the same interference and control or to adjust it.If you are annoyed that your mother calls you multiple times each day, make the choice whether to pick up the phone or not. If it makes you unhappy to talk to her that often, make the choice not to pick up and know that while your actions may upset it, it’s okay to have control of your own life.
Consider saying, “Mom, I want to be a responsible and productive adult, and I’d like to do it on my own. I’d really like your support as I mature to be independent.”

"
"
Practice acceptance.,
Control contact.,
Be empathic.,
Keep your expectations realistic.",How to Deal With Your Mother3," Realize that no matter how hard you try, you cannot change your mother or her behavior. You may have to find a way to accept her, your relationship with her, or her ‘eccentricities’.Learn to accept her, in both her positive and negative qualities.


If you feel like it’s your responsibility to change her or for your younger siblings to have a better life, realize that it is highly unlikely you can affect her to change her behavior. It is not your responsibility.

, While this is more difficult if you live with your mother, it can be helpful when you visit if you live separate. Instead of going over to her home or having you in yours, agree to meet on neutral territory. If you meet in a public location, it can make it easier for you to leave, and may neutralize the conversation since it is generally rude to explode or behave inappropriately in public.If you don’t like your mother coming into your home for fear she may criticize your possessions or cleanliness, don’t invite her. If she shows up unannounced, communicate that that behavior is unacceptable to you.

, Your mother may have a difficult time relating to your wants and needs because she lacks empathy. You may wonder why your mother would treat you this way, and it may be related to her not understanding what it feels like to be talked to or related to in the way she does with you. While the natural reaction is to be rejecting or avoidant, choose to be loving instead. Give her the empathy you wish she would give to you.When you want to react in anger or frustration, pause and respond in a kind, loving way instead.

, As a child, you need a lot of attention, affection, and guidance. If your mom lets you down, you tend to remember it forever and possibly hold it against her for not meeting your needs. Keep realistic expectations for your mother and for your relationship, without holding her to an unattainable standard.It can be hard to accept at times, but mothers are human, too, and make mistakes or don’t meet your needs.


You may want to have a discussion with your mother about your relationship. She may have an expectation to see you 3 times a week when you want to see her once a week. Knowing each other’s expectations and how they differ can help alleviate some of the stress of the relationship.

Focus on your own feelings.,
Change your own actions.,
Practice firm boundaries.,
Agree to disagree.,
Cut contact.",How to Deal With Your Mother4," Instead of blaming your mother and making accusations (which may very well be true), focus on your own feelings and how you are affected. You cannot change your mother’s behavior, but you can change your reaction to her by the way you feel.Even if she dismisses your feelings, you have created your emotional boundaries to show her she is over-reaching.


Instead of saying, “You are so cruel”, say, “It really hurts my feelings when you talk to me like that.”

, It may drive you crazy how your mom behaves, but remember that you can’t change her behavior but you can change yours.If you tend to blow up at her when you argue, try responding differently, like responding calmly or not engaging her anger. See how you changing your behavior affects the relationship and how she responds to you.


If your mother constantly criticizes your lack of effort in one area (say, putting away the dishes), see how she responds when you do the task thoroughly and on time.

, You may want to set physical and emotional boundaries with your mother. It may be time to move out of your mother’s home, or cut back visits with your mother. You may want to create boundaries regarding her coming into your home unannounced or cleaning for you. Emotional boundaries may include being firm in how you choose to be treated. You may say, “I want a relationship with you, but when you criticize me I need to leave because that is not healthy for me.”You may want to clearly communicate your boundaries with your mother. Say, “I do not want you in my room when I am not home, and I hope that you respect my need for privacy.”

, You can fight and run in circles until you realize there are certain topics that you may never see eye to eye on, which can include religion, dating, marriage, parenting, or career choices.Learn to respectfully hear each other’s opinions and then drop the issue. Accept that there are fundamental topics that you will disagree on, and leave it at that.


Don’t make decisions to make your mother happy when it leads to your own unhappiness; ask yourself, “Is it worth it?”

, If you feel you are unable to change anything for the positive and having your mother in your life feels toxic, it may be time to take a break or cut ties.Consider your options if your physical and emotional health are suffering as a result of the relationship. Recognize that this is an extreme option and must be carefully considered. If your mother is a hurtful or hateful person, you are not required to see or spend time with your mother.


You may want to cut face-to-face contact and consider communicating by phone or email.
Ultimately, do what is best for you. Prioritize your health and happiness.

Make it clear when you do and do not need help.,
Limit contact when possible.,
Do not get sucked into negativity.,
Have patience.,
Learn what boundaries are appropriate.",How to Deal With Overprotective Parents2," Boundaries are important in a parent/child relationship. In order to become an independent adult, you need the space to make your own decisions and, sometimes, your own mistakes. Try to set clear boundaries with your parents regarding when you do and do not need their assistance.


Most people, usually early on in middle school, crave some autonomy from their parents. Overprotective parents may have difficulties allowing you to have more freedom, because worrying about you is one of their primary ways of expressing that they care about you. Overprotection is often inadvertently a form of control. You need to make it clear to your parents that you want clearer, firmer boundaries.Let your parents know what is and is not appropriate. For example, you can tell them it's okay to be concerned about your physical wellbeing but that reminding you every day about the latest health scares is not helpful to your emotional well-being. You can tell them it's fine to want you to schedule a weekly phone call, but talking on the phone every day is a bit much., If you live away from home, sometimes limiting contact can be helpful. While it's great to have a relationship with your parents, if they tend to be overprotective you may need to shut them out a bit to reduce their anxiety.


If you've moved out of your house, you do not have to tell your parents everything. It might be best not to mention the person you've just started dating or the party you're going to on Saturday night. If such conversations tend to result in unsolicited advice and an onslaught of questions, just tactfully omit certain details of your day-to-day life.Your parents may resist the lack of contact initially, but find ways to subtly get out of conversations. If your parents start pressing you for more details about your weekend, for example, give them a brief summary and then say something like, ""But I can't talk too long. I've got to do laundry today."", Oftentimes, overprotective parents react negatively to their children establishing boundaries. Your parents may resist your desire for autonomy. If they react negatively, try to avoid getting sucked into drama.


If your parents are prone to dramatics, try to be firm if they take this out on you. If they try to pressure you to come back into the fold by going on about how much they worry, cut them off with something like, ""I'm sure you'll worry less with time."" Then, change the subject.Find a friend with whom you can talk over your frustrations. Venting can actually help you avoid any unnecessary drama. Expressing frustration to a third party who is less emotionally invested in the situation can allow you to purge negative thoughts so you do not end up blowing up at your parents., Your parents are unlikely to change overnight, especially if they're overprotective by nature. Understand there will be an adjustment period when establishing new boundaries and rules for contact. Try not to get too upset over slip-ups and misunderstandings. It may take a few months before your parents understand your need for space and adjust to your newfound independence., If you want to set boundaries with your parents, you need to learn what boundaries are appropriate given your age group. If you're in middle school, acceptable boundaries will be much different than if you're in high school or college.


Remember, your parents want to set boundaries to protect you and help you grow. Oftentimes, out of control children or teens secretly crave more boundaries in order to feel secure in their homes. Try to understand that your parents are acting in your best interest when it comes to rules.
If you're a preteen, it's not unreasonable for your parents to want to know where you are, who you're with, and what you're doing at all times. You should be willing to provide this information openly. However, as a preteen you likely have an increased need for privacy. It's okay to request that your parents, stay out of your room and don't go through your things, for instance.
If you're a teenager, your parents will expect you'll want to be more independent. You're in the stages of becoming an adult and getting ready to move out of the house. It's natural you may want a later curfew and certain freedoms, like being able to take the car out alone. It's perfectly reasonably to make these requests of your parents. However, keep in mind arguing and fighting only causes an increase in stress for both you and your parents. Be respectful when requesting increased freedoms. If you find the discussion becoming heated, remove yourself and take some deep breaths. Once you've calmed down, you can bring it up again, but this time ask calmly what their reasons are. Strive for compromise and win-win situations.
If you're starting college, your parents may struggle to let go. It can be frightening to watch your child enter the world as a young adult. It's okay to request that your parents not call you every day or ask you very personal questions, such as questions about your love life or your social life. However, having a weekly phone call with your parents can help ease their worries as they'll know you're okay.

Consider the role of anxiety in overprotective parents.,
Show your parents you're capable of making good choices.,
Be open to advice on occasion.",How to Deal With Overprotective Parents3," Do you consider your parents to be generally anxious people? Do they tend to worry about small details in day-to-day life in addition to you? Many overprotective parents have preexisting issues with anxiety that may make them extra vigilant regarding their kids. Try to understand your parents have your best interests at heart. Accept that anxiety, over which your parents likely have little control, is a major factor in how they behave towards you., If you want your parents to worry less, show them you're responsible. Making small changes to your day-to-day routine can help your parents see they do not have to worry.


If you live at home, approach your parents as soon as possible if you're asking for permission to go somewhere. Be upfront about who you'll be with and how long you'll be out. Your parents will appreciate your maturity.Be aware that adults often follow many of the same rules they apply to you. For instance, it can be troubling to simply disappear and not let the people who care about you know where you are, even as an adult. Adults let each other know where they are going if they are in loving, healthy relationships. If you want to be treated as a mature individual, then show your parents you are trustworthy and considerate.
Do your homework without prompting. Strive to eat healthier meals. Do day-to-day chores. Show your parents you are mature. This will help lessen their anxiety about the decisions you make.If you live away from home, try to fill your parents in on your accomplishments and small indications you're capable of taking care of yourself. Did you eat a particularly healthy meal this week? Clean your apartment? Did you make the Dean's list this semester? Try to mention this during your weekly phone calls home., Remember, sometimes your parents do know best. They are older and have had more life experience. If you're confused about something, it's okay to seek out your parents advice and be open to what they have to say. If your parents see you're mature enough to seek advice when necessary, they may worry about your decisions less."

Suggest self care for the parent's stress.,
Encourage the parent to take time for themselves.,
Ask the parents what they need.,
Emphasize the need for emotional stability.",How to Deal with Stressed and Overly Emotional Parents5," As anyone will tell you, parenting is the toughest job you can have. Sometimes, when parents are stressed and over-emotional, it can be helpful if you encourage them to take some time and space to care for themselves. By doing this, you are again showing support, showing that you are listening, and helping ease their stress by giving them permission to focus on themselves.Depending on the severity of the situation, you may need to suggest different things. For example, if there has been a loss in the family, encourage the parent to seek counseling. Offer to connect them with free services, or ask the parent to contact their insurance company to find a therapist that can help them. The parent may be beyond their capability to fully handle what is going on in their family, and seeking the help of a professional may be the best thing for them and for their child.

, Parents often forget to take care of themselves. Even if this means an hour alone in a hot bath with no interruptions, encourage the parent to find ways to relax. You don’t have to be explicit with your suggestions, but be sincere that you feel they deserve some pampering. Using your empathy, reaffirm that their stress and emotions are valid, and they must take care of themselves so that they can also take care of their child., It might help you to ask the parents what they think they may need to get through their stressful emotions. See if there is anything you can do to help, such as suggesting parenting classes or books. Depending on what is stressing the child, perhaps a support group would be helpful and you can help them find it.


For example, if the parents have an autistic child and are stretched beyond their limits, a support group for parents with autistic children might be a great way for them to relieve feelings of isolation and connect with other parents with similar stressors. , Impress upon the parents how important their emotional state is for the well being of not only themselves, but also their child. Sometimes parents can lose themselves in the daily stress of work and child rearing, and it can be helpful to hear that their emotional health is important and valid. Tell the parent that they matter, their feelings matter, and even though you care for their child as your job, part of caring for that child is caring for the entire family.


Be a pillar of support and validation for stressed parents. In the long run, better emotional health in the parents make for better emotional health for the child. As a youth worker, your job is to promote arenas for healthy children. Be kind, listen, validate, and empathize when parents get stressed."

Talk to your parents.,
Communicate your feelings.,
Compromise.,
Treat them with respect.",How to Get Your Parents to Be Nicer to You1," It can be hard for parents and children to spend time just talking to each other. Try telling your parents about your day, even if you don't think they would be interested. If they listen and respond, try to talk to them more often. This might make them friendlier and make it easier to talk to them later, when they're upset.If you don’t talk to your parents much, try finding something simple to say to them each day. It doesn’t have to be serious or momentous, just a small piece of news or an everyday observation, like what you did in gym class or who you met on your walk home.;
, Your parents aren’t mind-readers. You have to tell them what you’re feeling as clearly as possible. Be honest and direct, without blaming them or whining.Let your parents respond and listen to their side of the story.


Use sentences that begin with ""I"" like ""I felt sad"" or ""I think that was unfair."" Sentences that start with ""You"" can make your parents feel attacked. The goal is to express your feelings, needs, and desires, not to criticize your parents.
Similarly, it’s usually more productive to say what you do want rather than what you don't want. The first option sounds more positive.
For instance, if you feel like your parents are being too nosy, you might say something like, “I’m feeling defensive and on-guard. I would appreciate it if my room could be a private space.”

, The fastest route to conflict resolution is compromise. If you want your parents to be nice to you, you should expect to do something nice for them, too.For example, if you’re asking them not to poke around your room, that means that you’ll have to take responsibility for keeping it clean. Or, you might compromise by agreeing that only part of your room, like your desk area, is off-limits.

, When you give your parents respect, they’re more likely return the favor. This doesn’t mean that you have to agree with them all the time, it just means that you should listen to their perspective patiently and try to understand their point of view.Listening is one of the greatest signs of respect and keys to good communication. Once you’ve stated your case, be sure to give your parents a chance to respond.
When you show respect, it shows that you’re mature, and your parents will be more likely to treat you like an adult who can be trusted to make their own decisions.
Even if your parents respond with anger or rudeness, it won't help to imitate them. Adults don't always have the best behavior, but sometimes it helps for the kid to be the role model.

Get away from the situation so you can think clearly.Close your eyes and think about what caused the argument. Are you actually mad at your parents, or is there something else causing stress in your life? Take some time to work through your thoughts and find the reason why you're upset.It could be that your parents are the reason why you're upset, and you're not just taking your anger out on them. Think about what they did, and why it upset you. Try to understand their perspective as well.;
, After a fight, your heart is pounding and it's hard to focus. Deep breathing is one of the best ways to relax after a tense situation.Try the ""Four Square"" method of breathing. Four Square breathing breaks your breath down into four steps all set to a count of four. Take a deep breath for a count of four. Then, hold your breath for a count of four. Exhale for a count of four, and then rest for a count of four. Take a few normal breaths, and then repeat the process until you feel more relaxed.Meditating may also be helpful. Meditation requires a lot of patience, but practicing can help combat stress and anxiety. To start meditating, find a quiet place and sit with your back straight. Make sure you are comfortable. Take a deep breath through your nose and fill your lungs completely. You should feel your chest expand. When you exhale, push the air out through your mouth. Try to get every bit of air out of your body. Continue to breathe this way and work on clearing your mind., Writing can help you put words to your feelings, and gives you an opportunity to see what's really going on. Write as if you're talking to your best friend. Just get the feelings on paper.You may find it more helpful to write about something other than your feelings. For some, writing stories can be an outlet. You can write whatever you'd like if it helps you calm down., At some point, you'll need to talk to your parents again. Try not to put this off for too long. While it's important for both you and your parents to calm down after a fight, the quicker you can get back on good terms, the better.If you still have some things you need to say, make sure you do it in a respectful way. Be assertive, but make sure you're not making things worse. Organize your thoughts, and let your parents know exactly how you feel., Not every conversation with your parents has to be an argument. Try talking to your parents about non-controversial issues. Tell them how your day was, and ask them about theirs.The more you talk with your parents, even if it's about trivial matters, the easier it gets. Talking with your parents will help you form a bond with them, and may make things easier when you disagree.If you have a rocky relationship with your parents, start slow. It is not too late to start talking to them. Spend time with them and try to build trust. Show them that you want them to be a part of your life., At some point you will have to have difficult conversations with your parents. Before you start talking to them, take some time to organize your thoughts. By knowing what you want to say, you can communicate to your parents what you need from them.Planning the conversation is also a good way to calm yourself down, especially if you have to deliver bad news.If you just want your parents to listen to you, make that clear before the conversation. Tell them about your problem, and let them know that you just need someone who will listen to you., Some topics, such as sex or personal feelings, can be awkward to talk about with your parents. Don't let feelings of embarrassment or shame keep you from talking with them. Be up front with them, even if you think they'll be mad.By recognizing how you feel, and telling your parents, you may be able to ease them into the conversation. When it comes to topics such as a failing grade or a speeding ticket, ask that your parents listen to what you have to say.Try saying something like, ""I need to talk to you. I have some bad news, and I'm worried that you'll be upset, but I have to tell you. Will you listen to me?""You could also say, ""I'm a little embarrassed about something, but I need someone to talk to you."", Try to think about how much time you'll need to talk with your parents. Look for times when they aren't busy with other things.If you can't find a good time, tell your parents that you need to talk to them, and ask them when they have some spare time.Don't try to break bad news to your parents right when they get home from work., When you get into a disagreement with your parents, it can be tempting to defend yourself. While you should make sure you have a chance to say your piece, you should also give your parents the same respect.Avoid interruptions. Give your parents the opportunity to say what they need to say before responding. While your parents are talking, give them your full attention. Don't let your mind wander, and don't think about how much you disagree.When responding, repeat a few key points they made to show that you listened. Tell them what you disagree with, and why., If things get heated between you and your parents, don't insult them. Avoid making sarcastic remarks or calling them names. This will not help you resolve the conflict.Rather than get angry and resort to personal attacks, let your parents know why you disagree with their rules. Explain your feelings. They may not change their rules, but by being civil with your parents you may earn more trust in the future.

, Lying to your parents will keep them from trusting you. Avoid hiding information from them, even if you know it's likely to get you in trouble.Let them know you understand where they are coming from, and try to offer an alternative solution. Maybe you want to stay out an hour later one night. Try saying something like, ""I know you want me home early because you care about me and want me to make it home safely. But I think I'm old enough to stay out a little bit later. Maybe we can try it for one night and see how it goes?""Honesty is about more than telling the truth. If your parents do something that bothers you, be honest with them. If what they do is hurtful to you, tell them., Your parents may want to make a deal with you to end the disagreement. Or, perhaps you have an idea for a trade-off. In any case, if you make a compromise with your parents, stick to it.If you make a compromise and fail to deliver on your end of the agreement, it will be much more difficult to reason with your parents in the future.

, If you want to have a better relationship with your parents, do not ignore them. When they try to get in touch with you, respond. The more your parents trust you, the less likely they are to try and impose restrictions on you.If you get a phone call from your parents, answer it. If they text you, respond. Your response doesn't have to be lengthy, just let them know you are available., When your parents ask you to do something, do it. Even if they didn't ask you to do anything, do something to help around the house.Don't brag about helping, or they'll suspect you want something. Chances are, if you start helping around the house and paying more attention to the things they ask of you, your parents will notice., Building trust takes time, even if you haven't done anything wrong. If you feel like your parents are being unfair, or overly suspicious, talk to them. Make sure you are clear with them about what you want.If you have a history of breaking household rules, don't expect your parents to easily give in.

, Until you are an adult and living on your own, you have to play by your parents' rules. The easiest way to build trust with your parents is to respect them as the leaders of the household. Acknowledge their rules and don't argue with them.Try to see things from their point of view. Your parents have your best interest at heart, even if it seems otherwise. While they may not always be right, they probably have good reasons for their rules.Continue to talk to your parents. Express your opinions and let them know your needs.

Spend quality time with your parents.,
Be honest.,
Don’t pick a fight.,
Show gratitude.,
Seek help from others if you need to.",How to Get Your Parents to Be Nicer to You2," Make an effort to hang out with your parents once in a while. With sports, clubs, school, and friends, it’s easy to blow your parents off. But, taking time for family will strengthen your bond with your parents (and can be a lot of fun, too).It shouldn’t feel like a chore, so make it a leisure activity that you both enjoy. You could even agree on a scheduled ritual, like a hike, dinner, bowling league, movie night, or game night.
Some parents feel like their kid only spends time with them when the kid wants something. They may be happier and more relaxed if you show them you want to spend time just for them.

, Your parents are more likely to treat you well if they feel that they can trust you. Build trust with them by not shying away from the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable.It's surprisingly simple to find yourself saying a little white lie to protect your friend, romantic partner, or even your siblings. But if you tell the truth even when the truth isn't perfectly pleasant, you will become much more trustworthy.

, It’s easy to get annoyed with your parents and the other people that you're closest to. Don’t let small annoyances lead to big conflicts. Instead, strive to be tolerant of your parents’ personalities, habits, and even faults.If you know that you’re too annoyed, angry, or upset to be civil, it’s better to wait to interact with your parents until you calm down.

, When your parents are nice to you, express your appreciation. Doing so will encourage them to keep being nice to you in the future.A simple “thank you” or hug goes a long way. So does ""I love you,"" especially if that's not something you often say. If your parents do something especially nice for you, like get you a bike, help you with a science project, or drive you 100 miles to see a baseball game, consider writing them a thank you card.

, Sadly, your parents might still be mean to you or ignore you even when you try to be nice. This is not your fault, and you do not need to fix it all on your own. Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice from an adult you trust to look out for you. This is extra important if your parents hit you, abuse you emotionally (for example, bullying), or neglect your needs (for example, forgetting to feed you). Here are some places to look for help:


Talk to a school social worker if your school has one. (Some school counselors can also help, but others only give education advice.)
Look for nearby programs for children and teens in need, sometimes called Youth Resiliency programs. Some schools and religious groups run programs like this.
Look online for help lines and chat rooms where you can talk about the issues in your life.

Cooperate with their rules.,
Behave in a way that will make them proud.,
Make a contribution to the household.",How to Get Your Parents to Be Nicer to You3," If you have an issue with a particular rule, feel free to voice it. However, if your parents explain their reasoning and refuse to budge on a rule, you should accept it.For instance, if you have a curfew, observe it, and always notify them if you’re not going to make it in time.
Keep in mind that graciously accepting their rules and their “nos” can make it easier to get more leeway and “yeses” in the future. Chances are, if you stick to the curfew, they’ll trust you enough to extend it later.

, There’s no need to rebel against your parents. Demonstrating positive behavior, like respect for others’ feelings, bodies, and property, is admirable and normal. When you behave well, your parents are likely to treat you well., Often, parents do most of the work of running a household. Pitch in regularly towards keeping the place you live in order, and your parents are bound to take notice of your efforts.You could agree to a daily or weekly chore, like loading the dishwasher, doing the laundry, or mowing the lawn. Or, simply make a point of helping out when it seems like your parents are tired or could use an extra hand.

Don’t fight with your siblings.",How to Get on Your Mom's Good Side," Since the day you were born, your mom has probably been getting up early to feed you and get you ready for the day. However, you are now old enough to manage all of this on your own. You can tell your mom that you will make your own breakfast, and pack your own lunch. Tell her that you will take the school bus (if this is an option where you live) so that she can sleep in.Although your mom may not take you up on your offer, she will appreciate that you are trying to do something nice for her.;
, Tell your mom that you want to prepare breakfast or dinner one or two days in the week. If you are old enough, go to the grocery store and pick up all the ingredients yourself. If you are not old enough, ask an older sibling or your other parent to help you get the ingredients. If there is no one else to ask, you can still ask your mom if she can take you to pick up the ingredients.


Try to choose something that you will be able to make for the whole family with minimal assistance from your mom. However, if she says she would enjoy making it together with you, don’t push her away.
If you have siblings, you can also ask them if they’d like to help you make the meal together. It will probably make your mom very happy to see you all working together.

, For many moms, it is ideal to have each child make up their own bed each day before going to school. If your mom normally has to nag you to do this several times, try getting it done as soon as you get up before she has a chance to ask you.Though making up your bed can feel like a real hassle, if you get into the habit of doing it every single day, eventually it will be something you do without even thinking about it.
If you really want to go the extra mile, you can even make her bed for her.

, If you really want to impress your mom, you can do so by keeping your room clean without your mom having to ask you to do so. It doesn’t have to be perfect all of the time, but try to keep it organized. Keep the floor vacuumed, and all of your toys, books, electronic devices, etc. put away when you aren’t using them. Fold your clean clothes and put them in drawers or in a closet.


You can also keep it smelling fresh by opening the window for a few minutes every day.

, It’s best if you help out without being asked to do so. You don’t have to clean the whole house from top to bottom (though you can, if you’re up to it), but do a few things that you know your mom hates doing herself.


For example, you can take the trash out, sweep the kitchen floor, put away the dishes, fold the laundry, or clean the windows. These are just examples, so try to look for things that you know your mom will appreciate.

, There are many, many things you can compliment her on. You can tell her that she looks pretty, or you can compliment her outfit, or hairstyle. You can also compliment her cooking, or how great the house always looks because of her.


One good way to get on your mom’s good side is to always compliment her cooking. Even if you don’t really like what she made for you, you should still eat it. Tell her that she did a great job cooking, and that you really appreciate it.

, Don’t just assume that your mom knows that you love her. This becomes especially important as you get older and less dependent on her. Remember that it isn’t easy for moms to watch their babies grow up into adults who don’t really need much from them anymore, and simply reminding her that you really love her will make her feel happy.You can tell your mom you love her anytime, but good times include when she drops you off for school and before you go to sleep at night.

, It doesn’t have to be something big or expensive. It can even be something homemade, such as a card or a goody bag. It’s important to remember to do this on important days like her birthday and Mother’s Day, but it’s also a great idea to give a gift just to show her that you are thinking of her.


Don’t forget her birthday! Unless your family doesn’t celebrate birthdays, your mom’s feelings will probably be hurt if you forget about it, especially if she goes out of her way to make your birthday special.
If you give her a gift for no reason, when you give it to her, you can say something like, “I made this for you because you’ve been working really hard lately, and I want you to know that I care.”

, You don’t need to do this every single day, but whenever you feel the urge to tell her, do it! It doesn’t have to be a long, drawn out speech about all the good things you’ve done for her. You can simply just point out that your mom does a great job managing all the things that being a good mom requires, and that you don’t take it for granted.For example, you can say, “I just wanted to tell you that I think you’re the best mom anyone could ask for. You’re always there for me, and it really means a lot.”

, For most moms, their children are the light of their lives, even if children sometimes cause stress. Do something that will make your mom laugh. Tell a silly joke or do a silly dance, dress up in a silly costume and parade around the house. Show her that even though you are growing up, you still enjoy laughing and being silly with her.Don’t forget that moms like to have fun and be silly just as much as anyone.

, Sometimes your mom will say or do things that you don’t like. She might tell you that you can’t do something that you want to do, and she may or may not give a good reason for why you can’t. In these situations, it is easy to get angry, yell, and/or throw a tantrum. However, if you really want to get on your mom’s good side, don’t do this.


Try to remind yourself that your mom is doing her best for you, and even if her reason for not letting you do something seems stupid to you, it probably makes sense to her.
By behaving maturely, your mom will see that you are becoming a fully-formed, responsible adult. Thus, in the future, she might be more willing to let you do what you ask.
If you really disagree with something, then talk with your mom about the matter respectfully. Before you approach her, make sure you have gone through all the reasons you disagree with something so that she’ll see you’re not just approaching her because you’re angry.

, For most moms, they feel like they spend most of their day nagging children to do something, and this can feel draining and frustrating for them. If your mom has asked you to do something, try to get it done right away. If there is a reason that you can’t do it right away, tell her why, and let her know that you’ll get to it as soon as possible.


For example, if she asks you to clean up your room, but you have a TV show coming on in 5 minutes that you really want to see, just tell her the truth. Say, “Mom, I know I need to clean up my room, and I promise to get straight to it in about 30 minutes, but my favorite TV show is about to come on. Can I please watch it first?”
Complete the task without complaining about it. Complaining will only make your mom feel annoyed.

, Most moms really want their children to do well in school. If your grades aren’t so great at the moment, take steps to improve them. Stop goofing off during class, and instead, listen to the teacher. Complete assignments as they are assigned, and be sure to turn them in on time. Study for tests so that you will do well.


If you are struggling with a concept that you are learning, get help. Go talk to your teacher after class and explain that you are struggling, they may be able to offer extra help or at least direct you to a tutor who can help you.
You can also ask your mom for help with homework if you think she would enjoy helping you.

, Fighting children can be a real source of stress for parents. If you don’t get along with your siblings, this can be tough, but do your best to avoid fighting with them whenever possible. If they are doing something that is bothering you, try to get away from them without yelling or hitting them.This is especially true if you’re the oldest. As the oldest, your mom probably expects you to be the most mature of your siblings.
You can even try to help out your siblings when they need it. If your mom sees that you are being kind and helpful to them when you normally fight with them, she will be really impressed.

Be appreciative.How you do this depends on the dynamics of your family.,
Create boundaries.If you are an adult with your own life, you and your parents may need to set boundaries with one another in order to maintain a healthy relationship.,
Remain in contact.",How to Get Along With Your Parents," This doesn’t mean just sitting in front of the TV together. Instead, find activities to do together. In doing this, you will learn more about what your parent’s enjoy doing, and it will keep things light and, hopefully, tension free.


Ask them what activities they might like to do together with you. Maybe they would enjoy a round of mini-golf, for example.;
, This means that when you have time together, you should engage in conversation with them. In this case, it should be less about sharing your own feelings, and more about trying to learn more about them and their feelings, views, and beliefs.


For example, you can ask them to tell you about their own childhood, or about how they felt when they found out they were going to have you. It doesn’t matter too much what you ask, the point is to spend time learning about them.
This will also demonstrate to your parents that you are interested in them as people rather than just always seeing them as parents, who are expected to provide for you.

, This may seem obvious, but it is often harder than you think. When you are communicating with your parents, make sure you are listening.


This means looking them when they are talking, not interrupting them, and speaking clearly when responding.If you’re not sure what they meant when they said something, try repeating back what you think they meant.For example, if they said you need to clean the kitchen and you can go to the mall. Respond by clarifying what you think they mean by saying, “I hear that I can go to the mall once I have finished cleaning the kitchen. Is that right?”
If you are on your cell phone, listening to music, or on the computer, then stop what you are doing then they are talking to you. It can be really difficult to talk to someone when you feel that they are engaged in something else. Additionally, doing this demonstrates that you respect them more than whatever it is you're doing.

, It doesn’t necessarily have to be a discussion about trying to understand them better (although it can be). You can also talk to them about something at school that is bothering you, or something you are excited or scared about.


Regardless of the topic, do your best to stay calm and be as logical as you can. Sometimes these conversations steer in the direction of conflict. If your parents have opinions that you don’t agree with, then understand that this is OK, and try to remain respectful.

, If you ask your parents for help, you demonstrate to them that you respect them, and their knowledge of how to do something. You could, for example, ask them to help you with your math homework or to proof-read an essay you’ve written.Listen to what they have to say and don’t get offended. Critical feedback, regardless of who it is from, can often feel like a personal attack; however, remember that they are just doing their best to help you.

, By making an extra effort, you will show them that you are becoming more mature, and that they can begin to discuss things with you less as a child and more as a young adult.


For example, if you wash the dishes after dinner, your parents will be reminded of how lucky they are to have you, and will be more willing to discuss matters that are important to you.

, The relationship you have with your parents will evolve as you become older.Therefore, it is important for you, as the child, to understand that this transition can be difficult for your parents. As a young child, there main job was to keep you safe and healthy. However, as you get older, the relationship transitions from caregiver to a more friend-like relationship, and it can be difficult to make this transition smoothly so understand that conflict is apart of the process.


During these transitions, you will likely feel that they don’t recognize your independence, but try to remember that they are having to let go of their child to some degree, which is very emotionally difficult for many parents.

, Sometimes, it can be helpful to try and imagine that you were in their situation.You might see that they are worried for your safety, or for the consequences of a certain action. This doesn’t mean it should change your mind or make you agree with them, but it can help you to find the source of the conflict.


If you feel that they are open to it, try to explain the conflict from your point of view, too.

, When arguing with someone, it can be very tempting to add in personal comments such as, “you’re a bad parent” or “you never listen to me”. This makes the conversation feel like an attack, and will most likely cause them to withdraw from communicating openly.If it starts to become personal, consider taking a break, and beginning the conversation again later.

, Before you begin a conversation about a lingering conflict, resolve to listen openly to what they have to say and accept that they may have valid points., Sometimes, it can be helpful to try and imagine that you were in their situation.You might see that they are worried for your safety, or for the consequences of a certain action. This doesn’t mean it should change your mind or make you agree with them, but it can help you to find the source of the conflict.


If you feel that they are open to it, try to explain the conflict from your point of view, too.

, During a conflict it is easy to let the words flow out of your mouth without thinking about how they might come across. Before responding to anything, take a few seconds to think about what you want to say, and then to think about how this will sound to the person receiving it.You may think it will seem weird to others if you don’t respond quickly; however, in this situation it is better to take time to construct a response than to just let whatever comes into your head come out of your mouth!

, If the conflict escalates despite efforts to resolve it, take a break.Tell your parents that you need some time to think about everything and to calm down. This may be 10 minutes or it may be a day. In the mean time, do something productive that will help release any anger you are feeling.


For example, go for a walk or a run, meditate, write in a journal. Whatever it is, make sure that it is something good. Punching a wall, for example, may help release tension, but it may harm you physically.
Most likely, your parents will agree that it may be a good idea to take a break; however, if they seem to keep pursuing the fight despite your attempts to suggest a break, it may be best to simply walk away before the fight escalates even more!

, If the conflict is about values or beliefs, it is entirely possible that you will not be able to resolve the conflict.In this case, you may suggest respectfully agreeing to disagree. This means that you will keep your belief and your parent’s will keep theirs, and that you will recognize and understand that you cannot agree on the matter. You may decide together that you will simply leave this topic out of conversation as much as possible.


Be aware that this step may not be suitable for many types of conflicts. However, for certain matters (e.g. religious differences) it may offer a good way out of a conflict that might otherwise damage your relationship.

, Like any relationship, in order to maintain your relationship with your parents, you will need to be able to spend time together just like when you are improving your relationship. This might mean taking your parents out for lunch or dinner, running errands with them, or helping them clean the garage.


If there are certain types of tasks that tend to lead to conflict, then do your best to avoid them. For example, if conflict tends to arise about the best way to paint a wall, then don’t offer to help them paint their house. Instead, make time to do something else, like have coffee together.
In some cases, it may not be possible to schedule time to be physically together. In this instance, you can also schedule phone calls, or video calls using the computer. The important part is that you make time where you can casually chat with your parents about what is happening in your life, and that they can chat with you about their own lives.

, Before you open your mouth to say something to your parents, think about how it might make them feel.


It is nice if you can do a mixture of both actions and words. Occasionally, you can surprise them through a nice action; however, you should try to use kind words as often as you can, and ideally, always.

, If your family enjoys being affectionate, then you can give them a kiss or a hug along with a, “thank you for everything you do for me”. This is good to do any time, but can be especially helpful if there has been a lot of tension between you and your parents lately.


If your family doesn’t typically engage in physical affection, you can simply say, “thank you” and explain why you appreciate them. If you feel nervous about saying these things in person, you could also try writing them a letter.
You can also be specific in your appreciation. For example, if your mother or father makes you an especially delicious dinner then say thank you, and tell them how much you enjoy it when they cook for you.

, This means that you must sit down together to discuss how you will respect one another’s boundaries.


For example, you might set the boundary that your parents are not allowed to tell you how you should spend your money or where you should live, and your parents may set the boundary that you are not allowed to turn up at their home without calling in advance.

, As in all relationships, conflict will inevitably arise. During conflict, the likelihood that one party or the other will simply stop communicating altogether rises. This can effectively end the relationship all together. Therefore, to maintain the relationship, do your best to always stay in contact with your parents, even if it is just through email or letters until the conflict has been resolved, or at least until you are both calm enough to start over."

If you want to use a costume to embarrass your parents, try being inappropriate. Dress up as a Nazi, wear drag, wear a F*** the Pope Tee-shirt, wear a nappy if you are 13 and don't need one, black up and be an old fashioned black and white minstrel, if you've been well brought up dress as a chav, hick, red-neck, hillbilly or any other type of person your parents disapprove of.;
, Fishnet tights, a short skirt, low cut top, high heels, and caked on makeup are all fairly likely to embarrass mum or dad. If you are a boy dress up really recklessly. Wear an inverted cross, try pants with a crotch around your knees, two or three really big, thick gold chains, or gold looking. Carry a can of spray paint to look like a tagger, find a fake gun if you are feeling very reckless or fill a few tiny plastic bags such as those that spare shirt buttons are usually in with flour and carry those.

, It's hilarious when at the door they ask, ""and what are you dressed up as?"" and you're wearing an ugly mask and say "" my mom/dad "". Go through your parents wardrobe and find something to wear that you think your mother or father wouldn't want your neighbourhood to know they own. Has dad got a really naff 80s suit? Does mum have a terrible seventies jump suit? Get them on and go out trick or treating! Have a dig right to the back of the closet, you may locate mum's dominatrix outfit or dad's adult baby gear. Airing those sort of outfits in public is sure to embarrass your parents.

, For example, instead of saying ""Happy Halloween!"" say ""Happy Birthday!"" or ""Merry Christmas!"" Again, this is more likely to humiliate you than embarrass your parents. Try being more subtle. Say, 'I hope this year dad doesn't find my costume such a turn-on. I'm tired', or, 'Thanks to all this candy, I'll be able to get rid of the funny taste in my mouth tonight'.

, Beware not to go overboard with this, as the authorities may be alerted or your parents could get in trouble. Embarrass your parents for your own amusement by all means, apparently, but you'll be embarrassed too if you end up in the local papers in some sort, 'feral kids in neglect scandal' exposé.

, and close it without giving them candy, or give them fruit. Give out really cheap, tacky candy. Give out candy that is passed its best before date. Look for 'adult' confectionery online and hand out chocolate nipples or willies. Your parents will certainly find this embarrassing.

, If you are usually not affectionate, ramp up the public displays of affection to embarrass your mother and father on Halloween. Call your father Daddy if you are 13 or over and don't usually. Use Mommy for your mother, or Mater. Flinch when your parents look at you as if you are afraid of being hit. Ask for permission to do everything as if you aren't usually allowed to eat, go to the toilet or sit on the sofa.

Find a good time to talk.,
Think about what to say.,
Use specifics.,
Share positive things with your parents.,
Say ""Thank you"" regularly.",How to Express Appreciation to a Parent1," If you want to let your parents know how much you care, find a good time to do so. Parents are busy, and will appreciate you not bothering them when they're busy.Think about when your parent is usually free. For example, if your mom is usually busy on Wednesday nights, don't talk then. Wait until she has some downtime on a Thursday.
Pick a time when your parent is usually not distracted as well. While your dad may be home most Fridays, maybe he likes to watch a particular show that night. He may not pay as close attention to conversation.;
, Showing appreciation can be difficult. You may not be sure exactly what to say. Your parents do so much for you, so it can be stressful to try to find a precise way to thank them for that.You can rehearse beforehand. Try to jot down what you want to say.
Try reciting your words in front of a mirror. If you practice your words a few times, you'll be more likely to remember them when the time comes to talk.

, It can be nice to give a general ""Thank you."" However, you also may want to include some specifics when expressing gratitude to a parent. A parent will appreciate knowing exactly why you value them.For example, you may be inclined to say something to your dad like, ""I appreciate all the help you give me.""
Try to find more specifics. How does your dad help, exactly? Try to think of a specific thing he's done. For example, ""I really appreciate how you helped me work through that problem with my friend Justin last week. I really like having someone to talk to when I'm having problems.""

, Work on opening up to your parents on a regular basis. You can verbally show appreciation by telling your parents you appreciate them directly. However, you can also show them by sharing with them. Do not just talk to your parents when something's gone wrong. Speak to them on a regular basis.Fill your parents in on the small details of your life. Let them know how a test went at school, or something funny a friend said that week.
Your parents care about you. They want to know how you're doing and feeling. Let them in regularly as this can show you appreciate their presence in your life.

, A simple ""thank you"" goes a long way to show appreciation. While gratitude certainly goes beyond manners, do not forget your manners. Make sure to thank your parents throughout your interactions when appropriate. Always thank your dad for paying for dinner. Offer your mom a ""thank you"" when she gives you advice."

Write a letter.,
Make your parents a card.,
Write a poem.,
Express positive thoughts on social media.",How to Express Appreciation to a Parent2," A letter can be a fun way to let someone know how much you love and appreciate them and that you care. This can be particularly helpful if you tend to get nervous with face-to-face discussions. Try writing a parent a thought out thank you letter letting them know you appreciate them.A thank-you card can be sent in direct response to something. You can, for example, send your mom a thank-you letter after she visits for the weekend. You can also send a letter for a parent's birthday, and make a point of expressing appreciation there.
However, don't hesitate to write a letter or send a card simply because you're feeling grateful. If you value your parents, it's important to let them know regularly. Don't hesitate to write a letter, or even an email, if you want to let your parents know you care.

, This can be great if you're expressing appreciation for a particular occasion. If it's your mom's birthday, for example, a homemade card telling her how much you care can be a great way to show appreciation.You can get art supplies at a local craft store and let your creativity run wild. Decorate the card with designs your parent would like. If you're not artistically-inclined, you can always get a blank card at a gift shop.
Inside the card, write a heartfelt letter expressing appreciation. Let your parents know why you appreciate them every day.

, The effort you put into an original poem will really show appreciation. If you're feeling creative, try to write a poem for your parents telling them how much you value them. Remember, you don't need to be a master wordsmith to write a nice poem. Your parents will appreciate the time and care you put in to writing them an original poem., Many people use social media to vent frustration and negativity. However, try to use your Facebook or Twitter page to express positivity. Try to post happy memories of your parents online, or post a Facebook status saying exactly why you appreciate your dad.Remember, this may not be as effective if your parents don't follow you on social media.

Try to find a little time each week to visit your parents.If you don't live near home, try to find time to call each week. A quick phone call can really show your parents you care.

, If you're feeling grateful, try finding a present your parents would like. Presents don't have to only be given on holidays or special occasions. If you see something your mom would love at a local gift shop, don't hesitate to buy it. A surprise gift can really show that you care., Anything your parents dread doing (chore wise) make sure and do! This will take many sacrifices. If you live at home, you can show appreciation by chipping in regarding household chores. In addition to doing any chores expected of you, do a little extra now and then. For example, do the dishes when your mom has had a busy day at work. Take the trash out when you see your dad has forgotten to do so., Do it secretly, so they won't try to chime in and help you. Breakfast in bed will probably be the easiest meal. Don't wake them up though!"

Try writing down everything that your parents have done to upset you. You may find it easier to talk about certain things after you have gotten them down on paper.;
, In order for things to improve, it is important to figure out what you would like your parents to do differently. You will need to tell them what you would like them to do differently, so make sure that your request is something that is straightforward and reasonable.


For example, if you want your parents to stop coming into your room without knocking, then you might decide to ask them to start knocking and waiting for you to say “come in” before coming into your bedroom.
Try writing down what you want to ask your parents to do differently., In order to express yourself to your parents in a way that they will be receptive to, it is important to put your feelings into the form of “I” statements rather than “you” statements. “I” statements sound less challenging to people, so most people respond better to them.For example, instead of saying, “You always barge into my room without knocking,” try saying “I feel like I don’t have much privacy when you come into my room without knocking.”

, You will have an easier time of getting your parents to list to you and agree with your request if they are in good moods. Avoid talking to your parents when they seem stressed, busy, or upset about something.For example, you might try talking to your parents after dinner or on a day that they are off from work.

, The next step is to say what you would like your parents to do. In order for things to change, it is important for you to be specific about what needs to be different and tell them in direct, honest terms.


For example, if you want your parents to start knocking before they come into your room, then you might say something like, “In the future, would you be willing to knock on my door and wait for me to say ‘come in’ before coming into my bedroom?”

, If your parents refuse your request, try not to get upset.Your parents may just be taken aback by the request and need some time to process it. Try asking them if they would consider a compromise or if they would like a little more time to think about your request.


If your parents deny your request, try saying something like: “Okay, would it be possible for us to come to a compromise? Or do you just need some time to think it over?”

, It is normal to be annoyed with your parents, to fight with your parents, and to resent them sometimes. Keep in mind that these feelings and events do not mean that you and your parents have a bad relationship, unless you often get so angry at each other that you cannot stand to speak to one another.If you are not on speaking terms with your parents, then you may want to talk to a school counselor for help.

, If your parents often nag you to do things like take out the trash, load the dishwasher, or get the mail, beat them to the punch by doing those things as soon as possible.Over time, your parents will begin to see that you are responsible and that they do not need to nag you to do these little things. This should lead to a greater sense of freedom for you.

, Even if your parents are in the wrong, you can start the peace-making process. By taking the first step, you will be doing all that you can do to develop a better relationship with your parents and they will need to take the next step.Some other ways to take the first step include:


Inviting your parents to do something with you. Whether you ask your parents to join you for a walk or to watch a TV show with you, letting them know that you want to spend time with them is a good way to start improving the situation.
Giving sincere compliments. Everyone loves compliments, even your parents. Try paying your mom or dad a compliment. For example, you might say something like, “This meatloaf is amazing!” or “I really like that tie.”
Ask for advice. Asking your parents for advice will show that you value their input. This is a great way to start improving your relationship. Try asking for help dealing with a difficult person, completing your homework, or choosing a college.

, If your parents have wronged you in some way and it is interfering in your ability to develop a better relationship with them, then you will need to find a way to forgive them to move forward. Forgiving someone can be hard, but keep in mind that by forgiving your parents you will be helping yourself more than you will be helping them. The anger and resentment that may come with refusing to forgive someone can eat away at you.


If your parents have apologized to you about something, try responding to their apology with a statement of forgiveness. For example, you might say something like, “I have been thinking about your apology and I realize that you were sincere, so I forgive you.”
If your parents have done something that they did not or will not apologize for, then you may need to make the decision to forgive them regardless of whether or not they feel sorry. You might say something out loud to yourself such as, “For my own well-being, I do not want to hang onto this resentment any longer. I choose to forgive my parents for what they did and work towards healing our relationship.""
Keep in mind that by forgiving your parents, you are not saying that the behavior was okay. You are just choosing to let go of the negative emotions that you feel and move forward in your relationship., If you feel that you have made an error, then the best way to make peace with your parents is to offer them an apology. First, take time to think through exactly what you did wrong. Next, think about what your parents would want to hear in an apology. Then, apologize by telling your parents what you did wrong, that it was your responsibility, and recognize that it was not your parents’ fault.For example, you might say something like, “Mom/Dad, I am sorry for sneaking out of the house last night. I did not realize that it would upset you so much. I was only thinking about myself. You have every right to be angry with me.”
You may also want to tell your parents you are working to change your behavior. For example, you could add something like, “From now on, I will try to be more considerate of your feelings and I will not sneak out of the house ever again.”

, Writing a letter can be helpful for both you and your parents. It will help you calm down and identify exactly what upset you about your parents’ actions. For your parents, it will help them better understand you while also giving them distance away from you to relax as well. Do not write an angry letter; instead, tell you parents how you feel and why you are upset. Recognize that you understand why they are upset as well and that you want to work on your relationship.Make sure that you use “I” statements rather than “you” statements. For example, instead of writing ""You never let me use the car,” write ""I feel upset when I can't use the car on weekends to see my friends.""

, Honesty is important for all relationships, but it may be even more important for a good relationship between you and your parents. If you think that part of the problem you have been having with your parents is that you have not been honest with them in the past, then work to change that.For example, you might start practicing honesty by telling your parents the truth about where you will be, who you will be with, and what you will be doing when you go out.

, It is important to converse with your parents about a variety of topics, not simply just saying 'hi' or 'bye.’The more you talk with your parents, the more they may come to trust you and understand you. Trust and understanding are foundations for a good relationship.Having fun conversations with your parents can help to improve your relationship and will make your parents feel valued.


Try beginning a conversation about everyday stuff, such as what happened in school or at practice. Then, share something funny that happened at school or ask your parents what school was like for them.
Try discussing people at school, your social life, your friends, and things you like to do.
Talk about pop culture, books, current events, local happenings, or anything else that you and your parents could examine together.

, Being a good listener is essential for all relationships, but your parents may be even more sensitive to whether or not you are listening to them. To become a better listener, try to focus on what your parents have to say. If your mind begins to wander, make sure you correct this and go back to listening. It is also very important that you hold back judgment on what your parents are saying until they finish speaking.Try to use active listening strategies to show that you are listening as well. For example, when your parents are talking, you can demonstrate that you are listening by nodding your head, making neutral statements such as “yes,” “go on,” and “I see,” and occasionally repeating what your parents have just said.

, If you feel the need to talk to your parents to resolve a problem you should do so. Try to plan beforehand what you intend to say as well as what you want to accomplish from the talk. Pick a time to have the conversation and express your desire to have a serious conversation.Think about the best way to have a conversation. Is the best way to talk face to face, by phone, or by a written letter?
Make sure that you tell your parents how you feel. This will help them understand where you are coming from. For example, you might say something like, “I feel like you don’t trust me and that makes me sad.”

Recognize that while you may be in different positions and coming from different points of view, each deserves to be treated with respect.;
, Lying is a horrible thing to do. If you lie, you're only making problems bigger, and if you lie, your parents will never trust you (nor will many other people). This is a fact. If you've done something wrong, lying about it won't make matters better for anyone - including yourself - in the long-term. And it's the long-term that generates trust. Losing a parent's support just because they don't agree with character and moral standards is not allowable, hence focusing on the common ground and being honest about that is helpful.


There is an exception if you are an older individual who is responsible enough to make their own decisions and want to pursue life with what they believe is true to their individuality. However, still show respect.

, You're not the only one with opinions - your parents have opinions too, founded on years of hard won experience. Explain to your parents that you want to hear what they think of your situation or what you are going through. Always take what they say into mind.

, This almost never works, and most of the time your parents will become even more reluctant to trust you if you do this. Just admit you were wrong if you were, or admit you're too young or inexperienced if that's the case. They want to know that you understand why they're doing this, even if you don't.

, For example, if you are asked to do something by your parent, do it right away without any questions and stay on task while you do it. A wonderful example of this would be reading this article when you were asked to do your homework!

, If you believe something is right, do it. If your parents still don't seem to believe in you, prove to them that you are capable and deserving of their trust. Thinking and planning won't get anyone far; you have to get out there and show them just who you are and why they should trust you.

, Ask your mom or dad if you can help with dinner. Ask your parents if they need help with something. But don't constantly ask, or it will make you seem too nice or annoying. It's best to know what needs doing and just get on with it––trust that your help is noticed, because it will be.

, Instead of going out with your friend to the mall or a party, stay home and babysit your younger sibling or get some homework done. Be grounded, not giddy, bad-tempered, or hyper. If you're a naturally cheerful person, don't sweat. Just remember to take deep breaths to calm and center yourself. Don't tone down your personality, tone down your energy. Simply take the level of childishness down a notch and act maturely.

, If you have something to discuss with your parents, make sure that you get it out and tell them. Respect each other. Do the best you can to become friends with your parents. Do things around the house for them, and let them share their opinions with you.

, This probably seems scary, but ask them why they believe you are too young for something, or what you did wrong in the past. Don't negotiate, ask what can be done on your part in the future. For instance, if you want a later curfew than 10:00, instead of asking, ""How about 10:45? Fine, 10:30?"" say something like, ""So maybe my new curfew could be 10:45 if I start finishing my homework before dinner?""

, If your parents seem upset, ask them what's wrong. If they ask you about your day or what happened at school don't say, ""It's none of your business!"" Be honest and talk to them.

, After you feel like your parents really trust you, ask them if they can do something big like go to a party over the weekend, walk home from school, stuff like that. Don't get mad at them and storm off if they say no. Instead thank them for sharing their opinion. They might be shocked at how polite your acting and they might change their mind later. Do not be mad if they don't.

, Try not to talk back or use snide comments if your parents say something you don't particularly agree with! This may just earn you the trust you would like.

, And while nobody's perfect, one little screw up can change the way your parents view for a long time. And that view of you might get in the way of enjoying yourself or participating in activities you love or wish to join. As a result, it's important to gain back the trust you've lost from your parents.

, You can learn from it and do better next time around. After you've made your mistake, acknowledge what you did wrong and take responsibility for it. If or when your parents confront you about it, don't make excuses for why things went wrong or tell them it's not a big deal. Simply own up to it and show them that it was indeed a fault and you should have known better. Also let them know that you don't intend on ever doing it again.

, After making certain mistakes parents might start to hold back on you and probably won't let you do things that they normally would. This is where gaining their trust will come in. You want to start with small steps while trying to be on your best behavior. Show them that you are responsible by doing the dishes, not waiting for them to finish up chores around the house, taking care of your siblings, and by being mature around them.

, Once your parents notice a sudden change in your behavior from childish to mature they might start to reconsider, especially if you haven't been doing anything wrong at all since the mistake. As such, you might want to continue what you're doing, wait for the right time and then speak to them. When speaking to your parents, you might want to bring up the fact that you know you've done something wrong and you've certainly learned from it. You should also mention the progress you've been making, how you haven't gotten into any trouble, and how you've become more responsible. You want to ask them to think about giving you another chance.

, Do not rush them and do not stop behaving or taking responsibility because you don't want them to think that you were only being good for the moment so you could go out or have fun or freedom. You want them to believe that you actually learned something and truly are changing. Be patient and positive.

, Once your parents have made their final decision be sure to thank them. Don't do anything crazy, don't lie, or cross the line. Remember how hard you worked to gain their trust back. Remind yourself that it wasn't easy and there's no need to ruin it all when you've already come so far. Be proud of yourself and keep up the good work.

Change the hand-towels.,
Clean the microwave.,
Empty the crumbs from the toaster.,
Clean all the mirrors.",How to Do Quick Chores Your Parents Will Appreciate1," These tend to get dirty and dusty, and you don't really notice it until you are trying to watch a show. It's a lot easier to see the dusty and dirty spots if you turn the TV off first. You might want to wipe off remotes and game controllers, while you are at it.Remove the dust with a used dryer sheet – it will attract dust and keep it from returning to the areas you've already cleaned. If you don't have any dryer sheets, a dry paper towel works, too.
Try to remove any smudges or spots on the screen by gently rubbing with the dry cloth.
If there are spots that won't budge, use a lightly dampened paper towel or clean soft rag. Mix warm water in a bowl with a tiny squeeze of dishwashing soap.
Never use windex or other household cleaners, and resist the urge to scrape a spot with your fingernail. This will damage the screen.;
, These tend to get pretty dirty, pretty quick. This only takes a minute, and your mom or dad will certainly notice that it's clean the next time they come through the door.


Shake all the dust and dirt off the mat into the yard, or onto the sidewalk.
Take a broom, and quickly sweep the area under and around the mat.
Replace the rug.

, Ask your mom or dad if they will teach you how and when to water the plants, and then try to take care of this yourself. It only takes a couple of minutes, and your parents will appreciate not having to think about it.Always ask a parent to show you which plants to water, how often, and how much water they need. Every plant is different.
You'll need to go through the house once or twice per week and do several plants at once. If you agree to take on this task, be sure not to forget or your plants will die.

, Your house probably has little wastepaper baskets in every room – bedrooms, bathrooms, den. Carry a garbage bag with you, and empty the contents of each trashcan into the bag. Then take the bag outside to the trash can. If you do this every couple of days, your parents will definitely notice that the trashcans are always nice and clean., Hand towels often get overlooked on laundry day, and can wind up hanging in the bathroom for long periods of time. Collect all the dirty hand towels in your bathrooms, and replace them with clean ones. The room will look fresher, instantly., These can get dirty very quickly, especially when you heat something without covering it with a paper towel. Take a few paper towels and some all-purpose spray cleaner, and clean the microwave. Carefully remove the glass tray, then wipe down all inner surfaces – including the top, where splatters often collect. Then replace the glass tray, and wipe down the door and front of the machine.

, Everyone uses the toaster, and those crumbs collect pretty fast. Be sure to unplug the toaster before you mess with it. Then find the crumb collecting tray, remove it and empty it into the trash. Wipe it clean and return it to the toaster., When these are freshly cleaned, it is very noticeable. Your mom will love you for thinking to do this. It only takes a few minutes to do each, so you can run around the whole house and do them at once. All you do it wipe the glass thoroughly with a paper towel and spray glass cleaner."

Test smoke alarms.,
Dust ceiling fans.,
Shake out area rugs.,
Clean out the car.",How to Do Quick Chores Your Parents Will Appreciate2," If your home is like most, it probably has smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in the kitchen, in hallways, in the garage, and over bedroom doors. These have a little button on them that you can press, to see if the battery is still working. If it makes a loud “beep,” it should be okay; if not, you can replace the batteries with new ones.Ask your parents what type of batteries the detectors use. Usually they are AA batteries or the square 9-volt type. If they don't have spares on hand, add them to the grocery list.
Be sure your parents are okay with you doing this – it will probably involve climbing up onto a small ladder or step-stool.

, This is one of those chores that is often overlooked, until someone looks up and notices how gross the fan blades are. Your parents are sure to appreciate it if you offer to take care of this for them.Check every room for a ceiling fan – if you're going to do them, you might as well do them all at once.
The quickest, cleanest way is to use an old pillowcase (be sure to ask your mom to find one she doesn't use anymore...this may stain the pillowcase.)
Put the entire blade into one end of the pillowcase, then rub the dust off the top of the blade so that all the dirt falls into the pillowcase.
When you're done, take the pillowcase outside and turn it inside out to empty it...then toss it in the wash.

, Even with regular vacuuming, area rugs can gather dust, pet hair, and funky smells. This chore can actually be kind of fun, and you can let off a little steam after being cooped up all winter. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so.Ask your mom or dad which rugs you can clean. Some rugs, like vintage or Persian rugs, are delicate and have to be sent off for professional cleaning.
Take the rugs outside. If possible, take them all out at once – you won't want to walk over your freshly cleaned rugs while carrying a dirty one.
Shake off all the loose dust and dirt.
Hang the rug over a fence or railing, or hang a clothesline between two trees or light posts and throw it over that.
Beat the rug with something solid and flat, which will release the dust. Keep going until the rug stops making little poofs of dust when you hit it. Make sure your rug-beater doesn't have any sharp edges that might pull or tear the rug. A broom is good, or a cricket bat.
Return the freshened rug to its room, and get the next one.

, Cars can get messy fast, especially if they are being used by the entire family. If you have a younger sister or brother, you've probably noticed how messy babies and toddlers can be. Your parents may be too busy to deal with this one themselves on a regular basis, but they will definitely be grateful to you if you do it for them. You'll need garbage bags, Spray glass cleaner, Amor-all wipes or cleaning wipes, Q-Tips, paper towels, and a box or milk crate.Throw away anything that is obviously garbage: empty food wrappers, crumpled-up paper, soda bottles, and things like that. (Look at the crumpled papers before throwing them away. If it's something from work, or a store receipt, your mom or dad may want to keep it.) Put everything else from the car into the box.
Wipe the dashboard, center console, steering wheel, door panels, gearshift, and seats with the cleaning wipes. Dampen the end of a Q-Tip in cleaner, and use it to reach into all the dusty cracks, edges, and air-conditioner vents and cup-holders. Clean the windows with glass cleaner.
Pull up the rubber floor mats, wipe them clean, and vacuum the seats and floorboards.
Return the floor mats and anything else to the car that you know needs to be there – sunglasses, phone chargers, etc. Take the box of random things inside to your mom or dad.

Cook them dinner.,
Put together a photo album.,
Wash their car.,
Make them a playlist.",How to Do Quick Chores Your Parents Will Appreciate3," If you are old enough to cook dinner, google “easy meals for kids to make” and find a few simple recipes. Try making your own pizza on French bread or store-bought pizza dough, or putting together a deluxe chef salad or loaded tacos or burritos. Set the table for them, then pretend you are a waiter at a fancy restaurant and bring them their plates.Resist the temptation to use the fancy dishes – the last thing you want is to break one. Chefs usually agree that food looks best on simple, white plates anyway!
Candles can make an evening meal seem special – set them up on the table, then wait to let your parents light them. Besides the safety issue, burning candles are also a dead giveaway if you're trying to make the dinner a surprise.

, Print out some of your parent's favorite photos, and arrange them in a photo album or scrapbook. This makes a lovely gift that anyone would appreciate – and it also takes care of a big chore your mom or dad has probably been putting off doing for themselves: taking care of that box of old photos.Theme books are a great idea. Try making a book that chronicles your family vacations, or one that has photos from each of your birthdays.
If you have a little money saved up, services like Shutterfly or Mosaic will take your digital photos and turn them into a professionally printed hardbound book that your parents can display on the coffee table. If you keep photos on instagram, they have their own service, Social Print Studio (formerly Printstagram), which is very affordable., Washing the car by hand is better for the paint than taking it through a carwash, and this will keep them from having to do it themselves. Mom or Dad is sure to be grateful if you give their car a little love. You'll need a bucket full of soapy water, spray glass cleaner, sponges, and clean, soft rags for drying. If your parents keep soap and materials in the car specifically for washing the car, use those.


For soap, mix three long squirts of dishwashing soap into a bucket of warm water. Use a large sponge or soft, clean rags to apply the soapy water to all outside surfaces of the car. Wipe the car until it looks clean.
Rinse the soapy water off the car with the garden hose. If you don't have a hose, you can dump clean water over the paint until the soap foam is completely gone.
Always dry the car gently after washing with a chamois cloth or soft terrycloth rags. Letting a car air-dry will leave streaks, and the moisture can pick up road debris that can scratch the paint.

, If you know what music your mom or dad likes, this will be easy. If not, you may need to do a little research. Your parent will be grateful to have this on your next long roadtrip, or just for something to listen to while commuting to and from work.Look up what songs were popular when your parents were teenagers. See if you can find a few that you like, too. If not, look for names your mom or dad may have mentioned, or albums they have in their collection.
You could also try making a playlist of music that you like, that you think they might like as well. You never know – your parents might be cooler than you give them credit for. And having bands that you like in common means you can listen to music together sometimes.

A simple ""thank you"" goes a long way.Let your parents know when they gave you good advice. It will make them feel so good to hear ""You were right"" or ""I was wrong"" every now and then.;
, Nobody is perfect all the time. If you did something that upset your parents or said something you didn't mean, let them know you're sorry.It's never too late to say you're sorry!

, Your parents want to feel involved in your life, so set some time aside to talk to them every day if you can. Ask them how their days were and tell them about yours. Discuss any problems you have and ask them for advice.Try not to do this when they are in the middle of something. Dinnertime is ideal for family conversations.
If you don't live with your parents, call them regularly. Visits are always appreciated too!, It's inevitable that you will disagree with your parents about some things, but try to be mature about it and understand where they are coming from. Even if you think they're wrong, don't start an argument.Keep in mind that your parents have a lot more life experience than you do.
Take a moment to consider if your parents' religious beliefs, cultural background, or upbringing may have something to do with their opinions. Be understanding of this even if you do not share the same values.
If you don't understand why your parents disagree with you about something, ask them to explain their thoughts.

, Your parents probably miss the days when you were a little kid and used to give them hugs all the time. Show them you still love them by giving them a big hug every now and again.Telling them you love them will make the hug even better.

, If you have a list of chores that you're expected to complete on a regular basis, make sure you do them. Don't start an argument with your parents over your chores every single week. If you really want to be helpful, do them without being asked.


If you think you have a ton of chores, try reminding yourself of all the chores your parents have! You'll probably realize that your share is relatively small.

, Along with your regular chores, you should make a conscious effort to reduce the amount of household work your parents have to do. This means not making a mess whenever you can avoid it, and cleaning up your mess whenever you do make one.


Wash your dirty dishes or put them in the dishwasher.
Take off your shoes so you don't track mud in the house.
Put your dirty laundry in the hamper instead of throwing it on the floor.
Clean up spills right away.

, Parents have a ton of responsibilities, and that can cause a lot of stress. If you notice that they seem especially overwhelmed, ask them what you can do to take a little bit of work off their shoulders.Pitching in may mean offering to do some extra chores, like doing the laundry or mowing the lawn.
You can also help your parents relax by offering to give them a massage.
In some cases, the best thing you can do is just give your parents some space when they are stressed.

, Every once in a while, it's nice to show your parents you care by doing a chore around the house that they never expected you to do. Consider cleaning up the house for them while they're out.
Another great surprise would be to have dinner waiting for them one night (as long as you clean up the mess as well).

, If your parents are stressed about money, it will be a real help to them if you learn to be fiscally responsible. If you have a job, consider offering to contribute money towards household expenses. If you don't have a job, try to be cautious about spending money unnecessarily., If there's a special occasion coming up, consider planning a surprise party for your parents. It doesn't have to be elaborate: just invite friends and family over, have some food ready, and prepare some simple decorations.Even if you don't plan a party, make a point out of always remembering your parents' birthdays and anniversary., Whether it's your mom's birthday or you just feel like doing something nice for your parents for no reason, a thoughtful gift is always appreciated. If you choose to buy something, you don't have to spend a lot of money! Remember, it's the thought that counts.Make sure the gift is something your parents will enjoy. If your parents love the movies, for example, you could buy them tickets. If your dad is a big sports fan, you could get him a T-shirt or hat that displays the logo of his favorite team.
If you want to do something crafty, try making a list of nice adjectives that describe your parents (nice, helpful, loving, thoughtful, etc.) Then incorporate these words into your gift.You could paint them on a picture frame or write them out on homemade cookies with icing, for example.
Don't underestimate the power of a homemade card!
Parents love gifts that incorporate family memories. Consider making a scrapbook or creating a slideshow using old family photos.

, A really simple way to surprise your parents and make them smile is to leave them an unexpected note that lets them know you appreciate them. Try putting the note on their pillows before bed or tucking them into their lunch bags so they will find them at work.


If you want to be even nicer, leave them a homemade treat with the note.

, Your parents value the time you spend together, so show them you do too! Take the initiative to plan an outing for you and your parents. There are lots of fun and inexpensive things you can do close to home. Go to the beach
Have a picnic at the park
Visit the zoo or aquarium
Go to a museum
Go shopping together
See a movie or show

It can hurt to feel taken for granted, even for parents.
Show your appreciation with your actions. Get them a nice gift or, if you live with your parents, do some extra housework without being asked. They will likely be happy with you for this.

This is not to say that you should not care for and love your parents. But, if you are less emotionally attached to your parents, you may be less invested in arguments or disagreements with them. This way you can walk away from a situation more easily and not let it damage the relationship. You can separate yourself emotionally from your parents in two primary ways. Focus less on seeking their approval. Be willing to define yourself and your self-worth through your own eyes.
Acknowledge your past, then move on. Your relationship with your parents may have been rough before. Remember this and assess the role you have played in your relationship with your parents, but do not let it define your relationship going forward.,

Often, people do not get along because they fail to consider others’ perspectives. Once you can empathize with another’s position and see the reasons behind it, you will likely be more willing to compromise and improve the relationship.Accept that your parents are different. They grew up in a different generation with different social norms and rules of conduct, with different technologies and ways of thinking, with parents who treated them certain ways, that was probably much different that the ways of parenting today.Think about the ways that their lives may have been different from your life, and how these different histories may be contributing to issues in the relationship.
Try using this information when you talk about improving your relationship with them. Remind them that times change and ask them to think about their relationship with their own parents. See if they can recall any issues in their relationship with their parents that were due to these 'generational' differences.
For example, if your relationship with your parents is rocky because they disapprove of you moving in with your significant other before marriage, try reminding them that in their generation people were even more conservative still, and that times change and it is in fact quite common to move in with a significant other without being married.,

It is OK and even healthy for you to think for yourself and to have your own opinion on matters.In gaining a new found sense of autonomy and separation from your parents, you may find that your relationship improves organically.

Engage in self-discovery. Hold aside what everyone else thinks about you and how you should live your life, including your parents, and ask yourself some serious questions about yourself. Be sure to honestly answer questions such as ""what feelings do I want to feel most?"" or ""what do I want to spend more of my time on?"" or ""what are my talents?"" or ""what kind of person am I?"" Consider whether you are going along with your parents' opinion because you also believe it or because your automatic inclination is to think what they do about something (such as about your relationships, politics or even simple things like your favorite sports team, for example).

,

If you continue to see them as your parents, you may unthinkingly behave in a way that is child-like and promotes a relationship dynamic that you are trying to improve.

For example, if you continue to expect them to support you financially, you may be leaving the door open for your parents to give you too much unwanted advice or guilt you into spending time with them."
"
Figure out the underlying cause.,
Be respectful.,
Don't let things fester.,
Keep calm.,
Be positive.,
Don't ask for their advice unless you really want it.,
Be open and honest.,
Establish boundaries and make rules.,
Avoid unnecessary arguments.,
Keep interactions mature.",How to Develop a Better Relationship With Your Parents2,"

Assess what in particular is troubling you about your relationship with your parents. There are several reasons you may want to improve your relationship.

You may feel that you parents give too much unwanted advice, treat you like a kid, do not respect your opinions, guilt you into spending time with them, or disrespect your friends or spouse. Be sure to have a good sense of the particular aspect of your relationship that you want to improve.,

Even if you do not agree with their parenting style, values or principles, be courteous to your parents; in doing so you will be less likely to put them into a defensive parenting mode. There are a number of ways in which you can be respectful. Try using polite language (such as ""sorry"" or ""would you mind if""), speaking modestly (""it may be"" instead of ""it definitely is""), and letting them finish speaking before you take your turn.

,

If you have a fight with your parents, do everything you can to repair the relationship sooner rather than later. This will show that you care about the relationship. It will also mean you will have been fighting for less time total.,

Don’t overreact when talking to your parents, you may end up saying things you regret, which will only damage your relationship further and make you seem immature.When you are interacting with your parents and you feel a wave of strong emotion coming on, re-assess the situation that led to your strong feelings by asking yourself some questions. For example, if you are in a disagreement with your parents about mowing the lawn you might ask: ""In the grand scheme of things, how bad will it really be to mow the lawn?""
Or, if you don't live with your parents but they are overly involved, asking you detailed questions about your job and giving unwanted advice, you might ask: ""What is their motivation for wanting to be so involved? Is it that they care about me and are worried about my financial security?"" Asking yourself questions like this may lead you to feel less upset and it may give you insight into how you should respond to your parents. In this case, you may try to improve your relationship by easing their worries about your financial future.
If re-assessing your situation doesn't work to reduce how emotional you feel, try asking politely whether you can continue the discussion once you have cooled your jets. Explain that you are feeling really upset and don’t want to accidently say something rude or regretful.,

Smile at your parents. Stay positive and warm. Let them know with your body language that you are happy to see them and that you care about their well-being. This will set the tone for your communication and will help to improve the relationship. Without thinking, your parents may even mimic your positive emotions. This emotional mimicry will aid in setting a mood that will foster positive relationship change. ,

Sometimes problems arise in relationships between parents and children, particularly at the teenage years and beyond, because parents can try to give advice in an overpowering way that infringes on your sense of autonomy.To get around this, try only asking for their advice when you are sure that you really want it. If you are just feeling lazy to think about things on your own, and so you ask your parents, you may be opening the door to frustration on your part.

,

One way to improve your relationship dynamic is to be more willing to talk to your parents about things that you may feel are uncomfortable. This will help to build trust in your relationship with your parents, which will improve your relationship with them. Keep in regular contact so your parents can get a better perspective on your life, what upsets you, and what makes you happy. If they do not know you that well, it will be difficult for them to try to improve the relationship. If you listen to your parents they will be more likely to listen to you, opening the door for you to try discussing improving the relationship.,

If you want to maintain a positive relationship with parents, but find that you always end up disagreeing, consider setting up some topics as off-limits. This may work better if you are older or no longer live with your parents. Also try creating rules that both you and your parents agree to abide by. Sit down with your parents and tell them you want to improve your relationship with them, but that in order to do so, you think it would be helpful if there were some rules. Ask that they make a list of the rules they would like implemented, and you do the same.
If you are a teenager or child, rules can include not bringing up certain topics, giving you a chance to try things on your own, or letting you stay out later at night as long as you check in by text or call and can prove that you are being responsible.
If you are an adult, rules can include asking your parents not to interfere with the way you are choosing to parent your own children, or asking your parents not to comment negatively about your significant other.
Discuss the different rules, and narrow them down to a list that you all agree on. Check in occasionally to see whether you and your parents are still happy in following the rules that you have agreed on.

,

Sometimes arguments are unavoidable, but do your best to refrain from unnecessary squabbles. This may mean that you have to bite your tongue when one of your parents says something controversial. Determine whether the need to respond is really necessary. If it is, make the point clearly and modestly in order to avoid an overly emotional argument.,

Be fair and logical about issues and demonstrate to your parents that you are mature, and they will likely reciprocate by acting mature themselves. Oftentimes if parents see you acting mature, they will treat you accordingly."

Show that you're not a slacker by taking the most challenging classes you can handle.
Develop good study habits and do all your homework without any reminders from your parents. Try using a planner to keep track of when you have tests and when projects are due so you will never have to cram at the last minute.;
, Helping your parents out around the house will make their lives easier and it will help them see you as more of an adult.


If your parents usually wake you up in the mornings, you can show them that you're becoming more responsible by starting to use an alarm clock.Try cleaning your room without being asked. If you have chores that you're supposed to do on a regular basis, do them without any reminders. You can set reminders on your phone or post a calendar in your room to help you remember when you need to do your chores.If you make a mess, always clean up after yourself.

, If you start working, you will show your parents that you are responsible enough to maintain your own schedule, follow directions, and manage money. If you're an older teen, try looking for a part-time job at a restaurant or grocery store. If you're younger, you may want to consider helping neighbors with household tasks, like raking leaves, cutting the lawn, and shoveling snow.Show your parents that you are financially responsible by saving a portion of your income.
Offer to use some of your new income to contribute to expenses, such as your cell phone bill or your car insurance. This can be especially helpful if you are trying to show your parents that you are responsible enough to get a phone or start driving.

, Show your parents that you don't need as much help taking care of yourself as you used to by learning how to do things like go grocery shopping, cook your own dinner, or do your own laundry.If you don't know how to do something, ask your parents to show you. They can teach you how to use everyday machines like the washing machine or lawn mower, or even teach you more specialized household skills, like how to paint a room or how to unclog a drain.
If you want to start driving, ask your parents to show you skills you will need to know on the road, like how to change a flat tire or how to add extra oil or windshield washer fluid to the car.
Offer to help your parents out with these kinds of tasks, especially if they seem overwhelmed.

, If you want your parents to trust you, you will have to make sure that you always follow through on all of your promises. If you say that you will clean your room by Friday, make sure it gets done! Be careful about making promises that you can't keep.


If you use a planner for school, try adding in other obligations as well to help you better manage your time.Being punctual is also extremely important. If you do everything you say you will do, but you're always late or you aren't able to stick to deadlines, you won't seem very responsible., Nobody expects you to be perfect, but do your best to make the right decisions and avoid socializing with people who will get you into trouble.


If you make a mistake, own up to it and tell your parents what you've learned from the experience.
Instead of hiding things from them, be open and honest with your parents about the struggles that you face as a tween or teen. Tell them about times when you did the right thing, even though it was a hard decision.
If you need advice on how to deal with issues like bullying at your school or drugs and alcohol, it's often good to ask your parents. If you don't feel comfortable discussing these kinds of issues with them, find another trusted adult, like a teacher, coach, or another relative.

, If your goal is to convince your parents that you are responsible so that they will let you do something, like start dating, or let you get something, like a cell phone or a pet, read up on the topic so you will be able to prepare a good argument.If there is a cost associated with the thing you want, make sure you know exactly how much it is and where you can get the best deal.
If you want a pet, make a detailed list of all of the tasks that will need to be done to take care of it, and indicate who will do each of the tasks and when.
Try to anticipate some of the objections your parents might have, and prepare responses accordingly. For example, if you think your parents will be worried that you will be in danger if you go to the mall with your friends, look into what kind of security the mall has.

, Tell your parents exactly what you would like and why you think you deserve the new privilege. Come prepared with all of your research and try offering examples of how you have been responsible in similar situations in the past.


Make sure your parents have time to talk when you approach them. Try saying something like, ""I would like to talk to you about something important. Is now a good time?""
Once you have their full attention, let your parents know exactly what it is you are asking for and what you are willing to do to earn the privilege. Try saying something like, ""I think I am old enough and responsible enough to start going out with my friends alone. I promise to be very careful and always be home before my curfew.""
If you have had this discussion with your parents before, try to start the conversation by acknowledging the objections they have had in the past and explaining what has changed. For example, you can say, ""I know that you did not want to buy me a phone last month, but I have been working hard to save some money to help pay for it and I am willing to agree to whatever rules you impose.""
Find out what your parents' concerns are and try negotiating by creating a set of rules by which you will abide. For example, if you are asking your parents for a phone, you may have to agree to let them read your text messages. If you are asking for driving privileges, you may have to agree to a curfew.Be willing to offer something in return. This can involve contributing money towards the purchase of something you want or offering to do extra chores around the house in exchange for a new privilege.

, If your parents don't want to grant you the new privilege, try asking for something that they might feel more comfortable with first. For example, if your parents don't feel comfortable leaving you alone without a babysitter for the weekend, try asking them if you can stay at home alone for an afternoon.


Be extra vigilant about following all of your parents' rules and living up to all your promises if your parents agree to a slightly lesser privilege. It may take you a little while to earn their trust, but if you can demonstrate that you are consistently acting responsibly whenever you are given a new privilege, you're more likely to get what you really want eventually.

, Continue taking on more responsibilities around the house and at school to show your parents that you are not just pretending to be responsible so they will give you what you want.


Bring the topic up every so often, but don't harass your parents about the privilege you want because they will probably get annoyed and not want to discuss it.
If you finally do get what you want, you need to continue to be just as responsible, or even more responsible, than you were before. If you betray your parents' trust, you will probably lose the privilege and have a much harder time convincing them that you are responsible in the future.

Get in the shower.,
Get your hands dirty.,
Act like you’re sick.,
Pretend your friend needs you.,
Make up an important homework assignment.",How to Wriggle Out of Boring Chores1," Jump in the shower when you think your parents are about to ask you to take care of a chore. It should buy you 15 to 20 minutes, and you can continue to stall while you dry off and get dressed if you need to. Chores need to get done before everyone goes to bed, and your parents may just get frustrated and do it themselves if you take too long.;
, If you know a chore is coming, do something that will keep you from using your hands for a while. Make sure your hands get covered in something that’s really tough to get off. Digging around the yard will make your hands look dirty, but all the mud will come off with a minute or two of handwashing. Things like paint, shoe polish, and grease are all tough to clean off and will work great for this purpose.


Can’t think of any good ways to get your hands messy? Take off your old nail polish and repaint your fingernails. Decide it’s a good time to really give your bike a deep cleaning. Paint something like a birdhouse or your cell phone case with a lot of different colors. These will all make your hands too dirty for chores for a while.

, Your parents won’t ask you to wash the dishes if they think you might make them sick by touching them. You have to be really convincing though. Have a plausible excuse for why you don’t feel well, like eating something that made you feel weird afterwards. Make it seem like you are genuinely uncomfortable by sitting quietly and not doing too much.


Your parents know you better than anyone, so it may be tough to fool them. Make sure not to make classic mistakes like having a coughing fit one second then talking with your friend on the phone for half an hour. Keep your story straight and don’t change the symptoms you supposedly have. Whatever you do, make sure it doesn’t seem like you’re having fun., Friends depend on each other, something parents understand just as well as you do. If you know a chore you hate doing is on the way, text your friend and ask them to call you about something they’re upset about. Your parents will understand and allow you to console your friend instead of doing the chore. Make sure you call someone who is a good actor so your parents don’t get suspicious when they don’t sound upset.


Don’t worry if neither of you can come up with something that your friend might need your help with. Pretend they got in a fight with one of their good friends or are having relationship problems. These are all common issues that everyone faces, and your parents will leave you alone to deal with it.

, Your parents want you to do well in school, so they’ll let you off the hook if they think you have an important assignment to do. Have a plan for which teacher supposedly assigned it as well as a general outline of what the assignment is. You don’t have to have a whole lesson plan in your head, just a few details in case your parents ask questions.


Don’t volunteer information unless your parents ask for it. You probably don’t ramble on about the assignments you actually have to do. Make it seem like just another thing you have to get through to pass the class.
Don’t say you’re going to work on an essay and start playing video games. You’re going to at least make it look like you’re working. Open up a text document and a few web pages for research. Type a little bit, or just copy and paste some sections if you’re really feeling lazy. You don’t have to stare at this the whole time, but make sure it looks like you’re working when your parents are nearby.

Make it clear you are having a bad time.,
Make a mess of the job.,
Don’t finish the job.",How to Wriggle Out of Boring Chores2," If your parents make you go to an event or store that you don’t want to go to, make sure it’s obvious that you aren’t having a good time. Don’t make an effort to talk to anyone or add to conversations if someone is talking to you. Make sure you don’t smile, as this cues you’re enjoying yourself and will encourage people to talk to you., Making a mess of whatever your parents ask you to do will make it less likely they ask you again the next time. If you make a mess that takes more time to clean up than it would have for your parents to have just done the chore themselves, they probably won’t ask you to do it again the next time it comes up.


Aren’t sure what chores are good for this? If you have to wash the dishes, splash water all over the place and don’t bother wiping it up. Leave food scraps in the sink. Knock over the recycling bin when you take it out and “forget” to put all the bottles and cans back inside.

, For some chores, not finishing the job is just as bad as not doing it at all. Someone, most likely your parents, will have to do all the work you did over as well as the last step you didn’t finish. If this is something that happens consistently, your parents will think twice before asking you to do it again.


This won’t work for every chore. Raking the leaves is a good one to try this with. “Forget” to put them in the bag and eventually the wind will blow them back all over the yard. Your parents will probably just sigh and go fix it themselves. Clearing the table is another chore this might work for.

Listen to music while you do the chore.,
Reward yourself when the chore is over.,
Take short breaks.,
Do other chores.",How to Wriggle Out of Boring Chores3," Music can make boring and repetitive tasks seen a little less dull. Aside from making the task a bit more fun, researchers have shown that listening to music while you work can actually help you work more efficiently, helping you get the job done faster. This is because music blocks out other distractions and helps put you in a positive mood, something that’s ideal for productivity. If you aren’t a huge music fan, try listening to a podcast. There are all kinds of podcasts out there that cater to pretty much any interest you could possibly have, whether you want to learn about history, design, science, or just need to laugh a little. You can search for them on the iTunes store or just find them online through a search engine.

, Having something to look forward to at the end will make the chore go by much more quickly. Pick it out yourself so you know it’s something that will make you happy. Resist the temptation to leave the job half-finished and only indulge once you’ve completed the chore entirely.


If you don’t already receive one, consider asking your parents for an allowance in exchange for doing chores. Knowing that you’ll receive money once you complete them will make you dread chores much less. Chose a modest amount and agree that you’ll only receive it if you do all your chores.

, If you regularly find yourself feeling bored to death while you’re doing chores, you may need to take a few more breaks. Do the chore for about half an hour then take a five-minute break. Make sure you’re focused while you work, but do whatever you want on while you’re resting. Just make sure you quickly get back to work once it’s over. Repeat this process until you’ve finished the chore.

, There’s always something that needs to be done around the house. If there’s a chore that bores you to death to do, make yourself busy by doing something else. Your parents will appreciate your contribution towards maintaining the house and probably won’t make you do whatever they originally wanted you to.


Not all chores are created equal. Taking the dog to the park is nice, but it’s not really the same as taking out the trash. Cleaning the living room instead of the kitchen is a little more equal. Make sure whatever you do instead of the chore you hate actually helps out the household and isn’t just something fun and vaguely useful.

Choose your words wisely.,
Do not curse in front of your friends’ parents.,

Apologize if a teacher overhears you.,
Practice being polite to school administrators.,
Make sure your friends are OK with cursing.,
Ask your friends to keep a secret.,
Don’t get too used to cursing with your friends.",How to Use Bad Language Without Getting in Trouble," Sometimes, parents are more likely to allow certain words to be said than others. Having a serious conversation and setting ground rules for saying bad words could make your parents trust you more in the future. ""Since communication is a two-way street, the way you talk can influence how well a parent listens and understands you.""You might want to say something in a polite tone, such as, ""I feel like I'm getting old enough to say certain things I wasn't allowed to say before. I want to run this idea by you and see if you think there might be certain words I can say now that are less offensive than others.""
Remember that your parents may still reject your request for permission to use bad language. ""But gracefully accepting a no can help you get more yeses in the future."";
, If you swear at home, you’re giving everyone in your home the capability of hearing you. Make sure your parents are several rooms away before uttering a bad word.


Also consider avoiding cursing in front of younger siblings, as they may try to mimic you in front of their parents. ""Older siblings are more influential."", ""As culture changes, so does what is taboo.""The word ""taboo"" just means something that is prohibited. Basically, some curse words are more accepted than others. It’s best if you determine a list of curse words that you find acceptable and won’t accidentally offend someone. Practice using those words, and avoiding the more offensive ones.

, Even if you’re not at home, other parents and adults can relay what you said back to your parents. You might think you are safe from being grounded, but your parents can find things out without you ever knowing.

, Remember, teachers are adults. Cursing in front of your teacher can result in being sent to the principal’s office. Each teacher is different and some might not resort to the harshest punishment, but it’s best to play it safe and just avoid cursing at all during class.


Try to keep in mind that other students have different rules in their homes, and might be allowed to use bad language. When this spills over into the classroom, it may seem like it's okay to curse, but you should keep in mind: ""You can hear it but you shouldn't use it."", It’s easier to get away with being overheard if there’s a lot going on. Unless a school official is standing right next to you, it’s less likely you’ll be punished for cursing if there’s a lot of people in the hall that need to be monitored and watched over until the next class begins.


Some teachers admit to being more lenient about cursing in the halls. ""Whether in the hall or classroom, when I hear an offensive word, I just call out to the individual(s), ""Language please,"" in a polite tone and normally the immediate response from kids is ""Oops, sorry!"", Sometimes, it just feels natural to let out a curse word if you drop a book or your backpack rips open. In these cases, if a teacher happens to overhear you and starts glaring at you, it’s best to just be sincere and apologize for the outburst. A teacher will likely let it slide if they don’t hear you cursing often.


If a teacher happens to overhear you, it's best to look them in the eyes apologetically and say something like, ""I'm very sorry I said that, it was completely out of frustration. I won't let it happen again.""

, It’s easier to avoid using bad language around important people if you practice your manners. Make sure there’s a difference between how you speak with your friends and how you speak around school administrators. The most important people to speak politely with include:


the Principal
the Vice Principal
Board of Education Members
Secretaries
School Nurses
Teachers
Coaches
Student Teachers

, Some friends aren’t comfortable with bad language, and may become offended even when you’re not trying to insult them. Every parent has a different approach on growth and learning, so some people might be more welcoming of bad language, while others are put off by it. The last thing you want is to lose a friend based on the words you speak.

, If a friend can’t keep a secret, then it’s not worth swearing around them. Also, it’s best to curse around friends who are also trying to get away with it. Being around friends who curse freely and openly make adults think you might be cursing when they’re not around, too.


An added bonus to keeping secrets is a stronger bond with your friends. ""Being able to keep a confidence builds people’s confidence in you, allowing the kinds of conversations that deepen a relationship."", Sometimes, you get too comfortable swearing with the people you trust. If this happens, you could end up accidentally cursing around your family. This is a quick and easy way to get yourself into trouble.

Find common ground.,
Get to know him.,
Focus on the positive.,
Make an effort.",How to Connect With Your Father1," If you're trying to connect with your father, engage him in activities or topics in which you share common interest. These don't have to be life-changing moments. Most people report feeling more comfortable when spending time with people who share their interests and perspectives.If you disagree on politics or religion, expecting to connect on these issues would be a waste of time.
Reminding your dad of things you used to do together when you were a child can be one way of finding common ground.;
, Just because he's your father, don't expect that you know everything about him. Try asking him some questions you might ask any new friend, like ""What were your parents like?"" or ""What kind of experience did you have in grade school? Who was your best friend?""You may find that your father is more interested in talking about himself than he is in talking about you. For many adult children, this can be a change from what they remember their parents being like when they were younger. It might take some getting used to.
Doing things together may prompt more questions. For example, if you're at a baseball game, you might ask him about the first time he ever went to a game, who he was with, who was playing, etc.
When you're not sure where to begin, ask open-ended questions to start conversations. Questions such as ""What would your perfect day be like?"" or ""What are a few things you and your brother always had in common?"" might result in interesting new information.

, Whenever you're tempted to get defensive or irritated at your father, think about what you like about him. Even though he tells terrible jokes, you might appreciate that he always tries to put others at ease. Maybe he's kind, or patient. Keep your attention on these attributes, and you'll be more likely to connect.Staying focused on your dad's positive traits doesn't mean that his negative traits didn't exist. For example, he may have been aloof and distant when you were a child, but this taught you to be self-motivated and independent. You might now appreciate the way he allowed you to make your own mistakes and learn from them.
If you find yourself unable to think of any positive traits, take a break. Walk away, and spend some time collecting your thoughts. Everyone has positive traits. Your connection with your dad won't happen until you can identify some of his.

, Many times, connecting with someone is just a matter of spending time together. Setting aside time to visit your father, whether it's weekly or monthly, will go a long way towards helping you connect.This is particularly true if your father has developed age-related infirmities. Simply spending time sharing your life through stories and pictures can help your dad connect with your life now.
Even if you don't talk much together, your presence itself can generate a kind of connection. One way of visiting is just to sit quietly together. If you allow silence to be comfortable, it will be.

Prepare your room.,
Move slowly.,
Close the doors.,
Control the volume.,
Prepare food beforehand.,
Don't try to start cooking popcorn in the middle of the night, or you might as well wake up your parents yourself.,
Keep the noise down to a low shout.,
Consider using headphones.,
Use the computer.,
Be prepared to run.,
Have an escape plan.,Always remember that if you are doing all these things you need to keep the light off for safety reasons and so you can jump into bed quicker.",How to Stay Up Late Without Waking Your Parents," You probably won't be staying up the whole night, so prepare your bedroom for when you come back in. It isn't a good idea to go back into your bedroom knocking things over and slamming doors. So make sure that your bed is already made, you have already brushed your teeth and have pajamas on so you don't have to do all that when you come back in. Make sure that you aren't wearing shoes because they will squeak when you walk.


If you run out of room, hide it in another room nearby, so that you can just go into that room and get it. Hide things such as laptops, DS's, phones, drinks, food, etc. in this room that you'd like to use during that night.;
, If you are getting out of bed to go to the TV room, walk very slowly. After all, what's 5 minutes of slow motion walking compared to a whole night of fun?

, Make sure all doors in between the room you are in and the room your parents are in are closed. All of them. This will stop them hearing the TV and seeing all the light that is generated when watching TV.

, Keep the volume remote in your hand at all times. After all, if you were watching a quiet TV show then suddenly a bomb goes off on the show and makes enough volume to blow the roof off the house, your parents are going to wake up. If you know that something loud is about to happen on the show, turn down the volume.


Even better, just use subtitles.

, If you are planning to have popcorn and drinks while you are staying up, make sure that they are ready to eat.

, Keep all prepared food in containers or in glasses hidden somewhere, so you don't have to make noise.

, If you are staying up with someone else, whisper when you are talking. Don't knock chairs over, drop the remote or try to break the sound barrier. Otherwise your parents will definitely wake up.

, This way nobody but you will be able to hear what you are watching. On the downside though, you won't be able to hear if someone else gets up. A solution to this could be to use one ear to listen in on your headphones and have your other ear open to listen out for your parents.

, The reason is that this doesn't create volume, normally doesn't need sound and you can watch TV shows on it anyway. Try going on the Internet and editing wikiHow. Also, you can plug headphones or ear buds into the computer or close the sound of your computer

, Have the remote with the off button in your hand. Keep your food in a place where it can't be seen. Don't leave stuff lying around. You should be able to push a button then leave and nobody should know you were there.

, Sometime in the not too distant future your parents will get up for a drink of water or something. Make sure you are listening carefully and if you hear someone getting up, turn off the TV immediately. Normally there will be a way back into your bedroom, like through a window, that won't involve you running into your parents. Watch out when climbing through windows. Your parents could assume you were doing something worse.


Getting in trouble for being up late isn't as bad as for sneaking out. As soon as you hear them, turn off the TV and get back into bed immediately. Alternatively, you could run over to the kitchen and say that you were getting a glass of water.

Check your motives.,
Reach out to your dad.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Consider asking your father about his choices.,
Don't blame him for what's past.,
Stop taking his actions personally.,
Realize that nobody's perfect.,
Make a decision to forgive.",How to Connect With Your Father2," If your connection with your father is damaged from the past, you may not be sure if connection is something you really want. Ask yourself: how did my father's actions impact my life? Allow yourself to see both the good and the negative effect he's had upon your life.

Allowing yourself to acknowledge that past actions were not okay is part of the process of forgiveness.
Deciding to connect doesn't mean excusing your dad's past behavior. But if you've decided to try to connect, you'll need to find a way to be willing to forgive him for things that hurt you in the past.

, Picking up the phone may be scary, but it's necessary. If you really are serious about connecting with your dad, you'll have to let him know. Say something very simple to break the ice. A simple explanation is the best. For example, ""Hi Dad. It's Paul. I was thinking about you and would like to get together sometime. Look forward to hearing back from you.""If you don't hear back within the week, try again.
If the phone is too difficult, send him an email.
Include your contact information on everything you send, so that he'll be able to respond.

, Rather than criticize your dad for what he's done to hurt you, stick to your experiences. For example, instead of saying ""You always came home drunk,"" say what you felt: ""I grew up feeling confused about what to expect.""By using ""I"" statements, you're avoiding arguing. Your dad can't argue with how you felt.
You're including his behavior in order to share more about your own feelings. For instance, ""I used to feel embarrassed to bring my friends over to play,"" sticks to your own experience, while, ""You never had a job and were always hanging around harassing me,"" might make him defensive.

, If your father did things or made choices that hurt you as a child, you might wonder why he did these things. Perhaps you've made up reasons to explain his actions, but you might be unaware of his real motives. Maybe there were circumstances that you didn't know about as a child that he can share with you now.Examples of questions that you might use include ""Can you tell me why you took that job working for the airlines when I was a child?"" or ""I'd like to understand more about your relationship with your new wife. How did you meet?""
Be careful to keep yourself from asking in a blaming way.
Be open to hearing what he has to say.

, Statements like ""You always did this to me..."" are provocative and antagonistic: they start fights, not connections. After all, there's nothing he can do to change the past now. Start with the people you are now. If there are lingering feelings from the past, they are yours to work on.If your parents mistreated, abused or neglected you in the past, it wasn't your fault. You can seek help for your wounds in therapy, counseling, or support groups. Your father can't change what's in the past.
The patterns of blaming can be surprisingly deep. If you find yourself getting angry, defensive, or hurt, pause. Take a deep breath. Notice your thoughts, and consider if it seems that you're going into familiar blaming thoughts.
Remember that you can't change him. You couldn't change him when you were a child, and you still can't. Accepting this truth will help you improve your relationship.

, Remember that whatever your father does (or doesn't do) has more to do with him than you. The stories that you tell yourself about your father's intentions are just stories, and aren't necessarily true.If you start to notice patterns in the stories you tell yourself about your father, you'll learn more about yourself. For example, are you finding that you're often the victim of your father's behavior? If so, that's likely a pattern that's continued into other relationships. Allowing yourself new insights into possible alternatives to your dad's behavior provides you with new stories about your own life.
Remember that your dad, like most people, is probably busy. If he doesn't return your phone call, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. He might have been busy, or simply forgotten. Learning to give your dad the benefit of the doubt will go a long way in deepening the connection you have together.

, Your father will make mistakes. This doesn't make you a victim. It just makes him human. If you let go of the belief that your dad should be perfect, you'll have an easier time connecting with him.A warning sign of believing in a ""perfect father"" is when you find yourself thinking about what a dad should be like. The belief that there is a right and wrong way to be a father is rooted in setting up expectations that will eventually fail.
Don't compare your dad to other fathers you see, especially when it seems like the other fathers are better than yours. You can't really judge another person's relationship with his father. This is really another way people have of imagining a perfect father.

, To forgive is not the same as excusing your father's actions, and it doesn't mean you're reconciled. But making a decision to forgive is the first step in letting go of the resentments and angers you may still carry from the past.Think about your father's point of view. What was his own childhood like? What pressures was he carrying when you were a child? Try to understand his perspective.
Notice any small feeling of softness that might enter your heart when you think of his perspective. Cultivate that feeling with kindness, knowing that it doesn't mean that you're justifying his behavior.
Try to find some meaning in what you've experienced. Sometimes terrible actions have consequences that bring depth and usefulness to a person's life.
Letting go of the expectations you once had will help you make a stronger connection with your father in today. You may need to talk about things from the past with him, but be willing to forgive him - and yourself - for those things. Holding onto resentments will only get in the way of your connection.If you find yourself obsessing over the past and getting angry about it, talk to someone else, such as a friend, therapist, spouse or religious authority.
Be willing to take this slowly. Forgiveness doesn't come all at once, and relationships can take time to mend.

Drink caffeine.,
Use essential oils.,
Get active.,
Change your body temperature.,
Eat something.",How to Stay up Late Without Electronics1," Caffeine blocks neurotransmitters in your brain that make you sleepy.

Caffeine will cause a crash in energy after a couple of hours.
Stop drinking caffeine about four hours before your bedtime or it could affect your sleep cycle.
If coffee makes you feel jittery, try green tea. Green tea has a third of the caffeine found in coffee and lasts almost as long. Green tea also has L-theanine, an amino acid that helps you feel relaxed and focused.;
, Peppermint and cinnamon essential oils have been found to increase wakefulness. Smelling essential oils is a natural and safe way to fight tiredness. The smells have even been known to mitigate anxious feelings.


Essential oils are very potent so you may want to hold them a little ways away from your face when smelling them.
If your job includes driving, you can put a few drops of essential oil on a tissue and put the end of the tissue in the air conditioner vent. The vent will cause the aroma to circle throughout the car.Stay away from smells like lavender. Certain smells can actually relax you to sleep.

, Get up and get moving to wake yourself up. Even a light twenty-minute walk can give you more energy and get your blood pumping. You can also do a few stretches every once in awhile to release tension from your body that can drain your energy.


A lot of tension rests in your shoulders. You can do a few shoulder shrugs to release this tension. Roll your shoulders up as high as they can go. Squeeze them for a second. Then roll them back down and relax.

Read a book.,
Start a creative project.,
Plan a trip.,
Clean your area.,
Have a conversation.",How to Stay up Late Without Electronics2," Choose an adventure story or a book about a topic that interests you. Make sure you're excited to turn the page. Make sure you stay sitting up while you’re reading. If you let yourself get too comfortable, you could fall asleep.


Don’t read books with super small print. The strain could exhaust your eyes and cause them to close.
Take breaks periodically to prevent dozing off.

, Choose something you’re really interested in. You’re mind will be too consumed with your project to think about being tired.Some examples of fun projects you can start include:


learning a song
writing a story
building a model airplane
painting a portrait

, Imagine a location that you’d really like to visit. Write out a plan to take a vacation there. Think about everything you’d like to experience on your vacation. Decide where you’ll be staying and how you’ll get there. You’ll be too excited about your dream vacation to fall asleep.


Let your mind wonder. Don’t worry about being realistic. You can imagine anywhere you want to go.

, You can gain mental focus by sprucing up your environment. The act of cleaning itself will energize your body and mind.

Take naps during the day.,
Adjust your sleep cycle by increments.,
Reset your “food clock”.,
Sleep during the day.,
Use blue blocking shades.",How to Stay up Late Without Electronics3," It will be more difficult to fall asleep at night if you take a nap late in the day. Keep your naps short, about twenty minutes or under, so you don’t wake up feeling groggy.If you take a long nap of about ninety minutes, you can get through an entire deep sleep cycle which can reduce the amount of sleep you need at night.

, Try to stay awake fifteen to thirty minutes longer each night. Gradually, it will feel more natural staying up later. Keep adding time until you feel comfortable staying up as long you want to., In the wild, animals constantly have to readjust their sleep cycles depending on their food source. You can do the same. To do this, fast for twelve hours before you intend to wake up. When you do wake up, have a full breakfast. The breakfast will reset your metabolism and your body will be automatically re-calibrated to wake up at the new time.


For example, if you want to wake up at five in the morning, start fasting at five in the afternoon the day before.Don’t break your fast until you wake up.

, Make sure your sleeping area is completely dark. Close your shutters, turn out the lights and use eye coverings to banish out any light that may peep through.Get a full eight hours of sleep during the day so that you can stay awake at night.


Be sure to get some sunlight. Your body needs it to absorb Vitamin D.

, Blue light has a very short, high-energy wavelength that makes you feel more alert and prevents your body from producing melatonin. Because your body needs melatonin to go to sleep, you want to block out all the blue light you can before your bedtime. If you have to sleep during the day, wearing orange-tinted shades that block out blue light can help you wind down.Artificial light from computers, televisions and light bulbs can be very high in blue light.
Blue light is the highest energy and shortest wavelength of light in our visible spectrum.

Understand the variation within relationships.Since we’re all different, nobody relates to any two people in exactly the same way.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Be assertive but not aggressive.Find a quiet moment when you can talk to your parent about their behavior without anyone else interrupting.,
Don’t get into an argument.,
Don’t expect your parents to change.In the best-case scenario, you parents will realize that they’ve been treating you badly compared to your siblings and resolve to change.",How to Deal with Parents Treating Other Siblings Better1," In some cases, a parent might seem to show favor to your sibling. In other cases, or from another point of view, your parent might appear to favor you. It is unrealistic to expect any parent to be completely fair and even-handed in their treatment of you and your sibling.


However, there is no excuse for systematic and repeated favoritism of one child over another.
Before tackling the issue with your parents, ask yourself whether you're sure your siblings are really being treated better. Sure, they might receive something ""extra"" in one area of life, but you might receive that kind of special attention in another area. If this is the case, your parents might not really be showing your sibling preferential treatment, but are rather just acknowledging that you and your sibling are two different people with unique wants and needs.;
, It’s important to communicate to your parents how you feel when they treat your other siblings better than they treat you.Be honest about your feelings. Whether you’re an adult still dealing with the impact your parents’ behavior had on you or a kid trying to improve your situation, talking to your parents about how they treated your sibling better than they treated you is important.


Try starting the conversation by saying something like, ""Mom and Dad, I've been thinking a lot about this lately and I need to talk to you about not feeling as important as John.""

, Say, for instance, “I’m really hurt by the way you’re treating me compared to my sibling.”


Avoid confrontational “you” statements (like “You don’t care about me”) and focus on your feelings with “I” statements (like “I’m hurt by the way I’m being treated”).
Cite specific examples to illustrate your point. For example, you could continue the conversation by saying, ""It seems like you go to all John’s football games, but you only went to one of my volleyball games last season. Why is that?”
Finish with a direct request such as, ""I really want you both to attend at least three of my at home games this season. I feel that is only fair.""
If you can’t think of specific instances where your parents treated you poorly relative to how they treated your sibling, start looking for these occasions and write them down over the course of a few days. Then, when you’re armed with evidence, talk to your parents about the situation.
Be honest when expressing your feelings.

, If your parents get angry or upset with you, don't fight them. Stay calm and excuse yourself from the conversation if you don’t think you’re making progress or if you feel too frustrated. Don’t blow up, cuss them out, and call them names. Instead, maintain a level tone and speak slowly. Choose your words with care.If you feel upset by the conversation, then try taking a break and do some deep breathing. Try saying something like, “I will be right back. I just need a few minutes.”
You might have to talk to your parents more than once about this issue. If they are unwilling to listen the first time you bring it up, try again some other time.
Stay focused on the subject. Don’t let your parents turn the conversation around on you or excuse their actions.

, But they might not agree with your view, even if you draw attention to their favoritism. They might deny showing preferential treatment, or might admit that they show preferential treatment and try to justify it. In this case, prepare for frustration and unhappy feelings.


Remember, you cannot change other people. You can only change yourself.

The best thing to do is use the computer when your parents are not home.

,
If you are using this computer when they are not home, you don't have to be quite as careful.,
Set your home page to blank.,
Create two web pages.,
Before clicking on what you're really going to look at on the other page, pull down the Safari menu and click on ""Private Browsing"".,Go onto the site you are really going to look at, then create a new tab by typing ""command T"" ( the command button is the one with the apple, or the swirly square)

,
On the new tab put another boring site like google.,
Match the two corners of the open windows up exactly, so you can't see the one behind it when you switch to your dummy window.

,
When you're finished, you can just quit.,
If you don't have private browsing on your computer, as some older models don't, you'll have to clear your history and searches.",How to Surf the Internet on a Macintosh Without Your Parents Knowing,", Just make sure you can quit your Internet and log out quickly!

, This means just going under Safari preferences, and deleting the page they have set.;
, On the first one, create a dummy site. Wikipedia works great, and click on some site that has to do with whatever you are studying in history, such as Stalin.

, This will disable Safari from saving any browsing history, log-in names or passwords, cookies, or searches.

,, That way, if you don't want to close a window if it's a false alarm you still look like you are alright if they look at F9 or F10 showing all the open windows.

,, Maybe make sure the history is parent-friendly by putting private browsing on the computer should log you out, and clear your history and sources of everything interesting.

, This is not as good, as your parents can see that you have cleared your history, and might wonder why you would bother to do so, but if you don't have private browsing, its the best you can do.

Stay positive.Look on the bright side of things.,
Manage your emotions.Because of your parents’ favoritism, you might be short-tempered and/or aggressive.,
Rebuild your self-esteem.If your parents spend years acting as though your other sibling(s) are smarter, funnier, or more interesting than you, you might start to believe them.,
Form healthy relationships.,
Don’t blame your sibling.If your parents treat your sibling much better than they treat you, you might come to see your sibling and your parents as part of a united conspiracy against you.,
Keep your grades up.,
Confront your depression.",How to Deal with Parents Treating Other Siblings Better2," Instead of saying to yourself, “Well, that article didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to,” you should say, “The article wasn’t perfect, but I did my best and I’m proud of that. Others will surely appreciate my hard work.”


Stay aware of your own negative thoughts. When you think, “I’m so dumb,” stop yourself and envision that thought as a red balloon. Picture the words written on the side of the balloon.
Imagine yourself letting the balloon go. Watch it float up into nothingness, never to return.
Then, imagine hundreds of blue balloons descending, each with a positive mantra written on it, such as, “I am a winner.”

, Your temper might interfere with your ability to form friendships with others. Learn to take control of your emotions and don’t let them control you.Before you say or do something out of anger, think about how you’d feel if someone said or did the same to you. Breathe in slowly through your nose, then exhale through your mouth for slightly longer than it took you to inhale.
Find a positive outlet for your frustration and anger. Go for a run or ride your bike. Take up a martial art. Any kind of exercise is a good way to blow off steam.
Look for alternatives to violence, yelling, or other angry reactions. In the end, these reactions will not solve the problem or situation that inspired them. If someone said something rude to you, for instance, express your feelings in a mature way. Say, “I don’t like the way you’re treating me. You owe me an apology.”

, Learn to identify self-defeating or critical thoughts and feelings and challenge them wherever possible.The quickest way to disprove the lie that you have nothing of value to offer is to pursue your hobbies and interests. Whatever it is you love doing, continue doing it. The more your practice, the better you’ll get. After about 10,000 hours of practice doing something, you will have attained mastery in that particular hobby or skill. Having an exceptional talent can increase feelings of confidence and self-worth.
Provide encouragement for yourself. Every day when you wake, look in the mirror and say, “I have a life worth living and many people like me.”
Surround yourself with friend who care about you. Lean on them for support when you’re feeling blue.

, Children who are bullied or neglected by their parents are vulnerable to exploitation by others who give them the attention and validation they crave.Stay away from gangs, terrorist organizations, and cults, especially those that adopt a family-like structure. As a child of parents who treat your siblings better than they treat you, you might be lured by promises of love and affection. However, these arrangements are always temporary and designed with an eye on future benefits for the one who offers the apparent love and affection.


Remember, real love is given selflessly, without any expectation of anything in return.

, However, it is important to recognize that your parents alone are responsible for their behavior.


Your sibling has nothing to do with their attitude toward you. Maintain a positive, healthy relationship with your sibling.If your sibling is old enough to understand what’s going on, talk to them about how your parents are mistreating you. Seek their advice and encourage them to speak up on your behalf.

, Children of parents who show favoritism to another child often have a hard time in school.Find a well-lit, quiet place to study. Do all your homework each night, and use a daily planner to schedule time for yourself to review for tests, write essays, and complete important projects ahead of time.


Stay organized. There are many apps available for your phone and tablet to help you better manage your time and keep track of your assignments. The Complete Class Organizer and iHomework are among the best.
Attend all your classes and take notes in each class.
Ask questions when you are confused or don’t understand something.

, Depression -- a persistent feeling of sadness and a lack of energy -- is a common side effect in children who were regularly treated poorly in comparison to their siblings.A common course of treatment will combine antidepressants with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).


CBT is a therapeutic method that helps you confront your negative thoughts directly and identify counterexamples to construct a logical case against feelings of depression.CBT helps you focus on your feelings and experiences in the here and now in order to develop healthy coping mechanisms to change your depressive thought patterns into more positive ones.
If you believe you have depression, consult a therapist to help you get on the road to recovery.
