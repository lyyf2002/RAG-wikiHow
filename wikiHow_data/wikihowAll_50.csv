Raise Chansey's level once you are at Friendship 220 or higher.",How to Evolve Chansey," Chansey can only evolve into Blissey in generation II and later. If you're playing Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green, you'll need to transfer to Gold, Silver, or Crystal in order to be able to evolve Chansey.


You can trade from Generation I to Generation II, but you can't trade from I or II to Generation III or later.;
, Chansey evolves when its Friendship or Happiness level reaches a certain level. When you capture or trade for a wild Chansey, it's Friendship level is set to 70. In order to evolve Chansey, you will need to raise its Friendship level to at least 220 (255 is the max). The process for raising the Friendship level is similar across most games, but each one has some minor tweaks.

, Determining Chansey's Friendship level is a little difficult, as you can't see the numbers anywhere in the game. Instead, you'll need to talk to a specific person and use the phrase they say to determine Chansey's Friendship level. When checking Friendship, make sure Chansey is the first Pokémon in your party. The phrase listed below will indicate that your Chansey has a Friendship level of about 200-250.Generation II: Talk to the woman near the Bike Shop in Goldenrod City. ""I get the feeling that it really trusts you."" This is the same for HeartGold and SoulSilver.
Generation III: Find the house in Verdanturf with a woman and a Pikachu. Talk to the woman to determine your Friendship level. ""It seems to be very happy. It obviously likes you a whole lot."" This is also the same for Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby. In FireRed and LeafGreen, talk to Daisy in Pallet Town. ""It looks very happy. I wish Rival could see this and learn something from it.""

Generation IV: Talk to the Beauty in the Pokémon Fan Club in Hearthome city, or talk to Dr. Footstep south of the Pastoria City entrance. ""I get the feeling that it really trusts you."" (Diamond and Pearl). ""It's very friendly toward you. I can tell you treat it kindly."" (Platinum)
Generation V: Talk to the woman in the Pokémon Fan club in Icirrus City. ""It is quite friendly to you! You must be a kind person!"". In Black 2 and White 2, you can call Bianca. ""You two sure get along great! It looks like you are having fun together! You seem bright and cheerful!""

Generation VI: Talk to the Pokémon Breeder at the Pokémon Fan Club in Laverre City. ""You must really like your Chansey and always keep it by your side!""

Generation VII: Talk to the woman near the TM shop in Konikoni City. ""You clearly love your Chansey, and you must spend a lot of time together.""


, One of the primary ways to increase Friendship is to keep Chansey in your active party. Every 256 steps you take (512 in Generation II) will raise the Friendship level by 1.

, Leveling Chansey up will provide a boost of up to 5 friendship. You'll get less Friendship for leveling when Chansey has a high Friendship rating.

, These are items that increase Chansey's stats, and each Vitamin will increase Friendship by up to 5. Again, the rewards will diminish as Chansey's Friendship increases. Vitamins include:


Protein
HP Up
Iron
Zinc
Calcium
Carbos
PP Up
PP Max
Rare Candy

, There are several activities that you can take Chansey to that will raise its Friendship. The activities available depend on the game you are playing. There are no massage activities in Generation III games.


Generation II: Talk to the Haircut Brothers in Goldenrod tunnel. Daisy Oak in Pallet Town will also groom Pokémon between 3-4 PM.
Generation IV: Talk to the Massage Girl in Veilstone City. She can be found in the house in the bottom-left corner of the town. The Spa Treatment from the Ribbon Syndicate building in the Resort Area will give a large boost.
Generation V: Talk to the Massage Lady in Castelia City. In Black and White, she can be found on the first floor of the western building on Castelia Street. In B2 and W2, she can be found in the building across from the Pokémon Center.
Generation VI: Talk to the Massage Lady in the house to the west of the Pokémon Center in Cyllage City. In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, a Groomer has been added to Mauville City, north of the Poke Miles shop.
Generation VII: Talk to the Massage Lady in the Konikoni City market.

, These special Poke Balls give a bonus to each Friendship increase as long as Chansey is stored in it. Luxury Balls are only available in Generation III and later.

, This item increase the amount of Friendship gained by the Pokémon that is holding it. Like the Luxury Ball, it was introduced in Generation III.


You can use the Luxury Ball and the Soothe Bell together to increase the boost. Each one boosts Friendship gained by 1 point, and combined will increase Friendship by 2 points each time it is raised.

, If Chansey faints in Battle, it will lose 1 Friendship point. Make sure to pull Chansey out of the battle if it's in danger of getting knocked out.

, Using herbal items during battle will take a massive hit on your friendship level. For example, using a Revival Herb can cost as many as 20 Friendship points, depending on the current Friendship level, while using Heal Powder will cost 5-10 points.


Try to do all of your healing at a Pokémon Center or healing with normal healing items, which won't have any effect on Chansey's Friendship level.

, Since you can't find the exact number, you'll have to guess based on the Friendship Checker's phrase. Once you're pretty sure that Chansey's friendship is high enough, level it up during a battle to start the evolution. You can also use a Rare Candy to level it up.


If the evolution into Blissey does not happen, Chansey's Friendship is not high enough.

, As a mini boss, Gleeok will only have two to three heads. Once you enter the Mini Boss room, it will pop out the wall and begin attacking you.


Gleeok will start weaving its two to three heads through half of the floor. Its heads will also start shooting fireballs in random directions. Try to dodge these attacks by constantly moving around the floor.

, While avoiding its attack, slowly move towards its head. Once you get close enough, slash one of its head with your sword. It takes ten blows of your wooden sword to destroy just one head.

, Once you enter the Boss room, it will pop out the wall and begin attacking you. As the main boss, Gleeok will have four heads instead of just two or three.


Gleeok will start weaving its four heads through half of the floor. Its heads will also start shooting fireballs in random directions. Apart from that, every head you sever will start flying around the room and will damage you if you come in contact with it.
Just like with the mini boss version, simply keep moving around the room to avoid these attacks.

, While avoiding its attack, slowly inch closer towards its head. Once you get close enough, slash one of its head with your sword. It takes ten blows of your wooden sword to destroy just one head.


Do this to each of Gleeok’s four heads to defeat the monster.

Figure out which type of potion to buy.,
Gather Rupees.,
Go to a Potion Store in any town.,
Buy a potion.,
Buy multiple potions at once.",How to Buy Potions in The Legend of Zelda," There are three types of potion used in different versions of the game, all of which serve a specific purpose. These are:


Red Potion—Available in all version of the game. It replenishes Link’s heart containers (a measure of the character’s HP) at will.
Green Potion—In certain versions of the series (A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker), where Link has another set of character meter called Magic Points to be used in varying purposes like magic spells, a Green Potion refills this meter.
Blue Potion—Blue Potions serves as the combination of a Red and a Blue Potion. It refills both the Health and Magic meter at once. It also fully replenishes the two, regardless of how low the levels are. This potion is available in The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and A Link between Worlds.;
, Rupees are the game’s currency, and you need these to buy potions. You can earn money by opening treasure chests found in various locations in every game, killing enemies, or even cutting grasses or breaking jars.


Potion price varies from shop to shop, town to town, and game to game. Red and Green potions costs around 30 Rupees, while Green potions can cost anywhere between 50 and 100 Rupees.

, Every town has a Potion Store. You can tell one from its big potion bottle sign found at the front of every shop in every version of the game. Enter the store and you’ll find a store clerk.

, Potions can be found placed on top of the store counter. Walk in front of the item and press the Action button on your controller to start buying one. The store clerk will tell you its price. Press the Action button once more to confirm or the Cancel button to discontinue your purchase.


The potions will then be added to your inventory.

, You can only buy one to three Potions at once from a store (applies in all version of the game). When the store runs out of supply (you can tell because the item will disappear from the counter, or the clerk will tell you that they’ve ran out of supply), simply walk out of the store and go back inside again. You’ll find new supplies in the counter. You can keep buying as much as your money allows by repeating this step.

Have your shield ready.,
Always be alert.,
Raise your shield.,
Jump out of its way.,
Do a counterattack.",How to Avoid Ropes in the Legend of Zelda," In any version of the Legend of Zelda, Ropes can only be seen inside dungeons. They are randomly placed inside dungeons, so it may be quite surprising to see these monsters. Whenever you’re venturing inside a dungeon room, always have your shield equipped and conveniently assigned to one of the buttons of your controller.;
, Ropes will instantly charge at you once you come within its sight. When entering a dungeon, always be watchful when going from one dungeon room to another for any possible Ropes that may attack you.

, Once a Rope sees you, it will instantly charge at you at full speed, giving you only a second or two to react. Quickly press the button on your controller where your shield was assigned to raise it and defend yourself. The Rope will slam on to your shield, temporarily stunning it.

, If you don’t have your shield with you, you can do a quick side-step using the arrows keys on your controller to jump of out the Rope’s way. If there’s a wall behind you, the Rope should slam into it and get stunned. Otherwise, the monster will just turn back and charge at you again. When this happens, simply side-step again to avoid its attack.

, While the Rope is still stunned from running into your shield or the wall, draw your sword and attack the Rope. It takes two to three strikes of your sword to kill a Rope.

Get inside the Boss Room.,
Avoid its claw attacks.,
Dodge its fire breath attack.,
Attack its eye.",How to Defeat Gohma in the Legend of Zelda1," Enter the Boss Room of these levels by unlocking it using the Boss Keys you acquired while playing through the dungeons. Gohma can be found in the Boss Rooms of the following levels:


The Legend of Zelda (first version) – Guards the Boss Room of the “Dragon Labyrinth” (level 6 dungeon).
Link’s Awakening – Guards the Boss Room of the “Catfish’s Maw” (level 5 dungeon).
Ocarina of Time – Can be found inside the Great Deku Tree (level 1).
Oracle of Seasons – Guards the Boss Room of the “Dancing Dragon Dungeon” (level 4 dungeon).
Four Swords – Guards the Mini Boss Room of various dungeons.
Twilight Princess – Guards the Boss Room of the Temple of Time level.;
, Once you get inside the Boss Room, Gohma will start attacking you using its two front limbs. To dodge this attack, simply run around the Boss Room and you’ll easily evade Gohma’s claws.

, After three or more consecutive claw or leg attacks, Gohma will then blow a pillar of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will follow you wherever you go, so just keep running around the room (like what you’ve been doing in step 2) until the fire breath stops.

, After attacking you with its fire breath, Gohma will pause for at least three seconds, letting its guard down. Quickly turn around and shoot at the spider’s singular eye using your bow and arrow.


After damaging its eye, Gohma will resume attacking you again. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get the chance to shoot its eye again. Keep doing this for at least five times or more until you defeat the monster.

Release .",How to Unlock Characters in Don't Starve," The characters you unlock through dying are as follows, in order: Willow, Wolfgang, Wendy, WX-78, Wickerbottom, and Woodie. Each character has their own advantages: Willow has a lighter and gains sanity from fire, Wolfgang gets stronger the higher his Hunger gauge is, Wendy can summon her dead sister’s ghost to help her fight, WX-78 gets stronger from eating gears and getting hit by lightning, Wickerbottom can craft books with unusual effects like summoning Tentacles, and Woodie can chop wood faster and turn into a Werebeaver! But they all have drawbacks themselves, like how Willow sets fire to things when her Sanity is low or how WX-78 gets damaged from the rain.
, Now that you’ve unlocked your character, exit your current game and head on over to the Main Menu. You can do this by pressing the Esc button, pressing R2, or by tapping the “Pause” button in the lower right half of the screen. Select “Exit Game” then “Yes.” Now, press “Start Game,” and select a New Game slot instead of your usual game slot., In the New Game menu, pick the Character option and scroll by your choices! The hidden or locked characters are silhouetted while the playable ones are in full color. When you find one you like, press select them and then press “Apply.” After that, press “Start” and you’ll spawn in your world with your new character!, Each hour you survive in the game before you eventually die is converted to EXP, and the longer you last, more EXP you get, and the more characters you unlock! The EXP needed to unlock the characters increase incrementally for each of them. For instance, Willow takes 8 days, Wolfgang takes 16 days, Wendy needs 32, and so on and so forth. So try to survive for the number of days required to unlock the goal character you have in mind.

In RoG, another character named Wigfried is introduced, available when you survive a total of 96 days before dying, making her the last in the list. Her advantage is that she spawns with a helmet and armor right off the bat and gains sanity and health from killing things, but can only eat meat.

, You can choose how you die—get killed by Hounds, frogs, mosquitoes, bees, or any other creature you find. Except for the first, all you have to do is attack them to irk them and have them attack you; just don’t attack back once they do. You can also starve, which might take a bit longer than finding something to kill you though., Once you’re dead, you have the option of continuing or exiting the game. Opt to exit, and you’ll see the points you’ve earned and the character you’ve unlocked!, This poor child, eaten by Spiders, is another unlockable character, available in the Reign of Giants DLC! Webber’s Skull is a rare item dropped by slain Spiders or by destroying Spider Dens. While morbid, you better hang on to it until you find a Grave., Graves are normally found in Forests or in Graveyards. Digging one up requires a shovel, which you can learn to create through a Science Machine. Digging Graves normally yields you treasures, but occasionally spawns vengeful Ghosts instead, so be careful!

Shovels require 2 Twigs and 2 Flint to create, and can be made in the Tools tab (crossed pickaxe and axe icon).

, Now that you have everything, it’s time to commit a sin against nature and bring him back to life! To revive Webber, place his skull on the Grave you dug up. Lightning will immediately strike it, and the child in a spider’s body will emerge, along with some other Spiders.

Webber is great if you like Spiders, since he can befriend them all. He can grow a beard of Silk, making it easily renewable every few days, and he’s immune to the penalties from eating Monster food. As a drawback though, his Sanity is quite low, and mobs like the Pigs and Bunnymen will attack him on sight since he looks too much like a Spider, which they tend to murder with extreme prejudice. You can still befriend them, but you need to feed them their respective items (meat for Pigs, carrots for Bunnymen) twice, once to dispel their hostility and the second to completely befriend them.
Oddly enough, as long as you haven’t buried Webber’s skull yet, you can still get it as drops from Spiders and Spider Dens. Aside from being creepy, the skull item doesn’t have much of a function apart from Webber’s revival.

, Adventure Mode is the most difficult challenge for the players of this game. This mode is a crazy grind of unusual mechanics and even more unusual challenges that force the players to get very, very clever with their strategies, and is thusly not recommended for novice players of the game. Therefore, the following steps will just be a breakdown on each theme, where to find your other characters, and some basic survival tips., Adventure Mode can be accessed by going through a structure called Maxwell’s Door, which is commonly found in Forests. When you enter that, you’ll be taken to another world with a specific theme, called a Chapter, wherein you have to survive in. Do note that you can only bring four items with you in Adventure Mode at a time. This includes player-only items such as Lucy the Axe, Willow’s Lighter, and Abigail’s Flower (carried by Wendy).

Maxwell’s Door is a huge metal and wood structure that looks like Maxwell’s over-inflated head, and is surrounded by a field of Evil Flowers. To those who have seen the introductory animated scene of the game, it looks exactly like the object Wilson made under Maxwell’s instructions.
Wilson and Webber’s beards don’t count as an item, and WX-78’s upgrades from eating Gears are unaffected.

, You need to survive four themed worlds in “Chapters” to progress through Adventure Mode. The order of appearance for most worlds is chosen at random, however, in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th world, the map will show some of the path indicating where the objectives are. These five possible themes are quite difficult to survive in due to their unusual mechanics.

You should at least make it a point to learn as many recipes as you can by making things on your Science Machine, Alchemy Engine, and Prestihatitator, and bring at least one warm article of clothing, since most of the possible chapters feature harsher winters than normal.
At random, one basic resource will be made rare: saplings might not spawn but there might be spiky bushes instead, or there might not be any trees but only stumps.
Common food sources like Carrots, Berry Bushes, and Rabbit Holes are also generally scarce in the Adventure Mode worlds, so you’ll have to stockpile your food carefully and bring along long-lasting foods like Jerky and Popcorn.
Thankfully, you always spawn close to a Divining Rod to aid you in search of the Things, which is the only advantage given to you by Maxwell.

, To progress, you need to find the Things scattered around the map. Only one Thing can’t be removed from its spawn point, but the rest can be gathered and brought to it. Thankfully, you can equip your Divining Rod to direct you to the nearest Thing.

The Ring Thing is a large yellow-colored metal ring and is found in the middle of a ring of Evil Flowers.
The Crank Thing is a large rectangular metal object with what looks like large screws at each side and a small lever in the middle. It’s found in a small patch of savannah, with Evil Flowers, a Pig House, 3 Spikey Trees, and an axe next to it.
The Box Thing is a small wooden box and is found surrounded by Stone walls, a lawn gnome, a spear, and of course, Evil Flowers.
The Metal Potato Thing looks like a huge round lump of scrap metal. It’s right next to some Farm Plots, Grass, Twigs, and some Carrots, making it a good area to stay in for some food, if you need to.
Lastly, the Wooden Thing is a large wooded circle with strange red symbols etched into it. It’s also the most difficult to secure since it’s spawned next to some hostile Clockwork monsters, and you can’t move it either, so you can’t just run and grab it. The entire area it’s found in is full of Marble Trees and Marble Pillars, in an area commonly referred to as the Chess Biome due to it’s checkered floor and chess-themed Clockwork monsters surrounding it. You can place any of the Things in any order on the Wooden Thing, and once it’s complete, you can use it to get to the next world.

The complete Wooden Thing is basically the Metal Potato Thing, now revealed to be a metal sculpture of Maxwell’s head, floating on top of the other Things. It’s also referred to as the Teleportato, as a reference to the Metal Potato Thing being Maxwell’s head. Once completed, you can interact with it to bring you to the next world, and when you choose to advance, shadowy hands will drag you away while the head laughs.



, The first of the five possible themes for the four chapters is the Cold Reception theme. The seasons here are unusually short (6 days of summer to 3 days of winter) and rainy to boot. It may also rain Frogs, which can be an advantage and disadvantage at the same time.

The next is the King of Winter. This theme, obviously, is a harsh, endless Winter with normal weather patterns and day lengths. This is also where you can encounter Hound Mounds, which are bone piles that spawn Hounds periodically. Your path would also be blocked with Obelisks, which can be raised and lowered according to your sanity. If you encounter a raised obelisk with full sanity, you would need to lower your sanity to pass, and if it’s raised while in low sanity, you would need to increase your sanity to continue.

, theme. This theme has a very lush, rich central island surrounded by other hazardous islands where you can find the Things inside. It also starts immediately in Winter. To progress, you need to go through “bridges” linking the islands that have various obstacles. You can actually gather a lot of resources in this theme for the next ones, making this one of the better themes to start off in. Occasionally, the islands don’t have a bridge, prompting you to travel through Wormholes., This theme has six islands in total, with five of them containing a Thing, and the last island is where you start in. The only way to get to the other islands is by going through Wormholes. Your initial spawning point is in the relatively safe Grasslands, but it’s surrounded by Marshes, so you must still be careful. The day-night cycle is normal, as are the seasons, making this another good place to stock up on supplies before advancing., This next theme, appearing on either the 3rd or 4th chapter, is the Two Worlds chapter. Here, the world is split between two islands: one is a lush, almost idyllic place with abundant resources and extremely long days and short nights, while the other is a rainy, swampy area full of Merms, Spiders, Tallbirds, and Tentacles, and thankfully, a normal day-night cycle. Of course, you start in the lush area but need to leave for the swampy area to progress. Normally, when the world is generated, the only way to the swamp island is a Sick Wormhole, which makes it a one-way trip, prompting the player to hoard and stockpile resources before heading to the other island.



Occasionally, a pair of regular Wormholes connecting the islands can spawn, or a land bridge naturally spawns between them, letting you explore and gather things in a more relaxed, thorough manner before progressing.



, The fifth chapter is always Darkness. This is pretty much a straightforward rush-or-die world where the timer is your own degrading sanity and dwindling food sources. Maxwell’s Lights are common, but the eternal darkness can still drain sanity. Even if there are some creatures you can kill and hunt for meat, they’re not common enough for you to completely thrive off on. Think of this as the Underground with exponentially less resources and more danger. Do not linger, keep moving forward, and you’ll be able to get to the final area of Adventure Mode.

The last area is named Epilogue. When you get to the very very end of Adventure Mode, you’re immediately taken to this very special place, full of resources and darkness. Any more description would reveal massive spoilers, but if you’re not careful, you can still die from Hound Attacks and from the penalties of sanity loss. The only way to escape is to make a special choice, or to die.

, Here’s the first “special conditions” character you might encounter in the game, if you haven’t found Webber yet. His name is Wes. He’s a mime, and Maxwell has him in his dastardly clutches. And only you can save him and then recruit him! Do note that he is, by far, the absolute weakest character in the game, with the lowest overall stats, and is meant to be played by experienced players who want a challenge.

Wes can be found in the third chapter of Adventure Mode (if it’s not the Two Worlds theme) in a structure of three rooms, two with Maxwell’s Statues, and poor Wes trapped in the third one. If you break any of the statues, undamaged Clockwork monsters will appear to attack you, and you need to break all the statues and defeat all the monsters before you can approach Wes. Once you do, when you get near him, even more Clockwork monsters spawn, and you have to defeat them all to release Wes, so be very careful when you find this poor little mime!

, . . Maxwell? You know him, you hate him, and he revels in your misery. But now it’s time for a little payback, don’t you think? In lieu of spoilers, just know that you’ll meet Maxwell himself in the final area of Adventure Mode, and after a series of events and some eerie and important exposition, you are given a choice. One lets you continue on as you were, the other shows you an “ending” to the tale of Don’t Starve, and lets you Exit Adventure Mode with Maxwell as your character!

While despicable, Maxwell is one of the best characters to play! He constantly regenerates Sanity due to his smug dapperness, can spawn copies of himself, and even spawns with the Dark Sword and Nightmare Armor—one of the best weapons and armor in the game—in his inventory! To make up for this, his maximum health is the absolute lowest compared to character in the game, even Wes, so try to keep him alive to prolong his torment!

Enter the Boss Room.,
Avoid its claw attacks.,
Dodge it fire breath attack.,
Shoot the dragon’s tail with a Grappling Hook.,
Attack Gohma’s eye.",How to Defeat Gohma in the Legend of Zelda2," Gohma guards the Dragon Roost Island peak in this version of the game. Initially, you’ll have to start at the bottom of the island and make your way up to its peak, where you’ll find the Boss Room where Gohma is.


Unlike in other versions where Gohma takes the form of a spider, in Wind Waker, it appears as a centipede Cyclops and requires a slightly different approach to defeat it.

, Once you get inside the Boss Room, Gohma will start attacking you using its two front limbs. To dodge this attack, simply run around the Boss Room allowing you to easily evade Gohma’s claws.

, After three or more consecutive claw or leg attacks, Gohma will then blow a pillar of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will follow you wherever you go so just keep running around the room (like what you've been doing in step 2) until the fire breath stops.

, You have already received and used the Grappling Hook by the time you reach Dragon Roost Island. Take the Grappling Hook, aim it, and shoot at the dragon’s tail you see hanging from the ceiling of the Boss Room.


This will make the dragon sitting atop of the mountain move and drop the ceiling on Gohma.
Repeat this step up to three times until Gohma’s stone armor breaks.

, After breaking its armor, take your bow and arrow, aim it and shoot at Gohma’s eye. This will knock the monster face forward to the ground, placing its eye within your reach.

Approach Gohma’s eye and slash it as many times as you can using your sword. Keep doing this until the monster explodes.

, When you reach the top, keep going right until you see a glowing blue tile; it will be in plain sight with no rocks hiding it.

, With your automatically-equipped Titan's Mitt, lift the big black rock that is blocking you. Then pick up the only stone in the enclosure to reveal the warp tile.


You could also make your way through the Lost Woods, go south, and hammer in the stakes with the Magic Hammer.

, Off to the right, surrounded by stakes, will be a rock-covered tile. Hammer in the stakes with the Magic Hammer and lift the rock.

, The tile will be in an area surrounded half by rock and half by water. There will also be creepy green statues and stakes blocking it off. An overly enthusiastic Octorok will be there to spit rocks at you. Smash the stakes in with your Magic Hammer and lift the rock. Lo and behold, it's the fifth tile.

, Lift the rock covering the tile. Stepping on it is the only way to gain access to the Ice Palace dungeon.

, Lifting the black rock and stepping on the tile is the only way to get to the Misery Mire dungeon in the Swamp of Evil.

, Go up the ladder and to the right. Use the Hookshot to get across the bridge, and then keep towards the southern wall. It won't be long before you see a small black rock behind a bolder. Lift the rock. Tile number eight!

Identify a Bubble.,
Study its movement pattern.,
Quickly get out of its path.",How to Avoid Bubbles in the Legend of Zelda1," Bubbles in these versions of the game are invulnerable to any type of attack. They are simply skulls inside balls of fire that run against the walls or across the floor linearly. They do not fire any weapons or aggressively attack your character.;
, Bubbles do not attack but will deal damage if your character touches it. Shields will not protect you either, so staying clear of the monster is the only way to avoid damage. Study how the monster goes from one point of the room to another, and back to its original position. Studying its movement will allow you to time your movement correctly.

, Once you’ve identified its movement, you can plan your route pass the monster. You can simply walk across the room once the Bubble passes you or before it gets near you.

Keep running.,
Distract them.,
Lead them to traps.,
Don’t get cornered!",How to Survive a Hound Wave in Don't Starve," You’ll need a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials for this venture. They’re both available through the Tools tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select one by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down into gatherable materials.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs since they’re vital for creating a Science Machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also for other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also vital for campfires and torches.


Rocks can be found scattered everywhere, much like flint, but are less common and are more easily obtained by mining boulders.
Everything you gather, save for Logs, can stack up to 40 per inventory slot. Logs stack up to 20 per inventory slot.

, You’ll need a Science Machine to create the necessary items for your survival. A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and is the very first crafting station you can make.


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Craft the Science Machine where you’ll be camping permanently, since it cannot be moved and carried around once placed.
If you want a more advanced crafting station for more advanced ventures, you’re better off making an Alchemy Engine, which costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon.

, Spears cost 1 Rope, 1 Flint, and 2 Twigs, and are first crafted through the Science Machine’s Fight tab, which is represented by a crossed swords icon. This is the first true weapon of the game and is rather efficient when it comes to killing early-game mobs. Equipping it is identical to equipping your tools: select your item then equip it with right click or the right direction button.

, You’ll want armor to go with your Spear if you want to survive this ordeal. While it won’t completely repel damage, it lessens it greatly and will help keep you from losing too much health.The two most efficient armors available early on are the Grass Suit and the Log Suit.


Grass Suits can be crafted at the very beginning of the game and cost 10 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You equip them the same way you equip your tools and spear.
Log Suits require the Science Machine to make the first time, and cost 8 Logs and 2 Ropes.

, Once you’re done arming yourself, take stock of what healing items you can craft. Stockpiling Butterfly Wings, Spider Glands, and Mosquito Sacs is a good tactic, but taking some Jerky with you, cooking food in your Crock Pot, and making Healing Salves would be better off in the long run, as long as you have the right resources.


Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock, and 1 Spider Gland; it heals for 20 Health, compared to the 8 Health healed by the Spider Gland.
To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind on the rack, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat. Approach the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption!
You can make a Crock Pot with a Science Machine for 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs, and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook, and takes about a minute to complete. Most meals can restore a great amount of Health, as long as you figure out the recipe.

You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.



, Facing them head-on is always a terrible idea, since they arrive in a group, so running away from them is always a good idea. Though they are generally faster than you on foot, running along a Road and Path increases your speed considerably, perfect for kiting and hit-and-run tactics.


Hounds don’t disappear after a set amount of time and are excessively hostile, so the only way to get rid of them is by killing them.

, Hounds are easily distracted by the promise of Meat, so dropping a piece of Meat you don’t mind losing or running through a bunch of Rabbit Holes would ensure they get distracted from chasing you, leaving them vulnerable to your spear.

, The best way to keep them from hurting you while keeping them dead is by leading them to Marshes or areas with Beefalo, Tallbirds, or Pigs. Marshes are very hazardous place to explore, but a quick run through it would usually keep the nasties from getting to you, especially if they’re distracted by the Hounds. Beefalo Herds and Pig Villages work the same, since Beefalo fight back and Pigs dislike them by nature. Once you hear the last Hound die, you can then go back and pick your loot up!


Be careful when picking things up in the Marsh, though. If you see stray items there, chances are that a Tentacle is nearby, and they hit hard and are harder to kill than Hounds.
If you have the right materials, you can lead them to your own traps, like Bee Bombs. Bee Bombs can first be crafted from the Fight tab with a Science Machine for 1 Board, 4 Bees, and 1 Flint, and are “armed” by pressing right the mouse button or the left direction button. Whenever anything aside from you approaches the bomb, it will explode, sending the bees at the direction of what triggered it.
If you managed to get a hold of an Alchemy Engine and some Hound Teeth from previous attacks, you can make a Tooth Trap with a Log, a Rope, and a Hound Tooth in the Fight tab.

, Getting cornered is the worst possible thing to experience when under attack by Hounds. They attack as a group, and even with the best armor possible, you’re still vulnerable to damage. Since Hounds increase in numbers for every few succeeding attacks, the danger of getting cornered increases as well, so don’t get caught and you won’t be mauled!"

Gather your supplies.,
Grab food.,
Build your camp.,
Keep warm.,
Hunt whenever you can.,
Avoid the winter mobs.",How to Survive Winter in Don’t Starve," If you’re lucky enough to last two weeks in the game, you’ll notice the weather slowly growing colder and the aesthetics of the game gaining a cooler tone. This sets in by day 16 of the game, and if you’re caught unprepared, then you’ll definitely freeze to death. So before anything else, before day 16 hits and you’re left frozen, make sure to gather as much materials and resources as possible. Items like Berries and Saplings don’t grow back during Winter, which means you wouldn’t get any of those for 16 days. You need possession of at least a Science Machine before winter, but an Alchemy Engine is even more preferable. With them around, you could create many sources of food, protection, and warmth you’ll be needing for the harshest 16 days of your playthrough. Even if you’re playing Reign of Giants, Winter is still the harshest season of the game. Preparation must start at day 14 at the absolute latest, since you’ll be using day 15 to do some last-minute checking and to brace yourself against the cold, figuratively speaking.


You can gather most of your necessary materials by going up to it and left-clicking (PC) or pressing X (PS4) on the item. Berries, Carrots, Stones, Flint, Twigs, and Cut Grass must be stockpiled obsessively since Berries and Twigs don’t grow in the winter. Carrots, Stones, and Flint don’t grow back, and Grass grows extremely slowly in the winter. Carrots can be found poking out of the ground. Berry bushes are scattered around the world. Stone and Flint can be picked up anywhere, though Stone is less common. Twigs come from dried-out bushes called Saplings, and Cut Grass can be gathered from long, yellowing tufts of grass found nearly everywhere in the world. Stone and Flint can be more easily acquired by mining boulders with a pickaxe, and Logs have to be chopped from trees with an axe.
You’ll be needing at least a Pickaxe and an Axe to gather some of the required materials for prolonged survival. They’re both available through the Tool tab, represented by a crossed axe and pickaxe icon. Axes cost 1 each of Twig and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials. To use, select them by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.
Making a Science Machine requires a Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and is made in the Science tab, which is located in your crafting hotbar (right-hand section of your screen on PC and L2 on the PS4) and represented by an atom icon. An Alchemy Engine can be made in a Science Machine for 3 Cut Stone and 4 Boards under the Science tab.

You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world); mining yellow-streaked Boulders, which are dominantly available in rockylands; or finding them scattered around Graveyards.


Trees are not affected by winter, and you can keep planting as many trees as you want in winter and keep chopping them down. To plant a tree, you need a pinecone dropped from felled trees. Select it and right-click (PC) or press the left direction button (PS4) on your chosen spot to place your tree. In about a day in the game, your tree will sprout up into an actual tree, which you can chop down immediately. You can also wait another day or so for it to grow bigger, and thus yield more wood. Small trees only yield 1 log, bigger trees yield 2 logs, and fully grown trees yield 3.;
, Aside from Berries and Carrots, you need Meats and perhaps even plant a few crops to stockpile. You can acquire meats easily through trapping, and you’ll need a farm plot to grow produce. But only trapping remains a steady source of food during winter, since farm plots freeze over when winter hits.


To make a trap, you need 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs, and you can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick.
With a Science machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab, and functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds. You can get silk from killing Spiders, which are normally found in their Dens, which resemble a white mound with cobwebs.
To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine, and you can make through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.), excluding seeds. Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can place a seed into it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food!

There is a better version of a farm plot that grows crops faster. You can make it through an Alchemy Engine for 10 Grass, 8 Manure, and 4 Stone. But they both yield the same crops either way.



, While Don’t Starve doesn’t have any traditional building mechanics like other sandbox games, you can still make an impressive hideout for your survival needs. At the very least you’ll need at least a Pit Fire, 5 Drying Racks ready and Drying Meat, plus some storage for leftover vegetables and berries from your foraging ventures.


To make a Pit Fire, you need 12 Stones and 2 Logs. You don’t need your Science Machine or Alchemy Engine to make one. Head over to the Light tab, represented by a flame in your crafting hotbar, then select the second option there. Pit Fires are permanent structures and can keep you warm for a very long time as long as you keep feeding it fuel. Even when it’s extinguished, you can simply rekindle it by dumping fuel into it. You can also make regular Campfires for 2 Cut Grass and 2 Logs, but it isn’t permanent, and you have to keep it going indefinitely or it extinguishes and leaves only a pile of ashes. You can also make a torch with 2 Twigs and Grass, which provides you temporary portable light and heat, but isn’t as good as Campfire or Pit Fires.

To feed fuel to a Campfire or Pit Fire, select some flammable material (logs, grass, twigs, manure, petals, and grass or log suits are some flammable material), then interact with the fire by clicking on it (PC) or pressing X (PS4). It will immediately drop the fuel into the flames and consume 1 unit of said material.


To create a drying rack, you’ll need 3 Ropes, 3 Charcoals, and 3 Twigs. To use, simply select a piece of meat of any kind, except meaty bulb, and interact with the rack. The meat is then placed on the rack and dries into jerky in a few days, which is one of the best foodstuff in the game. Keeping plenty of jerky around during winter is a great way to keep yourself alive, healthy, and sane.

You can get charcoal by burning down a tree with a torch, but you have to be careful since fire spreads, and you might accidentally burn down your entire campsite with a single careless flame.



, Keeping warm is the most vital part of winter survival. At dangerously low temperatures, you’ll start freezing, which decreases your health periodically in huge amounts. There are many ways to keep warm, such as staying near your fire, wearing clothes, or carrying a thermal stone in your inventory hotbar.


Clothing can be created through the Dress tab, which is represented by a green top hat icon. The easiest to make is Rabbit Earmuffs, which costs 2 Rabbits and 1 Twig, and can be crafted through a science machine. The warmest clothing require hard-to-get materials, so unless you want to expend a lot of effort into getting them or have gotten them early enough, then by all means, make them!
Once you have an Alchemy Engine, you can craft a thermal stone in the Survival tab, for 10 Stones, 3 Flints, and a pickaxe. To use, drop it on the ground next to a fire, then wait until it turns bright orange. Then pick it up and keep it with you always! Placing it directly in your crafting inventory would keep you much warmer for a long time than keeping it in a backpack. Alternately, you can simply let it recharge by standing near a fire.

, Your only reliable source of food is Meat. While you may have some vegetables and berries left over in scattered bushes, farm plots, and maybe even a few carrots left in the ground, they’ll eventually run out if you rely on those. Trapping rabbits and birds will be your most reliable method of procuring food throughout the game, and must be done in a regular basis to supplement your stockpiled rations.

, Once winter sets in, two very dangerous mobs spawn. One of them is the Walrus Hunting Party, and the other is the extremely dangerous Deerclops. Tackling them unprepared is tantamount to suicide, and even with ample preparation you’ll still have the short end of the stick during encounters, so it’s best not antagonize them unless you’re feeling very lucky or have acquired late-game weapons and armors.


Walrus Hunting Parties spawn in pre-determined campsites. They’re distinguishable by a reddish circular marking on the ground during the warmer season and becomes a full-fledged igloo once the cold sets in. If you look at the map (tab on PC, touch pad on PS4), it would be represented by an igloo regardless of season. The Walrus duo are active in the day and sleep at night, and have two Blue Hounds guarding the igloo. If they spot you, they’ll trail after you over a huge distance and can be very hard to shake off, much less defeat, though thankfully they only start attacking you if you’re near them or if you hit them first.
Deerclops immediately spawn in random areas of the map once winter sets in and will roam around until it finds the player. Deerclops are much more dangerous than the other winter mobs, and would gleefully trample and demolish your camp if it manages to find you there. Don’t even try to fight it if it does find you. Just hit it once to lure it away from your camp and keep running until it loses interest.

Defeat the Bubble.",How to Avoid Bubbles in the Legend of Zelda2," In these versions of the game, a Bubble takes the form of a skull with bat wings on each side engulfed in a ball of fire. It either floats in mid-air or jumps on the ground, and will attack your character on sight.

, Bubbles are indestructible unless you put out its ball of fire first. To do this, raise your shield by pressing the Right Shoulder (R) button on your N64 or Wii controller, then tap the Left Shoulder (L) button on the other side of the controller to do a Shield Bash on the Bubble. This will diffuse the fire, leaving the Bubble vulnerable.

, Once the Bubble’s fire has been put out, it will jump around the ground trying to avoid you. Take out your sword and attack the monster. It will take around two strikes of your sword to defeat the Bubble.

Build, explore, and gather.",How to Survive in Don't Starve," At the very start of the game, you must gather Twigs so you can chop down trees. You can gather some from saplings around the world. Also, make sure to pick up Cut Grass whenever you can.


A Twig is one of the requirements to create an Axe and craft Torches.
Twigs are also a source of firewood.
Cut Grass is useful in creating Traps, Torches, Campfire, and basic armor later in the game.;
, As you explore the world, pick up Flint and Stones lying on the ground along the way. They can also be mined from boulders later on when you have the tools.


Now you can combine 1 Twig and 1 Flint to make an Axe.
Use the Axe by right-clicking on it from the belt, and then right-click-hold a tree to start cutting it down.
The cut tree will get you Pinecones (which can be planted to get new tree saplings) and Wood for firewood. The flame from Wood lasts longer compared to other materials.
An Axe has 100 durability and can be used as weapon that can inflict 27.2 damage to the enemy.
With 2 Twigs and 2 Flints, you can also make a Pickaxe so you can start mining.

, Food is very important in this game as your character is supposed to defy starvation. There are many kinds of food, but in the early part of the game, the food you can gather quickly are Berries, Carrots, Rabbits, and Frogs.


On Day One, get 5–10 Berries to survive the day.
Eat only when your Hunger decreases to 80%.
Make a Trap out of 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. Place the Trap over a rabbit hole to trap Rabbits or near a pond for Frogs. Just leave the Trap and carry on with gathering materials, but be sure to check if you’ve caught anything. The Trap shakes if there's something caught in it, and you can simply pick it up to gather both the Trap and the animal inside.
To get the meat, drag the Rabbit or Frog icon in your belt to the ground. When the animal stays still for a few seconds as if frightened, kill it with your Axe to get its meat.
Remember that food spoils, so gather food only if you're running low.
The only food that doesn't spoil are Tallbird Eggs, Mandrakes, Deerclops Eyeballs, and Guardian's Horn.
Any food can be eaten raw, but cooked food gives more health and satisfies your hunger better.

, A Campfire is key to basic survival in the world. It provides light and heat, and allows you to cook food. Build a Campfire as soon as it gets dark, and stay within its range. Once night falls, it's dangerous to travel for monsters appear in the dark.


To make a Campfire, you need 2 Wood and 3 Cut Grass. Remember not to make it too near flammable objects such as grass, trees and bushes.
A Campfire only lasts for 2 minutes and 15 seconds, unless more fuel is added. Be careful when doing so as adding too much fuel may cause nearby trees, grass, saplings, and any other flammable objects to catch fire, which can worsen into a forest fire.
Use a Fire Pit to be safer even though it requires more materials compared to a Campfire.
A Torch can be used as a source of light as well, but it dies out after a minute or so, leaving you in complete darkness and making your character vulnerable to monsters.

, Come morning, continue with your gathering of food and supplies. Dig boulders for Gold or look for it on the cemetery grounds. The cemetery is hard to miss what with its eerie atmosphere and the fog that leads to it.

, A Backpack is a survival item that serves to expand your inventory and gives +8 inventory slots. It’s very handy for players who have yet to find a perfect spot for their base.


You easily can make a Backpack by using the Science Machine, and 4 Cut Grass and 4 Twigs for the Backpack
To make a Science Machine, you need 1 Gold, 4 Wood, and 4 Rocks.

, Wormholes are living tunnels that connect two points in the world. They may appear as mouths on the ground that open when approached. Once you jump inside the Wormhole, your character will be spat out the other side of the tunnel.


Often, Wormholes will be book-ended by two completely different areas with different resources, such as a Forest and a Savanna.
Building a base near a Wormhole is wise because of the quick travel and the easy escape it offers if MacTusk or a large pack of Hounds and Deerclops attack your camp. When you’re ready, return to kill them and reclaim your camp. Having a camp at both ends of the tunnel will work in your favor.
Using the Wormhole decreases your Sanity. Pick up Flowers or let your character sleep well during the night.
A sick Wormhole can only be used for one-way travel. Once these Wormholes are used, they shrivel up and die. Sick Wormholes look like the healthy ones, but with lips more steeply tinted in yellow or green.

, It’s a perfectly safe source of light and warmth for your base since a Fire Pit doesn't burn down flammable materials nearby.


You can also cook food in it, and a Fire Pit makes fuel last twice as long compared to a Campfire.
To create a Fire Pit, you need 2 Logs and 12 Rocks.

, Inflicting 34 damage and with 150 uses, the Spear is an effective, easy-to-use weapon for players just starting the game. Use it to hunt down monsters such as spiders, which drop Silk that can be used for crafting.


Make your Spear with 2 Twigs, 2 Ropes, and 1 Flint using the Science Machine.
Make Rope with 3 Cut Grass.
You can also kill Frogs using the Spear as an alternative to catching them with a Trap.

, Now that you have a weapon, you will need a basic armor to survive the long fight. The Log Suit is the easiest armor to craft with 8 Logs and 2 Ropes using the Science Machine.


Note That wearing a Log Suit makes you slower

, With the different kinds of materials already in your belt, it's dangerous to lug them around during explorations. If you die, the items you have in your belt will be dropped. Once you have a base, make a Chest as storage for your belongings.


Make a Chest with 3 Boards using the Science Machine.
Make Boards with 4 Woods using the Science Machine.
You can also create multiple Chests.
You can place food in the Chest, but it won’t stop food from spoiling.

, Lastly, you can craft a Tent for your character since waiting for sunrise every night takes time and decreases your Sanity. Using a Tent restores 50 Sanity and 60 Health at the cost of 75 Hunger, and sets the player's body temperature to maximum when used. A Tent can be used six times before it disappears.


Create a Tent with 6 Silks, 4 Twigs, and 3 Ropes using the Alchemy Engine.
If you don't have the Alchemy Engine yet, you can use a Straw Roll instead.
The Straw Roll is a one-time survival item that, like a Tent, can be used to skip dusk and night.
Make your Straw Roll with 6 Cut Grass and 1 Rope using the Science Machine.
Using the Straw Roll restores 33 Sanity but consumes 75 Hunger.

, As you continue playing, surviving becomes painful, and eating Cooked Morsel, Frog Legs, and Berries won't be enough. Food you gathered are also easily spoiled and with hardly enough good effect on health. You need a Crock Pot to have better food for health regeneration.


A Crock Pot is a contraption that lets you combine and cook four food items into a recipe.
Craft it with 3 Cut Stones, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs using the Science Machine.
Get Cut Stones from 3 Rocks using the Science Machine.
Charcoal can be gathered from burnt trees. If there are no burnt trees around, look for a small patch of trees (preferably far from the thick forest), and torch them down.
There are lots of food you can whip up with your Crock Pot, and it's not really necessary to use 4 food items for a meal. For example, you just need Fish and Corn to create Fish Tacos, and 1 Vegetable to create Ratatouille.

, An Alchemy Engine is a craftable science structure that unlocks more crafting recipes to aid in your survival. With much more powerful weapons and tougher armor, you can withstand any Hound attack and increase your chances of survival, especially during harsh winters.


To create an Alchemy Engine, you need 6 Gold, 4 Boards, and 2 Cut Stones.
With the Alchemy Engine, create an Ice Box where you can store your food, thereby reducing the spoilage rate by 50%.
An Ice Box requires 2 Gold, 1 Board, and 1 Gear.
You can gather Gear from clockwork monsters.

, Having a Farm is possible in the game. Weapons, armor, and other items can be crafted easily with the proper materials gathered around the world. A Farm, however, requires patience, and you need seeds to plant.


To have a really good and fast harvest, you need an Improved Farm, which can be crafted with 10 Cut Grass, 6 Manure, and 4 Rocks using the Alchemy Machine.
Manure can be found and gathered by exploring a Beefalo Field when you chance upon one. Beefalo herds can be found in Savanna biomes and won't attack you unless provoked.
You can also use Manure as fertilizer for your plants.
Farming seeds give you random results, with plants producing either vegetables or fruits.

, Now that you have the essentials, you can survive the game for days. Just make sure you’ve built walls around your base, and you have enough food in your Ice Box. Explore the area to unravel its mysteries, and gather what you need for your next weapon and armor. Keep in mind that going up a level will have you starting all over again.

Chop some more trees!",How to Turn Into a Werebeaver in Don't Starve," The Werebeaver is Woodie’s unique ability to go from semi-rational lumberjack to slavering powerful beast, and this process can be beneficial to the early game player with little to no resources. But before deciding to go full beaver, players must take precautions and prepare for the transformation.;
, When you chop down trees, young or full grown, you always find yourself picking up some pinecones. Planting them in a nearby area would ensure a steady supply of Logs, and also give you an easily-accessible place to trigger the transformation.


In RoG, there’s a new type of tree called the Birchnut Tree, which drops Birchnuts instead. Birchnuts can be cooked, unlike pinecones, but it’s better to plant it than eating it.

, Basically, this is a Chest or a Backpack full of food, some crafting materials, some healing materials, and maybe a weapon and armor for added protection. This is because the aftermath of a Werebeaver transformation weakens Woodie thoroughly, with only 50 points each of all three gauges. This is not a very good position to find yourself when you have no weapons, no armor, and no resources. Most of the necessities require a Science Machine, however, so best make one as soon as possible.


Science Machines are made through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, for 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks. Afterwards, place it down on the ground, and start learning recipes! You can’t move the Science Machine after placing it though, so make sure the area is safe.
Backpacks can be made for 4 each of Twigs and Cut Grass, and you can learn to make them on your Science Machine’s Survival tab, represented by a looped rope. Chests require 3 boards, another thing you can make in the Refine tab (diamond icon), and you can learn to make them on your Science Machine’s Structures tab, represented by a wooden hammer.
You can make Healing Salves from Ashes left over from your campfires and a Spider Gland from when you kill spiders. You need a Science Machine to learn this, and they can be made under the Survival tab.
Weapons and armor can be made in the Fight tab, represented by two crossed swords. At the very least, make a Spear and a Log Suit to place in your survival kit to help prolong Woodie’s life post-transformation. Spears require 1 Flint, 2 Twigs, and a Rope; Log Suits need 8 Logs and 2 Ropes; and you can learn to make both of these recipes through your Science Machine.
Food like Jerky, Popcorn, and Pierogi last about 20 days and heal you for a bit of all three stats, while Honey, Seeds, and Butter last 40 but are less filling and restorative. Consider stockpiling food that last more than ten days at least before transforming. You’ll need a Farm Plot, a Drying Rack, and a Crock Pot to make the first three food items mentioned, while the latter three can be found by killing bees, on the ground, or by killing Butterflies, respectively. All three mentioned structures can be made in the Food tab, represented by a carrot icon.

, This is similar to your base camp, if you’ve made one, but with less structures. And by less, I mean it contains, at most, a Firepit, a “survival kit” or two, and maybe a Science Machine.

, Before transforming, take off everything in your inventory and place them in Chests, Backpacks, and the like to prevent item loss. If you’re using the tree-chopping method, use Lucy instead of any other axe type, since Lucy shows up in the Map whenever you drop her.

, This is the first method of transformation and is also the most reliable. To transform, you need to chop trees approximately 38 times with Lucy equipped. You’ll know when you’re close to transforming when Lucy the Axe starts warning you and telling you to slow down. Note that it doesn’t matter what Axe you’re using, Lucy just fells them all faster and even gives you warnings before the transformation, giving you an idea when you’re just about to turn. After you’ve chopped down 38 trees, you’ll transform.

, This second method is an RoG-only one, and involves the new Lunar Cycles mechanic. At the start of the game, the moon starts waxing until it becomes full at days 9–10, and then Woodie will transform into a Werebeaver.


After days 9–10, the moon will begin to wane until it’s a new moon on days 17–18, wherein it starts waxing again. You can see the phase of the moon right next to your clock.

, While you drop everything in your inventory when you transform, you can do so much as the Werebeaver! You can break every structure, dig up plants and graves, smash trees to bits, and he even comes with perfect, unlimited night vision! His only drawback, aside from the no-inventory thing, is that the Log Meter, which replaces the three regular gauges, is constantly draining. You can fill it back up by eating things like Logs, Grass, Berry bushes, and Twigs; but aside from that hiccup, you can use the Werebeaver to assist you in farming resources for free, fighting off hazardous mobs and bosses, and generally clearing out an area as you see fit.

, Post-transformation, don’t charge at everything you see. After the Log Meter depletes, you’re left weak, hungry, and generally helpless. With only a measly 50 in each gauge, you have to be careful. You have no weapons or armor and have precious little health in your system. This is when the aforementioned survival kits come in handy, providing you with everything you need to heal up and survive another day.

, Now that you’re Woodie again, this means you have an inventory, which means it’s time to clean up the Werebeaver’s mess and take everything you can use. While this means several trips back to your main camp and possibly having to build a lot more Chests and Backpacks, this would also provide you quite a bit of resources. Just make sure to gather the perishable items first, like Meats, before taking everything else.

, If all else fails and you find yourself in a fix, grab an Axe and start chopping! This will turn you back to the Werebeaver, and when you de-transform, you’ll be back to having 50 points in the 3 gauges!"

Start gathering materials.,
Craft an Axe.,
Chop a tree.,
Build a campfire.,
Remember to fuel the fire.,
Eat your food items.,
Avoid fights.",How to Survive the First Night in Don't Starve," Once you spawn in a new world, scout out your surroundings for whatever you can scavenge. Nearly everything you can initially grab is vital for survival in early game. Bushes with red dots give you Berries, Carrots are found on the ground, Flint is normally found scattered around the area, and Twigs and Cut Grass can be harvested from dead bushes (oddly called Saplings in the game) and long Grass Tufts. You’re going to need as many of those as you can find before the clock, found in the upper right part of your screen, moves to the red part.


In the PC version, simply click the desired items to pick them up. On the console, run up to the items and press X. On the iOS version, just tap it or press the green hand symbol on the right-hand portion of the screen.;
, Look at the bar at the left of the screen. You probably noticed some “ding” noises while gathering and that some of the icons there turned green. Check if the Tool tab (the pickaxe and axe icon) is green. That means you have gathered enough materials to make some items in the tab. The most important tool at this point is the Axe, which costs exactly a Twig and a Flint.


On the console, you can access the Crafting tab by pressing L2, then scrolling the choices with the right analog stick. Go to the Axe, and select with X (or Left click)!
To equip the tool, right-click it on PC, select it with the right analog stick and press the right directional button on the D-pad on the console edition, or just tap it and select “Equip” on the iOS.
If you have enough materials, you can also make a Pickaxe in the same tab with 2 Twigs and 2 Pickaxes, and it is used to break down Boulders scattered in the world.

, Now that you have your Axe, head on over to the nearest tree and start chopping. When the tree is felled, gather the logs surrounding you before the clock moves to the blue section.


To chop the tree down, have your axe equipped and left click, press C, or tap and hold the tree.
You can do the same for Boulders when you equip a Pickaxe. Boulders drop Rocks, Nitre, and Flint when broken, and darker Boulders with yellow streaks in them replace the Nitre with Gold Nuggets.

, Make a Campfire before the clock finally turns to the blue section. If you look at the Crafting tab, you’ll notice that the icon with the fire has turned green. That’s the Light tab, where you can make a nice, warm fire to cook your food and ward away the darkness. This is important because if you wander around in pitch blackness, a monster will attack you and damage both your Health (the heart gauge on the upper right of the screen) and your Sanity (the brain gauge in the upper right of the screen) quite a bit! Simply select the Campfire in the list, which costs 2 Logs and 3 Cut Grass. After you’ve built it, run to a clear area and place it. Just make sure you do this before the clock turns blue, which is when your screen will turn black!


If you have 12 Rocks, you can make a Fire Pit instead. It costs 2 Logs and 12 Rocks, and is a permanent structure, meaning you can’t move it. However, it also means that if the fire runs out, you can just fill it with fuel to start it up.

, Campfires tend to extinguish themselves after a while, which means you need to toss some fuel into it. Run up to your fire with some Logs, Twigs, or Cut Grass selected, then interact with the fire. It’s left-click for PC, X for console, and tapping for iOS. This will feed the items to the flame, prolonging your source of light!

, The Hunger gauge (stomach gauge under Health and Sanity gauges) is constantly draining, and if you don’t eat anything soon, it will empty itself quite rapidly and you start taking continuous Health damage until you feed yourself or die. Remember those Carrots and Berries you picked? Time to eat them near the safety of your fire! You can do so by selecting the food and dragging it to your character on the PC, selecting it and pressing the right button on your D-pad on the console, or by tapping it and selecting “Eat” on the iOS. You’ll normally need at least 5 or 6 of those foods to raise your stomach back to fullness.


You can also cook your food on the campfire. Select the food then interact with the fire the same way you did to add fuel. Your Carrots and Berries will turn into Cooked Carrots and Cooked Berries, which take up a different slot in your inventory from the raw ingredients (which also means you need to have one or two slots free before cooking, or else they drop into the ground and probably burn to Ashes if you don’t pick them up immediately). Cooked food normally fill you up more than raw food, making this a better way to feed yourself early in the game.

, While managing to get into a fight in the first day isn’t hard, this game is quite happy to punish anyone trying to pick a fight with nothing but an axe or pickaxe, so until you get yourself settled and have made some other weapons and armors, don’t run up to any living thing and hit it with your axe! If you accidentally step somewhere you’re not supposed to and get chased by Spiders or Tallbirds, the safest option is running away until they stop following you. Same if you find a Beefalo and accidentally hit it—just run! You’ll probably waste some time, but you’ll at least survive!

Familiarize yourself with the rules.,

Begin a new Pokémon game.
,

Choose a starting Pokémon.,
Stock up with any kind of Potions, healing items, and TMs and HMs.,





Think about the Pokémon that may help you on your journey.,

Create a decent Pokémon team with different types.,

Grind up some levels.,

Start your journey.,

Find ways to earn money.,

Repeat the process and you will be a pro at Nuzlocke!",How to Do a Nuzlocke Challenge in Pokémon," Nuzlocke is where when one of your Pokémon faints, it's considered dead. Meaning that you will have to release it, or just keep it in a PC box but never use it again. And the final rule is one Pokémon per area. It doesn't matter if you made a faint by accident, or if you already caught it, first Pokémon you find in an area is that.
,, Choose a reasonable starter Pokémon.

For example, if you are doing Nuzlocke challenge in Pokémon LeafGreen or FireRed, you must choose between Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Bulbasaur is kind of a Special Attack kind of guy and is considered as an easy Pokémon to start with. It can eliminate the first two gym leaders for that game, but that's for people who want an easy runner, or if they like Bulbasaur because they find it enjoyable.
Squirtle is a normal runner, which develops good defense other than the rest of the stats to begin with. Squirtle can take out Brock (first Gym Leader) and make it neutral to beat Misty (second Gym Leader).
Charmander is the hardest to start out with. It has good special attack and speed to begin with, but it will have some trouble between Misty, Brock, and is neutral to Lt. Surge (third Gym Leader). Charmander can be chosen by people who feel like they want a good challenge.

, This is major towards the Nuzlocke challenge. Potions, Super Potions, Hyper Potions, Max Potions, and Full Restores are needed to survive this challenge. As you can see, poison will bother you in the game, so stock up on Antidotes just in case your Pokémon is poisoned and it will die by the time you reach the Pokémon Center.

Other status healers are recommended also, Antidotes are just the items to save you. Revives and Max Revives will be useless when you are going to run through this challenge, since you can't resurrect your dead Pokémon. TMs and HMs are important if you have a Pokémon with a poor move pool.
In Pokémon Sun and Moon, there are no HMs, only TMs, so you won't have to go to a Move Deleter to get rid of HMs you don't want on your Pokémon.

, For example, you meet up with a Tangela. Very solid Pokémon to have with decent stats to have, but a poor move pool to have (move pools are the selections of moves the Pokémon learns by gaining levels). Diglet/Dugtrio have powerful moves to have in their move pool but very weak against HP and defense/special defense. This is one reason to think about the Pokémon. All Pokémon all have advantages and disadvantages to start with., All Pokémon teams go up to six Pokémon. And to go through Nuzlocke, you need to have a unique Pokémon team. If you start out with Mudkip (Hoenn Region), and it soon evolves to Swampert, making it extremely powerful Pokémon. Swampert is a Water/Ground type Pokémon and only has one weakness (Grass). Having more than three Pokémon that have Water/Ground doesn't make it easy, in fact, harder than you might think. A team like Swampert, Swellow, Minun, Numel, and so on. That makes it a unique Pokémon team because all the Pokémon have some sort of different type. Remember, you need to run into these Pokémon!, Nuzlocke will be a pain if you have Pokémon five levels lower than a Pokémon you are challenging. To raise more levels, you can either battle wild Pokémon over and over, or battle trainers you probably missed. Don't let the Pokémon faint, or it's going to the graveyard., When you reach a new area where wild Pokémon are available, the first Pokémon you encounter is the one you may catch. You may not catch any Pokémon in that area other than that first. You must release your Pokémon or place it into a PC Box if it faints; as it is counted as dead., You need Pokedollars to be able to buy healing Items and others, so you are going to need to battle a lot of Pokémon Trainers (Grind levels by going to Wild Pokémon first), and selling some of your items. You don't have to sell all of your items, but the one's you don't need. For example, you can sell Nuggets, Big Pearls, and Revives/Max Revives. Those you don't need to use during your journey., Enjoy playing Nuzlocke and good luck at it!"

Remember the rules of Nuzlockes and Sololockes.,
Do your best!",How to Do a Pokémon Sololocke1," Choose your gender, name, and pick a starter. Choose wisely, because this starter will be with you the entire game.

Nickname the Pokémon. It's tradition in a nuzlocke to give a nickname to your Pokémon, so that you have a closer bond with them. That way, them dying will be more serious.
Don't just randomly pick a starter. Think of it's advantages and disadvantages in the game. For example, if you're going to be fighting Team Aqua, having a Blaziken as your choice might be harder than having a Sceptile.;
, Since you have only one Pokémon, you need to be ready for anything that's thrown at you. Take the time to level up a bit before moving on to another route.

Remember weaknesses and advantages. In a fight, you need to use the best move possible before your Pokémon takes too much damage.

,

You cannot catch any other Pokémon, as this is a Solocke. The only exception is an HM Pokémon, because a Pokémon like Blaziken, for example, cannot learn Surf. You'll need an HM Pokémon to learn this move. These HM Pokémon cannot fight in battles though!
No Revives. Once you die, it's over.
No soft resetting to avoid death. It's cheating, and the point of Nuzlocking is the challenge!

,

Try selling things you don't need or can't use. Revival items can be sold for a fair price.
Have a wide move pool for your Pokémon. Use TMs and Move Tutors to give it an edge against anything that it might encounter.

Make sure to take a picture of your Hall of Fame entry.",How to Do a Single Pokémon Run," You are best choosing a newer game, as they have better graphics and improved trading systems should you need to trade your one Pokémon in, as most likely, you will. Recommended games: Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, HeartGold/SoulSilver, Black/White, Black 2/White 2 (due to be released in English in Autumn 2012).;
, You will probably have to trade it in, but if your chosen Pokémon is a starter, or available very early, then you do not have to use the trading function. You can, like many people opt, choose your favourite Pokémon. You could also choose a fairly weak/underrated Pokémon, and try to prove its strength! Make sure you are able to obtain that Pokémon, and it's time to begin!

, Obtain your chosen Pokémon. You may have to wait until after you get the first gym badge to trade a Pokémon in - If so, then choose the easiest starter so you can get through to that point as quick as possible. After that, trade your starter for your chosen Pokémon. Try to get it at level 14-18, as it may not obey you if you have it too high, and the game will not be a challenge.

, When so, catch a very low level Bidoof, Patrat, Rattata, or something similar, so when you're done, you can put it away in a PC box forever (or take it out when you need an HM slave, next double battle when you are required to have two Pokémon, etc.)

, Make note of types, and keep the type match-ups in mind. Your Pokémon may be weak against the gym leader's type. If so, use TMs to teach move that have type advantage.

, Can't beat someone? Keep trying! Teach your Pokémon new moves. Try a different strategy. Train a little more. You'll win eventually. Just don't give up. Start EV training or specific vitamins and other items to boost your stats.

, Use type advantages and skill to overcome the Elite Four. Make sure you have plenty of Hyper Potions, Full Restores, and status healers. You can also give your Pokémon a helpful item to make it easier. If it's getting really tough, you may want to resort to X-items. Don't worry about Revives and Max Revives (Unless you are playing Pokémon Black/White, you'll find out why) - You only have one Pokémon so they're worthless.

, This is the hardest part of the game. It's time to prove yourself! The Champion usually has many types of Pokémon, at high levels, but your Pokémon, as you have only one and have been able to train it more, should be higher, at around level 75-80. Note that if you are playing Pokémon Black/White, the cover legendary Pokémon is required for N and Ghetsis, so Revives and Max Revives are of use. When you've won... Congratulations!

, People will have to believe you, and your Pokémon's awesome power now!

Understand what a Magikarp sweep is and why it works.",How to Do a Magikarp Sweep1," Basically, a Magikarp sweep is an epic strategy used by some Pokémon trainers that defeats the entire opponents' Pokémon team using Flail when Magikarps' Attack is maximized. How does it work? When Magikarp is holding a Focus Sash, it will endure a potential OHKO. And when you switch in a Smeargle, your Smeargle will use Belly Drum and then Baton Pass to your Magikarp. Magikarp will then use flail and KO the other team. It's not as confusing as it seems!

Also, think about the typing of your Pokémon and how it might affect the appearance of the Pokémon. For example, Ghost and Dark Pokémon tend to have dark color palettes and eerie appearances, while fire types have a warmer color palette and possibly fire somewhere in their design.

, Remember, it doesn't have to evolve. But if it does, how? Most Pokémon evolve by level, but Pokémon can also evolve by held item, friendship, evolutionary stone, trading, trading while holding an item, being in certain weather or in certain times of the day, when a certain other Pokémon is in the party, or any combination of these. Some Pokémon can also have different evolution possibilities in the same line depending on their stats, gender, held item, or even personality value.

, Or, better yet, create your own moves.

, This can take forever, so how about this: for a turtle, combine it with a Flying-type. Research words that mean sky. How about heavens? That's easy. Combine the words you found, it can be three, four, or even two. For this example, you could call it Turavens or Heartle. Choose one.

"

Consider your goals.,

Research all the Pokémon and their possible moves.,

Choose your Pokémon.,

Try basing a team around a specific move or battle mechanic.,





Be sure that your team includes a strong core.,





Have the right nature on your Pokémon.",How to Create a Balanced Pokémon Team1," If you're trying to beat a friend, then you need to build a team specifically created to counter theirs. If you're trying to make a team for competitive battling, then you need to make one that can stand up to the top Pokémon. If you're just bored, or you want to do it for the sake of having a team, then consider sticking to your favorite Pokémon.
, You may want to use a site like Serebii.net, Bulbapedia, or Smogon. If you cannot obtain the Pokémon you desire in your version, use the GTS in Jubilife City to trade for them. Unsatisfactory stats or moves of the Pokémon you traded for can be solved with breeding once you are done planning everything out.

Remember that to breed with a male Pokémon and keep the same species, the female needs to be replaced with a Ditto.

, If you're trying to beat a friend, then try to use Pokémon whose types are super-effective against his/hers. Also try to make strategies that can counter your friend's. For example, if his main Pokémon is a Snorlax who tanks (can take many hits while dealing damage to your team and healing itself with Rest): consider ""Sub-Punching"" it. Put up a Substitute, and then use Focus Punch the next turn.

All teams should have a high type variety, usually with no more than two Pokémon of the same type. This not only means mixing types, but also physical and special users as well. However, if you plan on Baton Passing Nasty Plot or Swords Dance, having more of one type of attack than the other will broaden your options a bit.
It's also a good idea to keep some Pokémon on your team that are not designed for attacking, but instead for healing other Pokémon or taking many hits. This is called ""stalling.""
If you aren't battling competitively, you don't have to be so selective, but it is a good thing to keep in mind, and your Pokémon team will be far stronger because of it!

, Some teams may be based around a single mechanic, like weather, Trick Room, or Tailwind. If you're going to go this route, your team should have many Pokémon that can take advantage of that effect. Be sure to include Pokémon that can balance out any weaknesses and one or two who can set up the field condition., This is essential for a competitive team. A core is two or three Pokémon whose strengths and weaknesses complement each other and who can switch in to each other's counters., Natures will decrease one stat by 10%, while increasing another by 10%. It's important to have one that will increase a stat that is important to that Pokémon, while decreasing a less important stat, like Special Attack for physical attackers."
"

Consider breeding Pokémon.,





Know that IVs (Individual Values) can be passed down.,

Breed for Hidden Abilities.",How to Create a Balanced Pokémon Team2," In order to get Pokémon that are optimal for battling, you may need to breed for desirable egg moves, IVs, or natures. Pokémon can learn moves from their parents. If both parents have a move that the baby can learn from level up, it will start with that move.

There are also certain moves, called egg moves, that a Pokémon can only learn by breeding a father or mother (from Gen VI onward) with that move.
TM or HM moves can only be passed down in games prior to Gen VI. These moves are only passed down from the father.
Natures can be inherited if the parent holds an Everstone. The chance is 50% prior to B/W 2, and guaranteed from then onward.

, An IV is a randomized hidden value for each stat, from 0-31. At level 100, a stat will be roughly increased by the IV value, with the increase being lower at lower levels. These can make a huge difference in the power of your Pokémon, as well as determining what type of Hidden Power it has. Therefore, you should have as close to 31 IVs as possible in each of your Pokémon's stats.

Hidden Power is a Special move learned by nearly every Pokémon which changes type and power based on its IVs. It can be useful for special attackers who need coverage of a certain type. There are online calculators which can determine what IVs you need for Hidden Power.
Three of a Pokémon's IVs are randomly inherited from its parents. If either parent holds a Power item (Power Bracer, Anklet, Band, Lens, Weight, Belt), the baby will inherit the corresponding stat. If both parents hold one, the baby will only inherit one of those stats from a randomly chosen parent. After that, the baby will inherit two other random IVs. From B/W onward, if one Pokémon holds a Destiny Knot, 5 IVs will be inherited.

, Hidden Abilities can be passed down if the female Pokémon has it. Male and genderless Pokémon can pass on their hidden abilities when bred with Ditto. The female Pokémon has an 80% chance to pass her ability to the baby. This chance does not apply if Ditto is one of the parents."
"

Plan out your team so that each Pokémon has a role.,

Choose your Pokémon's moves.,

Choose a strong lead Pokémon.,

Don't fixate on brute power.,

Check your team for weaknesses.",How to Create a Balanced Pokémon Team3," Look at the stats and moves of each Pokémon to determine whether it's a good fit for a given role. Consider the following formula:

Physical Sweeper (Pokémon with high Attack stat)
Special Sweeper (Pokémon with high Special Attack stat)
Physical Wall (Pokémon with high Defense, who can soak up damage)
Special Wall (Same as Physical Wall, but for Special Defense)
Lead (Pokémon who sets up entry hazards or field conditions early in the game.)
Crippler (Pokémon who inflicts status conditions, then switches out to a Sweeper)

, Be sure that the moves that you're assigning them are compatible. Except in some circumstances, do not have two moves of the same type on one Pokémon, such as Surf and Hydro Pump. This is because you will want to ensure that your Pokémon can defeat as many types of Pokémon as possible. Stat boosters and restoration moves are OK (Synthesis, Aromatherapy, Growth and Petal Dance are all Grass-type moves, but only one is used for attacking), as are moves like Flamethrower and Overheat, which can be used in different circumstances.

An attacking Pokémon should have a strong move/moves of its own type, as it will get a boost to this move's power (called STAB). It should also have coverage moves that can hit different types than your main attack, otherwise your Pokémon will be walled by certain types. Some attackers can use a set-up move which can bring its power up to ridiculous amounts, others might use some support move, healing, or switching moves like U-Turn. Priority is also a good idea, because moves of a higher priority will always go before moves of a lower priority.
Your team's tank is a hardy Pokémon with high HP that can take a lot of damage while you heal and manage your other Pokémon. Tanks should have moves like healing, Taunt, Protect or Substitute, or status. Moves like Aromatherapy or Wish that help your teammates are good too.
Support Pokémon use status moves to cripple opposing Pokémon, get rid of threats like set-up sweepers, get rid of entry hazards, or help your team.

, This is the one that you usually send out first. They are usually either fast, so that they can put out delayed moves and other hazards before your opponent can do anything. Sometimes, leads are bulky so that they can set up hazards multiple times throughout the match. They can carry an entry hazard, like Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes, set up a beneficial field condition, like weather, Reflect and Light Screen, or Trick Room, or Baton Pass boosts to another teammate. They also usually have moves to disrupt your opponent, status, or phasing, as well as an attack so they will not be completely useless once hit with Taunt., Remember that competitive battling isn't just about wiping out your opponent; it's about strategy and prediction, too. Be sure that you can lay traps (e.g. Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes). Have stat boosters such as Swords Dance. It may not look like much, as you may just want to attack as soon as possible, but Swords Dance doubles your Pokémon's Attack power. Even if it just adds 50%, try it anyway. Use moves with added effects, such as Flamethrower and Blizzard, which respectively have a chance of burning and freezing the target. Make sure that the moves you use are complemented by the Pokémon's stats.

For example, using Flamethrower and Blizzard with a Pokémon that has a low special attack stat would be a bad idea.
Keep in mind that many Pokémon aren't offensively inclined. These Pokémon would likely be most effective with status moves that cause these effects, as they wouldn't do much damage with physical or special attacks.

, If you see that half of the Pokémon have a weakness to one type, then switch out at least one Pokémon. Simply giving your Pokémon a Water move will not protect it from a Gallade's Fire Punch, so don't try to simply change the move set. You'll end up wasting a move slot and not fixing the problem."
"

Plan out your team based on type.,





Choose a few Pokémon from the classic elemental types.,





Consider Pokémon from other common types.,





Try to use at least one resilient, physically-strong Pokémon.,





Avoid Normal types, in general.,





Select less common types for special effect.",How to Create a Balanced Pokémon Team4," Gym leaders and certain types of themed trainers often structure their teams around a certain type of Pokémon: water, electric, poison, etc. However, a single-type team isn't very balanced. Prepare your team to fight many types of Pokémon. You should have Pokémon on your team that are strong against most of the main types—even several of the most common types., A balanced team might include a Fire Pokémon, a Water Pokémon, and a Grass Pokémon. The three Starter Pokémon always give you a choice between Fire, Water, and Grass. For instance, in Pokémon X/Y, the Grass starter is Chespin, the Fire starter is Fennekin, and the Water starter is Froakie.No matter which starter you choose, however, you'll have the chance to acquire the other ""starter"" types in the wild or through trades.

Fire Pokémon are strong against grass, ice, bug, and steel types, but weak against water, ground, dragon, and rock Pokémon.
Water Pokémon are strong against fire, ground, and rock types, and weak against electric, grass, and dragon types.
Grass type Pokémon are strong against water, ground, and rock types, but weak against fire, poison, flying, bug and dragon types.

, You will probably encounter Bug, Flying, Poison, Psychic, and Electric Pokémon in the early game and throughout your adventure. This is not to say that they cannot be very powerful! Flying Pokémon, in particular, can be useful for quick transport as well as strong, hard-to-counter Flying-type attacks.

Electric Pokémon are strong against water and flying Pokémon, but weak against grass, electric, ground, and dragon types.
Flying type Pokémon are strong against grass, fighting, and bug types, but weak against electric, rock, and ice types.
Bug type are strong against Grass, Psychic, and Dark, and weak against Fire, Flying and psychic.
Poison type Pokémon are strong against grass and fairy, but weak against ground, rock, psychic and steel types.
Psychic type Pokémon are strong against fighting and poison types and ghost types, but weak against ghost, dark, and steel Pokémon.

, Ground and Rock types are resistant to a wide variety of common types, although they do have their weaknesses. Their defensive stats are usually high, which balances out the weaknesses of some other Pokémon. Fighting types are strong against some of the physical and commonly ""hard to hurt"" types, although they are open to great damage from special attack-prone types.

Ground type Pokémon are strong against fire, poison, electric, rock, and steel types, but weak against grass, flying, and water types.
Rock type Pokémon are strong against ice, fire, flying, and bug types, but weak against fighting, ground, and steel types.
Ice type Pokémon are strong against grass, ground, flying, grass and dragon Pokémon, but weak against fighting, fire, and steel.
Fighting Pokémon are strong against normal, ice, rock, dark, and steel Pokémon, but weak against poison, flying, bug, ghost, fairy, and psychic types.

, Some Normal Pokémon can grow to become very powerful, but they won't give you a significant leg up over any other type. Normal type Pokémon are not statistically stronger against any other type, and they are weak against fighting, ghost, rock, and steel. The upside of Normal Pokémon is that they are versatile: they can often learn TM moves from diverse other types., Dark, Dragon, Ghost, and Fairy are relatively rare in the Pokémon world, but these types can be some of the most powerful fighters when used in combination with hardier and more common teammates.

Dark type Pokémon are strong against ghost and psychic Pokémon, and weak against fighting, fairy, and bug Pokémon.
Dragon type Pokémon are strong against other dragon types, but weak against ice and fairy.
Ghost type Pokémon are strong against ghost and psychic types, but weak against dark and psychic types.
Fairy types are strong against dragon, fighting, and dark, and weak against poison and steel. They are resisted by fairy and fire.
Steel type Pokémon are strong against ice, fairy, and rock Pokémon, but weak against water, fire, and steel."

Train Pokémon through battles.,





Understand and utilize Effort Values (EVs).,

Use vitamins to supplement EV training.,

Use items to accelerate the level-up process.,





Use held items to prepare your team for battle.",How to Create a Balanced Pokémon Team5," This is more effective at increasing happiness and raising the strength of your Pokémon than if you use rare candies to gain levels quickly. For competitions, make sure all your Pokémon are trained to level 100. Otherwise, they will be at a big disadvantage., These are points that your Pokémon gain for defeating other Pokémon, whether it's in a trainer battle or in the wild. EVs are essential to raising strong Pokémon. Certain Pokémon give different EVs, so you should make sure you only train against Pokémon who give the right EVs, instead of just randomly. Note that you will not receive EVs in a link battle with friends or in the Battle Tower/Battle Subway. Consider the following list of Pokémon according to EV: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_effort_value_yield

You can have a maximum of 255 EVs per stat, and 510 EVs total on all stats. With every 4 EV points in a stat, it gains 1 stat point at level 100. This means that the maximum amount of EVs that can be used to increase a Pokémon's stats is 508. Because of this, do not give 255 EVs to a stat, but 252. This way, you have 4 extra EV's which can be used to increase another stat by one point.
It is usually a good idea to max out the EVs for a Pokémon's most important stat. However, in certain cases you can use less – such as if your Pokémon only needs a certain Speed stat to outspeed a common threat.
Figure out which stats you want to develop on your Pokémon, and figure out how many and which Pokémon you need to fight to reach those EVs. Make sure to keep a log of your progress. Consider logging stats in a spreadsheet so that you don't lose track., Buy as many vitamins (e.g. Protein, Carbos) for your Pokémon as you can, and use them before EV training. Each vitamin that you give to your Pokémon will increase its EVs by 10 in a certain stat. Vitamins can only be used for the first 100 EVs.

If you have 100 EVs or more, vitamins will have no effect. For example, Carbos gives your Pokémon 10 Speed EVs. If you use 10 Carbos with no previously gained Speed EVs, your Pokémon will gain 100 Speed EVs. If you already have 10 Speed EVs, you may use 9 Carbos. If you have 99, you may use 1 Carbos, and it will only give you 1 EV.
Remember to give your Pokémon EVs that they can use. Don't give an Alakazam Attack EVs, for example, because they are not physical attackers.

, If you're going to battle online, EV train beforehand using Power Items. Use the Experience Share or Macho Brace during early levels. The Macho Brace will double the EVs you receive from each Pokémon you battle, but it lowers speed while it is held.

Give your Pokémon Pokérus, if you have access to it. This also doubles the EVs, but without the speed depletion. The effects still remain even after the Pokérus is gone. This results in your Pokémon ending up with higher stats.

, Sweepers should hold an item to increase their attacking stats, like Life Orb, a Choice item, or Expert Belt. Assault Vest can be used for more bulky attackers, and Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed opposing Pokémon, or can be Tricked onto another Pokémon to lock them into a move. Defensive Pokémon can use Leftovers to increase their longevity. Poison types can use Black Sludge instead, in case their item is stolen. Megas will need their corresponding mega stone to Mega Evolve, and certain other items can be useful on specialized sets."

If you choose melee, go for the fire-type. (They can learn many strong melee moves)
If you go for tactical (ranged, in other games) then choose water-type. (They are very good at not making melee contact with enemies, giving them an advantage over Pokémon that rely on abilities like rough skin).
If you prefer taking advantage of the enemies' weaknesses, then use the grass-type. (They have moves such as leech seed that drain equal amounts of health regardless of type and level.)

Get your tools.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Create your crafting stations.,
Pick some flowers.,
Avoid monsters.,
Eat good food.,
Get some sleep.,
Get dapper!",How to Stay Sane in Don't Starve," You’ll be needing at least a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials for this venture. They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game) each, while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC), tapping it in your inventory (iOS), or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Now head up to a tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and either hold down the left mouse button or press the spacebar(PC), tap and hold your target (iOS), or hold down the X button (PS4) to wear them down so you can gather your materials.;
, Now that you have them, you’ll be using your tools to gather other materials you’ll be needing to make the necessities. Aside from what you can gather with your tools, you can also gather foodstuff scattered everywhere to help you last longer, and gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also vital for your campfires and torches.

, Now, if you’ve got the required materials, you can go make your own crafting stations now. This is vital for survival since the crafting stations lets you learn to craft so much more materials, structures, and tools you’ll be needing for prolonged survival. You can make a Science Machine in the Science tab (atom icon) right off the bat, but you require a Science Machine to learn how to craft an Alchemy Engine. These two crafting stations are the most important ones; however, most of the items that will be mentioned can be learned from the Science Machine.


A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and an Alchemy Engine costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon.

In Reign of Giants and the upcoming DLC Shipwrecked, the Alchemy Engine recipe replaces the 6 gold with 2 Electrical Doodads, which you can learn to make in the Science Machine’s Science tab. Electrical Doodads cost 2 Gold and 1 Cut Stone, making the recipe generally cheaper to make.


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.

, Picking flowers is a soothing action in real life and in the game, and picking one up can increase your Sanity a small bit. Not enough to completely fill your gauge in a single day, but enough to bring you back from the brink of insanity.


Once you pick about 12 flowers, you can use the petals to make a Garland. You can make it through the Dress tab (green top hat icon) right off the bat, and it heals your Sanity very slowly over time until the flowers wilt off. It won’t keep the night from draining your sanity, but can help you recover some in the daytime or slow down the draining effects at night.

, Simply put, if something looks unnatural and threatening, avoid it at all costs. Monsters drain sanity quite fast, especially if you stick around them. Boss monsters are even worse in this regard and can be quite persistent as well. So, as long as you’re low on sanity, or generally not ready to face any monsters, then just avoid them for as long as you can.

, Food is one of the many things you need to stay sane, since the Sanity mechanic of the game relies on the player “feeling civilized” to abate the oppressive, terrifying loneliness of living in a deserted island full of things that want to kill you. But plain old campfire food won’t cut it. You’ll need a Crock Pot or a Drying Rack, at least, to take advantage of the sanity gains from eating food, since they both offer better food than just cooking things in a campfire.


The recipes for the Drying Rack and Crock Pot can be learned through the Food tab on a Science Machine. The Drying Rack costs 3 Twigs, 3 Ropes, and 2 Charcoal, while the Crock Pot costs 6 Twigs, 6 Charcoal, and 3 Cut Stone.
The Drying Rack is fairly easy to use, just select some meat and interact with the Rack. It will hang up your meat, and in a few days, it’ll be ready for consumption! Note that while you can dry Monster Meat, the Monster Jerky that results will still damage your Sanity and Health, and is not advisable.
For the Crock Pot, you need to place individual units of food into 4 slots. Different combinations have different recipes, and different recipes have different boosts and gains. But in general, you will heal some sanity, health, and a lot of hunger with a crock pot dish, save for some exceptions.

, Now, when night falls and you have a stock of good food available, it’s best if you get some sleep. This will skip the entire night phase, but leave you dreadfully hungry in exchange. You can learn how to craft a Straw Roll from your Science Machine in the Survival tab (looped rope icon), and it costs 6 Cut Grass and 1 Rope. There are other “sleep” recipes you can craft if you have an Alchemy Engine, but this is the cheapest to make for one-time usage.


If you’re playing as Wickerbottom, you can’t go to sleep using the bed rolls or a Tent due to the character’s insomnia.

, You can craft clothing items in the Dress tab, and some of these clothes can be beneficial to your sanity. Aside from the aforementioned Garland, there’s quite a few articles of clothing that can give you small amounts of sanity, and wearing multiple articles of clothing can even halt the sanity drain from the night!


The easiest to craft, aside from the Garland, is the Top Hat. It costs 6 Silk, which you can get from killing Spiders, and you can learn to make it from your Science Machine.

Start cooking!",How to Spelunk in Don't Starve," The underground is a pretty dangerous place, more so than the surface. In fact, if you’re not prepared, you’ll die within the first day. Some renewable resources from above are not available underground, and so for every trip down there, you’ll have to stock up quite a lot of those resources.

Most resources available above-ground stock up to 40 per slot, with some exceptions. Bringing at least 1 full stack of Cut Grass, Twigs, Logs, and food would ensure prolonged survival during your trips.
Logs can stock up to 20 instead of 40. You can still carry more than that, but it takes up another slot of your inventory if you do.;
, Because Gold, Flint, Twigs, Cut Grass, and Rocks are all renewable in caves, you can afford to make your tools, armors, and certain weapons indefinitely. As for ruins, you only need to bring down Grass Tufts and Saplings in order to make all tools renewable.

Nearly all the weapons, save for the Thulecite Club, are renewable in the caves. In the ruins, all the weapons save for the Thulecite Club, Tentacle Spike, Bat Bat, and Ham Bat are renewable.
All armor except the Thulecite Suit and Thulecite Crown are renewable in caves. In the ruins, no armor is naturally renewable unless you bring down some Grass Tufts and Pine Cones, which would make Grass Suits, Log Suits, Marble Suits, and Beekeeper Hats renewable.

, Now all that’s left to do is to look for your way underground. Plugged sinkholes are basically craggy piles of rock scattered throughout the world. Normally, there are two of these found on the surface that lead to the first layer of the underground, the caverns, and another two found in the caverns (this time orange) leading into the ruins. To access it, simply start mining away with your pickaxe to reveal a hole and a rope, which you can then climb into.

If you find one on the surface early on and mined the rock, do not make your camp there or linger until dusk when unprepared. Batilisks spawn from the hole during dusk, and while they’re good to farm, they come in packs and could prove troublesome.

, Since the Caverns are always pitch-black, investing in portable lighting is a must. For a mobile source of light, the best ones are the Miner Hat and the Lantern. Both can easily be refueled with Slurtle Slime, Fireflies, or Light Bulbs, and both can be used while freeing up your hands so you can attack any opponents.

The Miner Hat prevents you from wearing head armor, but it keeps your hands free. The Lantern allows you to wear helmets, but need to be dropped on the ground before equipping a weapon to keep the light shining. This would, in turn, temporarily make your lantern a static light source until you pick it up and equip it again. It could also be stolen by Splumonkeys (underground-dwelling monkeys that steal items and sling manure as an attack) when it’s on the ground, which would take away what was probably your only light source, so be careful.
Fireflies are not renewable, so it’s not a very good idea to use them for fuel unless there really is no other alternative at hand. Light Bulbs and Slurtle Slime are both renewable—Light Bulbs from killing Tentapillars (absurdly large tentacles that spawn smaller ones when hit), and Slurtle Slime from feeding Slurtles (weird snail-turtle hybrids occasionally found roaming around the area) rocks or by killing them. A unit of Slurtle Slime grants 45 seconds of light and can be stored without spoiling. The Light Bulb grants 90 seconds of light, but spoils in 6 days.

, The clock mechanic from the surface is no longer available once you reach underground. Still, keeping track of the time is vital, especially when trying to get some sleep. The best way to figure out the time is by listening to the music of the game. Different music play whenever you move from day to night and vise-versa, so keep an ear out for whenever the music changes., This mechanic is only applicable in the Reign of Giants DLC, but it’s nonetheless vital. Outside weather and temperature will affect conditions in the caves and ruins. Rain will hydrate plants and slowly increase a player's wetness. Heat will cause crops to wither (but not catch fire) and eventually overheat the player. Cold will eventually freeze the player. Remember to prepare accordingly.

For the vanilla (non-DLC or mods installed) experience, the weather will not affect the gameplay in the caverns, so you can use it to escape the harsh Winter of the surface.

, Much like the surface, the underground is littered with unique wildlife. But unlike the surface, nearly all of them are extremely hostile towards you and attack immediately. So unless you’re sporting very good armor and weapons, try your best to avoid confrontation as much as possible., Depths Worms are one of the biggest problems in the caves. If you see a tempting, glowing blue flower, do not try to pick it! They spawn in swarms and act as the replacement of surface Hound attacks. Tooth Traps don’t work on them, but Bee Mines do!, If you see adorable Bunnymen walking about, or find some carrot-shaped houses, make sure you don’t have any meat in your inventory, or at least place those somewhere safe. Bunnymen tend to become hostile at the sight of meat, which includes Eggs. You can befriend them with Carrots from the surface since Bunnymen function mostly like Pigmen.

Oddly enough, carrying a Tallbird egg in your inventory or storing meat in Chester (an adorably hairy walking chest acquired in the surface upon picking up a randomly-spawned Eyebone) wouldn’t attract their ire. Equipping a Ham Bat, a Bat Bat, or a Tentacle Spike wouldn’t aggravate them either.

, Slurtles and Snurtles are just as slow as their component animals, but they pack a punch and have ludicrous HP on top of their hard shells. Because of this, it’s highly recommended to have a weapon better than a spear and wear a Log Suit or better when around them. Since they tend to retreat into their shells when attacked, it’s advisable to hit them when they poke out their heads instead of hitting their absurdly hard shells. Another option is to place large piles of minerals near their mounds. After an earthquake they will emerge to eat the minerals, and they will often fight each other over the resources. As long as you aren't carrying any minerals, you will be able to safely collect any slime, shelmets, or armor that they drop. Even if they don't fight, a large pile of minerals will ensure a good supply of slime as they sometimes excrete it after eating., Caves come with their own set of spiders, Cave Spiders and Spitters. Cave Spiders will act rather like Slurtles and Snurtles in the sense that they will retreat into their shells when attacked, while Spitter shoot webs at you, dealing fair damage. Since Spitters have no shell, they are fairly easy to kill once you get up close and personal with them. Preferably with a spear., Rock Lobsters are slow and strong, and when you give them rocks and other mineral items (other than Marble), they start following you around! You’re better off befriending them than killing them, since they’re extremely hardy and powerful., Batilisks are rather strange and unpredictable mobs at the best of times. Their behavior tend to vary wildly during encounters. Sometimes they will fly directly at the player, while other times they will pointlessly try to move through a wall. Much like Spiders, they tend to swarm if you strike one while others are nearby, and they have a habit of circling their prey. Strangely enough, sometimes they attack you all at once, while other times all they do is hover around you like ugly sanity-draining annoyances. Still, you should be wary when exploring the caves, since they’re “wandering” mobs with no nest or home to return to.

If you unplug the Sinkhole, Batilisks would spawn during dusk and night and return underground at dawn.
Batilisks are small, fast enemies, but a Spear and a Log Suit would be enough to lay low a swarm of them. Attacking them manually is inadvisable, but holding down F on the PC or the Square button on the console would initiate the auto-attack function, and make things easier for you.
Batilisks are worth farming, as they have decent drops and periodically drop Guano, which is better for fertilizing crops than manure if you plan on long-term survival underground or simply want some extra fertilizer for your camp.

, Splumonkeys are some of the most annoying mobs in the game, and are exclusive to the Ruins. They have the tendency to steal your belongings left on the ground, sling Manure at you (which damages both Health and Sanity), and are an all-around nuisance to your spelunking experience. They become even more dangerous during the Nightmare Phase. Fortunately, they go down quickly enough with a Spear if you’re fast. Just remember to watch out for other Splumonkeys in the area., Unless you're playing as Maxwell, your Sanity will constantly need replenishing due to the pervasive darkness of the underground, so it would be best to invest in many sanity-saving techniques and tactics. The first is getting sleep. Much like on the surface, sleeping can provide an instant, considerable sanity boost, but at the cost of a substantial amount of hunger. If you plan on using this as your main method of sanity recovery, make sure you have a good stockpile of food on hand.

Just a warning, though: a Miner Hat or a Lantern will still lose fuel, and all fires (including Night Lights) will be immediately extinguished whenever you go to sleep. If you sleep in an area where there are no natural light around, and your main light source doesn’t have enough fuel to last at least until the next day, the player will wake up in total darkness. This in turn would invalidate any sanity gain, as well as cause the Night Monster to attack unless you get to a light immediately.
In the Caverns, the best way is to simply camp out in one of the light shafts, near some Light Flowers, or beside a Mushtree. In the Ruins, you can sleep near Light Flowers or an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

, Clothes are another reliable way to restore sanity continuously, but unlike on the surface, some of the materials that make up the clothes that restore sanity are non-renewable in caves and ruins. For rarer clothing items, it would be pretty hard to keep them intact, because you’d need a Sewing Kit, which requires Hound’s Teeth from Hounds,. Hounds only spawn on the surface. However, you can still use certain clothes to raise your sanity without having to run back to the surface: Top Hat is a renewable item of clothing since it’s made from Silk, and spiders are abundant in the underground. The Thulecite Suit, which you can craft in the Ruins and bring anywhere afterwards, doesn’t degrade when worn unless you use it as armor.

If you brought some Butterflies underground, you can make a flower farm by placing the butterflies on the ground, which spawns a flower, then recapturing it to plant another flower. If you can get a few butterflies for your venture, you can make Garlands renewable this way.

, Cooking in your Crock Pot is always a good idea, since most dishes heal your sanity by 5 points, but to maximize your sanity gains, you’d have to consider using some of your more “valuable” or “filling” foods like Meat, Pumpkin, and Honey.

One of the best recipes, which increases all three gauges considerably, is the Meaty Stew. It costs about 3 Meats’ worth of meat products. You can simply use 1 Meat, or 1 Monster Meat, and 3 Morsels to make it.
If you have a Drying Rack available, you can simply dry out your assorted meats for Jerky and Small Jerky, which restore 15 sanity and 10 sanity each, respectively.

Find a good spot.,
Build a Fire Pit.,
Get some Gold.,
Build a Science Machine.,
Make an Alchemy Engine, if you want.,
Build more stuff.",How to Set Up a Base Camp in Don’t Starve," This is the most vital step for most players. By now, you probably explored a nice chunk of the surrounding area, which is good if you want to settle down somewhere you like. Choose an area where a lot of resources are easily accessible in just a few game hours, preferably in a biome like the Grasslands or the Savannah. Make sure that the area is about a screen wide and that you can easily clear out the area without any problems. Make sure too that you’re a short distance away from nearby mobs, like Spiders or Beefalo, or things like Frog Ponds so you won’t be constantly under assault whenever you’re hanging around the camp.;
, This is the first structure that you need to make, and probably the most important. A Fire Pit is like a Campfire and is made under the same crafting tab, but is a permanent structure that can be rekindled at any time. The fire even lasts longer than a Campfire too! You’ll need 12 Rocks and 2 Logs to make it though, but is definitely worth the effort and resources. When you place it down, it will generally serve as the centre of the camp.

, If you haven’t found any Gold Nuggets yet, now’s the time to hunt them down. You can normally get Gold from dark boulders with yellow streaks, but you can get them from other sources as well. The Gold boulders are normally found in the Rockylands Biome, which is characterized by the solid rock floor and the many boulders. They can also be found in the Mosaic biome, which is a very patchy biome with various turf types dotting the floor and an abundance of scattered Rocks, Flint, and Boulders.


If you’re lucky enough to find an overlarge Pig lying around, then congratulations, you found the Pig King! You can hand him some Meat and Meat items (excluding Monster Meat), and he’ll hand you a Gold Nugget in return. You’re better off just handing him Morsels, though, since Meat is much more filling, but they’re worth the same amount of Gold to him. The Pig King is normally found near Pig Villages, but can sometimes be found surrounded by Pig Guardians instead.
If you find a Mosaic biome, chances are that you might also find a Graveyard. It’s basically a patch of forest ground surrounded by mist, with graves and headstones scattered around. You can pick up some Gold scattered around it, and later on, when you have a Shovel, you can dig up the graves for some nifty loot. Trinkets, which are seemingly-useless items like the Gnome or the Gord’s Knot, can be traded to the Pig King for quite a bit of Gold as well. Keep in mind that digging up graves will sap your Sanity and have a chance to spawn some really nasty Ghosts.
In the latest update and in an upcoming DLC, called the Shipwrecked DLC, a new structure found next to the Ocean called a Sunken Boat spawns with a parrot named Polly. You can trade meat and trinkets with Polly in exchange for a Red Feather and a random selection between a Gold Nugget, some Flint, or some Dark Petals. In Reign of Giants and the upcoming Shipwrecked DLC, you can also fish out some floating junk with a Fishing Rod, which would yield you some new trinkets that you can trade only to Polly for a Red Feather and some Gems or Gold, depending on the trinket. You’ll want to hold on to the original trinkets for the Pig King, since he gives out Gold Nuggets, but trade the Soaked Candle to Polly for your gold. You can only trade with him once a game day, as well.

, Now that you have your Gold, it’s time to build a Science Machine. It costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Rocks, and 4 Logs. You can use this to learn new things to make, like new tools and new materials you can use to build better stuff with. This will be your first crafting station and would definitely improve your gameplay, and since the Science Machine is a permanent structure, like your Fire Pit, it’s best if you place it where you can easily access it. You can find it in the Science tab, which is represented by an atom icon.

, If you managed to scrounge up enough items, you can use the Science Machine to learn how to make the Alchemy Engine, which opens up even more items you can learn to craft. In the original game, it costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold Nuggets, while in the Reign of Giants DLC and the upcoming Shipwrecked DLC, it replaces the 6 Gold Nuggets for 2 Electrical Doodads, effectively making the recipe cheaper.


Boards and Cut Stones can be crafted through the Refine tab, represented by a white diamond icon, for 4 Logs and 3 Rocks, respectively; and Electrical Doodads can be crafted in the Science tab for 2 Gold Nuggets and 1 Cut Stone.

, Now that you have your basic necessities, you can feel free to make quite a lot more items! There are a lot of structures that can improve your life in this game, and several tools you can make to help you out further. Don’t be afraid to explore and experiment with the creations since they can all be useful to you when surviving in the long run.


One of the most popular structures you can make is the Crock Pot. You can learn to make it with a Science Machine in the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot. It costs 3 Cut Stone, 6 Twigs, and 6 Charcoal. You can obtain Charcoal from burning down trees and chopping up the burnt remains. The Crock Pot is one of the most loved items in the game since it lets you cook full meals that heal you in all 3 gauges when done right, and lets clever players take advantage of “poisonous” food, like Mushrooms and Monster Meat, and turn them into actually healthy meals.
You can also use the Charcoal to make a Drying Rack, which dries any and every Meat item placed on it into delicious, long-lasting Jerky.
You can also learn how to make Backpacks and Chests on your Science Machine. Backpacks can be carried and dropped in your camp, and you can store 8 items there, and Chests are more permanent structures and can keep 9 items. Backpacks can be found in the Survival tab, represented by the looped rope, and can be crafted for 4 Twigs and 4 Cut Grass. Chests can be found in the Structures tab, represented by the wooden hammer, and costs 3 Boards.

They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs since they’re vital for creating a Science Machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also your other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also vital for your campfires and torches.

, Aside from the Science Machine, you’ll also be needing an Alchemy Engine to create your supplies. Both can be created through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, but you’ll need a Science Machine to make an Alchemy Engine.


A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and an Alchemy Engine costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon.
You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.

, Since sleeping increases your health and sanity at the huge cost of hunger, make sure you have plenty of food on hand. Even just having a stock of berries and carrots in your inventory would be enough to keep you from dying of starvation.


Cooking your food over a campfire is an effective way to increase the hunger points gained by most food types. Simply select your food, walk up to the campfire, and left-click or press X to cook it.

, Seeing as you want to sleep, looking for a relaxing spot to camp out is always a good idea. Ideally, the area must be free from any Spider Dens, Beefalo herds, and Frog ponds. This is because Spider Dens and Frog ponds tend to spawn hostile creatures (Spiders for the dens, Frogs for the ponds), while Beefalo tend to become hostile and attack you during mating season, a time when their rears turn red.


Note that you can’t sleep if you’re in a dangerous area or if your hunger is too low, so only sleep if you need to regain Sanity quick and are either willing to suffer the penalty, or if you have enough food on stock.

, Most characters, excluding Wickerbottom, can sleep off their troubles by crafting Fur Rolls, Straw Rolls, Tents or, in the Reign of Giants DLC, a Siesta Lean-To. You can craft a Straw Roll, which you can use once, early enough in the game as long as you have a Science Machine. Fur Rolls and Tents require an Alchemy Engine, which is the second available crafting station in the game.


If you plan on making a Tent, seeing as it’s semi-permanent (cannot be picked up without destroying it with a hammer, wears out after 6 uses), you’re better off using the space as your main campsite. Tents themselves need a fairly wide space, and combined with a campfire might require a lot of space.
A Straw Roll is the easiest of the bunch to create, requiring 6 Cut Grass and 1 Rope to make in a Science Machine.
While both Tents and Fur Rolls are available and Fur Rolls can be brought anywhere to sleep with, Tents are more economic, since Fur Rolls not only need 1 Straw Roll but also require 2 pieces of a late-game item called Bunny Puffs found underground. A Tent only requires 6 Silk, 4 Twigs and 3 Ropes, which are readily and available on the surface.

, Your Sanity basically decreases the longer you go on without a semblance of civilization to hang on to, and what better way to emulate the feeling of being a civilized person than by wearing nice clothing?


Right near the very bottom of the crafting bar (located at the far left side of the screen), there’s an icon of a green hat. This is the Dress tab, where you can create clothing with different effects.

, Now, this may sound silly, but picking flowers is an excellent way to maintain sanity, especially early in the game. Each flower picked gives you 25 sanity points, and once you have 12 Petals from the flowers you picked, you can craft a Garland, a clothing item that, once worn, steadily increases your sanity until it wilts away in 6 days.


While most of the clothes are available only when you have a Science Machine or an Alchemy Engine, the Garland is available at the very start of the game.

, Other than Garlands, you can craft other clothes once you have the necessary materials. One of the most effective and easy to acquire articles of clothing you can make earlier on in the game is the Top Hat, which require 6 Silk and is crafted at a Science Machine.


Some clothes, while not possessing any ability to gain Sanity, have other functions. Straw Hats are used to make other hats, Beefalo Hats are used to keep you warm in the winter and would enable you to walk among the Beefalo during mating season without being attacked, and Beekeeper Hats render you nearly immune to Bees of all kinds.

, Eating food, aside from Monster Meats, is always a good way to recover hunger, health, and sanity. Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from rabbits caught in traps, berries picked from berry bushes, and carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger. However, for food that restores sanity, you'll need more thorough methods.


Carrots can be found poking out of the ground and Berry bushes are scattered around the world. You can pick them up by left-clicking or pressing X.
To catch rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick.
With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds.
To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food!

, Jerky and Small Jerky are long-lasting food items that restore quite a bit of all three gauges. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal.


Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the Trees. Each burned Tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal.
Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption!

, The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine and costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of sanity, as long as you figure out the recipe.


You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients.
Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.

, Sometimes, while exploring the world, you occasionally encounter giant pigs roaming around the area, normally right next to a hut or a set of huts. These are the Pigmen, who are presumably the dominant sentient species of the setting. You can befriend these strange piggies and gain Sanity when around them!

, You can befriend them by giving them Meat, and once befriended, they tend to follow you around and help you with fighting and chopping down trees. Aside from that, staying close to them recovers your Sanity continuously. Different meats have different values, and higher values make your Pig friends stay with you for longer periods of time!


Feed them as regularly as you can, with any type of meat you have on hand to keep them friendly.
Be careful with the Monster Meats! Feeding them 4 units of Monster Meat will turn them into a Werepig, which not only attacks you but also decreases your sanity upon close contact!

, As long as your Pig friends are nearby, you’ll be able to gain some amount of Sanity, but to really benefit from it, you’ll have to stick very close to them. As long as they are close at hand, you will continuously gain sanity as long as they remain friendly.

, Later on in the game, you'll also encounter giant rabbits, called Bunnymen, underground. Unlike the Pigmen, the Bunnymen can and will attack you as long as you're carrying meat, but is easily befriended when fed Carrots, which can be found growing on the ground in the surface. They function similarly to the Pigmen as well, and also help recover Sanity when nearby.

, Every so often, you can come across some objects and colorful piles of rock called Relics. Relics (and Broken Relics) are the remains of the Ancient Civilization that apparently ruled the land you are now trapped in. While for some people these objects are an archaeological blessing, for someone trapped and scraping at survival they are either only nuisances or possible boons.

, Rocks are plentiful and renewable in the underground, so don’t be shy! Pick up as many as you can and want, since they’re a valuable resource.

, Now, when you encounter Relics, you are presented with the choice to break them to pieces or restore them. While destroying them utterly with a Hammer would yield uncommon, possibly vital resources, repairing them with Rocks will restore 20 points of Sanity. For late-game players, either yield would be a boon or a burden, depending on the state of their resources and mental health. Choose wisely though, since Relics are non-renewable.

They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.

To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down and create the gatherable supplies.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs since they’re vital for creating a Science Machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also for other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also important for campfires and torches.

Rocks can be found scattered everywhere, much like flint, but are less common and are more abundantly found from mining boulders.
Everything initially gathered, save for Logs, can stack up to 40 per inventory slot. Logs, being heavier, stack up to 20.

, Aside from the Science Machine, you’ll also be needing an Alchemy Engine to create your supplies. Both can be created through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, but you’ll need a Science Machine to make an Alchemy Engine.

A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and an Alchemy Engine costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon.
You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Before you craft a Science Machine, make sure that you’ll be camping there permanently. Once you place the Science Machine, it cannot be moved. The Alchemy Engine is also a permanent structure and cannot be moved around.

Start the hatching process.,
Keep it warm.,
Keep it from cooking.,
Be patient.,
Feed it regularly.,
Be careful with your Smallbird!,
Keep an eye on its growth.",How to Hatch a Smallbird in Don't Starve," Tallbird Eggs start hatching when warmed to a point, and what better way is there than to build a nice, warm fire? Simply drop it near a fire or any kind for about 10 seconds and you’ll see the egg starting to crack immediately. After the initial warming, the Tallbird Egg would become a Hatching Tallbird Egg, which means you’re one step closer to getting yourself a tiny, adorable minion.


A Fire Pit would be best used during winter since it’s a permanent, refuelable source of light and heat. Campfires are better during the other seasons, since they extinguish more quickly, which means you can just work or explore the night away and come back to a still-hatching egg.;
, Hatching Tallbird Eggs would stop hatching when they go cold, and tend to dissolve into Wet Goop if kept cold for too long. So before you go to sleep, once night falls, or all throughout winter, simply drop the egg close to the campfire when it’s lit. This will keep your egg warm enough to progress hatching.

, Unless it’s winter, try not to keep it close to the campfire all day. The egg would overheat and cook your tiny friend before it’s even born, resulting in a Cooked Morsel. So place it away from the fire, or in your inventory, during the day.


Placing it in your inventory would pause the egg’s development, which means it will not continue hatching until placed back on the ground.

, The egg takes about 3 in-game days to hatch, give or take the time the hatching egg spends in your inventory. As long as you wait long enough and keep up the care, a tiny, hungry Smallbird would emerge soon enough!

, Smallbirds are frequently hungry, so you’ll have to feed them lots of seeds and raw berries to keep it happy. Simply walk up to them with the said edibles selected, then click or press X to feed it!


Once they reach adolescence and transform into Smallish Tallbirds, they can eat just about every edible thing (all types of meat, fruit and vegetable, rot and rotten eggs) and will eat anything left on the ground.
Smallish Tallbirds tend to peck at you, dealing a small amount of damage each time when they are hungry. Consider this incentive to feed them often.
If you don’t feed your bird often enough, they die in a few minutes. Two minutes for Smallbirds, and four minutes for Smallish Tallbirds.

, Smallbirds are tiny and fragile, but also over-eager to help your player when you start a fight! Which means that your tiny little baby bird will be put at risk and will probably get itself killed if you don’t keep a good eye on it. You should try your best not to pick fights with the really dangerous mobs, no matter how experienced you are, while they’re still tiny chirping fluffballs. Once they reach adolescence, they’re a lot more sturdy.


Smallbirds and Smallish Tallbirds are fully healed with every meal you give them.

, Smallbirds take 10 days to reach adolescence, and another 18 to become a full-grown Tallbird! Be warned, though: Tallbirds, even the ones you raise since hatching, are extremely hostile and territorial towards the player! So once you’re nearing the inevitable time and it starts pecking at you for reasons other than hunger, it’s best to keep your distance. But even so, this would only present a minor setback, since you could always get another Smallbird!

To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs, since they’re vital for creating a science machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the science machine and also your crock pot. Make sure you also have plenty of Twigs in stock, since not only are they required for the crock pot to be built, they’re also dead-useful for the recipes itself.

, You will need this to make your crock pot, so if you don’t have one yet, it’s high time to do so. It requires 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and is made in the Science tab (atom icon), which is located in your crafting hotbar (left-hand section of your screen on PC and L2 on the PS4).


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading meats with the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world); mining yellow-streaked boulders, which are dominantly available in Rockylands; or finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Once you make your science machine, it will immediately prompt you to place it down (press X or left-click). Choose the area to place the machine wisely since after placing it, you won’t be able to pick it up again.

, Now that you have a science machine, you can make a crock pot there through the Food tab for 3 Cut Stone, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs.


You can create Cut Stone through the Refine tab in the science machine, and costs 3 Rocks to make.
You can get Charcoal by burning down a tree with a torch, but you have to be careful since fire

, Once you get your Crock Pot, it’s time to consider what you can and can’t cook. Generally speaking, Meat of any and every kind can be used as an ingredient for your Crock Pot’s recipes, and any fruits and vegetables you grow or find is viable for consumption too! Mushrooms are great filler for many recipes and can be found practically everywhere. So just make sure to stock up on edible items before you start cooking!


You can add Twigs, Honey Comb, and in Reign of Giants only, Ice as ingredients despite being generally inedible. Some recipes call for those too, in fact.
Despite being edible, you can’t add Rot, Seeds, Petals, Rotten Egg, Hatching Tallbird Egg, Cooked Mandrake, Koalefant Trunk, Deerclops Eyeball, Guardian's Horn, Batilisk Wing, Leafy Meat, Foliage, Light Bulbs, or Glow Berries as ingredients.

, When you interact (click or press X) with your crock pot, a small menu will pop up with 4 slots. You need to fill out those slots with one unit of your food items then wait for around 40 seconds, depending on the recipe. There are many crock pot recipes for you to try out in Don’t Starve. As long as you have the resources, feel free to experiment in the foodstuffs you put in.


Don’t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian in one recipe, since it would yield a Monster Lasagna, which actually damages instead of heals and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity. Only do so if you plan on adding a Twig in your recipe.

, Crock pot dishes are amazing because most of the time, you only need the absolute minimum of ingredients to gain a hefty bonus to your meal. The only way to tell is by keeping an eye on your gauges, which you can do by hovering your mouse over the brain, the stomach or the heart icon in the PC, or by pressing R2 on the console. It might take a while, but you can calculate bonuses for each and every dish by first eating the completed meal, then eating individual units of your ingredients and taking note of how much health, hunger, and/or sanity they give you individually. Once you figure the individual benefits, you can then calculate the bonuses by adding the benefits of the individual recipes up, then subtracting the total sum from the benefits of the complete dish.


Most of the time, you’ll fumble and accidentally make a meal that’s less filling than the individual dishes itself, but don’t worry! Most Crock Pot dishes don’t call for specific ingredients unless specified, so experimentation is the key!
Twigs and Mushrooms (especially Red Cap Mushrooms most commonly found during the day) are the most efficient fillers, since Mushrooms are poisonous and actually carry penalties when consumed, but when used as an ingredient it will carry none of the risk for Monster Lasagna, and Twigs are completely inedible but can be used as an ingredient.
Berries are also an acceptable filler, but only because it’s one of the most readily available food in the world.

Stock up on food.,
Get to a safe spot.,
Make your bedding.,
Get some sleep.",How to Heal in Don't Starve2," Since sleeping increases your health and sanity at the huge cost of hunger, make sure you have plenty of food on hand. Even just having a stock of Berries and Carrots in your inventory would be enough to keep you from dying of starvation.

Cooking your food over a campfire is an effective way to increase the hunger points gained by most food types. Select your food, walk up to the campfire, and left-click or press X to cook it.

, Seeing as you want to sleep, looking for a relaxing spot to camp out is always a good idea. Ideally, the area must be free from any Spider Dens, Beefalo herds, and Frog ponds. This is because Spider Dens and Frog ponds tend to spawn hostile creatures, while Beefalo tend to become hostile and attack you during mating season, a time when their rears turn red.

Note that you can’t sleep if you’re in a dangerous area or if your hunger is too low, so only sleep if you need to regain Health quick and are either willing to suffer the penalty, or if you have enough food on stock.

, Most characters, excluding Wickerbottom, can sleep off their troubles by crafting Fur Rolls, Straw Rolls, Tents, or in the Reign of Giants DLC, a Siesta Lean-To. You can craft a Straw Roll, which you can use once early enough in the game as long as you have a Science Machine, but it won’t heal you. Fur Rolls and Tents can heal you and require an Alchemy Engine to create, which is the second available crafting station in the game.

If you plan on making a Tent, seeing as it’s semi-permanent (cannot be picked up without destroying it with a hammer, and wears out after 6 uses), you’re better off using the space as your main campsite. Tents themselves need a fairly wide space, and combined with a campfire, it might require a lot of space.
Both Tents and Fur Rolls are available with your Alchemy Engine, and Fur Rolls can be brought anywhere to sleep with. Tents are more economic, however, since Fur Rolls not only need 1 Straw Roll but also require 2 pieces of a late-game item called Bunny Puffs. A Tent only requires 6 Silk, 4 Twigs, and 3 Ropes, which are readily and available on the surface, and heals much more than the Fur Roll.

, Now that you’ve got all the preparations done for sleep, select your bedding or tent, and your character will automatically go to sleep. When your character wakes up, his or her Sanity and Health will be healed, but Hunger will be very low, so make sure to feed your character immediately after sleeping."
"
Choose your food options.,
Cook some Eggplants and Pomegranate.,
Dry out some Jerky.,
Cook with your Crock Pot.,
Eat what you cooked (or dried)!",How to Heal in Don't Starve3," Eating food, aside from Monster Meats, is always a good way to recover hunger, health, and sanity. Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from Rabbits caught in traps, Berries picked from berry bushes, and Carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger and a pittance of Health. However, for food that restore more Health, you'll need more thorough methods.

You can pick Carrots and Berries by left-clicking or pressing X.
To catch Rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a Rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a Rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the Rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a Rabbit is selected will do the trick.
With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds.
To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, interact with the crop to gather it. You now have some food!

, Of all the produce you can grow in your farm plots, the Eggplant and Pomegranate are the two most filling and restorative. Select your food, then go to your campfire, and you'll see the “Cook” command by the fire. Now, when you left-click or press X, you’ll immediately start cooking!

While Dragonfruit heal about the same as Pomegranate, it’s much more efficient to use it to cook a Dragonpie with a Crock Pot.

, Jerky and Small Jerky are long-lasting food items that restore quite a bit of all three gauges. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a drying rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal.

Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the trees. Each burned tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal.
Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption!

, The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine. It costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs, and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in four items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of Health, as long as you figure out the recipe.

You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients.
Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food with a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.
As previously mentioned, if you find yourself with a Dragon Fruit, you’re better off making a Dragonpie with it than cooking it over a campfire. It’s only requirement is a single Dragon Fruit and excludes all meat products and Mandrakes from the recipe. You can simply use Twigs and Berries as fillers to make an easy Dragon pie, which heals double the Health than simply cooking it would.

, Just select the food item and drag it to your character. When you see “Eat” when hovering the food over your character, click again. You can also right-click on the food item to immediately feed it to your character."
"
Know why you should hunt insects.,
Make your armaments.,
Make a Bug Net.,
Kill Spiders.,
Kill Mosquitos.,
Kill Butterflies.,
Kill Bees.",How to Heal in Don't Starve4," You can kill some insects to loot their wonderful restorative items. Butterflies, Bees, Mosquitos and Spiders all have one thing in common: They drop items that can heal your health, and the items from the Bees and Spiders can be used to create more successful healing items., While your axe and pickaxe can be serviceable for minor slaying ventures, you’re better off making a Spear and some armor for prolonged and more efficient hunts. You can make these necessities through the Fight tab, represented by a crossed sword and spear icon.

Spears cost 1 Rope, 1 Flint, and 2 Twigs, and are first crafted through the Science Machine. This is the first true weapon of the game and is rather efficient when it comes to killing early-game mobs. Equipping it is identical to equipping your tools. Select your item then equip it with right click or the right direction button.
Grass Suits can be crafted at the very beginning of the game and costs 10 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You equip them the same way you did with your tools and spear.
Log Suits require the Science Machine to make the first time, and costs 8 Logs and 2 Ropes.

, Aside from Spiders, you can catch bugs of any kind with a Bug Net. This would actually save you some time if you don’t want to bother killing but need some bug-related resources. You can make a Bug Net through your Science Machine’s Survival tab for 4 Twigs, 2 Silk, and 1 Rope. Afterwards, equip it, and swing it at the first bug (that isn’t a spider) you see., While one of the more dangerous creatures you can encounter in the surface, killing spiders can yield lucrative amounts of loot, including the ever-useful Silk and the restorative Spider Glands. By itself, it won’t heal much, but it can be used to craft the Healing Salve, which heals a decent amount of Health. Simply step on the “web” of a Spider Den, which resembles silk-wrapped, cobweb-covered mounds, and wait until a Spider emerges to chase you. You can then keep hitting it with your spear until it dies!

You can also set up traps around the Den and lure them into it if you feel extra cautious. The traps would drop the Spider’s loot instead of the Spider itself in your inventory.
Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock, and 1 Spider Gland and heals for 20 Health, compared to the 8 Health healed by the Spider Gland.

, While dusk is the most hazardous time to be in the Swamp, you’ll find that killing the Mosquitos will yield the healing Mosquito Sac item. It heals the same amount of health as a plain Spider Gland, but cannot be used to make more effective healing items. In a pinch, though, it’s very useful.

Mosquitos spawn from Ponds in Swamps, and immediately become aggressive towards you. Whenever they hit you, their bellies will grow more bulbous until they explode. As long as you kill them before they explode, they will drop a Mosquito Sac.
You’re actually better off trying to catch them with a Bug Net than killing them with your Spear.

, Butterflies are plentiful and adorable, but you can murder them and take their wings to heal yourself with. Like with Spider Glands and Mosquito Sacs, the Butterfly Wings heal you for about 8 Health. Unlike the other two, they lose freshness and eventually rot, reducing their effectiveness. But you can cook the Butterfly Wings into a Butter Muffin in your Crockpot for 1 Wing and 1 Vegetable, which heals you for 20 points. While Butterflies normally tend to fly away from you, when they land on a Flower they are vulnerable for a couple seconds. Use these precious seconds to smash it to bits and gather those precious wings!

Occasionally, instead of Butterfly Wings, a dead Butterfly drops Butter instead. It heals you for 40 points and can be used to cook Waffles in your Crock Pot for 1 egg, 1 berry and 1 butter. Waffles are one of the best healing food in the game, giving you a whopping 60 points of health, but plain butter lasts longer (40 days) without spoiling.
If you catch a butterfly instead of killing it, when you place it on the ground a new Flower grows. This would be useful if you plan on starting a Bee farm instead of killing Bees, or if you need some Flowers and more Butterflies, since they spawn from Flowers.

, Bees are pesky things and come in two variations in this game. Normal bees don’t do much except hover around flowers and return to their hives unless attacked, but Killer Bees tend to be hyper-aggressive, come out in droves, and try to kill everything in their path. While that sounds too bothersome to deal with, they drop useful things like Stingers and Honey. While Stingers are more common and can be used for other items, what you’re after is the delicious golden Honey. Honey can be used to cook specific Crock Pot dishes and is used to craft Honey Poultices, which heal for 30 health!

Honey Poultices are crafted through your Alchemy Engine for 2 Honey and 1 Papyrus. Papyrus is crafted from 2 Reeds, which are found in the Marsh, in your Science Machine through the Refine tab.
You can make a Beekeeper Hat for 8 Silk and 1 Rope through your Alchemy Engine’s Dress tab, and it will reduce all damage taken from bees by 80%, making this vital if you need to go bee hunting.
If you don’t feel like killing Bees all the time, you can catch just destroy a Hive, take the Honeycomb, and make a Bee Box. It can be crafted through your Science Machine’s Food tab for 2 Boards, 1 Honeycomb, and 4 Bees. This way, you have regular Honey production with less stinging and pain.

Understand what the item does.,
Go grave-digging.,
Make a Prestihatitator.,
Make the Amulet.,
Equip the Life-Giving Amulet.",How to Heal in Don't Starve5," The Life Giving Amulet is a somewhat rare and valuable item available late in the game that resurrects you upon death once, but more importantly, it heals your Health and restores Sanity for as long as it remains around your neck. It will degrade over time while you recover your Health., While this takes a toll on your Sanity, you can take your Shovel and go dig up Graves. Graves resemble large mounds of dirt sometimes accompanied by stone grave markers. While you can find the occasional grave in the Forest, they sometimes spawn in large groups, forming a graveyard. Life Giving Amulets are somewhat rare yields from grave digging, so don’t count on this to be a reliable way to get it.

Shovels are made through the Tool tab with a Science Machine for 2 Twigs and 2 Flint. You can also use it to dig up Saplings, Grass Tufts, Berry bushes, and Tree stumps.
Be very careful when grave-digging. While the chance to spawn a Ghost is low, they’re also very aggressive and dangerous, and can bypass any armor’s protection. Fortunately, it’s easy to outrun them, so you can just run away and it will eventually find something else to kill.

, You can make this crafting station as soon as you get a Science Machine, and requires 4 Rabbits, 4 Boards, and 1 Top Hat. Head over to the Magic tab, represented by a red skull, then create it! Like the Science Machine and the Alchemy Engine, it’s a permanent structure., The Amulet requires 3 Gold Nuggets, 2 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Red Gem to craft on your Prestihatitator under the Magic tab.

Nightmare Fuel can be hard to find, but reliably you can get them from lowering your sanity until your hallucinations become solid and killing the Nightmare Monsters that spawn. Once you get enough, quickly recover your Sanity immediately so you don’t die. If you’re feeling cautious, you can simply pick Evil Flowers, then craft Nightmare Fuel for 4 Dark Petals in the Magic tab of your Prestihatitator.
You can actually cultivate Evil Flowers for Dark Petals by placing some Bees near some Evil Flowers, and those Bees would slowly pollinate and propagate your Evil Flowers.
Red Gems can be found Underground, especially after earthquakes, from grave-digging, or by killing Red Hounds that occasionally spawn during summer.

, Once you have created the amulet, you can just equip it (right-click or select with the D-pad), and it will heal you of any injury for 20 times, or resurrect you once. Aside from that, you can just keep it on you nearly indefinitely."

Gather a Twig


Twigs are found basically everywhere in Don't Starve, besides in Caves.,
Get one Flint


Flint is obtained on the ground, practically everywhere, just like Twigs.,
Build the Axe


Go to the Tool isle, and look at the first item, it should be an Axe.",How to Make an Ax on Don't Starve," They are most commonly found in the Forest, and the Savannah, and are common around the Beefalos.;
, Loose Flint can also be found around completed Boulders.

, Click on the icon and a Build icon will appear on the screen, detailing the materials you need to craft an Axe. If you have followed these instructions, you will already have the materials to build an Axe, so simply press with ""Build"" and you will have your first axe.

"
Find a Frog Pond.,
Prepare your tools.,
Gather supplies.,
Set up your camp.,
Make a Science Machine and an Alchemy Engine.,
Trap Frogs.,
Fish your heart out!,
Dry the spoils.,
Cook with the Crock Pot.",How to Set Up Camp in a Frog Pond in Don't Starve," Ponds are most likely to be found around the Grasslands or Marshes. It’s much easier to search for them in the Grasslands since it’s less dangerous and has less natural hazards littered about. Ponds will show on the map as light-blue circles with a green border, while Mosquito Ponds, a variant found in the swamps have a purple border. Usually, you can find that following a path or cobblestone road will lead you to a pond, or several in a cluster.


Frog Ponds are generally more useful than Mosquito Ponds since frogs yield the food item Frog Legs, while Mosquitos seldomly yield the healing item Mosquito Sac. So while having a steady source of healing items might come in handy later on, food is still the top priority since there are ways to gain health from food.;
, You’ll be needing at least a Pickaxe and an Axe to gather some of the required materials for prolonged survival. They’re both available through the Tool tab, represented by a crossed axe and pickaxe icon. Axes cost 1 each of Twig and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while Pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials. To use, select them by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe), and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down and gather the materials they create.

, Before settling in, though, you’ll need to gather supplies to create your base camp with. As much as possible, you’ll need a Pit Fire, a stockpile of food and building materials, and if you’re lucky enough to find Gold early, a Science Machine.


You can gather most of your necessary materials by left-clicking (PC) or pressing X (PS4) on the item. Berries, Carrots, Stones, Flint, Twigs, and Cut Grass are a priority for the first few days of the game and will remain useful throughout. Carrots, Stones, and Flint don’t return once you pick them up, but there are other ways to keep them renewable later in the game.
Carrots can be found poking out of the ground. Berry bushes are scattered around the world. Stone and Flint can be picked up anywhere, though Stone is less common. Twigs come from dried-out bushes called Saplings, and Cut Grass can be gathered from long yellowing tufts of grass found nearly everywhere in the world. Stone and Flint can be more easily acquired by mining boulders with a pickaxe, and Logs have to be chopped from trees with an axe.

, Once you find your pond(s), make your camp a short distance away, but far enough that day-spawning Frogs don’t harass you in your camp. The main feature of your camp, aside from your stockpile of items, is a Pit Fire; it’s a permanent structure that lets you create light and warmth for the nights ahead and can also let you cook your food to get the most out of your supplies. Once you’ve settled, you can now make permanent structures like the Science Machine for prolonged survival. An ideal location has more than one pond, as a single pond won't spawn enough Frogs to support a player through winter.


To make a Pit Fire, you need 12 Stones and 2 Logs. You don’t need your Science Machine or Alchemy Engine to make one. Head over to the Light tab, represented by a flame in your crafting hotbar, then select the second option there. Pit Fires are permanent structures and can keep you warm for a very long time as long as you keep feeding it fuel. Even when it’s extinguished, you can simply rekindle it by dumping fuel into it.
You can also make regular Campfires for 2 Cut Grass and 2 Logs, but it isn’t permanent, and you have to keep it going indefinitely or it extinguishes and leaves only a pile of ashes.
To feed fuel to a Campfire or Pit Fire, select some flammable material (Logs, Grass, Twigs, Manure, Petals, and Grass or Log Suits), then interact with the fire by clicking on it (PC) or pressing X (PS4). It will immediately drop the fuel into the flames and consume 1 unit of said material.

, These machines will allow you to create more tools and items to help you survive the game. Since both cannot be moved around, it’s best to make them after you’ve found yourself a camping site.


Making a Science Machine requires a Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and is made in the Science tab, which is located in your crafting hotbar and represented by an atom icon. An Alchemy Engine can be made in a Science Machine for 3 Cut Stone and 4 Boards under the Science tab.
You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders, or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.
You can create Cut Stone through the Refine tab in the science machine. It costs 3 Rocks to make.

, While suiting up in armor and killing Frogs would be fun and quick, it’s not the most efficient way, and you tend to get continuously damaged. The best way to exploit your Frog Ponds is by trapping Frogs! The best way to catch them is to observe the direction they hop and place a trap right in front of them or by leaving Traps around the ponds itself. One trap will catch 8 Frogs before breaking, exhausting two or three should be no problem during the day.


To make a trap, you need 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs, and you can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it on the area of your choice then wait until a your target is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the spoils, which is, in this case, a Frog Leg. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears.
You can also “kite” aggressive Frogs into an area full of traps by running behind the Traps while the Frogs are chasing you.

, At dusk, Frogs will return to their ponds, giving the player some time to fish risk-free if a fishing rod is available. Fishing, at this point, will become one of your main food sources as long as you have the necessary materials.


To make a fishing rod, you’ll need 2 Twigs and 2 Silk (from killing Spiders). Once you have all the items necessary for the fishing rod, go near your Science Machine and pull up the Tools tab in the crafting hotbar. Scroll down near the bottom, and you’ll see the fishing rod highlighted and ready to be created. Just click or press X to get it!

, To ensure that you get the most out of your Fish and Frogs, drying them into Jerky is one of the most effective ways to do so. Jerky heals decent amounts of all 3 gauges and lasts a long time, which makes this the perfect way to stockpile large amounts of food without fear of immediate spoiling.


To create a Drying Rack, you’ll need 3 Ropes, 3 Charcoals, and 3 Twigs. To use, simply select a piece of meat of any kind, except meaty bulb, and interact with the rack. The meat is then placed on the rack and dries into jerky in a few days, which is one of the best foodstuffs in the game.
Keeping plenty of jerky around during winter is a great way to keep yourself alive, healthy, and sane.

, The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine. The Crock Pot costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs, and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about less than a minute for the dish to cook. Most available meals can restore varying amounts of all three stats, as long as you figure out the recipe.


A recipe exclusive for Frog Legs is the Froggle Bunwich, which needs 1 Frog Leg and 1 Vegetable, plus two filler ingredients (excluding Honey, Mandrake, and Eggs). It takes 40 seconds to cook and makes for a cheap-ish, efficient, filling meal with a decent bonus to health and hunger. For early game players, you can simply use Carrots, since they’re the most common vegetable available. If you’re using Twigs for your filler, use two instead of one, since a single Twig will turn your Bunwich recipe into a Kebab.
Fish have two dedicated recipes, the Fishsticks and Fish Tacos. Fishsticks require 1 Fish and 1 Twig, while Fish Tacos require 1 Corn and 1 Fish. Of the two recipes, it’s recommended to cook Fishsticks instead of Fish Tacos since it only requires a fish and a stick and heals more health than Fish Tacos, though the hunger and sanity gains are the same.
If you’re cooking Fishsticks, don’t use twigs as filler. Use other low-value food, like Berries or Mushrooms, instead. This is because using more than 1 twig will “ruin” the recipe and result in Wet Goop, an inedible item that can still be used as baits for traps or to create Rot for fertilizer, but not much else.

It requires a Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and it’s made in the Science tab (atom icon), which is located in your crafting hotbar (right-hand section of your screen on PC and L2 on the PS4).


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading meats with the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world); mining yellow-streaked boulders, which are dominantly available in Rockylands; or finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Once you make your science machine, it will immediately prompt you to place it down (press X or left-click). Choose the area to place the machine wisely since, after placing it, you won’t be able to pick it up again.;
, You’ll need these two items to create a pickaxe and axe (if you don’t have it yet) and for the fishing rod. Twigs can be gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world, and Flint (sharp-looking rock) are scattered everywhere in the game, so you can readily pick it up.

, You’ll be needing at least a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials. They’re both available through the Tool tab, represented by a crossed axe and pickaxe icon. Axes cost 1 each of Twig and Flint. It is used to chop down trees. Pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials as axes and are used to mine down large boulders.


To use these tools, select them by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.

, You can now gather Silk by killing spiders. Spider dens, which resemble cobweb-covered mounds, can be found almost everywhere in the world, and you can attract a spider by walking close to it. If you hit it while near the den, a few spiders also pop up to defend their friend, so be careful when killing spiders, since you might just attract more if you don’t lead it away from the den!

, To make your rod, you’ll be needing 2 Twigs, and 2 Silk. Once you have all the items necessary for the fishing rod, go near your science machine, then pull up the Tools tab in the crafting hotbar. Scroll down near the bottom, and you’ll see your fishing rod highlighted and ready to be created. Just click or press X to get it!

, Ponds are fairly uncommon in Don’t Starve, but they’re usually found in Grasslands, Forests, and Swamps. In Grasslands, they’re even found near roads, clustered together. Swamp ponds are found scattered everywhere there, though be careful not to agitate the many enemies that spawn in the place.

, For Grassland and Forest ponds, the best time to fish is dusk and night, since frogs spawn in the daytime. Just remember to make a campfire before settling in to fish!


For Swamp ponds, the best time to fish is at day, since only Tentacles spawn in the daytime, and at dusk, the ponds spawn mosquitos. Just make sure you can get away from the swamp quickly enough when it starts getting darker, since it’s a very hazardous place to be in!

, You do this the same way you did to equip your other tools (pickaxe and axe).

, Move to your chosen pond, then use the fishing rod by pressing X or clicking. It takes a few seconds for fish to bite.

, Once the command “Hook” appears, click or press X, then do it again as quickly as you can when the command changes to “Reel In!” Your character will then pull up a nice fresh fish!

Flint, Cut Grass, Rocks, Berries, and Twigs must be stockpiled before the venture. To gather, click the item or press Spacebar (PC), press X (console), and tap the item or the green hand button (iOS).


Flint looks like sharp, jagged stone; they can be found scattered in the world or through mining.
Berries are found on bushes.
Rocks are more uncommonly found scattered in Forests and rocky areas, but are more commonly found through mining.
Cut Grass can be gathered from long tufts of grass found nearly everywhere.
Twigs can be gathered from dried out bushes, oddly called saplings in the game.;
, Now it’s time to create some basic tools. If you look at the left side of the screen, you’ll see the crafting hotbar. For the PC and iOS players, accessing and crafting is as simple as clicking or tapping the tab you desire. For the Console players, press L2 to access it and scroll between your options with the right analogue stick. Select the icon that resembles a crossed pickaxe and axe. This is the Tool tab, where you can make your basic Tools. Select a tool you can initially create, and ta-dah! You can now mine boulders and chop down trees!


The Pickaxe costs 2 Twigs and 2 Flint.
The Axe costs 1 Twig and 1 Flint.
In Reign of Giants (RoG), the Hammer is available at the start and costs 3 Rocks, 3 Twigs, and 6 Cut Grass.

, Now it’s time to equip and use your tools! While the first tool you make is automatically equipped, you can equip and unequip your other tools whenever you like, and you can use your tools immediately afterwards. For the PC, right-click equips the tool and the left-click uses it. For the iOS, you tap your tools and choose “Equip,” then tap and hold or press the green hand button to use it. For Console, it’s the right direction button, then X.


Axes let you chop trees down to get Logs.
Pickaxes let you break down boulders for Flint, Rocks, Nitre, and Gold.
In RoG, Hammers are immediately available and let you break down any and every structure in the game to recover a fraction of the materials used to make it.

, Ideally, the Marsh should have a number of rundown houses, which spawn Merms every dusk. The Merms would serve as the main source of your food and your unwitting “bodyguards,” despite and because of their extreme hostility. The most ideal place for you to set up camp in is a patch of road or a clear area near the most rundown houses, and at least a screen away from any and every pond in the Marsh. This campsite of yours will be the closest thing you have to a “safe area” during your stay in the Marsh.

, What comes next are the structures for your food and belongings. The most important thing to build are the two crafting structures: the Science Machine and the Alchemy Engine. These two will let you prototype other vital structures for your venture. You also need to craft a Fire Pit, which is a permanent source of fire, and perhaps some food structures, like Drying Racks and a Crock Pot. You also might want to consider investing in Walls to protect your loot and yourself when you’re not busy dodging Tentacles and other March denizens. Once you make these structures, simply place them with X, left-click, or tapping the area.

, A Fire Pit is one of the most vital objects in the game, providing you with a near-permanent source of light and warmth for a very cheap cost. The Fire Pit can be crafted right off the bat on the Light tab, represented by a flame icon, for 12 Rocks and 2 Logs. Do note that unlike a regular campfire, this is permanent, which means you have to choose a suitable campsite before placing it. When it extinguishes, you can just add more fuel (Logs, Grass, and Log Suits, Sleeping Rolls, Beefalo Wool, etc.) to it to reignite the fire.


In RoG, you can first make an Endothermic Fire Pit on your Alchemy Engine for 2 Nitre, 4 Cut Stone, and 2 Electric Doodad. This fire pit cools you down instead of heats you up, which is handy for Summer.

, As mentioned, having the two major crafting stations is vital to your prolonged survival, primarily because you can’t craft weapons, armors, and food structures without them. The Science Machine, being your first crafting station, opens up a wider range of items to prototype, while the Alchemy Engine widens the range even further. In short, if you truly wish to make your stay in the Marsh worth it, you need these structures.


Science Machines can be crafted right off the bat in the Science tab, represented by the icon of an atom, and can be crafted for a Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks. Since this is a structure, it can’t be taken and placed elsewhere, so save this for your camp.

Gold Nuggets can be mined from large dark rocks with yellow streaks or traded to a Pig King for any meat, if you’re lucky enough to find one.


Alchemy Engines can first be crafted in the Science Machine for 6 Gold Nuggets, 4 Boards, and 2 Cut Stones. It’s also a structure, meaning you can’t move it.

Boards and Cut Stones can first be made in the Science Machine under the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon. Boards cost 4 Logs, and Cut Stones cost 4 Rocks.
In RoG, the recipe replaces the 6 Gold for 2 Electric Doodads. The Doodads are also found in the Science tab and cost 2 Gold Nuggets and 1 Cut Stone, making it a cheaper recipe than before.



, Once you have at least a Science Machine, you can make Farm Plots, Drying Racks, and the Crock Pot. These structures are vital because they let you widen your food options. They can all be crafted through the Food tab, represented by a carrot.


Jerky Racks cost 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 1 Charcoal. You can use this to dry every type of meat, save for eggs, into Jerky, which heals you a bit for all three stats. Charcoal is acquired by burning down trees with a torch and then chopping it down with an axe. Be careful though, fire tends to spread unpredictably, so don’t set fire to trees near your camp.
Crock Pots are made with 3 Cut Stone, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs. To use it, drop 4 separate food items into the 4 slots, then select “Cook.” You need to wait a while before the food is ready, but this will normally make your food much more filling and healing than just eating each individual ingredient. You can also use Twigs in the Crock Pot, but not Rot or Seeds.
Finally, you can make two kinds of Farm Plots. The Basic Farm plot requires 4 Manure, 8 Cut Grass, and 4 Logs to make, and is available in the Science Machine. The Advanced one, which grows your crops faster, requires 10 Cut Grass, 6 Manure, and 4 Rocks; it is available in the Alchemy Engine. Manure is naturally dropped by the Beefalo roaming around the Savannah or can be “made” by feeding Pigs some Berries and other vegetables.

, This is where the Alchemy Engine comes in handy. Fortifying your area involves placing multiple Walls around the perimeter of your camp to prevent unwanted visitors from the Marsh from breaking in to kill you. Walls can be made through the Structures tab, represented by a hammer.


Hay Walls can first be crafted through the Science Machine with 4 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. It’s not very strong and can be quite flammable.
Wood Walls, also available through the Science Machine, can be made for 2 Boards and 1 Rope.
The Stone Wall, which is arguably the best Wall in the game, is first made through the Alchemy Engine with 2 Cut Stone. It’s a very cheap recipe and isn’t flammable, plus it’s infinitely renewable if you decide to explore the underground Caverns beforehand. This is the most prefered Wall type by experienced players.

, Even the most basic of armor and weapons will greatly help your chances for survival here. With your Science Machine, the Log Suit and Spear become available in the Fight tab, represented by crossed swords. These two will greatly help your chances of surviving. Equipping both and using the spear is identical to equipping and using tools, but their usage is purely for battle and survival.


Spears cost 1 Flint, 2 Twigs, and 1 Rope. This is the most basic, but most useful weapon.
Log Suits need 4 Logs and 2 Ropes to craft. It’s the easiest to craft, with somewhat decent defense for most of the game.

, The Marsh is full of surprises, normally the bad kind. If you see some things like an abundance of Reeds, a pile of Fish, scattered Frog Legs, or the Tentacle Spike weapon, do NOT approach immediately. There’s a very large chance that the place is infested with Tentacles. Equip some armor and a spear before running off and picking stuff. Also, make sure you’re really quick about it too, since Tentacles appear fast and hit very hard.

, Merms and Mosquitos spawn at dusk and night, making nighttime exploration quite difficult in the Marsh. You’re better off holing up for the night than exploring, since the threats have basically doubled. Spiders also wander about at dusk and night, so if there are any nearby Spider Dens, then you’ll be in more trouble. Take a hint and stay in camp when it gets darker.

, The Marsh’s most dangerous aspect besides the abundance of Tentacles and other such monsters is the fact that it tends to drain Sanity quite fast. Since it’s densely populated by an assortment of nasties, you’re bound to take continuous hits to your Sanity, further endangering your life, since at lower Sanity, your hallucinations turn real and deadly. Keep up your Sanity by eating Crock Pot dishes and Jerky, and by picking flowers.

, Even with your armor and spear, you’re still quite vulnerable to the many monsters and their many claws. Don’t immediately rush into battle, and let the environment do it for you. If you’re being chased, lead them to an area you know has lots of Tentacles, and RUN. Just run. Most of the time, the Tentacles will lash out to what was chasing you, and they all fight it out, leaving you to hastily reap the spoils before you become a victim as well.


As long as you’re quick and smart, the Marsh is a great place to live in. Just try not to anger your “neighbors” so much.

Find some bioluminescence.,
Find some structures.,
Craft yourself some light.",How to Get Light in Caves and Ruins in Don't Starve," Light Flowers naturally spawn in both underground realms, while Mushtrees spawn in Caves. Both are somewhat decent natural sources of light and can help light the way, but you can’t re-plant any of these resources to more convenient places. When they’re around, they’re dead useful and act as a great natural source of stationary light.


While you can’t relocate the Light Flowers, you can pick the Light Bulbs from them to craft a Lantern or refuel your Miner Hat or Lantern. You can also drop the Bulbs on the ground for some light, but its glow is so faint that they can only be used for temporary path markers or to simply keep yourself from getting killed by the Night Monster by standing directly on top of it.;
, There are quite a few structures in the Ruins that constantly emit light, especially in the Nightmare Cycles. The Nightmare Lights, statues, and pillars found scattered in the Ruins naturally start glowing in the Nightmare Phase, and the Ancient Pseudoscience Station lights up whenever you go near it. While this method is more appropriate for the Ruins, you can still find some structures that glow on the Caves, mainly the Nightmare Fissures, which are functionally similar to the Nightmare Lights.


You’re better off not approaching either, since the Nightmare Lights and Fissures eat away at your sanity when you stay within its glow.
You can also sometimes encounter huge shafts of light in the Caves, apparently from cracks in the ceiling reaching towards the surface. While this is technically not a structure, it’s a permanent source of light you can stay in whenever you need to.

, The most common and reliable way to get some light in this dark and dreary areas is to build your own lights. The easiest to build are basic Torches, Campfires, and Fire Pits, but there are other ways to get some light shining. Do note that you need to constantly refuel your light sources (save for the Pumpkin Lantern and the Torch) or else they’ll go out.


Miner Hats are by far the most reliable way to get some light shining, and costs a Straw Hat, 1 Gold Nugget and 1 group of Fireflies. You can learn the recipe on the Alchemy Engine. The drawback of having one is that you won’t be able to equip a helmet. The item lasts for almost 8 minutes, but you can refuel it with Fireflies, Slurtle Slime, and Light Bulbs to keep it going indefinitely.
Lanterns are also pretty good to bring, though it occupies your hand slot. You can drop your Lantern on the ground and it will keep burning as long as you have fuel. You can learn the recipe from the Alchemy Engine, and costs 2 Light Bulbs, 3 Twigs, and 2 Ropes. Its light lasts for 8 minutes, can be turned on and off to conserve fuel, and can also be refueled using Fireflies, Slurtle Slime, and Light Bulbs. Be careful though, Splumonkeys can steal this when you place it, robbing you of precious light.
You can also craft a Pumpkin Lanterns, which costs 1 Pumpkin and 1 Firefly, and you can learn the recipe on the Alchemy Engine. This light source lasts a bit longer, but spoils over time and cannot be refueled. It lasts about 10 minutes in the Summer and 12 ½ minutes in Winter.

In RoG, it lasts 7 ½ minutes in the Summer, 10 minutes in Spring and Autumn, and 12 ½ minutes in Winter.


Lastly, in RoG you can craft Moggles with 2 Moleworms, 2 Electrical Doodads, and 1 Glow Berry, and you can learn the recipe on the Alchemy Engine. It’s somewhat unusual in that it gives you full night-vision with a sort of negative filter over the screen, and you can even see the entire screen instead of a radius of light around you. The Moggles last for 8 minutes before breaking, and you can refuel it with Glow Berries whenever you need to.

Make torches.",How to Get Started in Don’t Starve," Don’t Starve has this unique mechanics where you’ll have to watch three different gauges rather than just one or two. The three gauges are found on the upper right part of your screen and are thusly labeled Hunger (represented by a stomach), Health (represented by a heart), and Sanity (represented by a brain). These three determine the fine line between life and death, and must be monitored closely.;
, Your Hunger meter is constantly draining throughout the day, and it’s possible to die of starvation just before the second day if you don’t keep an eye on it and keep feeding your character, since an empty Hunger gauge means you start taking damage on your Health gauge. You can find Carrots lying on the ground and there are plenty of Berry Bushes scattered in the game, which would serve as your main source of food for the first few days. You can harvest them by left-clicking (PC) or pressing the X button (console) on the Carrot or Bush, and you can eat them by right-clicking the item in your hotbar (the bar on the bottom part of the screen, which also serves as your main inventory) or scroll to it with your right analog stick and press the right direction button (console).


Ideally, you should feed your character 5 Berries or Carrots’ worth of food a day, but your character generally can last up to two days before starving to death. Most foods have bigger bonuses or have less penalties when cooked over the campfire, especially Meat items. You can cook your food by selecting your item and then going to your campfire and left-clicking it (PC) or pressing X (console).

, Your Health is a little easier to keep an eye on since it’s affected by things like getting hit by monsters, being set on fire, freezing, and especially starving. The lower your Health gauge, the closer you are to dying, and an empty one means definite death.


Health can be recovered in many ways, such as eating cooked food, using Spider Glands and making healing materials, such as Healing Salves. Spider Glands sometimes drop from slain Spiders and can be consumed the same way as food, though you can’t cook it. Once you acquire a Science Machine, you can craft a Healing Salve with it through the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon in the Crafting menu.
Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock (found scattered in the world or mined from Boulders), and 1 Spider Gland.

, Your Sanity gauge may be a little less dangerous when it lowers compared to the other two gauges, but lower Sanity levels will bring about some aesthetic changes, and Shadow Creatures will start appearing. At the the lowest levels, the screen turns dim with red cracks, and the Shadow Creatures will become aggressive and start attacking you. Unless you feel like slaying some Shadows, which can be dangerous at the start of things or if you’re low on resources, try and keep this gauge a bit high.


Picking flowers, which yields Petals, is a great way to maintain high Sanity this early in the game, and you can create a Garland with 12 Petals on the Clothing tab (the green hat icon) on the lower portion of the crafting bar at the lefthand side of your screen.

, Once you’ve got a basic grasp on things, it can be a bit tempting to explore and maybe even defeat a few monsters, which is a fairly bad idea for a game like this. Do NOT give in to the temptation—everything can and will kill you unless you’re very prepared. Until you make the Science Machine at the very least, actively seeking and attacking things with only your axe is only going to get you killed, and even when you’re not trying to do anything, you’ll still die anyways if you literally don’t keep an eye on your character.

, Materials are your friends. They’re what keeps you from a death of starvation and/or mauling, and provides you with means to survive at longer rates. You can normally gather these materials by left-clicking on them, or pressing Spacebar once you’re nearby (PC) or by pressing the X button (console), but some materials need tools to be gathered, which is covered in the next section.

, You’ll have to forage for as much Flint (sharp-looking small rocks) as you can, which are fortunately always lying around on the ground, but this should always remain your top priority during the first few days, and you’ll need at least one Flint before the day is over. You can find it practically everywhere during exploration. Later on, when you have your Pickaxe and start mining Boulders, you can get up to 3 pieces of flint with most boulder types.

, Rocks, much like Flint, can be found scattered everywhere, though they are less common that Flint. They’re more reliably found when mining and can be stockpiled faster that way.

, Cut Grass, gathered from the yellowing tufts of tall grass, is extremely essential, since there are a lot of things you can make that require lots of it. They’re renewable and grow back in 4 days, so don’t be afraid to mow down an entire area full of Grass.

, Twigs can be found on saplings, which actually resemble dried-out bushes, and can be found pretty much everywhere, so gather as much of that as you can find as well. Much like Grass, saplings regrow their twigs in 4 days, making this resource renewable.

, Berries and Carrots are a must if you want to keep your hunger at a decent level, and seeing as the game is called “Don’t Starve,” you’ll best be doing that. Berries regrow from their bushes in 4 days, while Carrots do not grow back when plucked from the ground.

, Once you make your tools, chop up as many trees to gain as much Logs as you can muster, but always use the Pinecones dropped from the tree to plant new ones to replace the tree you killed.


Everything you can gather initially, aside from Logs, can be stockpiled in stacks of 40, which means after you get 40 of that item, you can still gather it, but it would occupy an extra slot in your inventory. Logs can be stockpiled in stacks of 20, making it the most cumbersome of the items.

, A game as unforgiving as this means that the earlier you can start crafting things, the better, as they give you another advantage against a quick death. Tools tend to break easily after a few uses, indicated by how high the percentage of its durability is left. The lower the percentage, the closer it is to breaking, so watch out for that! You can easily switch between tools, and later on weapons, by right-clicking (PC) or by scrolling to it with your right analog stick and pressing X (console) the tool you want on the hotbar, which automatically equips your tool into your hand.

, Probably the most important tool you need to make is an axe. An axe is the easiest item to make, gives you the extremely useful ability to chop down trees for logs, and would definitely serve as your go-to makeshift weapon for the first few days.


To make an axe, you first need a Flint and a Twig. Once you get those, click the Tool tab, represented by a symbol that looks like a crossed axe and pickaxe on the left-hand side of the screen, then at the top of the list that appears is the axe you’ll need. Click on it to make one. Approach a tree, and press the left mouse button or spacebar (PC) or the X button (console) to get chopping!

, Another important survival tool is a pickaxe, though the opportunity to use it would depend if you were lucky enough to find a boulder. It costs 2 Twigs and 2 Flints, and its recipe is located just below the axe in the Tool tab. It’s a bit less durable than an axe, so don’t go using it as a weapon. Instead, use it for its main purpose: breaking down large rocks into smaller rocks. Like with the Axe, simply select your tool, go up to a Boulder and start mining!


You will need all the rocks you can gather later on, and if you’re lucky enough to find a boulder with yellow streaks in them, you’ll be rewarded with some Gold, which you can use to make your Science Machine—this lets you make even more things to help your survival!

, Another tool you can make is a Trap, which you can use to catch Rabbits to fill your stomach with. It costs 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs, and you can craft them by pressing the looped-rope symbol instead of the crossed axe and pickaxe, then clicking on the first item on the menu that appears.


To use traps, you need to set it down where Rabbits tend to appear, place some bait in it by selecting a berry or carrot on hand, and left-clicking (PC) or pressing the X button (console). Then wait until an unsuspecting sucker walks right into it! You can only use the Trap to catch Rabbits and Frogs, but later on, you can make Bird Traps with your Science Machine.
Bird Traps can be created through the Survival tab for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk with your Science machine, and are exclusively for catching birds. Simply place it on the ground, place some seeds in them as bait, and wait for a bird to land in it.

, The last tool you could possibly make on your own, and this might take a while depending on your luck, is a Science Machine. It requires 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks to craft. While it can be tricky to find Gold Nuggets if you’re unlucky, this particular tool will let you make even more items, tools, and even a farm!


Note that this tool is not portable like the others, and so you must carefully consider where you place it.

, When you have at least 2 Logs and 3 Cut Grass, you can make fire! Click the bonfire icon to your left, and on the very top of the list is a campfire. Campfires are essential because they’re the most reliable and easiest way to generate light during nighttime. Without a light source, creatures will constantly attack you and greatly reduce your Health and Sanity with each hit. You can make multiple Campfires as long as you have enough resources.


Later on, if you’ve got at least 12 Rocks and 2 logs, you could make a Fire Pit, which is a permanent version of a Campfire and does not spread flames when you add too much fuel.

, When you make a Campfire, make sure you have at least three other pieces of Logs at hand. The fire periodically gets lower and lower the longer it’s been on, so when it gets a bit too low, select your Logs, go up to your fire, and then interact with it (left-click on PC; X on consoles) to replenish your fuel. This will help brighten your fire, but don’t add too much, or the fire would go out of control and spread to every nearby flammable object.

If your Fire Pit’s flames die out, simply start it up again by adding your fuel to it.

, Torches are a good way to keep a light when you don’t have enough Logs for a campfire, and you can light things with it. However, be careful with that fire; it tends to spread. A lot. And while that may sound delightful to all you pyromaniacs out there, when it manages to burn down all your hard-earned materials, it isn’t as delightful. Torches cost 2 Cut Grass and 1 Twig, making it a very easy source of light.

, Since Glazed Pokémon is built on Pokémon Emerald, most codes should work. Be careful, as some codes may not work properly due to the ROM already being hacked., The game will need to be running in order to enter cheats for it. The process for entering codes varies slightly if you're using a different emulator, but the codes are the same for all emulators.

VBA-M is a popular GBA emulator that you can use to load ROM files. ROM files are copies of the game file, and Pokémon Glazed in a hacked version of the Pokémon Emerald ROM.

, This will turn cheats on for the emulator., This feature is required in order for some codes to work., This will open a new window., It looks like a green bookmark., This is so that you can recognize it. The description has no bearing on if the code works., Most of the cheat codes listed above are ""GameShark Advance"" codes, unless otherwise specified. Some emulators will auto-detect the type of cheat, but VBA-M users will need to select GameShark Advance from the drop-down menu., Make sure that you are only adding the code for a single cheat at a time. Click ""OK"" once you've pasted the code.

You can find a list of codes lower in this article.
If the code was multiple lines, you'll see multiple entries on your code list.

, Unless specified otherwise (some cheats require a master code enabled as well), you should only run a single cheat at once. Using more than one at once increases the chances that you'll break the game., You'll be returned to the game and it will unpause., Once the game is unpaused your your cheats are enabled, you can use them immediately. For example, if you have the Walk Through Walls cheat enabled, you'll immediately be able to pass through normally blocked objects like trees and gates. If you enabled the Unlimited Master Ball cheat, you'll find them in your PC., This is the most popular emulator for Android devices. If you're using a different emulator, the same codes will work but the process will likely be a little different., You'll find this at the top of the controls in the center., This will open the Cheats screen., This will allow you to enter a new cheat., This will help you identify it later. The name does not have an impact on the cheat itself., My Boy! will automatically detect what type of cheat code it is. You'll find a list of codes at the bottom of this article.

My Boy! already has the real time clock enabled, so you don't need to manually turn it on.

, This will save and apply the cheat., To help reduce crashes, try to stick to one cheat at a time. Adding multiple codes will allow you to switch between them. If you don't need any cheats at the moment, disable any active cheats.

Some cheats require a master code as well as the cheat code.

, After entering the cheat and returning to the game, you should see your cheat code take effect immediately. The process for using the code will vary depending on the code. For example, if you're using the Unlimited Trade Stones cheat, you'll be able to purchase them for free from any Poke Mart. The Trade Stone will replace the first item the store offers.

The cheat code list above describes any special conditions you need to meet to use a cheat.

Know the different ponds.,
Follow the roads.,
Explore forests.,
Wander around grasslands.,
Listen for croaking.",How to Find Frog Ponds in Don't Starve1," There are three kinds of Ponds in the game: the Mosquito pond, the Frog pond and the Eel pond. The first two kinds are readily available on the surface, while the third is exclusive only to the Ruins portion of the underground. Frog ponds are more common and found in more places than the Mosquito ponds, and they spawn Frogs during the daytime. Meanwhile, Mosquito ponds are found in the Marshes and spawn Mosquitos during dusk and nighttime.


For visual differences, Frog ponds have a green border, Mosquito ponds have a purple border, and Eel ponds have bright green water.;
, Following the trail of a cobblestone road or a dirt path is often the most reliable way to get anywhere in the game. Oftentimes, they would lead you to places like Pig Villages or Things. More often, though, they tend to lead you towards a pond or even a large cluster of ponds!

, Forests are one of the places you can find Ponds in. You can usually find them scattered near the trees. They’re a bit uncommon though and are generated one at a time. With the addition of the multiple trees making your view limited, it can be tricky to search in the Forest.

, Ponds are a bit easier to find in the Grasslands, and not only because they have less trees blocking the view. Ponds spawn more often and tend to cluster around each other in the Grasslands, making it one of the surest areas to search when looking for your Ponds.

, If you’re exploring during the day, you can usually hear the Frogs croaking and wandering about a short distance before encountering any ponds. Frogs spawn during the day and tend to wander around the area near their ponds, and then retreat during dusk. Be careful, though! Frogs are aggressive, pesky little buggers, and they tend to knock away things from your inventory whenever they attack. You can always pick your stuff back up, but it would leave you vulnerable to more Frog attacks, so watch yourself if you plan on looking for Ponds!

Locate the Pig King.,
Rustle up meats with Traps.,
Rustle up meats with Spiders.,
Present the meats to the Pig King.",How to Farm Gold in Don’t Starve1," The Pig King is the most reliable way to gain gold, and the only way to farm the material. Once given a meat item (excluding Frog Legs, Cooked Frog Legs, Monster Meat, and Cooked Monster Meat) or the non-renewable Gravedigger items, the Pig King will reward you with some Gold Nuggets, depending on what you’ve given him. Because of this, as long as you have a steady supply of meat, Gold becomes an infinitely renewable resource.


The most reliable way to find the Pig King is to follow the roads and trails scattered throughout the game. These roads and trails sometimes lead to Pig Villages, which is a collection of huts and occupied by several Pigmen. Normally, if the Pig King spawned at all, he’d be close to a Pig Village.
Do note that not all worlds generated by the game have a Pig King in it, since sometimes there isn’t enough room for the Pig King to be generated in the game. The Pig King’s appearance is that of a very large pig with a crown made of dried grass lying down on a wooden floor and surrounded by black pillars.;
, Most farming methods require you to have a way to generate meat easily and quickly. If you find the Pig King early enough in the game, the easiest way to gain meat is to create Traps through the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon, on your crafting hotbar (right-hand side of the screen). This item costs 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs, and are easily renewable resources. Place it over some rabbit holes, which can be found all over the map and are especially concentrated around Savanna biomes (a biome with a yellow grassy look full of grass tufts, rabbit holes, and no trees).


After setting the Traps, check it regularly. A Trap looks like a normal stick-and-basket trap, and when you’ve caught something, the basket will be on the ground and shaking constantly. If you click on a shaking Trap, you can gather both the rabbit and the Trap, if you have space in your inventory, and you can kill the Rabbit right off the bat by right-clicking it. You now have your meat. Get Rabbits trapped in your other Traps, and kill them for more meat. Set the Traps again to get more Rabbits, ensuring a steady supply of meat.
Rabbits normally spawn at morning, but the best time to check Traps would be around dusk. Traps, however, wear out eventually, and you’ll be forced to keep making them to replace the broken ones and using up precious resources in the process.

, Another, and more efficient, method of getting meat involve luring nearby Spiders into a Pig Village. Get Spider Eggs, which you can get by destroying third-tier Spider Dens (Spider Dens with two additional layers on its mound), and plant the eggs somewhere near the Village to create your own Den. Spider Dens can be found scattered everywhere across your map (they look like white boulders covered in spider webs), sometimes clustered closely together. The Spider Eggs will immediately become full-grown Spider Dens.


Once the eggs become a den, simply walk up to it and a Spider or two will emerge to attack you. Attacking one will alert other Spiders in the den, and they’ll all emerge to try to kill you. Lure them to the nearest Pig, hitting them every now and then with your chosen weapon to ensure they’re still following you, and the Pigs will start attacking it.
The more Dens and the higher the Den’s tier, the more Spiders will come out at once, giving you a steady supply of Meat and Pig Skin from the unlucky slain Pigs, and Monster Meat, Silk and Spider Glands from the Spiders.
Once the assault of the Spiders are over, you can then feed the Monster Meat to some Pigs, which earns their trust and lets them follow you around for a while. Feed them too many Monster Meats, and they turn into Werepigs, making them aggressive and attacking everyone in the area, even other Pigs. Once a Werepig attacks a Pig, the entire village will attack it, and with luck, they’ll finish each other off without you having to lift a finger to help. Werepigs still drop Meat and Pig Skins, though, and are a slightly more reliable way of making sure Meat drops since they drop 1 Meat and 1 Pig Skin consistently upon death, unlike the common Pig’s drop rate of 75% Meat and 25% Pig Skin. You don’t even need to keep attacking the Spiders and Werepigs after luring them into the village; the normal Pigs can do that for you, and both the village and the den respawn their respective denizens eventually, providing you a steady stream of resources.

, Once you’ve gathered enough meat, simply walk up to the Pig King, select the Meat by left-clicking the item on the computer edition or by scrolling to it with your right analog stick (console), then give the Meat to the Pig King (left-clicking the mouse or left button on the D-pad). You can also hand him some excess Pig Skins if you want, since it’s considered a Meat item. As long as you have meat, he will keep giving you Gold.

"
Go to the World menu.,
Scroll through the menu until you see the icon of a pond.,
Click the right arrow to increase your chances of finding a pond to either “More” or “Lots.” The “More” option simply makes your ponds more accessible and plentiful, while the “Lots” options would place them nearly everywhere.,
Exit the menu and start playing the game.",How to Find Frog Ponds in Don't Starve2," When you first make your world in Don’t Starve, you can see a set of options to modify your gaming experience. Press the “World” option in the Creation screen. This will open the World menu where you can adjust the settings for the game world.

, Like the others, beside the icon is a bar with the word “Default” and arrows.

,


If you press the left arrow button, it would decrease the spawn rates of whatever you choose.
You can also modify the settings and spawn rates of other things and monsters, depending on your preference!

, When you enter the game, you’ll find that the number of ponds have increased, depending on whether you set it to “More” or “Lots.” Now enjoy your nearly effort-free Pond spoils!


Be careful though! More ponds means more Frogs, and if you choose Lots, you’ll be practically swimming in them. Tread carefully when under Frog-infested worlds, and make armor and weapons as quickly as possible when playing in one.

"
"
Find a nice spot to place your Pond in.,
Press the tilde (~) button on your keyboard.,
Type “DebugSpawn “pond”” in the box that appears.",How to Find Frog Ponds in Don't Starve3," Since the cheat works by generating the item or structure where the cursor is, you’re better off placing it somewhere wide and accessible. It won’t spawn if the area is too small to hold a Pond, and you wouldn’t want it too near your stuff. Go to a clear place at least a screen or two from your camp’s location.


To make it look naturally generated, place it in the nearest Grasslands or in a Forest area.

, This method only works for the PC, and this will immediately place a pond right where your mouse is pointed at, so make sure you see the mouse cursor on the screen before you enter the cheat code.

, The DebugSpawn code is simply a code that generates items and structures depending on what item name you type in. While you’ll need a guide to find all the item names, the Frog Pond is simply “pond” in the game’s files, ensuring that you get a single Frog Pond every time you use the cheat.


To get rid of the scrolling text that remains on the screen after you finish putting in your cheat, press CTRL + L.
The other ponds are known as “pond_mos” and “pond_cave” in the database, so if you want to get an Eel without diving deep into the Caves, or want to farm Mosquitos without being in the swamp, you can use these instead of “pond.”

Give Gravedigger items to the Pig King.,
Wait for an earthquake in the Caverns.,
Kill the Bunnymen you find in the Caverns.,
Go fishing in the Ruins.",How to Farm Gold in Don’t Starve2," Sometimes, you’ll find large patches of raised soil every now and then when exploring the world, or some headstones lying around in the Forest. Those are graves, and you can dig those up with a Shovel, which you can make for 2 Twigs and 2 Flint in your Science Machine. If you’ve dug up some graves and found some odd little things, you can take them to the Pig King, and chances are, he’ll accept them for quite a few pieces of Gold, normally more than what most Meats can net you.


The items you might dig up from graves include knots, buttons, toys, and a lawn gnome, which apparently amuses the Pig King immensely, judging by the amount of Gold he hands you.
Graves, and therefore items from them, are non-renewable and scarce in the original game, however, and must be considered as a sort of last resort if you need a lot of Gold at once. In the Reign of the Giants DLC of the PC edition and the console edition, these items can sometimes be found by breaking open Tumbleweeds in the Desert, but it’s still not very reliable despite the yield.

, Caverns are found by mining a large, craggy boulder called a Plugged Sinkhole you sometimes encounter while exploring, and going down the revealed hole in the ground. An earthquake would naturally and randomly happen underground, and would normally net you a small amount of Gold once it ends, though you’d have to be careful during it as rocks are constantly falling and will damage the player when hit with a falling rock.


You can sometimes trigger earthquakes by detonating Gunpowder and Slurtle Slime while in the Caverns. You can make Gunpowder by combining a Rotten Egg, Charcoal, and Nitre, and you can get Slurtle Slime by killing Slurtles, which look like an odd combination of turtle and slug, or feeding them plenty of Rocks.

, Sometimes, when exploring the Caverns, you will encounter giant white rabbits hopping around, or a carrot-shaped house. These Bunnymen are the underground equivalent of the Pigs, which means you could befriend them with carrots and they will aid you for as long as their loyalty lasts. You can also kill them by hitting them with a weapon or tool, or by letting them fight monsters for you. Killing them will net you a carrot, a piece of meat, and occasionally, a Bunny Puff, which you can trade to the Pig King for 2 Gold Nuggets. However, it’s an uncommon drop from the Bunnymen despite its worth.

, The Ruins is a layer lower than the Caverns and accessed by mining an orange pile of rock and going down in the resulting hole. When you find a pond and fish in the Ruins, you’ll get an Eel, which is renewable and worth a good 5 Gold Nuggets each when traded to the Pig King, unlike other Meat items. Fishing in the Ruins is reserved for late-game ventures, though, since the area is very dangerous.

Stock up on surface resources.,
Scout out your resources.,
Feed some Rock Lobsters and Bunnymen.,
Pick some Light Flowers.,
Harvest some Bananas.,
Wait for an Earthquake.,
Farm some Slurtles.,
Squish some Spiders.,
Smack some Batsilisks.,
Beat down a Big Tentacle.,
Defeat the Depths Worms.,
Go insane and farm Nightmare Fuel.",How to Farm the Caves in Don't Starve," Some items can be found underground, but it’s not reliable to just search for the odd Tree or Grass Tuft for your material needs. Bring down as many Berry Bushes, Pinecones, Grass Tufts, and Saplings as you can, and create at least an Alchemy Engine (but don’t place it until you get underground!) to bring with you down below. You don’t need to bring down many Rocks or Flint. You can also bring several other renewable resources underground to make your life much easier, as well as give you an opportunity to farm the necessities.

If you have a Beefalo Horn, you can lure down some Beefalo with you when you venture into the Caverns.
If you can, create other structures like Drying Racks, Bee Boxes, Crock Pots, and Pig Houses (again without placing any of them, before venturing down). This will save you inventory space and let you place many structures as you can without using up your initial supplies.;
, Before running off, take stock of what resources are nearest to you or look for a safe, clear area close to many of your desired resources. This is so you can establish a safe area you can retreat to whenever you need it, as well as an area to keep your possessions and structures., You have two creatures here you can use to help farm hostile mobs, and they’re both fairly easy to befriend. Rock Lobsters eat pretty much any mineral material on the ground and are easily befriended when you feed them the same materials. Bunnymen are a bit pickier since they only accept Carrots, but both of these creatures function much like Pigs. You can take them with you and they’ll protect you from threats and such as long as they’re fed. They’re not necessary for farming but are more than welcome since there’s quite a lot of things trying to kill you in the Caves!

Make sure you don’t have any meat items in your inventory (including backpacks but excluding Chester) when you approach the Bunnymen, since they immediately become hostile and try to kill you.
Bunnymen give you a light Sanity Boost whenever you’re close to a friendly one, which makes them good for companionship if your Sanity is flagging. Rock Lobsters regenerate their health and grow whenever they’re camouflaged, making them perfect for beating up boss mobs or farming hostiles.

, You’ll find these new, interesting plants growing around the Caves, and they provide quite a bit of light in an otherwise dark and dreary area. The Light Flowers yield you Light Bulbs when picked, and will regrow in about 3–6 days, depending on the type you picked.

Light Flowers are available in 3 variations: one with a single stem, one with two stems, and one with three stems, with the three-stem one taking the longest to regrow its bulb.
The Light Bulbs are used primarily to refuel your Lantern and Miner Hat, or can be left in the ground for a short while to provide you a glowing path marker of sorts. They can also be used to prevent the Night Monster from maiming you terribly.
Light Bulbs spoil after 6 days, so harvesting a lot at a time is unnecessary and wasteful despite being easily renewed.

, Occasionally, you’ll encounter an underground biome visually and functionally similar to the surface Forest biome. Sometimes, you may even be luckier to find a Cave Banana tree growing in it. They basically resemble thin, bent trunks with Bananas growing from the stalk. The tree itself isn’t renewable, but the fruit growing from it is renewable every 4 days. They’re not very filling, just about as much as Berries, but they make excellent filler for your Crock Pot recipes., Earthquakes happen periodically in the Caverns. They can also be triggered with explosives or by beating a Big Tentacle. When it happens, Rocks, Nitre, and Flint start falling down from the ceiling (along with some Rabbits and Moleworms in Reign of Giants ), and with a chance for Gold Nuggets, Gems, or even Marble to drop down as well. This makes those materials infinitely renewable, if a bit unreliable for the case of Gold, Gems, and Marble. Be careful not to get hit by them when they fall!, Sometimes, you’ll encounter a huge slimy pile of rock surrounded by slugs with turtle shells. These slimy nuisances tend to devour almost every type of mineral (excluding marble) and also tend to assault you when you carry any gem or rock with you, including the rare Thulecite. When they die, though, they drop the useful Slurtle Slime (which you can use as an explosive or to refuel Miner Hats and Lanterns), the less useful Broken Shells (which you can only use to craft Potted Ferns), or the extremely useful Shelmet (which the second-strongest helmet you can wear). You can also place stacks of Rocks and Flint on the ground for them to eat, which makes them drop some Slurtle Slime without the risk you take when killing them. As long as you don’t destroy the slimy Slurtle Mound they live in, your resource is near-infinitely renewable.

Slurtles are extremely slow, so kiting them or getting your Bunnymen or Rock Lobster minions to deal with them is pretty easy.
There’s a rarer variation of Slurtle called a Snurtle, which flees from you when you come too close, and adds an annoying “hide” ability where it retreats into its shell and become practically invulnerable to attack. You can beat it by attacking it whenever its head pokes out from the shell. Beating one has a huge chance of dropping its shell, which you can use as an armor and to hide from enemies and take no damage whatsoever!

, Aside from regular Spiders, two new kinds are introduced in the Caverns and are spawned from structures called Spilagmites, which look like a set of stalagmites covered in black webbing. The two new Spiders are the Cave Spiders and the Spitters, and they are quite a bit tougher than regular Spiders. Thankfully, though, all you need to do is place Traps all over the Stalagmites to avoid unnecessary conflict.

Spitters have a long-ranged “spitting” attack while Cave Spiders retreat into their shells when attacked. However, they are easy to stunlock, meaning you can just keep attacking them once you have an opening, and they’ll die quite easily. Just make sure you attack them one at a time or have some helpers to prevent swarming.

, These pests spawn sporadically and randomly, and are usually found flapping about in the Caverns, but they die with one hit of a spear. Since they spawn randomly but constantly, you can just keep killing them without any regrets. They drop Monster Meat and Batsilisk Wings when killed, and constantly drop Guano while roaming around., These huge buggers spawn from holes in the ground and spawn Baby Tentacles to murder you whenever you attack it. Since they respawn, you can beat them about once a day. They drop some nice loot, like Tentacle Spikes and Tentacle Spots.

The Big Tentacles only drop Tentacle Spikes, Tentacle Spots, and Skeletons once a day, which makes this not as viable as it could be, but still makes those items renewable.

, These beasties function much like the Hound attacks of the surface, but in a more heinous manner. While periodically they will go out of their way to murder you, sometimes they lure you in with a bright blue plant that glows in the dark, then attack you relentlessly. If you manage to run away from them, they settle back down with only their bright blue lures visible. The maximum you can encounter in a single wave is 3, but with their ridiculous health, fighting them is pretty daunting without good weapons and armors or help from Rock Lobsters or Bunnymen.

When you beat Depths Worms, they drop 4 Monster Meats and a single Glow Berry. While there’s quite a few creative uses for Monster Meat, it’s the Glow Berry you’re actually farming. The Glow Berry spoils in 10 days, but when you eat it, you glow quite brightly for about 90 seconds.
In RoG, you can use a Glow Berry, plus 2 Moleworms and 2 Electrical Doodads, to craft the Moggles, which lets you see in the dark for a total of 12 minutes and can be refueled by Glow Berries before it breaks, making the Berries much more useful.
Their basic attack pattern is to attack from underground, surface once, and attack again without resurfacing. Then the patterns repeats. You can get a good 4–5 hits when they resurface, but you can’t stunlock them. Kiting tactics work best for the Worms but will definitely take you a very long time to kill just one without Rock Lobsters or Bunnymen helping you out.
Don’t use Tooth Traps to deal with Depths Worms, since they don’t trigger the traps while underground. Bee Mines are effective though.

, The Caverns constantly pick apart your sanity the longer you stay, since it’s perpetually dark and all that, making this place excellent if you want to farm Nightmare Fuel. All you need to do is neglect to heal up your sanity until the first of your hallucinations turn solid. You’ll want the ones that look like huge ticks and not the ones with huge beaks, since the tick-looking ones are easier to kill. Now lower your sanity until it reaches 30%. Simply run up to your hallucinations, and start killing them! Kiting tactics work best on both enemy types, but the tick-looking ones are weaker and thus easier to kill. Attacking or being close to your solid hallucinations eats away at your sanity, but slaying the shadowy creatures will boost it back up. They only drop Nightmare Fuel, but seeing as it’s a vital ingredient to make many magical items, you’ll be needing them all soon enough.

Better stay away from your Bunnymen friends if you plan on getting insane, since they transform into fearsome Beardlords. While they are neutral towards you and can also be befriended with Carrots, they drain your Sanity, much like normal monsters do. If you try to kill these guys, they will drop Beard Hair and Monster Meat upon death.
If you want a high-risk, high-reward challenge, go look for Nightmare Fissures in the Caves. The Fissures look like small holes in the ground and their light grows and wanes in cycles—the brighter the light, the higher the chance of spawning Nightmare creatures. Those creatures spawned are functionally like your hallucinations, but more aggressive and don’t heal your sanity upon defeat. The Fissures also drain your sanity the brighter the light, so be very careful.

Study the box art of different Pokémon games.,
Take a look at the version's exclusive Pokémon.,
Choose which legendaries appeal to you the most.,
Check to see whether there are any other exclusive features.,
If you have friends who own or are considering getting one of the Pokémon games, you might choose to get the opposite so that you can swap those version exclusives!

",How to Choose a Pokémon Version," It usually features the artwork of the legendary Pokémon in that game. Do you want Arceus, Groudon, Lugia, or Rayquaza? Perhaps you'd like to sport Zekrom or Giratina. Maybe the appearance of Vicinti appeals to you. You could base your decision on the appearance alone, or you could take a look at its moves and base stats over at a well known Pokémon site.;
, Here's a list of all the Legendary Pokémon and the games they belong in:



Gen I (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow): Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo, and Mew.

Gen II (Gold, Silver, Crystal): Raikou, Entei, Suicune, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Celebi.

Gen III (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, LeafGreen): Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Jirachi, and Deoxys.

Gen IV (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver): Uxie, Mespirit, Uxie|Azelf, Dialga, Palkia, Heatran, Regigigas, Giratina, Cresselia, Phione, Manaphy, Darkrai, Arceus, and Shaymin.

Gen V (Black, White, Black 2, White 2): Vicinti, Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion, Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, Kyurem, Keldeo, Meloetta, and Genesect.

Gen VI (X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire): Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.

, It can be a painful decision if your favourites are split across different versions, but you might find someone to trade with later on!, In Pokémon Black, for instance, you have access to Black City (for your reference, this is a city containing a bunch of tough trainers with Pokémon from levels 50-65), a couple of rotation battles, and an opportunity to make the occasional 10,000 coins. Pokémon White allows you to enter the White Forest, where you can catch old favourites from the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions, all at level 5. There are some trainers to battle, too. Don't worry, though: with 'game sync' you can access the other version (if you have Black 2, you can connect with White 2 via Game Sync) as long as you have a friend with the other version.

Know your Pokémon.,
Decide on the size.,
Find your Pokémon.,
Order your plush.,
Prepare for your new friend's arrival.,
Enjoy and love your new friend!",How to Choose a Pokémon Plush," If your favorite Pokémon is, say, Mantyke, then you will need to read up on it. A recommended source is Bulbapedia, an online Pokémon encyclopedia.;
, If you want to take your Pokémon everywhere with you, Poke Dolls are highly recommended. Or, if you want to keep it in your room,you may want a larger one, so you don't lose it as easily.

, Look up ""xxxx plush"" without the quotes and replace ""xxxx"" with your Pokémon. Keep in mind, though, that looking up Pikachu or Squirtle will have many results, while Qwilfish or Machop may not. If this happens, try another favorite Pokémon.

, You will, however, need a credit card to do so. If you are a kid or do not have your own credit card yet, then your parents will need to order it for you, as they will probably freak out at you if you use their credit card without permission.

, You can make a small bed for it, and make a menu with tasty foods for it to eat. Pokémon love Berries, so you can prepare pretend foods for it (Rawst Berry Crepes, Chesto Berry Salad, etc.) that contain Berries. Of course, it won't mind other foods at all, unless it's just plain gross., Wake it up in the morning with a hug and kiss, pack it lunch to eat at noon if you are at school, play with it after you come home, and have dinner and dessert at night! Do fun things with it related to its type like ""diving"" under the blankets if you have a Water-type, or, if you own a Fire-type, you could pretend hike at the edge of an active volcano!"

If you are playing Diamond and Pearl, get some Honey from the man in Floaroma Meadow for 100 Pokémon Dollars.,
Slather honey on a tree.,
Since Munchlax trees have a 1% chance of attracting a Munchlax, and you don't know which are Munchlax trees, slather honey on the same tree until a Munchlax appears.,
If you are playing HeartGold and SoulSilver, there is a Snorlax at Route 11.",How to Catch Munchlax," You can also capture a Combee and use its ability to get Honey after battling with it.;
, Only four trees in the game will attract Munchlax, which will be chosen randomly before you start playing. If they are a Munchlax tree (you won't know if it is or not), there's only a 1% chance of attracting one, so try finding the good one.

, If you slather the same tree ten times and a Munchlax hasn't appeared, better try another tree.

, You will have to breed it. Since it will probably be male, you'll have to capture a Ditto to breed it, and if you're lucky and it's female, you can breed it with any Pokémon of the Monster egg Group. Note that Snorlax must be holding a Full Incense to get Munchlax, if not, you'll get a Snorlax.

Make a decision.",How to Choose the Best Starter Pokémon for You," Some people believe that they are three difficulties. Grass is hard, Water is easy, and Fire is medium. Don't believe this. It's not the same for all Pokémon games.;
, If you are not sure what to expect, then go for the Water type. It's the best for people that are new to Pokémon games. Grass types are for people that like a challenge, and Fire types are average.

, Just because your friend chose Water doesn't mean you have to pick that one too!

, Everyone has different things they like. If you like the ocean, choose Water. If you like the outdoors, choose Grass. If you like bright sunshine, choose Fire.

, That way you'll at least have an idea as to what the circumstances are.

, It pretty much comes down to this. It is totally your decision. If your friend tells you that's a bad one, you can bet their rival chose it too - and it keeps beating them.

Get the National Pokedex.,
Trade for Arceus if possible.,
Transfer Arceus from another version.",How to Catch Arceus1," This will unlock all of the Pokémon in your pokedex, allowing you to catch and migrate Pokémon across versions.Obtaining this will vary depending on which version of the game you are playing..

To unlock this on Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, you'll need to complete two tasks: beat the Elite Four and see all 150 Pokémon in the Sinnoh Pokedex. You don't need to capture them, just see them.
To unlock this on HeartGold and SoulSilver, you'll need to complete two tasks: beat the Elite Four and capture 60 Pokémon from the Pokedex.;
, Arceus is an Event Pokémon, meaning that it could only be acquired legitimately through special events held by Nintendo. The last Arceus event was in 2010 and there are no more planned, meaning the only way to get one in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum without cheating is to trade with someone who got one from the event.

Arceus is an incredibly rare Pokémon, so you'll likely only be able to trade for one if you have an equally rare Pokémon to offer in return. Event Legendaries such as Landorus and Deoxys are good choices. If you have a Shiny Legendary such as a Shiny Mew or Shiny Rayquaza, this will also be good for trading.

, This can be done by trading Pokémon to yourself or by download 3DS software like pokebank, which allows you to to perform transfers with a single system. The steps for transferring Pokémon will vary depending on which versions you are transferring to/from.

Since Arceus is not available in earlier versions, you will at least be transferring from Generation 4.
You can trade an Arceus from Diamond, Platinum, Pearl, HeartGold, or SoulSilver using PokeTransfer, as well as from any of the Black or White games as a regular trade.
In order to get an Arceus from an older version of the Pokémon to X or Y, it will need to first be transferred to Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. You can then use PokeTransporter and PokeBank to transfer Arceus into X or Y.

Be aware of the modified combat mechanics for the Safari Zone.,
Use bait to make a Pokémon less likely to run.,
Use rocks to make a Pokémon easier to catch.,
Use safari balls to attempt to capture Pokémon.,
In general, go for capture attempts after one or two rock throws.,
Use your limited steps carefully.,
Be prepared to pay the entrance fee.,
Consider exploring the math of capture mechanics.",How to Catch Pokémon in Safari Zone1," In the Safari Zone, you'll have four options during battle that work differently than your four ""ordinary"" options. These new options are: use bait, use a rock, use a safari ball, and run away. In some games, ""bait"" is referred to as ""food"" and ""rocks"" are referred to as ""mud"" — in both cases, they function identically. In this subsection, we'll briefly review these new combat mechanics.Note that the ""run away"" option functions as normal, so we won't be discussing it.;
, In the Safari zone, you can't attack the Pokémon you come across, so the main thing determining whether or not you'll be able to capture one is whether the Pokémon runs away. Pokémon in the Safari Zone tend to be more skittish than normal and will sometimes run away after just a few moves. Throwing out some bait makes the Pokémon you encounter less likely to run, buying you more time to catch them.


However, using bait will also make the Pokémon more difficult to catch in a safari ball. Thus, striking a balance here can be difficult — the longer you get the Pokémon to stick around for, the harder it will be to actually capture it.

, On the other side of the coin are rocks: unlike bait, they make the Pokémon you are confronting easier to catch. Since the safari balls you get in the Safari Zone are fairly weak, softening your target up with a rock or two can be a big help when it comes to capturing them.


However, there's an important downside: using rocks will also make the Pokémon more likely to run away. In fact, after taking more than a few rocks, a Pokémon is virtually guaranteed to run away — some will exit the battle sooner. Thus, once again, using rocks means striking a delicate balance as you try to capture your Pokémon.

, As noted above, you can't use any of the ""normal"" pokéballs from the rest of the game in the Safari Zone. Instead, you are forced to use safari balls, which are quite weak, especially when dealing with higher-level Pokémon that would be difficult to catch with stronger pokéballs. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to get the most out of your safari balls so generally your best bet is to simply throw one after a rock or two and hope for the best.


Note that you only have a limited supply of safari balls (depending on the game, usually 30), so save them for Pokémon you want to catch. It's generally the best use of your time to use your safari balls for Pokémon that are only found in the safari zone.

, Unless you're willing to explore the actual math the Pokémon games use to determine whether or not you make a successful capture (more on this below), Safari Zone battles can be a frustratingly inexact science. As a very general rule, your best chances for capturing a Pokémon is generally to throw a safari ball after you've hit the Pokémon with a rock or two. However, be prepared for failure, as Safari Zones can be notoriously difficult even if you maximize your chances for success.


Note that safari balls are weak compared to the pokéballs you can use in the rest of the game. In addition to this, especially rare Safari Zone Pokémon are extra-difficult to catch.This can lead to some very frustrating situations — for instance, it can easily take 20 or more tries to catch an exceptionally rare Pokémon like Clefairy.

, It's important to understand that you are not allowed to stay in the Safari Zone forever. Instead, you are limited to a certain number of steps while within the zone (even if you're on a bike). When you run out of steps, you are taken out of the zone. This means that you need to plan your path through the zone carefully. Head directly to the area that contains the Pokémon you want to try to capture and use the steps you have remaining solely to capture the Pokémon you want. It is helpful to consult a map of the Safari Zone before entering to plan your trip.


Bulbapedia, an online user-supported Pokémon encyclopedia, has extensive information about each game's Safari Zone, including maps and guides covering where to look for the Pokémon in each zone. See the Bulbapedia Safari Zone article to get started.Note that there is no step limit in the Safari Zone in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver., It costs in-game money to enter the Safari Zone — not a huge amount, but enough that it bears mentioning. This entrance fee must be repaid every time you enter the Safari Zone. In other words, if your Safari Zone visit ends for any reason, you'll need to pay again the next time you visit.


Across all of the games in the series, the entrance fee has stayed the same: 500 P. This includes the Great Marsh in Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, which is not technically a Safari Zone but behaves very similarly.
One smart strategy is to save your game before you enter the Safari Zone. This way, if you don't catch any Pokémon you want, you can re-load to avoid paying the entrance fee again.

, In Pokémon, the likelihood of capturing a certain Pokémon when you throw a pokéball is determined by a math equation that takes into account a variety of variables, like its remaining HP, any status effects it is suffering, and more. Avid Pokémon players have analyzed these equations for each game to determine the best ways to catch Pokémon. Though the specifics of every game's equations are too complicated to explore in depth here, a great place to start is Bulbapedia's catch rate article, which has each game's capture equations and a section on how Safari Zone mechanics effect capture rates.

As an example of the sort of equation used in the games to determine whether certain Pokémon are captured, consider the equation from the Generation games (Gold and Silver):a = max((3 × HPmax - 2 × HPcurrent) × ratemodified / (3 × HPmax), 1) + bonusstatus
where HPmax is the Pokémon's maximum HP, HPcurrent is the Pokémon's current HP, ratemodified is the catch rate of the Pokémon modified by the ball used (every Pokémon and every ball modifies this in a certain way, and bonusstatus is the modifier for any status condition (sleep and freeze are 10, all others are 0).When you throw a ball, a random number between 0 and 255 is generated. If this number is less than or equal to a, the Pokémon is caught.

Buy Items: The next step would be to get the proper amount of Pokeballs and Potions, because the Dogs and Latis all have a catch rate of 3, meaning your chances of catching them on your first ball are very slim, and they can really damage you, possibly thwarting that attempt at catching them.

,, You'll find out why soon enough.

,, While holding an Everstone, a Pokémon has a high chance of passing on it's nature to the baby Pokémon. Eventually, you will get an egg, and then soon after, a baby Eevee, hopefully with the correct nature. Sometimes, this will take multiple attempts. Don't get down, just carry a Pokémon with Magma Armor or Flame Body abilities in your party to cut the egg hatching time in half.

, But, don't evolve it until after Eevee gets to be level 36, so it will learn Baton Pass, which is crucial. Then train it up to level 57 so it will learn Mean Look, and have the Ability Synchronize, so the opponent Pokémon is likely to have the same Nature as you.

, Mime and Drowzee. Find or trade a female Mr. Mime or Mime Jr. to your game, and then get yourself a male Drowzee. Make sure Drowzee knows Hypnosis, and then put them both in the daycare. Eventually, you'll end up with a Mr. Mime that knows Hypnosis. Although, that alone won't do. Make absolutely certain that the Mr. Mime from the egg has the ability Soundproof. This is absolutely crucial!

, EV train the Mr. Mime in it's Defense and Special Defense stats, so it will last longer. Train it up to level 46 so it will learn Baton Pass, which isn't really crucial, but it helps.

, If it learns it from leveling up though, just save your money.

, Max Repels won't be very effective with this strategy, but somehow a running Pokémon is always the second or third Pokémon people encounter in that route, Max Repel or not. Track them in your Pokedex or Pokegear to find them in the same route, and make sure your Pokémon in the first slot of your party is your False Swiping Pokémon. Then just Swipe them, and repeat this step until only a small portion of their health is left. Now, your False Swipe Pokémon has done it's job.

, Then, use Mean Look. The target will have wasted that turn trying to run, and you'll have trapped it. Now, on your next turn, use Baton Pass, and pass to Mr. Mime, with the Soundproof ability. This will keep them from being able to Roar you away, and you will have Hypnosis to put them to sleep.

, Once they're down to a sliver of health and sound asleep, begin bombarding them with Ultra Balls and, depending on your level, Level Balls. Dusk Balls work well at night, and keep some Timer Balls on hand, too, because this could take a long time.

, You'll eventually catch the target with the desired nature, and then you can begin EV training it to battle your friends, or to use in the Battle Tower, or just for your Pokedex.

,
Finished.

",How to Catch Giratina Easier," In particular, Ultra Balls, Timer Balls, and Dusk Balls (if you're catching it in Turnback Cave). You'll also want to purchase some Potions and Revives in case your Pokémon gets low in health and/or faints during the battle.;
, You should have a Normal/Flying Pokémon such as Staraptor on you, since it won't be affected by either Shadow Force or Earth Power. Make sure your Pokémon are at or around the level that Giratina is, which is level 70 (Diamond/Pearl) or 47 (Platinum).

,


Heal your wall when its HP is close to zero (prepare for the possibility of a critical hit too).






Use your Normal/Flying-type Pokémon (if you have one) whenever Giratina starts Shadow Force. That way, his attack will lower and the attack will do nothing. If you don't have a Normal-type Pokémon, switch to a Pokémon that resists Ghost attacks.







, Don't use poison or burn, since you risk making it faint before you're able to catch it.

Learn whether it is a ""Waiting"", ""Roaming"", or ""IA"" (Item Activated) Pokémon.,
If it is a roaming legendary: use moves like Mean Look or an ability like Shadow Tag to ensure it can't escape!,
Know what level the Pokémon is, and the abilities and moveset it has.,
Save right before going into the battle.,
Use the right Poké Balls.,
When you catch the legendary Pokémon, save the game!",How to Catch a Legendary Pokémon," A waiting legend just sits and waits there for you (Dialga, Palkia, etc). Roaming legends have you find them, then they run away (Mesprit, Cresselia, Suicune, Raikou, Entei, etc). Item activated Pokémon requires an item from another game such as Wi-Fi connection, Mystery Gift, or hacking (use only as a last resort), for example Shaymin, Heatran, Arceus, Manaphy, Deoxys, etc).


Item activated Pokémon are most likely considered a mythical, or a Pokémon who cannot be captured using only in-game methods, as they require another item. Also, a select few legendaries or mythicals are given out for free, but you don't need to catch these, so if you're looking for one of those, you will not need this article's assistance. You can always find out information like this on the Internet.
;
, Shadow Tag and Mean Look can help out a lot! If you don't have a Pokémon with these moves, some legendaries will move to a new route every time you do, so switch between routes for a bit, and, if (like in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver) you can see where the legendary is, you can tell when the legendary is near, and then go search for it.

, This is very crucial information. Knowing what type the legend is, helps determine what you will need to heal yourself (Paralyze Heal, Awakening, Antidote, etc.) Knowing the level will tell you what Pokémon to bring. Too low a level, and you will be defeated. Too high, and you defeat the legend. Bring a Pokémon that won`t kill it, but can at least endure the battle (if you can, bring a level 100 Pokémon no matter what, so that once you weaken the legend with the other Pokémon you brought to actually battle it, you can put in the lv. 100 so when you try many times with Poké Balls, it can take the attacks of the legend). It is also a decent idea to bring a Pokémon to put your legend to sleep, as this improves your catch rates and gives you a few turns to heal, switch Pokémon, or throw Pokéballs.

, You may not get a second chance to catch it, and if you saved before you defeated it, you can soft reset (L+R+Start+Select) and try again! It is very comforting to have this save, and continuous soft resets can score you a shiny, although the chances are absurdly low.

, It is generally a good idea to use at least Ultra Balls (catch rate: x2). Use Net Balls for water and bug Pokémon (catch rate: x3). You can use Dusk Balls at night (day- and night-times are different for the Pokémon games. You should look that up on the internet.) or in caves (catch rate: x3.5). If you want even higher catch rates you can use Timer Balls (the catch rate depends on the length of the fight: round 1-10: x1; round 11-20: x2; round 21-30: x3; round 31+: x4!). Don't use the Master Ball unless you absolutely need to, because they are extremely rare! An unused Master Ball is a cool trophy! (Every legendary CAN be caught in a Pokéball that isn't the Master Ball.)

, It would be horrible to lose your prize!

Catch a Sneasel/Scyther, evolve it into a Weavile/Scizor and teach it False Swipe.,
Catch a Gastly and teach it Hypnosis.,
Level up your Pokémon as high as you can.

,
Buy as many Ultra Balls as you can.,
Go find that Legendary!

,
Engage the Pokémon in battle and use False Swipe to whittle down it's HP and use Hypnosis to send it to sleep.

,
Keep throwing Ultra Balls (or whatever you have) until the Pokémon is yours.

",How to Catch Legendary Pokémon Easily," False Swipe does decent damage for a 40PP move, but always leaves the Pokémon with 1HP.;
, Hypnosis sends the Pokémon to sleep, making it incapable of attack and easier to catch. (Although Pokémon roaming around the map may still flee.)


If you are planning to catch a roaming Pokémon (Mesprit, Latias, etc.) teach Gastly Mean Look, which prevents wild Pokémon from escaping.

,, (Although some Pokémon may be better caught with others. Case in point, Groudon is the heaviest Pokémon ever so will be most vulnerable to Heavy balls.)

,,,"
"
Have a good amount of supplies for your Pokémon.,
Check to see if your Pokémon can inflict any status-changers on a wild Pokémon.,
Enter a patch of tall grass.,
Walk around.,
Battle the wild Pokémon.,
Access your Bag.,
Select the ball you plan to use.,
Wait.",How to Catch a Pokémon in Any Game," In order to catch Pokémon, you'll need any type of Poké Ball; however, you may want to stock up on other supplies as well, such as types of potions for your current Pokémon party. Additionally, if you're going to be searching for Pokémon in a building or a cave, you may want to purchase a few Escape Ropes in case you get lost or want to get out without being surprised by another Pokémon.

If your party Pokémon are at low health or have a status condition, take them to a Pokémon Center if possible. You don't have to use any potions or status restorers, and it's free.
Keep in mind the type of Poké Ball you're using matters. A typical Poké Ball would work fine on a Pidgey that's Level 6, but not so well on a Level 40 Gyarados. Consider using Great Balls or Ultra Balls for higher-leveled Pokémon, or a Master Ball - but only use the Master Ball on legendary, hard-to-catch Pokémon, as this has a 100 percent catch rate and you don't want to waste it on something easy to catch.

Time matters in Pokémon catching, too. The Timer Ball introduced in Generation III becomes more effective the longer a battle has gone on. Additionally, in Generation IV, the introduced Dusk Ball has a higher chance of catching a Pokémon if it's used at night, or in caves. There is lots of different balls that work better in different situations.

;
, If you have a Pokémon with a status-changing move such as Thunder Wave or Sing, use it. A Pokémon in your party with the moves Mean Look and/or False Swipe is a good choice as well; Mean Look prevents the Pokémon from fleeing, and False Swipe brings down the Pokémon's HP to one, making it easy to catch.

, In order to encounter a wild Pokémon, you'll want to enter a place where Pokémon can see you, such as tall grass, a cave, or certain ""haunted"" buildings that vary between the games. Running is recommended to attract the wild Pokémon.


If you've used any type of Repel recently, make sure it has worn off before you enter the tall grass. Otherwise, you won't get any Pokémon unless they're of a very high level.

, Sometimes, it may take a while for a wild Pokémon to appear. Don't get discouraged; simply walk around until something finds you. You'll know by either the battle music, or if you have the volume off, the screen suddenly changing to a battle screen!

In the Safari Zone in all Pokémon games, you have a limited number of steps. If you don't want to waste the steps you have, simply lightly tap a new direction on the D-pad; your character won't move, but you'll have increased odds of a Pokémon appearing.

, Get the wild Pokémon's HP to the orange zone. Try to avoid getting it into the red if you plan on using moves that inflict the Pokémon with a harmful status ailment (e.g. poisoning or burns); these ailments have more effect the longer they've been there, and may knock the Pokémon out.

, Once the wild Pokémon's HP has been significantly lowered, select the Bag/Item button. Select the Poké Balls tab.

, Use a suitable ball per the Pokémon's level and rarity. As mentioned above, you don't want to use a Master Ball on a Horsea.

, After the ball is selected, an animation will play of the Poké Ball being tossed. The ball will then shift side-to-side a few times; if it does so three times and then stars come out from the ball, you've captured your Pokémon successfully! If that doesn't happen, repeat the steps until the Pokémon gets knocked out or you capture it.

Get used to the controls.,
Know when Bonnie and Chica leave the stage.,
Check the door lights.,
Check on Pirate's Cove.,
Check the Show Stage.,
Repeat.",How to Beat Night 6 of Five Nights at Freddy's," You will need to be able to do things quickly, like close doors, so getting used to the controls of the game is a must to survive. This is a must, failing to do this means you will probably die.;
, It is recommended alternating between Pirate's Cove and the Show Stage until you see either Bonnie or Chica leave.

, Don't chase down Bonnie or Chica on the cameras, it will only waste power. Checking the blind spots by your doors to see if they are there is a better way to keep track of where they are. If they are there, quickly close the door, then open when they are gone.

, Foxy is a large threat on the sixth night, so make sure you keep an eye on him.

, If you look at the Show Stage as often as you look at Pirate's Cove, Freddy will not leave. That's right, there is a way to keep Freddy away.

, If you do these steps quickly and properly, there is a big increase in the chance that you will survive the night.

Determine your target.,
Select your Pokémon.,
Get equipped.,
Capture Pokémon through random encounters.,
Weaken your target.,
Be persistent.,
Name your new Pokémon.",How to Catch All the Pokémon in a Pokémon Video Game1," Knowing what kind of Pokémon you are trying to catch will help you determine what items to bring along, which Pokémon you want on your team, and what kind of strategy to use.;
, Low health targets might require you to bring a lower level team. For powerful or legendary targets, you might need to bring along your most powerful Pokémon.


In normal game play, it's effective to use strong types against weak types, like a fire type against a grass type. Since you can't catch a Pokémon if it faints, you might want to choose a Pokémon the same type as your target.

, No collector can call himself a master if he doesn’t have the right tools for the job! Master Pokémon hunters like yourself will need the right pokéball to catch your prey.These can be found at the Pokémart or Pokémon Center. Each new version of the Pokémon game adds new features, but the main Pokéballs you should be familiar with are:Standard Pokéball
Great Ball
Ultra Ball
Master Ball
Safari Ball

, The most common way of acquiring new Pokémon is through randomly generated battles that occur when moving your character through certain areas. The most common places to randomly encounter a Pokémon are:Tall grass
Water (using the Surf ability)
Caves
Fishing

, A random encounter will pit your team of Pokémon against a wild one. Wild Pokémon are more resistant to capture when at full health, you should weaken your prey before attempting to throw a pokéball.


If your target still refuses to be caught, try a status effect, like sleep or paralysis, to improve your chances.

, Some ultra-rare Pokémon can take hours of random encounters before you finally find the one you’re looking for.


This activity, sometimes called “grinding,” might be more enjoyable for you listening to your favorite music, an audio book, or a movie.

, Don’t forget to check out the new entry in your pokédex and see what you can learn about your new friend.

Catch lower level forms.,
Increase your Pokémon’s level.,
Find, buy, or win evolution stones.,
Use evolution stones.",How to Catch All the Pokémon in a Pokémon Video Game2," These are frequently more common and you can train them to gain experience (XP) and level up. Many Pokémon evolve after reaching a certain level, which means you may not need to catch a high-level form.


Your pokédex will still register the previous evolution as ""caught.""

, Some Pokémon, usually the high-level ones, can only be obtained through evolution. Pokémon like Charizard and Blastoise are extremely rare in the wild.


To increase the level of a Pokémon, battle other trainers or wild Pokémon. Winning battles lets your Pokémon gain experience points (XP), which raises its level.

, Some Pokémon will not evolve by simply raising its level. Pokémon like Pikachu and Clefairy will only grow if you use evolution-inducing items called “Evolution Stones” on them.Choose the Pokémon you use the stone on wisely – some evolution stones can be expensive.
These kinds of items are available throughout the game and most can be acquired through completing the game’s storyline.

, Select the item from your inventory. You’ll be asked to choose which Pokémon you want to use the stones on. After you pick the Pokémon, the evolution process will begin, changing your Pokémon into its adult form.

Catch Pokémon specific to your version of the game.,
Look for a person playing a different Pokémon game version.,
Seek out trainers who have already beaten the game.,
Trade Pokémon with the other player.",How to Catch All the Pokémon in a Pokémon Video Game3," This will help later when you want to trade with friends. Depending on your version, there will be unique Pokémon unavailable in the counterpart to your version.


It can also be helpful to catch two rare Pokémon, keeping one for yourself and saving the other later for trade.

, If you know someone playing a different version of the Pokémon, talk to that person and make arrangements for trading.


For example, if you’re playing the Pokémon Black version, look for someone playing the other version of the game, which is Pokémon White.

, Completing the game opens full access to the Pokémon in their version.

, Link the two devices either using a link cable (for Game Boy) or through Wi-Fi connections (for DS/3DS consoles). While inside the game, head to a Pokémon Center and begin the trading sequence.Avid collectors sometimes collect two of every kind of Pokémon to do a full swap with another player. Doing this will allow you to own all the Pokémon available for that version of the game.
If you can’t find anyone to trade with, get another version of the Pokémon game and complete it on another Nintendo portable game console (Game Boy, DS, 3DS).

Learn which events you can go to catch certain Pokémon.,
Explore the game thoroughly.",How to Catch All the Pokémon in a Pokémon Video Game4," On your way to beating the League, you'll encounter the Pokémon in the game that you can add to your ranks. Battles will also raise the level of your team, adding Pokémon to your collection through evolution.

, This is especially useful if your friend doesn’t want to give away a Pokémon specific to their version. By breeding it, you both can add to your pokédex.

, Note that some ultra-rare Pokémon are only found once a game and are impossible to breed. If your friend won't give up that kind of Pokémon, a brief trade will still work. If you return your friend's Pokémon, your pokédex will register the traded Pokémon as “caught.”

, Gotta Catch ‘em All Events are opportunities where you have better odds of adding certain rare Pokémon to your collection. A guidebook can be helpful, though many of the events are listed online.


Some online stores let you buy the tickets for the Pokémon (like eBay for example).
Examples of Pokémon you can get in events are Togepi, Eevee, Lapras, and Fossil Pokémon., Don't forget that some Pokémon might not be found in your version. But don't give up hope. Some Pokémon can only be found in areas still waiting for you to explore.

Remember your basics.,
Work with Foxy while in the closet.,
Be efficient.",How to Beat Night 4 of Five Nights at Freddy's 4," Little Fredbears will constantly be spawning on the bed at this point, so it should almost always be a priority when stopped back in the center of the room to turn around and clear at least one bear off of the bed. Keeping Foxy running around the halls is better than creeping in the closet. Bonnie will usually be the main concern on the doors as Chica tends to attack less frequently due to his constant need to rummage around in the kitchen.;
, More likely than not, Foxy will be slipping into the closet at some point during the night tonight, so it is always good to understand exactly how he works should this Nightmare decide to pay you a visit.


The single visual clue you receive that Foxy is now in the room is the closet door opening slightly and then returning back to its original position. You will also hear Foxy run into the room, and the closet will make a squeaking noise as he slips in. Foxy will give you a non-life threatening jumpscare when you first check on him.
Each of Foxy's stages reduces the amount of time needed to spend with the door closed. The first stage where Foxy’s head is sticking out with jaw open will require you to shut the closet for the longest amount of time to downgrade Foxy to a less threatening phase.

, As the animatronics are at their most active during this night, it is important to be as efficient as possible. A single second slip-up could cost you your life. Preloading commands while traveling to locations will shave seconds off the time it takes to do things.


Never run to the left or right door with the flashlight preloaded and ready to shine, as the only way to tell if Bonnie and Chica are at the doorway is to stop and listen for breathing for a few seconds. Preloading the flashlight at this point will likely result in a jumpscare.
Be prepared to run back to the center of the room as soon as you hear Bonnie and Chica walk away from the doorway and back down the hall. There is no need to further investigate the hallway with the flashlight until you hear them walking back again.
Always preload the flashlight to shine into the closet and quickly close the door for a few seconds if Foxy is seen. Keep the flashlight toggled on. Open the door, keeping the flashlight on the entire time, and close it again—repeat this until Foxy is in a safe state or another pressing matter becomes more relevant.

, False Swipes is a move that doesn't do much damage, but it can't knock out the enemy. This may not seem like a useful attack under normal circumstances, but it's great for whittling a tough Pokémon down to 1 HP without knocking it out.


False Swipe (TM54) can be found at Veilstone Dept. Store (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum), Goldenrod Dept. Store (HeartGold, SoulSilver), Professor Juniper (Black and White after you catch 25 Pokémon), Reversal Mountain (Black 2, White 2), Professor Sycamore's lab (X, Y), a man in the Rustboro City Pokémon Center (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).Scyther, Scizor, Farfetch'd, and several others learn False Swipe naturally.

, Use powerful attacks to take off large chunks of the wild Pokémon's HP. Once you get the bar down so that it turns yellow or red, start using your False Swipe attack to get it to 1 HP.


Lowering the wild Pokémon's health is the single most important factor in capturing it.

, Status Ailments are negative effects that are applied to the enemy Pokémon by certain attacks. Different Status Ailments will affect your capture chances by different amounts. See the chart below to see which ailments work best.

, Once your opponent is weakened and under the effects of a Status Ailment, you can start throwing your Poké Balls. When you throw a ball, calculations are made behind the scenes based on a variety of factors, including the Poké Ball used, the status ailment, the Pokémon's health, and its unique catch rate.

, Newer versions of Pokémon have introduced the concept of Critical Capture. When a Critical Capture occurs, the Poké Ball pauses in midair, and makes a metallic clanking noise. It will then only shake once when it hits the Pokémon. This essentially removes two of the four random calculations that occur when a Pokémon capture is attempted.


Critical Capture is determined by the number of Pokémon you have caught. You need to have at least 30 Pokémon for the chance to even occur, but you won't see significant increases until you have at least 300.

, It will take a long time, and it will require much patience. With that in mind, start the game.

, Ballora's cue is the ballet music that chimes from her music box. The music will be louder on either side depending on her position. Shut the door she gets closest to, and wait for her to leave. She will also jump scare you if you run out of power.

, His audio cues will give you the direction he is in, either right or left. He has two cues that indicate attack.

If you fail to type ""Lol"" before Lolbit appears on all three monitors, Lolbit will pop up on your screen as a distraction, and will stay for a few seconds or unless it is deterred.

, Yenndo is a rogue endoskeleton, very similar to that of Funtime Freddy. Yenndo will drain your oxygen while it is in your office. To make Yenndo go away, bring up your monitor, and bring it back down. If Yenndo drains all of your oxygen without countering him, he will attack and kill you.

, The pink puppet will race across your office at random, from right to left. Click on her nose with the mouse to make her go away. She will jumpscare you if you fail to click her nose before she reaches the other side.

, Electrobab will drain your power at random intervals. When you see a warning next to your power meter, check CAM 03 and CAM 04. Use a controlled shock on Electrobab immediately.

, Bidybab will climb through the central vent to get to you. The only audio cue will be thumping in the vents.

, They will appear randomly in CAM 06 and drain your oxygen. If you see a warning next to your oxygen meter, and Yenndo is not there, check the cameras and shock the Minireenas to make them disappear.

, Minireenas will appear at random and block your view, preventing use of the door and vent buttons. Once they appear, they will not leave until you die or complete the night..

Watch the power.",How to Beat Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location," You are in no danger on this night.
, Simply follow HandUnit's instructions and you'll move on quickly to the second night., When they begin opening the metal sheet, click and hold to keep it in place; dragging will be less effective. You'll need to do this twice, then you are told to go through Ballora Gallery.

, Move quickly if you want, but always stop whenever you hear Ballora's music playing. The loudness of the music indicates her proximity. Failure to stop moving when Ballora's music grows too loud will result in a game over.

, After reaching the Breaker Room, you are told to restart systems on the breaker panel. Opening the monitor will cause Freddy to approach, and restarting a system will make him approach even faster. It is best to partially restart a system, close the panel, play audio, and finish restarting a system. Upon restarting all systems, there is no more danger, and you may finish the night in peace.

, There, you will be provided with a flash beacon to help you. You will need to walk intermittently, and flash the beacon to avoid being attacked. Listen for footsteps going to either side, and walk the opposite way. Flashing the beacon too much or too little will result in a game over.

, It will guide you in how to remove Funtime Freddy's power module. You are in no danger here., After doing this, you are instructed to remove Bon-Bon's power module via clicking his black button. He will gradually rise up from either of Freddy's shoulders, and disappear when looked at.


It is best to keep Bon-Bon in the edge of the light beam as he rises up, then quickly move and click his button. Taking too long will result in his jumpscare. After doing this, there is no more danger, and you may complete the night.

, You no longer need to walk carefully, as Funtime Foxy will unavoidably jumpscare you and send you directly to Night 4., You will listen to Baby talk for a bit, and watch Ballora getting scooped. The real challenge of the night starts when Baby opens the faceplates on the suit.

, Once it does, set a three-minute timer to judge your proximity to the end of the night. The springlocks will then begin unwinding, and the Minireenas will start climbing up the suit.

Click and hold to wind springlocks, and shake left and right to get the Minireenas off the suit. Letting a springlock unwind fully or letting a Minireena climb too far will result in a Minireena's jumpscare and a game over.

, Keep this up as best as possible for the rest of the night. Once Minireenas begin climbing up the sides of the suit, try and wait until one is on each side before shaking them off, to maximize efficiency, as shaking will cause the springlocks to unwind faster. However, if only one Minireena is on the suit, and it's getting too far, shake anyway to avoid its jumpscare., Don't worry about these, as they won't kill you, but they will cause springlocks to unwind faster. After the three minutes is up, the night is over, and you may progress to Night 5., Night 5 is not very challenging, compared to earlier nights. When you are told by Baby to enter the random passcode, enter the numbers quickly and correctly; otherwise you will be jumpscared.  , Avoid flashing the beacon. You will then proceed to be ""scooped"" and the game will end., If you have completed the Baby ""death minigame"", you are now able to access the Private Room. When you reach Funtime Auditorium, completely ignore Baby's instructions and go forward and right until you reach the Private Room to face off against the hybrid animatronic, Ennard., You will have a short amount of time to get used to the game's mechanics, before the challenge starts. During this time, avoid using the monitor or the doors, as this will waste your extremely limited power supply., The real challenge begins once this sound is first heard. This will happen reasonably close to 1 AM. Listen carefully to where the sound is coming from. It will either be in the left, right, or center, signifying that he is on that side of the cameras., Close the corresponding door, and check the camera, on that side, closest to the room.

If Ennard isn't there, close the monitor and open the door.
If it is there, but not right up close, open the door and close it when you next hear movement, then double check to see that he's there.
If Ennard is right up close, or right at the door, keep it closed until you hear movement, therefore it has moved away.

, At one point around 4-5 AM, it is likely that audio cues can be heard rapidly, going from side to side. While this happens, Ennard is not immediately ready to attack, but he will likely end up right at the door when he stops moving., It is advised to use no more than 16-17% of power per hour. Unlike the first game, running out of power will result in an almost immediate death, as there is no stalling. If you find you've used more than the recommended power limit, it's best to restart the night."
"
Notice your power.,
Know there are four animatronics.,
Check the door lights and cameras only sparingly on Night 1.,
Check the doors rapidly on Night 2.,
Check the door lights more often than on the previous two nights on Night 3.,
Use the method of checking door lights more, but be more aware of Freddy's laugh on Night 4.,
Check Foxy and Freddy and check the doors while keeping the right door shut when viewing the monitor on Night 5.,
Use the same method for Nights 3 to 5 on Night 6, but be much quicker and more efficient.",How to Beat Five Nights at Freddy's," If you run out of power, Freddy Fazbear, the main antagonist, will come and end your long night.;
, The four animatronics are Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, Foxy the Fox Pirate, and Freddy Fazbear. These animatronics are listed in order of activeness. Bonnie is the most active, while Freddy is the least. Bonnie, Foxy, and Freddy come to the left door, and Chica always comes to the right door. Freddy also comes to the right door from night 3 onwards.

, However, this is all you'll need. The animatronics rarely attack, making this the best night to try to find Golden Freddy. Freddy is not active at all, (unless if you run out of power) Bonnie and Chica are not very active, and Foxy only has a small chance of appearing.

, Bonnie and Chica are activated much faster than on Night one. Foxy also appears, making the player constantly check the cameras. This is the final night where Freddy only attacks you if you run out of power. Once you check both doors about 7 or 8 times, check Pirate's Cove. Then, go back to checking your doors and rotate between the two.

, Chica and Bonnie become significantly more aggressive. Foxy also peeks out of the cove much faster than on Night two, so keep an eye on that. Freddy also becomes active on this night, but only a little. He will attack if not kept a close eye on. Use the same method for Night 2, except look at the Show Stage occasionally as well.


If Freddy is getting closer (i.e. East Hall or East Hall Corner), you may want to shut your Right Door whenever you check the cameras. Freddy is most likely to move when the monitor is raised .

, Freddy is much more active and is aware of the player's gameplay tactics. He is incredibly difficult to understand, predict, and deal with from now on.


Chica and Bonnie have the ability to make the doors and door lights fail completely, indicating they have infiltrated The Office and will attack when the monitor is next lowered or up for too long.
Foxy is also very active, sometimes peeking out before 1 AM.

, Night 5 is where the game gets incredibly brutal. The animatronics are more active than ever.


Just repeat this and you will (hopefully) survive the night, get a paycheck, and unlock the secret sixth night.

, In order to complete the night, it is advised to have certain amounts of power at certain times.


1 AM needs at least 80%, 2 AM needs at least 60%, 3 AM needs at least 40%, 4 AM needs at least 25%, and 5 AM needs at least 9%.
Completing Night 6 will unlock Night 7 (the Custom Night).

Don't pay much attention to Phone Guy.,
Become familiar with your mask.,
Don't be fooled by Foxy still being in the hall - you only need to flash him three times in quick succession every so often, not until he goes away.,
Wind up the music box.,
Don't waste time on the cameras!,
Watch out for Balloon Boy.,
Listen for Mangle - Mangle lets out a beeping, buzzing noise, much like a police scanner when she's in your vents.,
Don't give up if Mangle is in your office - she will not always attack, so if you're well into a night, you can at least try to finish it and hope she remains in place.

,
Breathe.,
Start a routine: Check one vent, flash your light three times as your camera moves, and check the other.,
If you fail to do these things properly, prepare for a jumpscare.",How to Beat Five Nights at Freddy's 2," All you need to remember are your flashlight, vent lights, music box and mask.;
, Use the mask whenever it is necessary; this is only when there is an animatronic in your vent, or when there is an animatronic directly in front of you. As a rule of thumb, try to put your mask on immediately when you bring your camera down. On later nights, the time you have to put your mask on after taking your camera down becomes very short.


Don't waste time putting your mask on if they're near you - they will not go away any quicker, so you are simply sitting there not flashing Foxy, not checking your vents, and not winding your music box.
Only Foxy can be disabled with the flashlight; the older animatronics require you putting on the mask as quickly as you can when they're in front of you. Failing to put your mask on quickly will make the older animatronics pop up to you, even if you are wearing the Freddy mask. Remember to put it on right away whenever you bring your camera down on later nights, without taking the time to check if an animatronic is present.

, On later nights, Foxy will be in the hall almost constantly.

, If you fail to keep winding up the music box, the Puppet will rise from her present box and kill you. Wind it all up, but don't check any other cameras! On later nights you may need to wind it partway then quickly deal with something else. If the Puppet gets out of the box, don't give up if you haven't died yet. If you wind the box quickly enough, the Puppet will stay in their room as long as the music keeps playing.

, The only camera necessary to your survival is the prize corner. Because it takes such a short time for animatronics to get on the move, keeping track of them is essentially pointless since you can only react to them when they're in your vents, face or, with Foxy, the hall.

, Although he does not jumpscare, he will disable your flashlight and vent lights as soon as he gets into your office, which will most likely result in death by Foxy unless you're very near the end of the night. Put on your mask if you see him in the vents.


If he gets in without you knowing it, the mask will not work on him, as he will stay inside your office until 6 AM arrives, or, most likely, you are killed.

, If you hear this while you're winding the music box, put it down and put your mask on, unless you can see her on the camera. If you have your mask on, and you stop hearing her, than she's no longer in your vent.

,, It's important to stay focused while playing - panicking will quickly result in a loss.

, If there's a toy in either vent, put your mask on, and wait for them to go away. Once you can, wind your music box, and once its wound pull down your camera and whip on your mask. Don't wait at all to take your mask off - the game will stop you from doing so if an animatronic is attacking you - and quickly repeat. This system, once you learn to do it quickly, will carry you all the way through the game if executed properly.

, Some animatronics have different jumpscares. Foxy jumps at you if you don't flash the flash light at him enough or if Balloon Boy disables your flashlight. Mangle swings from the ceiling to bite you. Bonnie reaches out for you. Chica, Freddy and Toy Freddy pop up. Toy Chica, Toy Bonnie, and The Puppet jump at you. Balloon Boy does not have a jumpscare. Thank you, Scott.

Reflect on the dangers of the first night.,
Learn the new dangers of the second night.,
Keep Foxy in a harmless state.,
Manage all four angles of attack.",How to Beat Night 2 of Five Nights at Freddy's 4," The two main worries of the first night were Nightmare Bonnie on the left and Nightmare Chica on the right. They may have sounded eerily similar to the untrained ear, but hopefully you noticed that there are indeed differences in the sounds they make. Knowing this will make you a more efficient player and, in turn, hopefully keep you alive longer.


Try to focus on their respective sounds on this night. It is still not crucial to know exactly which is which, but this might very well be your only really good opportunity to try and relax and focus, instead of fearing for your life the whole time.;
, Monsters begin to creep at 12AM now as each night brings a new challenge to the bedroom. The difficulty ramps up with the addition of Foxy now stalking you, and you will soon realize the closets role in the game. Foxy, just like a fox, is quick and smart. Foxy will actively avoid being seen by you, briskly running from side to side, which is also very disorienting while listening for Bonnie and Chica.


Foxy enters the room from either side door behind your back, and you will catch a glimpse of the closet opening and closing very briefly.
Foxy has four stages: The initial jumpscare and head out of the closet, head retracted back into the closet, standing up with only the hook hand in view, and the sweet, innocent plushie phase.

, Keeping Foxy outside of the room is ideal. Foxy can be heard as quick footsteps running from side to side, which will change if you follow the animatronic. If you take too long dealing with Chica or Bonnie, Foxy will run to the other side of the room and slip into the closet behind your back. You’ll know this happens when you return to the main area of the bedroom and see a quick animation of the closet door opening and closing slightly. Check the closet, and there will be a nonthreatening jumpscare. Keeping the flashlight on, close the closet door for a few seconds then open it. Foxy will only change states while the door is closed, so keep repeating this process until Foxy is in the plushie phase.


Actively listen for Bonnie, Chica, and the Little Freddy’s on the bed while dealing with Foxy.
Foxy’s plushie and hook phases are both considered safe, with either phase afterwards being danger zones, which puts your life at risk of an attack.

, Foxy is not a major threat this night, which leaves you the opportunity to develop other skills. Little Freddy's screams can be heard, and the lights will begin to flicker if they build up on the bed for too long. It is always safe to assume there is at least one on the bed, so make a quick check after everything you do. If Foxy has entered into the room, run to the closet and return the animatronic to a safe phase, then quickly run back to the bed afterwards.


Actively keep Bonnie and Chica away if they are heard. There is no need to keep checking for them when you know what sounds they make, which could waste precious time and lead to an attack. If either of them are heard walking down the hallway, take action to ward them off and return to the center of the room immediately afterwards. 6AM won’t come around so quickly on this night.

Wait for the trap to catch something.,

Reset the trap.",How to Catch Rabbits in Don’t Starve," Right off the bat, you already have the crafting recipe for the trap item you’ll be needing to catch those skittish little buggers. The crafting hotbar can be found on the left-hand side of the screen (PC) or by pressing the L2 button (console), then select the button with the looped rope icon to open the Trap menu.;
, You can see at the very top of the list what appears to be a blacked-out item. That’s the trap item you need to make.

, To make the trap, first you need to gather at least 2 Twigs and 6 Cut Grass. Gathering them is as simple as going up to a sapling (the objects that look like a dried-out bush) or some tall grass, and left-clicking or pressing the Spacebar (PC) or pressing the X button (console) on them.

, Once you’ve gathered enough Grass and Twigs, you will hear a bell-like sound signifying that you’ve gathered enough materials to craft something. When that happens, open the Trap menu again. The blacked-out item at the top will now be in full color. It looks like a standard basket trap. Click on that item, and then you’ll have a nice new trap!

, While you certainly can catch rabbits without bait, it takes a while longer, and it’s a little bit chancier. You can attract rabbits by using Berries and Carrots as bait, both of which are normally easily found in most areas. Bushes speckled with bright red dots have berries on them while Carrots grow on the ground. Much like with your Twigs and Cut Grass, simply walk up to them and left-click, press spacebar (PC) or the X button (console) to gather your item.

, Rabbit holes are just small holes in the ground where rabbits spawn from. If you’re not sure if the hole you found is a rabbit hole, just hover your mouse over it, and you’ll see the name of the object. On the console, walking up to it would immediately show the name of the object once you’re near enough.

, Select your trap by either clicking it (PC) or scrolling to it with your right analog stick (console). Set it down on an area near the rabbit hole by left-clicking or pressing the down button. You’ll see that it really is one of those basic basket traps where the basket is propped up by a twig.

, Select your bait, and on the PC, hover it over the trap until you see the cursor say “Bait,” then click on it to set it in the trap. On the console editions, walking up to it and pressing the X button when prompted would set your bait. Now all you have to do is wait!


You can set as many traps as you want in different areas for different rabbit holes, so be sure to check them often!

, It normally takes a short while to catch any rabbits since they approach the traps at a slow pace, so feel free to explore and gather other materials for survival while you wait. Rabbits tend to roam around the area unless enticed by bait, and tend to run away when you’re nearby, so catching rabbits would take anywhere from a minute to only a few seconds. It’s better to simply leave the trap alone after setting it.

, Go back to your traps to check on them. Traps that have caught something, hopefully the rabbits, have the woven basket part flat on the ground and shaking about. Checking is as simple as going up to the trap and clicking on it (PC) or pressing X (console), which automatically adds both the rabbit and the trap to your inventory. If you did everything right, then congratulations! You have caught yourself a rabbit!


Occasionally, when your inventory is full, you’ll drop the trap and be prompted to drop the rabbit as well. If you drop the rabbit, they’ll lie on the ground for a few seconds and not move, so you can simply kill them at that stage.
You can only catch one rabbit per trap, so setting up multiple traps is advised.

, Because the traps are reusable until they break, you can set up the trap again to catch more rabbits. You can reuse your traps for a total of 8 times before they disintegrate into nothing.

Try to keep both doors open as much as possible.",How to Beat Night 1 of Five Nights at Freddy's," You will start out in your office, and the phone will ring. Listen to the Phone Guy (the former night guard) for information on how to play.;
, On Night 1, the animatronics won't be very active, but you need to see if they form a pattern anyway. Foxy will very rarely move on Night 1 if you don't check the cameras at all, and Freddy will definitely not move. Your biggest threat is Bonnie.

, You'll want to keep an eye out for Bonnie and Chica, who begin to move at around 2-3am. Bonnie appears travels along left side of the map. Chica tends to stay to the right.

, Don't worry if they start to get close. If one appears outside a hallway, stay wary, but don't shut the door just yet.

, You will see if they are outside your office. If they are, shut the door and monitor the other side. Check every now and then to see if they leave. If they do, open the door.

, The doors drain your battery. Never shut both doors unless it's an emergency (i.e. animatronics outside both doors).

Decide if you’re settling in or not.,
Check out the Grasslands.,
Consider areas like Marshes and Forests if you want a bit of challenge.,
Consider the Savannah.,
Try to avoid Rockylands.,
Scout out resources of every biome.,
Make sure you’re not too close to Pig Villages.,
Try to camp close to Rabbit holes.,
Be wary of Spider Dens and Ponds.,
Find a wide area.,
Try to camp near roads.",How to Choose a Camp Location in Don't Starve," When choosing your camping ground, and before settling on a biome, you have to consider whether this is just a temporary place or an actual permanent settlement. Temporary settlements don’t require much, just a clearing wide enough that a basic campfire won’t accidentally light the surrounding area on fire. The more permanent your grounds are, the more work and resources you’ll have to put on it, so keep that in mind when you go scouting for your perfect campsite.


Temporary sites are best for an outpost or rest stop you could go to while exploring.
Fire pits, permanent fixtures that burn brighter without setting fire to nearby structures (unlike campfires), are a must for any of the more substantial settlements or areas that you would stay in for extended amounts of time.
Finding a biome with lots of resources and the least amount of danger is the key to your happy base camp and survival.
After deciding whether your campsite will be temporary or permanent, it’s time to choose a biome to camp in. There are several biomes in Don’t Starve; the next steps describe those biomes that are habitable.;
, The Grassland biome is always a good place to settle, with the abundance of resources (food, trees, flint, flowers, etc.) and widely-spaced objects that don’t require you to clear out too much of the area to make it habitable. You often spawn around Grasslands as well, and finding a spot near the road would make travelling much easier. This makes Grasslands one of the best biomes to settle in, due to the abundance of common resources.


Be prepared to deal with Frogs if you camp near the Ponds that spawn in this biome, since they tend to knock off things from your inventory and swarm around you.

, For newbies and people who want less-stressful gameplay, these two Biomes aren’t very good, despite their resources. Forests are too densely packed with trees and lack most other resources, making it hard to clear out and settle. While Marshes have unusual resources that you can’t get in other biomes, there are too many hazards and aggressive monsters like Tentacles, Merms, and Mosquitos that regularly spawn there to make a permanent settlement viable. If you want to settle in these two biomes, be very prepared for their challenges.

, Savannahs are another great biome to settle in. With the abundance of Rabbit holes, grass, and the Beefalo herds that spawn there, this biome is great to settle in for the easy food source and abundance of manure, which is great if you want to take up farming. Savannahs, though, lacks trees and boulders, and only rarely have saplings, which means you have to venture out to other areas to supplement your stock. When Beefalo go into heat, they become aggressive towards everything and attack everything passing by the area—you included.

, This biome—despite the abundance of stones, flints, and the occasional gold vein—is not viable for a permanent camp if you want to farm on your settlement. The biome’s stone ground means you can’t plant saplings, grass, berry bushes, and trees, making those resources inaccessible for your camp.


There’s also an abundance of Tallbirds in this biome, which are tall aggressive birdlike creatures that are extremely persistent and territorial, often chasing you for a very long time before giving up. They can kill a character in just 3 or so pecks, meaning that if you encounter one, you’ll have to waste valuable daylight escaping.

, Like previously mentioned, each biome provides you with its own resources and unique features that challenge you. Marshes have Merms and Tentacles, which are hard to kill but yield you a steady supply of food and some unique resources. Grasslands have Bees and Ponds, whose denizens can be aggressive but otherwise provide you with easy food. Savannahs have Beefalo, which are a great source of Meat, Beefalo Fur, and Manure, but turn dangerous when in heat. Some resources are available nearly everywhere, like Saplings, Spider Dens, Grass, Flint, and Berry Bushes, but vary in abundance in each Biome.


Most initial resources, such as Twigs, Berries, and Cut Grass, are easily renewable every 4 days. The exceptions are Flint, Carrots, Rocks, and Boulders, since they don’t renew themselves naturally in the surface. Late-game players will encounter ways to infinitely renew these other resources, but initially the regular player won’t.
Trees can be chopped down for Logs, and can be renewed by planting the Pine Cone dropped by the tree and waiting. Reign of Giants (RoG) introduces Birchnut trees, which drop Birchnuts instead of Pine Cones. You can either plant those or cook the nuts and eat them, but it’s better in the long run to plant them, unless you have a lot of extras or you’re desperately hungry.

, This is especially important if you’re playing RoG. Pig Villages normally spawn between Grasslands and Forests. This makes it quite convenient for the player, supplying you with meat, Manure, and even Gold, if they’re lucky enough to have a Pig King spawned there. However, in RoG, it’s inadvisable for the player to settle within the Village itself, due to the Pigs transforming into Werepigs during the full moon. You may also be able to find a Pig House by itself while exploring the world. This will only spawn 1 Pig at a time, but you can still use the single Pig to farm some Manure, or kill it for food.

, Rabbit holes are found in Grasslands and Savannahs and are a source of easy meat for your character through trapping. Most new players and freshly-started worlds tend to rely on this resource heavily until alternative food sources are found or unlocked.

, Spider Dens can be hazardous to the unprepared player, but killing the Spiders that spawn from them yields Monster Meat, Silk and Spider Glands, which are very useful resources. If you want to camp near Spider Dens, always be prepared. Spiders tend to come after you if you step on the webbing surrounding the Den. They also spawn naturally at Dusk and Night.


Ponds are more commonly found in Grasslands, and you can fish in those Ponds. However, they spawn hostile creatures, depending on the time of day and the biome, and can be a bit hazardous. Ponds in the Grasslands and Forests spawn Frogs in the daytime, and are safest to fish in during dusk. Ponds in the Marsh spawn Mosquitos at dusk and night, and are relatively safer in the daytime.

, One of the other key things you have to consider is the size of your camping grounds. The area should be wide enough to easily move around and create structures while being close enough that your campfire or fire pit can illuminate the core area without much fuss. A decently-sized campsite is about one screen big; when you stand in the middle of the campsite, you should be able to see all your structures in your campsite. This is so when you add enough logs in your fire pit, you can still craft and work with your structures.


For wider areas or those who want to expand, always remember to keep the most often-used structures and your chests near the fire pit itself so you don’t risk being hurt by the shadow creatures that attack in pitch blackness.

, Many times, you’ll be forced to flee from your camp due to monsters and Hound attacks. This makes it a necessity for you to make your camp near roads. Roads add a slight boost to your walking speed when walking along it, letting you outrun some of your pursuers long enough for you to regroup and recuperate. Most of the time, Roads also lead towards Pig Villages, Things, and other Biomes, making it less of a hassle for you to explore while still staying safe. With these four factors in mind, making your own camp is just a matter of time and resources! So go forth and explore!

Befriend Bunnymen and Rock Lobsters.,
Make a pen.,
Set up camp.,
Craft a Bush Hat.,
Ride out the wave.",How to Exterminate a Worm Wave in Don’t Starve," Here are two allies that would definitely save your life more than once during your stay underground. Bunnymen can be befriended with carrots, and Rock Lobsters can be befriended with rocks or flint. Most experienced players, however, agree that Rock Lobsters are best since they can hide and regenerate whenever they’re too damaged, but either creatures will follow you around when fed their favorite food, making them easier to lure into designated areas and whatnot. You don’t actually need to feed them for them to kill Depths Worms, though.


Don’t bring meat with you when trying to befriend the Bunnymen. They turn extremely hostile when you carry meat, unless you put it in Chester.
You can actually use any mineral material to befriend the Rock Lobsters, but it’s advisable that you hang on to your Gold and Gems for more important things. They also don’t accept marble.;
, Now, take your friends and lure them into a wide enclosed area made from walls, and close the opening. The walls should be placed about one space apart, which gives you a small gap you can pass through even when enclosed. Since Rock Lobsters and Bunnymen are larger than you are, they will not be able to pass through the gaps as easily, which means you can keep slipping in to feed them whenever possible to keep them friendly. You can even craft multiple pens near areas you frequent the most. Stone walls, of course, are the best to use, since it’s the second sturdiest wall type and uses up rocks, which are abundant in the Caves and Ruins. You can even reinforce them at least once, since you can probably get the required materials in a short time.


If you want to use Bunnymen, you’ll be better off making a larger pen or placing walls around a Bunnyman Village. The Bunnymen are less powerful than the Rock Lobsters, after all, but respawn from their assigned Rabbit Hutches. You don’t even really need to section the village or self-made rabbit hutches off since they attack the Worms on sight, though it might be better for you in the long run if you accidentally bring meat with you.
You may need to rotate the camera a single degree, whether left or right, to better see the gaps when you build the wall because the default angling of the camera sometimes makes it so that anything placed horizontally and vertically have no gaps in between, and trying to make a diagonal pen can be very trying, with frequent mistakes in placing.
It’s also preferable to set up the pen about 10 seconds or so away from your base camp, for easy access.

, Make the area easy to live in by placing the barest minimum of structures. The only real requirement is a Fire Pit (and Endothermic Fire Pit in Reign of Giants), but you can add a chest or a backpack of necessities (food, weapons, armor) nearby as well. You don’t need much, just enough to ensure you can stay there for a short time until it’s safer.

, If you don’t fancy joining your friends in the melee later, you can invest in a Bush Hat. If you don’t know how to get one, you can learn to make it from the Alchemy Engine’s Dress tab for 1 Rope, 1 Berry Bush, and 1 Straw Hat. When you equip it, you can then right-click on it any time to hide from anything aggressive, as long as you’re not in their direct line of sight or are being pursued by an enemy. Best of all, it never breaks! The only drawbacks are that it can’t be used as an armor and you can’t use it with a Miner’s Hat.


You can also grind for a Snurtle Shell Armor, which functions the same, but is on the armor slot instead and is quite rare. This, paired with a Miner’s hat, would negate the need to rekindle the Fire Pit often, since your surroundings are illuminated. However, if used as an armor itself, it loses durability and will eventually break.

, Now, when you hear the sinister rumbling that signals the assault, run immediately to the Bunnymen or Rock Lobster pen, light up the Fire Pit, and wait. If you have your Bush Hat or Snurtle Shell Armor, go and hide! If not, position yourself next to the walls of your pen, equip your best armor and weapon, and brace yourself. The Rock Lobsters would make short work off the Depths Worms, and they would also leave the loot alone.


The best tactic if you choose to fight the Worms is by kiting around the pen or even going into the pen and dealing the occasional hit to the Worms while the Lobsters do the rest. Just be careful not to hit the denizens of your pen.
If you’re using Bunnymen, take care to pick up the Monster Meat and Glow Berries quickly. Meat, as you know, enrages them to no end, and Glow Berries are a very tempting treat for the Bunnymen, who tend to gobble it up quickly.

Make your tools.You’ll be needing at least a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials for this venture.,
Gather some materials for the campfire.,
Make a campfire (or fire pit).,
Start cooking!",How to Cook Frog Legs in Don’t Starve1," They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.;
, Aside from making sure you have enough Twigs, you also need to gather some Cut Grass, gathered from long tufts of grass found scattered everywhere in the world. Make sure you chop down some trees for your logs too.


Gathering some Rocks would also be useful if you want to make fire pits.

, When you have at least 2 Logs and 3 Cut Grass, you can make fire! Click the bonfire icon to your left, and on the very top of the list is a campfire. Campfires are essential because they’re the most reliable and easiest way to generate light during nighttime, as well as make a good way to cook your food, which can either prolong its freshness or increase the benefits to your health, hunger, and sanity when you eat it. You can make multiple campfires as long as you have enough resources.


Later on, if you’ve got at least 12 Rocks and 2 Logs, you can make a fire pit, which is a permanent version of a campfire and does not spread flames when you add too much fuel.

, Now simply select the Frog Legs, then go to your campfire, and you'll be prompted to cook them. Now, when you left-click or press X, you’ll immediately start cooking!

Don’t overexploit your resources.",How to Create a Renewable Farm in Don't Starve," Some of the early game resources, especially Seeds, Grass, Berries, Mushrooms, and Rabbits, are easily renewable without difficulty. Bigger, more substantial and important resources (like Meat, Pig Skins, Silk, and Beefalo fur) can be a bit more difficult to farm, but are definitely worth it. Some are only available in certain places, like Monster Meat, Gems Cave Bananas, Tentacle Spikes, Fish, and Frog Legs. So before everything else, consider what you want to farm or what you consider to be most important to farm, since this will determine where your base camp will be.

At most, a few “food” structures, some way to get manure, and some other surface resources (like Saplings and Grass Tufts) would be enough to ensure your continued, self-sustaining survival for several weeks at a time, even in Winter. More advanced builds include sustainable farming in rarer or more uncommon in hazardous places, such as Marshes, Caves and Ruins, and it’s only advisable if the player prepares themselves to farm there with a clear safety net in close reach, like a Touch Stone or a Meat Effigy.;
, Before getting hyped up to make a sprawling, complicated farm, consider first if your materials are easily renewable at this point.

For example, Bees and Honey are infinitely renewable as long as there’s a Hive or a Bee Box, but Honeycomb, which you get from destroying Bee Hives, are not.
You can dig up Saplings, Berry Bushes, and Grass Tufts and replant them, but while their resources are renewable every 4 days, the objects themselves are not.
Gold is infinitely renewable if you go down the Caverns and wait for an Earthquake, or find a Pig King to give Meat to, but most Gravedigger items, like Gnomes, Gears, and Hardened Rubber Bungs are not renewable.
The only renewable items you get from digging up Graves are Gems, Life Giving Amulets, and Nightmare Fuel, since they can be found and made elsewhere. Checking the Wiki for the complete list is advisable for the new or unsure players, but generally speaking, if it’s a treasure, or if you can’t plant it or raise it, you usually can’t renew it.
Thulecite and Gems (Green, Yellow, or Orange) are very rare resources in the Ruins and aren’t reliably renewed. However, in Reign of Giants, they have a chance to be found in Tumbleweeds, making them renewable. Same with the most Gravedigger items and Fireflies.

, The best area to camp in is a Grasslands with all the other biomes within a few seconds to a minute away from you. This will give you a wide area to place your base in, and the Grasslands also provide you with some easy resources you can relocate to your camp with a Shovel. If not, look for places with a concentration of your prefered resources. For example, if you want to farm Fish and Frog Legs, scout out a Grassland area full of Ponds. If you want to farm Beefalo for their fur, Meat, and Manure, check out a Savannah full of them.

If you make a camp between multiple Biomes, make sure you scout out the others first. It would do you no good if you camp beside a Savannah with no Beefalo if you plan on farming them.
If you can find a Worm Hole leading to some further places with plenty of resources, by all means make camps near them. Just remember that traveling through them costs some Sanity in return.

, Of course, tools don’t just mean an Axe, Pickaxe, and Shovel. You’ll also need a Shovel to relocate Grass Tufts, Berry Bushes, and Saplings, or to dig out tree stumps to make room for your stuff. Hammers are also useful to break down natural structures you can find in the world to gather more resources. However, those aren’t the only tools you can use for survival.

You’ll be needing plenty of Traps to farm Rabbits, Frogs, and Spiders, for example. Bird Traps are exclusively for farming Birds for their Feathers and Morsels, or to raise as your main source of Eggs and Crop Seeds. And, of course, you’ll need Tooth Traps, weaponry, and armor to farm some of the bigger animals and ward off the periodic Hound attacks.
You’ll also be needing more advanced crafting stations for some of the more unusual and useful objects. An Alchemy Engine is the minimum requirement for your major crafting needs, especially in the next section.

, Now, it’s time to get into the structures you can build! There’s quite a lot of things you can make under the Food tabs and Structures tabs, and most of them are vital for survival. Some of them can be a bit expensive, some of them cheap, but all of them are useful as long as you know how to use them.

Farm Plots are the easiest to make, requiring 6 Cut Grass, 4 Logs, and 4 Manure for the Basic model, and 10 Cut Grass, 4 Rocks, and 6 Manure for the Advanced model.
If you can’t find a lot of naturally-spawning Pigs nearby, you can make your own Pig House. It costs 4 Boards, 3 Cut Stone, and 4 Pig Skin. (Pig Skin usually requires you to kill some Pigs, but if you can find a Touch Stone anywhere or some Merm houses in a Marsh, you can just hammer the Pig Heads to gather the Skins.)
Making a Bird Cage is a bit expensive, at 2 Papyrus, 6 Gold, and 2 Seeds, but the yield from trapping a bird in it is worth it.
Bee Boxes may be tricky; aside from 2 Boards, you have to destroy a Bee Hive to get the necessary Honeycomb and capture 4 Bees, but the yield is low-risk and high-return.
There’s a lot more structures you can make that can help your survival, but for your farming needs, these are the most important, since they are highly renewable and definitely profitable even early on in the game!

, There are several structures that can help you prevent damage to your farm.

Craft a Lightning Rod and place it near important structures. This will prevent any freak lightning strikes from burning your farm to sad, expensive ashes.
Placing Stone Walls and Tooth Traps around most of your structures is heavily advised as well, in case of Hound attacks. The exceptions are Pig Houses, since they can fight back and tend to trigger the Tooth Traps.

, There’s many ways to continuously farm your resources, especially if you’re clever enough. The main types will be outlined here, with some methods in farming certain resources. The guide won’t delve into all of the resources that you can farm, but will show some resources and the methods to farm them, mainly the Surface resources., This method mainly involves the Farm Plots you made, and the Saplings, Berry Bushes and Grass Tufts you dug up. This method is completely static, with the lowest level of interference from the player. When you plant the seeds into the Farm Plots, you can either wait to get your food, which will take about a day or so, or if you’re the impatient type, you can just fertilize it continuously until a fresh crop pops up. To fertilize them, you need Manure or Rot. To get Rot, just leave out some food; to get Manure, hand out some non-meat food to Pigs so they’ll poop themselves, or follow some Beefalo around until they poop themselves.

Reeds, a Marsh-exclusive resource, can’t be dug up and relocated like Grass Tufts, since it destroys the tuft that grows the Reeds. You can’t dig up Rabbit Holes or Mushrooms up either for the same reasons. Which means you manually have to gather them yourself.
When you place Grass Tufts and Berry Bushes on the ground, you’ll also need to fertilize them before they can start growing their resources. Just 1 unit of any fertilizer will do. Saplings don’t need to be fertilized, and they all renew their respective resources every 4 days.
For maximum efficiency, group your crops together in different areas, and place Lightning Rods in the middle of each crop farm. This is because these kinds of farm are highly flammable, and one stray lightning bolt is enough to burn everything down.

, One of the first objects you can craft is the humble Trap, which has a very cheap cost, easily renewable, and has quite a lot of uses. Spiders, Rabbits, and Frogs are susceptible to getting caught under Traps, and picking up rustling Traps would yield you goodies to eat, and in the Spiders’ case, make Silk and Spider Glands renewable with the least amount of effort. For the Rabbits, placing a Trap directly above the Rabbit Hole is the best way to catch them. For Spiders and Frogs, place the Traps around the Spider Den or the Pond. You’ll need to check on the Traps for the Frogs and the Rabbits at around Dusk, while checking for the Spiders are best left for morning. This is because Frogs and Rabbits spawn during daytime, while Spiders roam around at Night.

Remember not to step on the “webbing” surrounding Spider Dens unless you want to purposely attract Spiders towards you and the trap.
Bird Traps are best left alone with a single Seed in them, but must be checked every few minutes, since they also spawn during dusk. Crows are more common in the Rockylands all year round, while Grasslands find itself with more Redbirds, which are found in the Summer, and Snowbirds, which are found in Winter.
You’ll be better off saving one bird to keep in the Bird Cage. This is so you can have a renewable source of Eggs and Crop Seeds. Eggs are useful for recipes, feeding Pigs, or trading with the Pig King, while Crop Seeds are useful if you wish to farm specific Fruits or Vegetables, like Dragon Fruits or Pumpkins. To get eggs, you can feed the bird most kinds of meat, excluding Monster Meat (cooked or raw). To get Crop Seeds, feed it a specific crop you want, excluding Berries, Mandrakes, Lichen, Cave Bananas, or Mushrooms, and it will drop 1 or 2 seeds of that crop.
You can feed it any of the above foods in any level of spoilage to constantly recycle and renew your food sources. You can also feed the bird any Seeds in any state of freshness to get fresher Seeds.

, Some resources, like Trees, Pigs, Spiders, and Beefalo, tend to multiply and spread when you get the conditions right, or when you use their farmed resources to create more of them. This is basically called the “Breeding” method, and while all of them aren’t naturally self-replicating, the resources are highly and easily renewable with only the occasional interference on your part.

Trees are the easiest to “breed” and farm out of all these resources. All you need is a Pinecone, a Shovel, and an Axe. Whenever you fell a tree with your Axe, the tree will drop a Pinecone (two, if you chop a full grown one). You can then plant the Pinecone(s) in a nearby, cleared area, then wait about a full game day for it to grow into a small tree. Wait about another day for it to spawn a medium tree, or a few more days for it to become a full grown tree.
Pig Houses spawn a single pig at a time, and if that one is killed, another one takes his place four days after he’s killed. This means you can keep killing that Pig for Meat and Pig Skin, ensuring that you can build another Pig House and increase your Pigs. With this method, you can probably make your own Pig Village in a few weeks’ time. In RoG, you need to keep your Pigs away from your base camp. This is because during the full moon, the Pigs may turn into Werepigs, which can wreak havoc on you and your resources, so keeping them near but away from your camp or other farms is a must.
Beefalo have “mating seasons” where they grow aggressive for a few days and spawn a few Baby Beefalo at the end, making their Meat, Beefalo Wool, and Manure infinitely renewable, as long as at least 2 Beefalo remain before every mating season. You can lure them into a “pen” made out of Walls and Savannah Turf by using a Beefalo Horn, which you can get from killing Beefalo. Don’t kill the Beefalo while they’re near any others, since they attack as a herd. Set up some Tooth Traps in the pen to automatically cull the herd occasionally.
If you want a more controlled way to farm Spiders, fully grown Spider Dens can spawn a Spider Queen whenever you walk into the webbing, and she spawns a smaller Spider Den and several Spiders in turn while trying her best to maim you. If you slay her, you get a set of Spider Eggs, which you can place down to spawn a single Den, or you can leave her alone for a few minutes, and she’ll settle back down as a small Spider Den in an area away from any other Dens. The second method lets you “breed” more Dens with minimum risk, but the first method lets you place your Den wherever you want, as well as acquire a rare item, the Spider Hat, which lets you interact with Spiders with minimum risk.
If you have a Berry farm and want to farm Gobblers as well, place some Tooth Traps inside the Berry farm so that when one spawns, it is messily murdered and you are free to take its delicious, meaty corpse for your dinner. They’re available in the original edition and RoG and have a low spawn rate, since they spawn whenever you pick Berries. Be careful though, since even one spawning will definitely ruin your Berry farm, as it just keep eating every Berry it sees in a single screen before wandering off. It will also attack any crop food you leave on the ground, meaning you can lure it with a carrot or a single berry towards the tooth traps if you don’t mind some of your Berries being eaten.
Bee Boxes also count as a “breeding” method, since it respawns a Bee every 2 minutes whenever one from the box is killed, for a maximum of 4 Bees per Box. The box itself starts to get visibly covered in honey whenever it’s almost full, and you can harvest it for a maximum of 6 Honey. To minimize damage from Bees, craft a Beekeeper’s Hat. This will reduce the damage taken by a whopping 80%.

, Some resources are utterly hostile or uncontrollable, but respawn dependably. Nearly every hostile enemy can be farmed reliably, but it’s normally really risky. Luring them into Tooth Traps or nearby Pigs, Beefalo, or Tentacles will help tremendously, as long as you're quick when gathering your spoils. But here are some general guides on how to beat them if you’re low on resources or don’t have those available around you.

If you found a Plugged Sinkhole, you can go down or wait for dusk for Batsilisks to appear. In the Caverns, they spawn everywhere, but on the surface, they will spawn from the Sinkhole every dusk and occasionally drop Guano, which is the best fertilizer in the game. Killing them will yield you Batsilisk Wings and some Monster Meat as well, and can be killed with most weapons and Tooth Traps with one or two hits.
The Tallbirds that live in the Rockylands are viciously tough and can usually kill you in 2 hits. But they’re easy to beat of you hit them once, run away, then hit them again. They respawn about a day and a half, as long as their nests in the Rockylands remain untouched and undamaged.
Occasionally, you can find Suspicious Piles of Dirt on the ground, and unearthing it will yield a footprint. Following it will lead you to another pile to unearth and reveal another print, and you need to repeat this until you find your quarry: the Koalefant. You can chase it into a pen if you desire a pet, since it occasionally drops Manure, but it’s much better if you kill it, since it would drop a considerable amount of Meat and a Koalefant Trunk. While it’s inclined to fight back if you attack it, it’s less risky to hunt it down than some of the other creatures.

In RoG, the risk increases exponentially with the introduction of the Varg. It has a low chance to spawn instead of Koalefants if you track down the footprints and calls for Hound reinforcements the longer you take to kill him. He yields about 6 Monster Meat and 1-3 Hound Teeth upon death, not counting the possible spoils when killing his cohorts.


Hounds spawn every few days to maim the player and make their life miserable, and with their speed, ability to spawn wherever you are when the time comes, and the fact that they love to hunt in groups, it can be difficult to kill them without help. What you can do is make a structure called a “panic room,” which is a three-wall thick room or corridor with Bee Mines, and eventually, Tooth Traps lined in and around it to thin the pack and leave you the weakened stragglers, and then run there when you start hearing barking and growling. You can probably fight them off the first few “months” of the game, but the longer you play, the more of them hunt you down whenever they arrive.

, Ponds, Tentacles, Pig Kings, even the random animals you find in the world can also be used to farm resources. They all have different gimmicks, but with them around, you can renew quite a lot of your resources just by knowing how to deal with them.

If you’re lucky enough, you may be able to find a Pig King when exploring the world. He’ll trade you Gold Nuggets for Gravedigger Items and Meat (excluding monster meat and its byproducts) items, so if you have a reliable way to farm meat, you can use him to constantly renew your stock of Gold. It’s better if you use Morsels and Eggs rather than Meat, since they’re all worth the same amount of Gold to the Pig King, but Meat is more useful to the player. If you can easily access the Ruins and a Ruins Pond, you can just fish out several Eel, cook them, and bring them to the Pig King. For the player, Eel are functionally identical to the regular Fish they can get from normal Ponds, but it’s worth 4 Gold to the Pig King.
If you find a nearby Marsh, you can also probably spot some Rundown Shacks, Tentacles, and Merms. What you can do is pit them against each other by luring the Merm towards a spot that’s bubbling, then watch as the Merm and the Tentacle duel it out until one dies! Then when one dies, pick the item up quickly and repeat the process! This will net you quite a lot of Fish, Frog Legs, and even Tentacle Spots and Tentacle Spikes when the Tentacle finally dies! This isn’t infinitely renewable though, but it’s a great way to get a lot of resources quickly!
If you venture into the Caverns, you’ll periodically experience Earthquakes shaking the place up. This will drop quite a lot of mineral items (rocks, gems, flint, etc.) on the ground, and Rabbits and Moleworms in RoG. Just make sure to dodge the falling items, since they can damage you. This also ensures a lot of materials to be infinitely, if somewhat unreliably, renewable. You can trigger earthquakes by igniting Gunpowder, Slurtle Slime, Slurtle Mounds, Slurtle, and Snurtle using a Telelocator Staff or the RoG-only item Old Bell, or by beating a Big Tentacle.
In the Caverns, you’ll sometimes see a ridiculously huge Tentacle reaching towards the Surface, officially called a Big Tentacle. Players affectionately refer to it as the Tentapillar, and beating one of them makes them retreat into their holes instead of dying, making Tentacle Spikes, Light Bulbs, and Tentacle Spots renewable. The Tentapillar spawns smaller Tentacles, called Baby Tentacles, to protect it, but those are ridiculously weak and take 1 hit from most weapons before dying.
This is an RoG-only method, but is useful for the player too unprepared to dive in the caves for minerals. Simply dig up any Moleworm Holes, which are visually larger and “messier” than Rabbit Holes, and it will yield you some amount of rocks, flint, nitre, and occasionally gold. This is infinitely renewable, since Moleworms tend to just spawn new holes whenever they can’t find a nearby one.

You can also catch Moleworms by laying down a Rock or a Flint, then whacking them on the head with a Hammer when they emerge. Then you can pick up the materials, dig up the hole they made, set them free, and lure them again!


Another RoG-only method that makes renewing some unusual items easily is by constantly feeding or giving “gifts” to nearby Catcoons. Catcoons will eat “small” meat items like morsels, fish and eggs, and you can give them easily acquired items like cut grass, twigs and pinecones to befriend them. In return, after a while, they’ll barf up other items, like Crop Seeds, Petals, and even Tumbleweeds. Catcoons also tend to attack Butterflies and Birds, so setting down a lot of Flowers and some Seeds in an enclosed area with a Hollow Stump in it would ensure a quick and easy way to farm Butter, Butterfly Wings, Feathers, and Morsels—if you’re quick enough to gather them before the Catcoon takes them for itself.

, Scheduling when your harvests take place is useful if you’re fond of exploring, or you can set up several farms in several places. Most farmable resources are renewed every few days, so what you can do is harvest one or two farms every day, then all you need to do is wait for your resources to renew itself. This will keep you from frantically rushing everywhere and wasting time, with huge periods of time without anything to do. This will also free up some time for exploration if you time your harvests just right., While this is more of an organizational thing, this will help greatly in case of Hound attacks, “boss” monsters and Giants trying to wreck your place, and the occasional unlucky fire. It can also help keep mobs that heavily dislike each other from killing each other off too fast. At the minimum, structures and static farms should be about 2 spaces away from each other, and farms using living things should be about half a screen or more away., Normally, this isn’t a problem, but sometimes the frequent usage of a resource can outstrip the production of the item. Trees need to be replanted, Ponds have delay times the more you fish, and Beefalo don’t breed as often as some players think they should. Don’t be overeager when harvesting from your farm, especially when winter approaches, since a lot of resources, especially crops, grass, and twigs, stop production entirely when the cold hits. Give your farms time to recover their resources instead of killing and looting everything and having nothing left when you really need it."

Make a science machine.,
Make a drying rack.To create a drying rack, you’ll need 3 Ropes, 2 Charcoals, and 3 Twigs.,
Dry the Frog Legs.",How to Cook Frog Legs in Don’t Starve2," You will need this to make your drying rack, so if you don’t have one yet, it’s high time to do so. It requires 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and is made in the Science tab (atom icon), which is located in your crafting hotbar (right-hand section of your screen on PC and L2 on the PS4).


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading meats with the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world); mining yellow-streaked boulders, which are dominantly available in Rockylands; or finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Once you make your science machine, it will immediately prompt you to place it down (press X or left-click). Choose the area to place the machine wisely since after placing it, you won’t be able to pick it up again.

, It can be made through the Food tab, represented by a planted carrot icon, through your science machine.


You can get Charcoal by burning down a tree with a torch, but you have to be careful since fire spreads, and you might accidentally burn down your entire campsite with a single careless flame.
You can get Rope by heading to the Refine tab, represented by a diamond, and making it. Rope costs 3 Cut Grass.

, Much like with the campfire, simply select the Frog Legs and place them on the rack when prompted. You can only dry your meat when raw, and it takes a full day to dry out Frog Legs to produce small Jerky.


Do note that you can’t dry multiple meats in the same rack, so if you want to dry them all out, better make some more racks!

Cook!",How to Cook Frog Legs in Don’t Starve3," If you already have a science machine, you can make a crock pot there through the Food tab for 3 Cut Stone, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs.


You can create Cut Stone through the Refine tab in the science machine. It costs 3 Rocks to make.

, When you interact (click or press X) with your crock pot, a small menu will pop up with 4 slots. You need to fill out those slots with one unit of your food items, then wait for around 40 seconds, depending on the recipe. Frog Legs count as a meat product, and meat dishes are normally some of the most filling.


You can add Twigs, Honey Comb, and in Reign of Giants only, Ice as ingredients despite being generally inedible. Some recipes call for those too, in fact.
Despite being edible, you can’t add Rot, Seeds, Petals, Rotten Egg, Hatching Tallbird Egg, Cooked Mandrake, Koalefant Trunk, Deerclops Eyeball, Guardian's Horn, Batilisk Wing, Leafy Meat, Foliage, Light Bulbs, or Glow Berries as ingredients.

, There are many crock pot recipes for you to try out in Don’t Starve. As long as you have the resources, feel free to experiment in the foodstuffs you put in.


Don’t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian in one recipe, since it would yield a Monster Lasagna, which actually damages instead of heals and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity. Only do so if you plan on adding a Twig in your recipe.
A recipe exclusive for Frog Legs is the Froggle Bunwich, which needs 1 Frog Leg and 1 Vegetable, plus two filler ingredients (excluding Honey, Mandrake, and Eggs). It takes 40 seconds to cook and makes for a relatively cheap, efficient, filling meal with a decent bonus to health and hunger.

If you’re using Twigs for your filler, use two instead of one, since a single Twig will turn your Bunwich recipe into a Kebab.

Be very, VERY careful.",How to Camp Underground in Don't Starve," The underground is a pretty harsh place to live in, more so than above, and if you’re not prepared, you’ll die within the first day. Some renewable resources from above are not available underground, and if you plan on living there indefinitely, you’ll have to stock up quite a lot of those resources.


Some of the things you should consider bringing are: Grass Tufts, Saplings, Berry Bushes, Honeycombs, Bees, Pine Cones, Pigskin, Seeds, Fleshy Bulbs, and a Bird. These items are the most essential, since they’d give you the ability to maintain a steady supply of Grass, Twigs, Berries (with occasional Gobblers), Honey and Bees, Logs and Living Logs, and Pigskins once you set up camp and start building structures. The remaining resources you’d need when building your camp underground, such as Gold and Rocks, are already renewable and highly abundant there due to the Earthquakes that periodically shake down these materials.
Also, because followers can be brought down, you can lure up to 5 Beefalo using a Beefalo horn at a time into the opening and establish a Beefalo herd there. This would also make Beefalo Wool, Meat, and Beefalo Horns a renewable resource underground.;
, Because Gold, Flint, Twigs, Cut Grass, and Rocks are all renewable in caves, you can afford to make your tools, armors, and certain weapons indefinitely. As for ruins, you only need Grass Tufts and Saplings in order to make all tools renewable.


Nearly all the weapons, save for the Thulecite Club, are renewable in the caves, and in the ruins, all the weapons save for the Thulecite Club, Tentacle Spike, Bat Bat, and Ham Bat are renewable.
All armor except the Thulecite Suit and Thulecite Crown are renewable in caves. In the ruins, no armor is naturally renewable unless you bring down some Grass Tufts and Pine Cones, which would make Grass Suits, Log Suits, Marble Suits, and Beekeeper Hats renewable.

, Now all that’s left to do is to look for your way underground. Plugged sinkholes are basically craggy piles of rock scattered throughout the world. Normally, there are two of these found on the surface that lead to the first layer of the underground, the caverns, and another two found in the caverns (this time orange) leading into the ruins. To access it, simply start mining away with your pickaxe to reveal a hole and a rope, which you can then climb into.

If you find one on the surface early on and mined the rock, do not make your camp there or linger until dusk when unprepared. Batilisks spawn from the hole during dusk, and while they’re good to farm, they come in packs and could prove troublesome.

, Unless you're playing as Maxwell, your Sanity will constantly need replenishing due to the pervasive darkness of the underground, so it would be best to invest in many sanity-saving techniques and tactics. The first is getting sleep. Much like on the surface, sleeping can provide an instant, considerable sanity boost, but at the cost of a substantial amount of hunger. If you plan on using this as your main method of sanity recovery, make sure you have a good stockpile of food on hand.


Just a warning, though: a Miner Hat or a Lantern will still lose fuel, and all fires (including Night Lights) will be immediately extinguished whenever you go to sleep. If you sleep in an area where there are no natural light around, and your main light source doesn’t have enough fuel to last at least until the next day, the player will wake up in total darkness. This in turn would invalidate any sanity gain, as well as cause the Night Monster to attack unless you get to a light immediately.
In the caverns, the best way is to simply camp out in one of the light shafts, near some Light Flowers, or beside a Mushtree. In ruins, you can sleep near Light Flowers or an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

, Clothes are another reliable way to restore sanity continuously, but unlike on the surface, some of the materials that make up the clothes that restore sanity are non-renewable in caves and ruins. For rarer clothing items, it would be pretty hard to keep them intact, because you’d need a Sewing Kit, which requires Hound’s Teeth from Hounds,. Hounds only spawn on the surface. However, you can still use certain clothes to raise your sanity without having to run back to the surface: Top Hat is a renewable item of clothing since it’s made from Silk, and spiders are abundant in the underground. The Thulecite Suit, which you can craft in the ruins and bring anywhere afterwards, doesn’t degrade when worn, unless you use it as armor.


If you brought some Butterflies underground, you can make a flower farm by placing the butterflies on the ground, which spawns a flower, then recapturing it to plant another flower. If you can get a few butterflies for your venture, you can make Garlands renewable this way.

, Cooking in your Crock Pot is always a good idea, since most dishes heal your sanity by 5 points, but to maximize your sanity gains, you’d have to consider using some of your more “valuable” or “filling” foods like Meat, Pumpkin, and Honey to get the most sanity out of your ingredients.


One of the best recipes, which increases all three gauges considerably, is the Meaty Stew. It costs about 3 Meats’ worth of meat products. You can simply use 1 Meat, or 1 Monster Meat, and 3 Morsels to make it.
If you have a Drying Rack available, you can simply dry out your assorted meats for Jerky and Small Jerky, which restore 15 sanity and 10 sanity each, respectively.

, While wandering in the caves, you might encounter a shaft of light illuminating a section of the cave. If you do, chances are that Evergreens, Grass Tufts, Saplings, and Berry Bushes will also be found nearby. Because of this, the light shafts would be the best place to camp in, since not only do they have ready resources, but also if you choose to sleep the “night” out, you won’t awaken to total darkness when your fire runs out.


Rarely, light shafts could also contain a version of the Cave Camp Set Piece, which includes a Frog Pond. It’s preferable to scavenge it of all supplies, since the frogs will definitely be a nuisance to you if you stay there.
In ruins, there are no shafts of natural light, and there are Nightmare Lights, which drain your sanity quite quickly, scattered around the areas, and Nightmare Fissures spread across the floor. Nightmare Fissures will spawn Shadow Creatures during the Nightmare Phase, a rather difficult and hazardous obstacle exclusive to the ruins. The camp should be placed as far away from any Nightmare Lights and Fissures as possible. A good camp location is by the edge of a Light Flower field. Walls (upgraded at least once) of any kind could be used to keep Shadow creatures from randomly wandering inside the camp during Nightmare Phases.

, Probably the highest priority in caves and ruins is to always have access to a source of light. Without a source of light, you’d be eaten alive by the Night Monster before you can even do anything.


For static light sources for your camp, a Fire Pit is still your best bet. If you’ve brought down some Beefalo with you, you can shave them for Beefalo Wool, which would give you a nigh-endless supply of fuel for your fire. If not, Logs from chopping trees would remain your most reliable source of fuel.
If you plan on camping in the ruins, which is the lowest layer of the game and found by breaking a pile of orange rock and descending into the resulting hole, the Night Light is a very efficient static light source due to the abundance of Nightmare Fuel you can acquire there. The ruins are much more hazardous, though, and is reserved only for the veteran players.
You can also camp next to some Light Flowers in a pinch, since they stay lit until picked.

, For a mobile source of light, the best ones are the Miner Hat and the Lantern. Both can easily be refueled with Slurtle Slime, Fireflies, or Light Bulbs, and both could be used while freeing up your hands so you can attack any opponents freely.


The Miner Hat keeps you from wearing head armor, but it keeps your hands free. The Lantern allows you to wear helmets, but need to be dropped on the ground before equipping a weapon to keep the light shining. This would, in turn, temporarily make your lantern a static light source until you pick it up and equip it again. It could also be stolen by Splumonkeys (underground-dwelling monkeys that steal items and sling manure as an attack) when it’s on the ground, which would take away what was probably your only light source, so be careful.
Fireflies are not renewable, so it’s not a very good idea to use them for fuel unless there really is no other alternative at hand. Light Bulbs and Slurtle Slime are both renewable—Light Bulbs from killing Tentapillars (absurdly large tentacles that spawn smaller ones when hit) and Slurtle Slime from feeding Slurtles (weird snail-turtle hybrids occasionally found roaming around the area) rocks or by killing them. A unit of Slurtle Slime grants 45 seconds of light and can be stored without spoiling. The Light Bulb grants 90 seconds of light, but spoils in 6 days.

, Camping underground is considered a challenge even for veterans, and all this is due to the constant darkness, the continuous decrease of sanity, and the abundance of hostile mobs found there. As much as possible, you should keep it safe and try not to agitate any of the hostile mobs unless completely necessary or if you’re very prepared.

This is a fact that will come back to bite you in a more literal sense if you try to outrun them or lose them in a forest. The only way you can outrun them is to own a late-game item called Walking Cane or by running on a Road. Building your panic room on a Road, preferably on the end of the Road, would let you access it quickly as well as let you outrun the Hounds enough for you to gather your wits. Roads are scattered everywhere in the game, and its counterpart, Paths, can be more common and found winding around an entire area.;
, The panic room must also be a fair distance away from your camp; close enough that you can go back and forth between them easily, but far enough that the Hounds don’t make a right mess of your main camp, or if you are unlucky enough to encounter them early enough, keep the more powerful enemies like the Deerclops from completely destroying your camp. Preferably, the panic room should be a few seconds’ walk from your camp, anywhere from 10 seconds to 20 seconds of straight walking.

, Keeping the area clear enough is also important, because the panic room can and will take up quite a bit of space and would keep the destruction of your resources at a minimum. Clearing out an entire screen of space (the entire space your screen can show at any given time) is recommended, depending of the size of your projected panic room, and also ensures you have a good view of approaching enemies. You’ll be needing an axe to chop down trees, pickaxes to destroy boulders, and a shovel to clear out tree stumps, grass tufts, berry bushes, and dried saplings.

, Normally, the warning for the Hounds’ arrival comes a good 30 seconds before they do, so ideally, having a panic room in a cleared area about 20 seconds away would give you ample time to run there, equip your necessities, and get somewhat settled in your room. So before you start building your panic room, give the distance a test run and count the number of seconds it takes you to get there.

, You can gather Rocks by mining boulders available around the world with your pickaxe, or by picking Rocks scattered everywhere in the world. Aside from Rocks, it would be best to invest in other accessible resources like Twigs, Flint, Cut Grass, Logs, Gold, and Meat.


Twigs can be gathered by selecting the dried-out bushes scattered in the world, and Cut Grass can be gathered by selecting tufts of long grass scattered everywhere. Logs can be gathered by creating an axe, selecting it as your main tool, then selecting a nearby tree. Gold can be gathered by mining large boulders with yellow veins streaking across the stone or found scattered in Graveyards and Rockylands.

, As mentioned in the previous section, you’ll be needing quite a lot of tools while creating your panic room, like an axe, pickaxe, and shovel. The former two can be created right off the bat by accessing the Crafting menu, which is found at the right-hand side of your screen on the PC or by pressing L2 on the console editions, and selecting the Tool tab, represented by a crossed axe and pickaxe icon. The Axe costs 1 Twig and 1 Flint, and the Pickaxe costs 2 Twigs and 2 Flints. The Shovel requires a Science Machine to prototype and can be crafted through the Tool tab when standing near the Science Machine.

, Aside from the Science Machine, you’ll also be needing an Alchemy Engine. Both can be created through the Science tab, represented by an atom icon, but you’ll be needing a Science Machine to make an Alchemy Engine.


A Science Machine costs only 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, but an Alchemy Engine costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine Tab, represented by a diamond icon.
Cut Stone is crafted from 3 Rocks, and Boards are crafted from 4 Logs.

, Aside from that, you might want to invest in a Fire Pit for your panic room, in case the attack lasts until night, which is a definite bad thing if you don’t have a light with you. This will cost you 12 stones and 2 Logs, it’s available on the Light tab, represented by a fire icon, and you can make it right off the bat.


A plain Campfire, which costs 3 Cut Grass and 2 Logs, tends to be extinguished after a while unless continuously fed fuel. Once extinguished, it produces Ashes, which can be used to create some healing salves later on.

, A Chest is not so necessary, but would be useful to store armors, weaponry, and some food, like Jerky, if you were caught off guard when the attack happens. Chests cost 3 Boards and are crafted at the Science Machine.


You can also craft a Backpack in the Survival tab with a Science Machine for 4 Twigs and 4 Cut Grass, or a Piggyback in the Alchemy Engine for 4 Pig Skins, 6 Silk, and 2 Ropes. These other two items provide a mobile extension to your inventory and might be easier to use in the long run. Though equipping it would mean that you cannot equip armors while wearing it, you can simply switch between them when needed.
Backpacks and Piggybacks can’t be placed in your hotbar either, but remain on the ground until picked up, which automatically equips them. You can switch your armor or backpack around by right-clicking either of them (PC) or by scrolling with the right analog stick and pressing the right direction button (console).

, A piece of meat of any sort is also recommended, but not necessary. Hounds tend to get distracted easily, especially by meat, so luring them away or even attracting them with a piece of meat is a viable strategy. You can get your meat by trapping rabbits or killing various creatures and monsters in the world.


Traps can be created through the Survival Tab, represented by a looped rope icon, for 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs.

, Last, invest in weaponry and armors. You can use your axe and pickaxe as rudimentary weapons at first, but crafting a spear would be better. Spears are available on the Weapon tab, represented by a crossed sword and spear icon, and crafted at the Science Machine for 2 Twigs, 1 Rope, and 1 Flint.


Investing in at least a Grass Suit or a Log Suit is also best. Grass Suits are always available at the very start for 2 Twigs and 10 Cut Grass, while Log Suits costs 8 Logs and 2 Ropes and can be crafted in the Science Machine. Ropes can be crafted at the Refine tab for 3 Cut Grass. If you’ve killed a Pig and found a Pig Skin, you could also craft the Football Helmet in the Fight tab with the Science Machine for 1 Rope and 1 Pig Skin.
You could also invest in some healing materials, like Spider Glands, Healing Salves, and Honey Poultices, in case you get badly hurt. Spider Glands can be acquired from slain Spiders, which you can find in Spider Dens scattered around the world. You can craft a Healing Salve with a Science Machine through the Survival tab located in the Crafting menu. Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock, and 1 Spider Gland.
Honey Poultices can be crafted with an Alchemy Engine and costs 2 Honey (occasionally dropped by slain Bees or obtained by destroying hives or harvesting Bee Boxes), and 1 Papyrus (crafted with a Science Machine through the Refine tab for 4 Reeds, which can be found in Marshes). This item heals a bit more than the Healing Salve, but the resources can be tricky to acquire. Bee Boxes can be created with 4 Bees, 2 Boards and 1 Honeycomb. You can catch the bees with a Bug Net, which you can make using 4 Twigs, 2 Silk, and 1 Rope. Silk is also dropped by Spiders when slain.

, While the initial panic room design is good at first, once the Hounds’ numbers start increasing, you might want to consider investing in traps. Traps in your panic room early in the game can be optional, but later on, it could be vital. However, this option really depends on preference. Just remember, without traps, such as Tooth Traps or Bee Mines, to help fortify your defenses, the Hounds can make short work of your structure and leave you vulnerable to attacks from all directions.


Should you decide on making traps, the next two steps can help in creating two of the best kinds of traps for a panic room.

, Tooth Traps can be created in the Weapons tab through the Alchemy Engine and costs 1 each of Rope, Logs, and Hound Teeth. Hound Teeth are occasionally dropped by slain Hounds. Once placed, any wandering creature that steps on it will trigger the trap and damage them. Once triggered, you’ll have to reset the trap by selecting the planted trap. Each Tooth Trap lasts for 10 uses, and with the constant Hound waves, it’s completely renewable.

, Another trap you could create is a Bee Mine, which can be crafted in the Weapons tab with a Science Machine, and costs 4 Bees, 1 Board, and 1 Flint. Once placed, it will trigger an explosion when a creature aside from you gets near enough and releases all 4 bees to sting whatever triggered the trap. The Bee Mine only lasts for 1 use, however.

, To start, first you need to make as many Stone Walls as you can. Stone Walls can stack up to 20 per inventory slot, so you’ll need around 50–60 walls, which would occupy three slots of your inventory.


Stone Walls can be crafted from the Structures tab, represented by a hammer icon, with an Alchemy Engine for 2 Cut Stones.

, Select your walls and place them by right-clicking (PC) or pressing the left direction button (console) on the area you wish to build it on. As much as possible, try to keep the walls as closely parallel to each other as possible, but make sure that the walls beside it do\n’t highlight while placing your wall. This would only make your wall bigger and waste the item. And while bigger walls may seem nice, you could simply use a Rock or a Cut Stone on the wall instead of wasting your walls.


Keep building until it is vaguely room-shaped and has at least some space for you and your belongings. Having some space to move is prefered when it comes to your room, because despite the bottleneck entrance, you could still be attacked by multiple enemies if they are too close to each other and yourself.

, Leave a small space for an entrance, enough for you to run through, and then build it forward, creating a sort of long entrance “hall” into your room. This will create a bottleneck or a funnel to ensure only one creature at a time can get in and out of your room.


The purpose of the panic room during the early stage of your gameplay is to simply help funnel the attack better so that the player is not overwhelmed.

, Your room should have a thickness of at least three walls. If you’re wondering why, it’s because the hounds can attack the player through 2 layers of wall, which can be a bit jarring to discover the first time. The last layer would serve as a buffer between you and their absurd biting range. Once you have enough materials, you can make the entrance path turn a few times to create a more efficient funnel. This would further ensure that you’ll only be fighting one creature at a time, instead of being harassed at all sides.

, Once you have your desired traps, place them in assorted areas. The entrance and round sides are the most strategic places, since the Hounds tend to swarm around you during the attack. Lining your entire entrance corridor with traps is also a good way, since they would immediately kill the Hounds before they even reach you.


With the creation of your traps, you can create an alternative style of panic room. This style requires you to create a long passageway or corridor of sorts and filling it with as many Tooth Traps as you could make. This way, when you’re being attacked, simply run through the trap and most of the Hounds will be taken care off, if not all of them. This method is more beneficial for late-game players with currently low resources or health, or weaker players with Hound’s Teeth to spare, since most of the Hounds will be killed by the traps, leaving you to deal with one or two stragglers easily.
Later in the game, once mobs like the Deerclops emerge, traps are the most effective way to deal with them. Simple walls can be broken by it, and you’re better off luring it to different trapped corridors or through numerous placed traps than trying to weather away the attack in an actual “closed” room. This is also why panic rooms should be far away from your camp, so that it would survive large assaults by these mobs and keep the rest of your survival amenities intact.

, Afterwards, you can place your Fire Pit and/or Chest inside with some extra resources so you could weather the night if it comes to that.


During your first few weeks in the game, making a very large room isn’t necessary, since it would take too much time and consume too many materials to make. It should only be large enough for you to move a bit and maybe have a Campfire. Without traps, such as Tooth Traps or Bee Mines, to help fortify your defenses, the Hounds would make short work of your structure and leave you vulnerable to attacks from all directions.

Consider your dishes.,
Watch your ingredients.,
Know your fillers.,
Check the individual values of each ingredient.,
Check for zero-value ingredients.,
Calculate the bonus.",How to Calculate Bonus Points for a Recipe in Don't Starve," Most of the time, your dishes will only require a specific ingredient or two, or specific amounts of an ingredient type. Some dishes are extremely simple, like Meatballs and Meat Stew, where the only ingredient required is certain amounts of meat, and Ratatouille, which requires a certain amount of vegetables. Other recipes require specific ingredients, like Dragonpie, which requires one dragonfruit. The key here is experimentation.;
, Some food items are rather unfilling, like berries and morsels, while some items are quite filling, like meat and eggplant. By balancing the amounts and kinds of ingredients you choose, you can maximize the efficiency of the dish while still ending up with the dish you were aiming to create.


Don’t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian ingredients in one recipe, since it will yield a Monster Lasagna. This actually damages instead of heals, and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity. Only do so if you plan on adding a Twig in your recipe.

, Fillers are items inserted in the remaining slots of your Crock Pot’s menu so that the four-ingredient requirement is fulfilled. Most recipes only require a certain amount of items, or the presence of one or two types of food, or a specific ingredient.


Twigs and mushrooms (especially the Red Cap mushrooms most commonly found during the day) are the most efficient fillers. Mushrooms are poisonous and carry penalties when consumed uncooked, but will carry none of the poisonous risk when used as an ingredient. Twigs are completely inedible uncooked, but can be used as an ingredient filler.
Berries are also a good filler since they’re readily available and renewable, except during winter. They’re also not as filling as other foods, which means they make an excellent filler for cheap meals if you have some to spare.

, Each individual ingredient has different values and benefits to your Sanity, Health, and of course, Hunger. The only way to tell is by keeping an eye on your gauges, which you can do by hovering your mouse over the brain, the stomach, or the heart icon in the PC, or by pressing R2 on the console. It might take a while, but you can check the value for each and every ingredient by eating individual units of your ingredients and taking note of how much health, hunger, and/or sanity they give you. The Bonus Values primarily refer to the hunger point values, but you can also count the bonus health and sanity gains as well.

, These items are considered the best type of filler for their actual lack of value. Twigs, Honey Comb, and Ice (Reign of Giants) are examples of items counted as ingredients despite being generally inedible. Some recipes actually call for them.


Mushrooms are considered zero-value, despite being edible, because of their negative effects.
Monster Food counts as zero-value when paired with a Twig.

, Once you determine the individual values, you can then calculate the bonuses by adding the values of the individual ingredients up, then subtracting the total sum from the benefits of the complete dish.


For instance, if you made a Fistful of Jam with 4 raw berries, you first need to add up the individual value of the berries, which is a total of 37.48 hunger points and no bonuses to sanity and health. Subtract that total from the gains of the dish, which is 37.5 hunger points, 5 sanity, and 3 health. The hunger benefits basically even out, with some bonuses to health and sanity.
Using Cooked Berries, which have a hunger value of 12.5, would devalue the dish by 12.5 points, though the dish itself would heal you for 4 points more and restore your sanity by 5 points.

Press B repeatedly.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Cancel an Evolution in a Pokémon Game1," The majority of Pokémon evolve when they reach a certain level. A Pokémon ""levels up"" (gains a level) by gaining experience points from fights. The level that triggers an evolution varies from Pokémon to Pokémon.


If you're unsure when or how a Pokémon will evolve, this information is easy to find online. You can check the Pokémon's page on a Pokémon resource site like Bulbapedia, for instance.Note that select Pokémon will only evolve by using special items or by meeting special conditions. For example, Eevee requires an evolutionary stone to evolve no matter how many levels it gains.;
, When you get your Pokémon to a high enough level (or use an evolution stone, etc.), you will see an evolution dialogue screen with ""What? (name of Pokémon) is evolving!"" or a similar message. Wait for the evolution ""animation"" to appear. The screen may flash and the Pokémon may ""blink"" between its current form and its next evolution.


More modern Pokémon games generally have fancier evolution screens than older games, but the general idea is the same for all games in the series.

, As soon as you see the animation begin, press the B button rapidly. Don't wait too long or the evolution will finish.


Eventually, you will see ""Huh? (name of Pokémon) stopped evolving!"" or a similar message. At this point, the evolution is canceled. If your Pokémon gained a level, it will keep its level but will stay in the same form.

, Cancelling an evolution once will not cancel it in the future. If your Pokémon starts to evolve again, you will need to repeat the process above to cancel it. If you don't, it will evolve.


For Pokémon that evolve normally from leveling up, you'll need to cancel every time the Pokémon gains a level.

Nature: This affects a Pokémon’s statistics as they However, the exception to this is when using a Ditto to breed. One state (speed, attack, etc.) will be in red and grow quickly, while another will be in blue and grow slowly. Some of these traits are passed down.

Summary: This little paragraph actually predicts what qualities your baby Pokémon will have. Each sentence corresponds to the baby Pokémon's hidden states, called Individual Values, or IV. Each parent passes down 3 of a baby's 12 total stats.;
, Two Pokémon that are the same species share the same name. Thus, two Bulbasaur will always breed with each other to produce another. There are a few exceptions to this rule, as baby Pokémon and Legendary Pokémon (Articuno, Ho-Oh, Entei) cannot ever breed. There are a few other exceptions as well, as these Pokémon cannot breed.:


Any ""baby"" Pokémon.
Nidorina and Nidoqueen.
Cosplay Pikachu
Unown, Pokémon do not have to be the same species in order to breed. There are several large categories, made up of similar Pokémon, that are all able to interbreed. Two Pokémon of the same egg group can breed as long as one is male and the other is female. These groups are complex and often overlapping, allowing trainers variety when breeding Pokémon. A complete list of egg groups can be found here.When breeding two different species, the baby Pokémon always will be the same species as the mother.
Egg groups are largely determined by appearance: there is a Plant Group, a Flying Group for birds, and a Human-Like Group for Pokémon that walk on two legs.
Pokémon only need to share one egg group to be compatible.

, The shape-shifting, genderless Pokémon Ditto can be used to mate with any Pokémon, regardless of egg group, as long is it is not one of the exceptions listed above, such as a baby or Legendary Pokémon.


Genderless Pokémon, such as Magnemite or Golett, can only breed with a Ditto.The Pokémon produced by Ditto breeding will always be the non-Ditto Pokémon, whether you began with a male or female.Breeding with Ditto is a great way to breed male Pokémon.

, The Daycare is where you leave your Pokémon to gain levels automatically. It is also a place to leave two compatible Pokémon so that they have the privacy to begin egg-making. Find your game's Daycare and talk to the Old Man out front to begin breeding.


In Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, it is to the left of Mauville.
In FireRed/LeafGreen, it is on Route 5.
In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, it is in Solaceon town.
In Heart Gold/Soul Silver, it is near the entrance to Goldenrod City.
In Black/White it's on Route 3.
In X/Y it's on Route 7.
In Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire it is the same as the Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald games but there is also one in the battle resortIn Sun/Moon it is in Paniola Ranch.

, You need to leave one female and one male (or one female and one Ditto) from the same egg group together in order to have a chance at breeding them. Put the two Pokémon in your party and then talk to the Daycare staff to leave the Pokémon at the Daycare.

, The Original Trainer (OT) of the Pokémon (whoever caught or bred it) and whether or not the Pokémon are the same species, determines how quickly you will receive an egg. The fastest way to get an egg is to breed two Pokémon of the same species with different OTs. This will give you a 70% chance of producing an egg every 256 steps.


Pokémon from different trainers have a higher probability of producing an egg.
Pokémon of the same species have a higher probability of producing an egg.You can attach the Oval Charm to any Pokémon to increase its probability of breeding per 256 steps.

, Chatting with the Old Man after placing your two Pokémon in the Daycare will allow you to determine their egg production probability:


""The two seem to get along very well!"" indicates a high probability of an egg, around 70%.
""The two seem to get along"" indicates a 50% chance of an egg.
""The two don't really seem to like each other very much"" indicates a low chance of getting an egg, around 20%.
""They prefer to play with other Pokémon more than with each other"" means you will not get an egg ever.
In the Generation 2 games (Gold/Silver/Crystal) you must talk to the Pokémon directly -- they will either ""care for each other"" (highly likely), ""be friendly"" (likely) or ""show interest"" (unlikely). Any other dialog means that they won't mate., You need to give your Pokémon time to breed. In all games after Generation 2, the game randomly chooses if you get an egg after you've taken 256 steps, based on the aforementioned probability. If you don't get one, you can keep walking to try again next time. It is often best to walk back and forth in front of or around the Daycare, allowing you to check on your egg periodically.


You can ride your bike to make the steps melt away much faster.
If you have a Pokémon with Flame Body or Magma Armour abilities, the amount of time needed to get egg will be cut in half.In Generation 2 games, every step has the opportunity (though usually under 2%) to make an egg.

, You will need an open slot in your party to accept the egg, so don't go around with six Pokémon. The Old Man will change his behavior if he has an egg to give you:


In Gold/Silver/Crystal, he will appear in the front yard.
In Ruby/Saphire/Emerald, he will step out by the fence.
In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, he will face the road.
In HeartGold and SoulSilver, he will face left or right instead of down and call the player over the Pokégear.
In Black/White he will call out to you.
In X/Y he will face the road.
In Alpha Sapphire / Omega Ruby he will turn around, Eggs take anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 steps to hatch, so get back to your adventuring and wait to see what happens. To see the stage your egg is at, just go to your party and check the summary of your egg:


The first stage is ""I wonder what will hatch from this, it doesn't seem close to hatching.""
The second stage is ""It appears to move occasionally.""
The third stage is ""Sounds can be heard coming from the egg!""
The fourth stage is the egg hatching. When you are walking, a text box will appear saying ""Oh!,"" and the egg will hatch similarly to an evolving Pokémon.

, A small handful of Pokémon will actually birth the second step up the evolutionary ladder one of the parents is not holding a specific incense:


Snorlax must have Full Incense to make Munchlax.
Wobbuffet must have Lax Incense to make Wynaut.
Roselia and Roserade must have Rose Incense to make Budew.
Marill and Azumarill must have Sea Incense to make Azurill.
Chimecho must have Pure Incense to make Chingling.
Mr. Mime must have Odd Incense to make Mime Jr.
Chansey and Blissey must have Luck Incense to make Happiny.
Mantine must have Wave Incense to make Mantyke., This is only applicable if the Pokémon could eventually learn the move as they level up. If you breed a male and female Aggron who both have leveled up to learn Iron Tail, for example, the baby Aggron will know Iron Tail as soon as they hatch. This is a great way to pass down moves to young Pokémon and make them powerful from an early age., A TM is an item that teaches a Pokémon a move, but it can only be used once. However, if a baby Pokémon is able to use a TM, they will learn the move automatically from their father when they are born. For example, you might have a male Charmeleon who you taught Dig, but you cannot get another TM for Dig. If you breed the male Charmeleon with a female Pokémon who could also learn Dig, the resulting baby would automatically know Dig from birth.


This is a great way to ""reuse"" great TMs that you cannot get your hands on again.
Generation VI, unfortunately, created some exceptions to this rule.

, This new feature makes it easier to give great moves to you baby Pokémon that they might not normally learn. For example, if you have a female Dragonite that knows Outrage and they mate with a Charizard, the resulting Charmander will know Outrage as well.


Genderless Pokémon cannot inherit egg moves.A exhaustive list of all known egg moves can be found online here.


, For instance, Eevee can only use Wish if it has learned it through a breeding chain. But Eevee cannot breed directly with any Pokémon that can learn Wish -- you'll need an extra step. It is possible to breed a male Togekiss with Wish with a female Pikachu, then breed the resulting male baby Pikachu (with Wish) with a female Eevee, and voila -- a baby Eevee with Wish.


This is a time-consuming process, but is essential to get the ""perfect"" move set for some trainers.

, IVs, or Individual Values, are hidden numbers between 0-31 that determine a Pokémon's stats. They are Pokémon's version of genes. Higher values determine how high your Pokémon's maximum stats can be. When Pokémon breed, each parent passes three of their IV's down to the baby and the rest are randomly selected. To get an idea of a Pokémon’s IV, read the parents ""Nature."" If they talk about quickness, the Pokémon has a high Speed IV, if they talk about ""curiosity,"" they have a high Special Attack IV. However, this is not an exact science, as exact IVs are hidden from players.

The item ""Destiny Link,"" when attached, passes five of the parent's IVs down instead of three.
Attaching a ""Power"" object, like a belt or anklet, forces the parent to pass down the associated IV. So if you have a Power Weight on (grows HP), the parent's HP IV will be passed down.Advanced players can consult an IV predictor online to get estimations at their Pokémon's IV scores and make breeding decisions.

These are usually released in pairs and each has different features. If you have a favorite Pokémon that you must have on your team, do a quick Internet search before buying the game to check and see if the version you want has the Pokémon in question. The currently available versions are:


Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Silver, Gold, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Black, White, Black 2, White 2, X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, Sun, and Moon.;
, The first thing you need to do on your journey to becoming a Pokémon is to collect your first Pokémon. In each game, there are different options for starting Pokémon which you are gifted by a local Pokémon professional, like Professor Oak in the original games. Usually, after meeting your local professional, you are offered one of the three main elemental types: grass, water, or fire.In some cases, you will be offered a fourth type, but this is a rare exception.


In Pokémon Red, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen, choose from: Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.
Pokémon Yellow: only Pikachu.
Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver: Chikorita, Cyndaquil and Totodile.
Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire: Treecko, Torchic and Mudkip.
Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum: Turtwig, Chimchar and Piplup.
Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2: Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott.
Pokémon X and Y: Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie.
Pokémon Sun and Moon: Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio.

, Each Pokémon has one or more elements it is associated with, so choosing the right element Pokémon for your battle can give you an advantage with more effective attacks and more resistant defense.Learn these elemental strengths and weaknesses so you can choose the right Pokémon for the right battle. With the symbol "" > "" representing strong against, "" < "" representing weakness to, and "" X "" representing zero effect, the types are:



Normal: < fighting; X ghost

, You will spend a long time traveling between towns in your Pokémon game, completing adventures, and fighting other Pokémon trainers along the way. Make sure you stop at your local shopping mart for potions to recover hit points (HP), antidotes to cure status (like poison), and a few spare Poké Balls to catch any wild Pokémon you run into along the way!, Now that you have a Pokémon and some supplies, you probably realize that it's not very strong, that it has a limited amount of abilities, and potentially an evolved form you can unlock through training. Your Pokémon will gain more abilities, improve its stats, and eventually evolve by gaining levels. You can raise your Pokémon's level by fighting it against wild Pokémon or the Pokémon of other trainers.Some players choose to save trainer battles for Pokémon that have difficulty gaining experience, as oftentimes trainer battles give you a greater than normal amount of experience points (XP).
Some items, like Rare Candy, give your Pokémon an automatic boost. Use these items with caution; some are expensive, rare, or have a negative trade off. Rare Candy, as an example, cannot be bought, instantly raises the level of the Pokémon on which it is used, but does not give the full stat bonus you would receive from leveling up through battle., If you want to be the very best, you need a team that you can call upon in any situation. A real trainer can manage a whole team of Pokémon, regardless of element or level. You can only capture wild Pokémon, and only by throwing a Poké Ball at it after weakening it. There is a chance that even Pokémon with low HP can break out of Poké Balls, so make sure you're fully supplied with Poké Balls.


There are many different varieties of Poké Balls, with better quality Poké Balls having a higher chance of capture. Be conservative using your Master Ball, as it is one of the rarest Poké Balls and guarantees the capture of any wild Pokémon., Now that you have a few different Pokémon to choose from, make a team of six to accompany you wherever you go. Try to keep the levels of your Pokémon balanced, as leveling one too high too fast might leave you reliant on that particular Pokémon. Having only one or two strong Pokémon might create difficulties for you down the line, when you run into an enemy that is unaffected by the element of your strong Pokémon.


When making your team, try to select Pokémon with a wide range of abilities, or if you know your opponent prefers a type, choose your team accordingly. For example, when at the Fire Gym, you may want to include water and rock type Pokémon, as both are strong to fire attacks.

, After a battle, heal your Pokémon at a Pokémon Center. Pokémon Centers are places where you can heal your party for free. Also, you don't have to worry about them getting soft and losing their fighting edge. You can stop and rest, or talk with non-player characters here to learn more about the city you are in.

, You will need to collect gym badges in order to prove that you are a worthy trainer to your Pokémon and other trainers. Without badges, your higher level Pokémon may disobey you in battle.These badges will also prove that you are ready to face the Elite Four after you have collected each one. There are eight different gym leaders in most Pokémon games.


In Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver, you can battle 16 gym leaders, the Johto League (Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver), and the Kanto League (Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen). Each gym leader uses different types of Pokémon, with the exception of gym leader Blue of Kanto, who does not specialize in one particular type.

, By beating gym leaders, you will gain more experience, learn more abilities, evolve your Pokémon -- all of which are necessary to become a diligent trainer. Possessing every badge also makes you eligible to take part in the Pokémon league, which varies by region, but usually involves you taking on the Elite Four. These are powerful trainers, so bring your best Pokémon and be ready for a difficult fight.

, Every region has a champion that you can challenge in addition to the Elite Four. Beat the Pokémon Champion and prove that your method of training is the best.

, In each game you should receive a Pokédex, or an electronic encyclopedia where you can look up Pokémon you have encountered. You can gain more detailed information for your Pokédex by catching the Pokémon, or even by gaining possession of a Pokémon for a short time, like when trading with other players using a wireless adapter or a GBA link cable.


In Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, and LeafGreen, you must see and catch all of the Pokémon in order to complete your Pokédex.
From version Gold and Silver onward, you can transfer your game data, adding the Pokémon you've already encountered in previous games.
In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, you only need to see all of the Pokémon to complete your Sinnoh Pokédex.

, When you connect, you will be able to battle other people online to prove your training regimen is superior to all others!

You will need a powerful lead to strike down part of the foe's team.,
One of best Pokémon for this is Deoxys in Attack Mode.,
Use Timid/Modest Arceus to K.O.,
Rayquaza.,
Modest or Timid Darkrai.,
Timid Dialga.,
Modest or Timid Mewtwo with Aura Sphere, Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Psystrike, and Wise Glasses or Choice Specs.",How to Build the Ultimate Pokémon Team1," It is a good strategy, knocking out half of the foe's team and letting in other Pokémon.;
, Attach a Life Orb to it to boost the power of its moves. Max out its offensive stats. A recommended move set is Fire Punch, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Psychic/Psycho Boost. (Psychic is more reliable because it does not lower stats, but if you do not care about the recoil or plan on switching, use Psycho Boost.) Use the appropriate moves on foes, and sweep until Life Orb damage or a priority move K.Os you. Be aware that this Pokémon is not defensive, even quick attack will make it faint. However, it has a great speed and attacking stats, and will K.O. most Pokémon in one or two hits.

, whatever is left of your foe's team. Use Calm Mind to stat up, Judgment for powerful and reliable STAB, and Flamethrower and Earth Power for great coverage. Attach a Splash or Draco Plate to give Arceus a great offensive typing with Judgment.

, Use Jolly Nature to make it strong. Attach a Persim berry to heal confusion from Outrage. Earthquake and Fly are for good neutral and Stab coverage.

, Use Dark Void, Dark Pulse, Dream Eater, & Nasty Plot. Put your foe to sleep with Dark Void, then use Dream Eater. Dark Pulse is a STAB move to use on Psychics & Ghosts, & is almost unresistant in the ubers.

, Use Aura Sphere, Earth Power, Flash Cannon, Roar of Time/Dragon Pulse Adamant Orb, and Leftovers. Dragon Pulse can be used over Roar of Time if you don't want to waste a turn after Rot, Flash Cannon is a good STAB, and Aurora Sphere and Earth Power are powerful moves with good neutral damage. Adamant Orb will boosts moves power, and Leftovers can keep it healthy for while.

, Both items boost power for all its Special moves, Thunderbolt will take out Water Pokémon, Flamethrower K.O.s Grass Pokémon, and Aura Sphere takes out Dark Pokémon and is a good move that almost never misses. Psystrike is a good STAB, very powerful, and can take out many Pokémon.

Plan.,
Catch or obtain the Pokémon.,
EV-train it.,
Use logic or the internet to know what kind of points different Pokémon gives - Flying-types are usually fast (Speed), Rock-types are sturdy (Defense) etc.,
IVs.,
Teach it the moves.,
Level it.,
Breed!",How to Build a Perfect Pokémon," Plan what type of Pokémon you want. The perfect Pokémon will know the moves to fend off its weakness while normally fighting other Pokémon. Use Pokémon books or online references to research the different types of Pokémon and figure out which ones you want.;
, Search tall grass or water. Look for people in-game that want to trade. This is a great way to find rare Pokémon. Trade with friends that have Pokémon games, especially if they have the version opposite yours. This is an easy way to get Pokémon that you are unable to attain. For example, if you have Leaf Green and you want a Tyranitar, go find someone who has Fire Red! Natures are important too. If you decide to go with your starter, save and reload until you get the nature you think will be the most adequate. (This is a smart thing to do with any other Pokémon you decide upon as well, however, since you are not guaranteed any Pokémon for your effort, it might take even longer than with the starter!)

, Get all stats up with Vitamins such as Protein. Don't feed it what it doesn't need. Doing so will give a Pokémon 10 EV points in that stat, until it reaches 100 EVs, which is the highest you can reach with medicine. This is where EV-TRAINING plays a part! EVs, or Effort Values, are stat modifiers that improves different stats depending on which Pokémon you defeat in battle. For instance, a Pidgey gives a +1 EV point to Speed, whilst a Staraptor gives +3 EV points to Attack. Every 4 EVs in a particular stat is equal to 1 point in that stat. Also, every Pokémon is capable of having a maximum of 510 EVs with a maximum of 255 EVs in any one stat. Since neither 510 nor 255 are divisible by four, having 252 EVs in one stat is the most beneficial to you. Use this for your benefit, and train the stats you'd like to increase against Pokémon that gives the correct EVs.

, A Pokémon that hasn't evolved, or a Pokémon that doesn't evolve at all, gives 1 EV point. A 1rst stage evolution Pokémon gives 2 EV points, and a 2nd stage evolution Pokémon gives 3 EV points, along with legendary Pokémon. Items like a Macho Brace double the EVs earned in battle, and the elusive Pokerus, should you be so lucky to ever experience it, double EV gain too.

, Individual Values are quite important too. As you probably have noticed by now, each Pokémon has different stats, even if it is the same type and has the same nature! This is because of some numbers called Individual Values. Unlike EVs, there are NO WAY to change them once you have obtained the Pokémon. These numbers range from 0 to 31, telling you the quality of the Pokémon’s stats, 0 being the weakest, 31 being the best of them all. They are essentially the same as up to 31 extra points in each stat, which is why they might be so freaking important. The best way to get good IVs is to breed Pokémon that you already know has some good IVs in a particular stat. However, since this will take quite the time to explain, just Google it until you find the answers you need on this subject. Smogon, Bulbapedia, Serebii, the choice is yours. It is possible to win any Pokémon-game with a team consisting of 6 high-leveled Magikarps, so this will most likely not matter at all for you.

, Know its weaknesses and teach it moves that can be used to hit Super Effective on the other Pokémon. Try to teach super tough moves like Earthquake. Teach moves that suit the Pokémon. Note that if an attacking move is used by a Pokémon of the same type, it will be significantly more powerful, thanks to Same Type Effect Bonus (STAB), which can be useful.

, Train it to level 100! Simple and straight forward. Depending on which game you are playing, you may not want to use Rare Candies all the way to level 100; if you do, it might lose the possibility to gain EVs. That is 126 stat points lost at lvl 100. If you want to be safe, make sure you have finished EV training it until you finish leveling it to lvl 100 (normally, since a lot of battling is required to reach lvl 100 without Rare Candy-ing it, these will fill completely up by themselves).

, Some special moves can only be learned by breeding. For example, get a Light Ball, a Male Pikachu/Raichu and Female Pikachu/Raichu, give the female the Light Ball, and put them both in the Day Care. The hatched Pichu will have Volt Tackle.

Start over!",How to Build a Competitive Pokémon Team on a Pokémon Battling Simulator," Tiers are determined in general by Smogon and can be viewed on their site (see the first source in Sources and Citations). More information about the tiers and the tier system can also be found under policy review on their forums.;
, Weather may be more viable in some tiers than others, and some weathers may be more viable in some tiers than in others. Running weather gives a team certain advantages and disadvantages. First, it allows a team to take advantage of many Pokémon's abilities (such as Toxicroak's Dry Skin or Landorus' Sand Force) and overpower another team that cannot do this. Furthermore, Hail and Sandstorm can take advantage of the attrition that those weathers bring to non-ice or non-Ground, Rock, and Steel-types respectively, while Rain and Sun can take advantage of the fact that they boost water-type moves and weaken fire-type moves or vice versa, respectively. If weather is chosen, an appropriate weather starter should be the first member of the team. This Pokémon will be able to create unending weather through an ability that activates each time that Pokémon switches in. The weather inducers are: Politoed and Pelipper for rain, Tyranitar, Hippowdon, Hippopotas, and Gigalith for sandstorm, Ninetales and Torkoal for sun, and Abomasnow, Alolan Ninetales, and Snover for hail.

, This is a crucial part of team building and never should be overlooked. Will the built team seek to win by overpowering the opponent for the win, out-stalling the opposition with moves such as Toxic and ""walls"" that cannot be touched, or a mixture of both? These team strategies are called Offense, Stall, and Balanced. Within these three overarching strategies are more specific strategies, such as Bulky Offense (an offensive team that also packs Pokémon with high defenses to give the team some endurance), Hyper Offense (an offensive team that solely focuses on taking down the opponent's Pokémon as fast as possible), or Rain Stall (a Rain team that takes advantage of the fact that water-types typically have high HP and defenses to out-stall the opponent). There are many more strategies that can be played -- for more information see the Dragonspiral Tower section of the Smogon site or the Rate My Team forum, also of Smogon.

, Depending on what you have decided so far, you should have a general idea of what your team is trying to achieve and a rough outline of what kinds of Pokémon to have on your team. This is where you finalize this. A standard balanced team will have a special sweeper, a physical sweeper, a special wall, a physical wall, a lead, and a support Pokémon. However, your team may be different. If you are running weather, replace the generic lead with a weather inducer. If you are running Offense, you might want to replace the wall(s) and/or supporter with (a) sweeper(s). If you want to run a Stall team, you might want to increase the number of walls or supporters on your team. If you are running a weather team, you want to make sure that many of your Pokémon benefit from the weather you are creating.

, Up until now, we have carefully avoided the topic of choosing Pokémon to eliminate all bias. The first place to start choosing Pokémon is a list of all the Pokémon in the tier that you are attempting to build a team in. Read analyses of these Pokémon (even just the overview section) on Smogon. This will give you an idea of what each Pokémon does on a team. For each role that you aim to have on your final team, choose three (or more) Pokémon from that tier that might fit in that role. Rank them from 1-3 (or higher) based on how well you think they will do.

, You now have plenty of options for Pokémon. What you now want to do is actually choose which of those three Pokémon you are going to use for your first draft of the team. Look to make sure the Pokémon on your team resist each others' weaknesses and no more than two or three Pokémon on your team share a common weakness. If three Pokémon share a weakness, make sure you have an immunity to that type in your party or a couple of good counters to the common attackers using that type in your tier.

, First, let us define a check and a counter. A counter can switch into a Pokémon with little or no risk, and ensure the opposing Pokémon's defeat. A check can sometimes switch into a Pokémon safely, and sometimes ensure it's defeat. In many battles, you will see the same Pokémon over and over again. Make sure none of these Pokémon will be able to set up and run rampant on your team. In fact, if there are still some party slots in which multiple Pokémon could still be chosen, you might want to consider one that counters or checks the most commonly used Pokémon rather than simply provides a little extra team support.

, Now that you have finalized what you believe to be the Pokémon you are going to use on your team, look at the Smogon analyses, and choose the moveset that you think will carry out that Pokémon's role most efficiently. Often you can tell which this will be from the name of the set (for example, for a Dragonite Rain Mixed Attacker in OU, choose the Mixed Attacker (Rain) set). If you are new to competitive battling, make sure you don't disregard stat-boosting moves -- they do come in handy.

, Currently, the best simulator for the Fifth Generation is probably Pokémon Online, so this guide will assume that you are using this program. First, open it. Click ""Teambuilder."" Then click the ""Pokémon"" tab at the top of the pop-up window. Now you can enter the species of your Pokémon, it's nickname (not necessary), it's moves, it's gender, it's Hidden Power type and IV's, it's EV's, it's nature, and pretty much anything else. In the simulated battling world, it is assumed that you have spent your entire life breeding or soft-resetting for perfect Pokémon (even though you haven't -- this saves you time!), and so you can use almost unrealistic, but NOT HACKED Pokémon.

, This guide recommends battling on Smogon's server, as you will encounter the best trainers there who will easily show you through the course of battle where your weaknesses lie. Battle at least 10 separate opponents until the end of the battle (or until it is obvious who will be the victor and the losing side forfeits). Ensure these battles are saved to a folder so you can go back over the logs.

, Look specifically to see if there are any pertinent weaknesses on your team or any of your Pokémon are failing to carry out a role for a particular reason. Make sure the Pokémon that looked good or looked like they would work together well on paper actually were or did. After reading through each log, rank your Pokémon from 1-6 based on their positive impacts on the battle. Tally up the totals. Pokémon with higher numbers perhaps should have a moveset changed or species changed to help the team more. You can make more than one change between drafts, but it is not advised -- one change can make a huge difference on its own while the second change may muddle results. In this stage, keep to the Smogon analyses; the new player with a new team will not have the experience to create strong sets and EV spreads yet.

, Continue to let your team change and make sure you seem to be winning more and more often. If not, perhaps the changes you are making are actually detrimental. Once you seem to be unable to boost your wins higher (this will take a while and many team drafts), you have a couple options available to you. Continue to the next step.

, Now you can stray from the Smogon analyses. Is it frustrating that many Conkeldurr just outspeed your Gastrodon? Consider taking some EV's from Attack or Special Attack and moving them to Speed. Would it be more helpful to your team for Starmie to know Psychic instead of Scald? Replace them and see if your winnings are boosted. Besides customizing your Pokémon to be better on your team, you also add a bit of unpredictability to your Pokémon. Some Conkeldurr users will expect to outspeed Gastrodon and you will surprise them. Perhaps some unwitting trainer will switch in Gengar to your Starmie and you will OHKO with Psychic from sheer surprise. Eventually, you will get stuck here too. When you do, move to the next step.

, This will allow other Pokémon trainers to view your team and may point out some weaknesses or offer advice to help your team grow and get better. One note of caution -- make sure to put a lot of analysis about each of your Pokémon. People will underrate your team if they think that you have not put a lot of effort into it's creation (which you have, if you have followed this guide). Now you can fine-tune again with the new suggestions and edit your Rate My Team submission. Eventually, your team will peak, and no longer be able to do any better.

, Choose a different tier, a different strategy, or different roles. You can still use your old team in tournaments, but it is likely that you have got a bunch of great ideas from the multitude of teams you faced while fighting and want to try them out too. If you are especially pleased with your team, consider creating it (albeit imperfectly) in your game cartridge of Pokémon Black or White.

Buy Pokémon figures or plushes.,
Get a costume.,
Make Pokémon food and items yourself.,
Collect Pokémon cards.,
Join other fans!,
Play and watch Pokémon with your friends.",How to Become a Pokémon Trainer2," These can be bought online or at local toy stores. You can also purchase model Poké Balls so that you can pretend to be a trainer in real life! Choose one of your plushes as your starting Pokémon, and hide the others as ""wild Pokémon"" to be caught later.

, There are many Pokémon costumes available to you at local costume shops, Halloween stores, or online. Some Pokémon costumes, like Squirtle or Aipom, are relatively easy to make and can be a fun crafts project to do with friends. Once you have a Pokémon costume, you can ask a friend to be your Pokémon, or take turns practicing being a trainer as you explore your imagination.


A potential idea for a group costume is to dress up as Pokémon and trainers for a convention, costume party, or Halloween.

, These can be used as accessories to a Pokémon themed costume, or even as an accessory to your daily attire. Make Pokémon treats using fruit chews, Pez, and hard candies, to list a few examples. Label your Pokéfood in a baggy or container and reward your Pokémon with these for all its hard work.


Don't forget to reward your Pokémon for using the right moves. You should also remember the abilities your Pokémon has so you can coach them effectively in battle.

, You can buy packs of Pokémon cards at game or hobby stores, online, or at various other retailers. With these packs you can build a 60 card player deck, which you will fill with Pokémon cards, Trainer cards (cards with special effects activated by you, the trainer), and energy cards (cards used so Pokémon can perform attacks).You can purchase pre-made ""Trainer kits,"" or ""Theme Decks"" that have everything necessary to play, or you can build your own deck from scratch.

, There are Pokémon conventions, Pokémon card tournaments, and card markets. Look online or check local game or hobby stores to see if there are any local events you can join.


It can be fun to offer a duel to another player by starting off with a catchphrase, much like non-player trainers do in the game. Something like, ""My heart is beating for a battle!"" might get some laughs and earn you a new friend.

, An effective trainer should have a comprehensive knowledge of Pokémon strengths, weakness, and abilities. You and your friends can deepen your knowledge by watching Pokémon movies, the TV show, reading trainer manuals and so on.

Blissey is a good choice.,
Poison Pokémon are good stallers as well.,
Umbreon makes an awesome Wish passer, and can dish out Payback with Wish/Toxic/Payback/Guard Swap.,
Gourgeist-super with Phantom Force/Will-o-Wisp/Synthesis/Toxic can only be killed off by Heatran.

,
Run a Ground type to take care of Heatran, which can wall near everything on a stall team.

,
Fairies are basically the Arceus of taking a special hit, so use one.,
Finally, Milotic is a strong defensive choice.",How to Build the Ultimate Pokémon Team2," She can take even Close Combats and live, then cripple the opponent with Thunder Wave or slowly kill them with Toxic. However, it's a bad idea to let her take Focus Punch or Close Combat, so use a good physical defense Pokémon. If you choose Blissey, run Seismic Toss or a special move like Ice Beam or Flamethrower/Toxic/Soft-Boiled/Attract or Minimize.

, They can take Toxic and have 100 percent accuracy on it. Most get some attacking moves, and can usually only be walled by a good Steel Pokémon.

, Vaporeon is also good with Defense, and gains access to Acid Armor. Run Acid Armor/Toxic/Baton Pass/Calm Mind.

,,, Suggestion: Mawile. That thing, with the right EV spread, can take Earthquake and Blast Burn, Combined. Although, it does make a better physical sweeper than staller, but it gets Earthquake. Use it with Sucker Punch/Play Rough /Earthquake/Iron Head. Or, to be annoying, give it Sing instead of Sucker Punch. Run a Mawilite if you're in gen 6.

, Use Cute Charm to disable multiple attacks, and then run Surf/Ice Beam/Toxic/Recover to defeat near everything. Give it Leftovers or a sitrus Berry.

Read the rules that are used for Little Cup battles.,

Decide on your team.,

Breed the Pokémon you want for your team.,

Train the Pokémon that you bred.,

Give the Pokémon on your team the movesets and items that you want to give them.",How to Build a Little Cup Team in the Pokémon Games," In Little Cup, you can only use first-stage Pokémon that can evolve, except for any Pokémon that are banned from the tier. All Pokémon must be level 5. For a full list of rules used for Little Cup, see this Smogon ruleset.
, You'll want a team that has both offensive Pokémon and defensive Pokémon, including one that's built to set up field hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Once you decide on your team, decide on their movesets, held items, natures, abilities, and EV spreads. While most Pokémon caught at level 5 would have weak attacks such as Scratch and Tackle, that's not what you want here. Treat your team like you would any other competitive team - give them egg moves, Move Tutor moves, and/or TM moves. For example, a good moveset for Charmander would be Fire Blast, Ancient Power, Dragon Pulse, and Hidden Power., Preferably, you'll want at least 5 IVs at the maximum possible value of 31; at least 2 of them being the main stats you'll use. You'll also want a nature that benefits the Pokémon. Using the Charmander example again, you would want the 2 perfect IV values to be in Special Attack and Speed, with a Modest (increases Special Attack and decreases Attack) or Timid (increases Speed and decreases Attack) nature. The best way to get a 5 IV Pokémon would be to breed it with a Ditto holding a Destiny Knot (guarantees that at least 5 of the combined IVs from the two Pokémon being bred will be passed down to the baby) that has 6 IVs, but if you don't have one, you can use the power items. The power items guarantee that the Pokémon holding it will pass the IV of the stat down to the baby. This requires ""chain"" breeding, which you can also use to get egg moves. For the Charmander example, you would want to pass down perfect IV values in Special Attack and Speed using the Power Lens (passes down Special Attack) and the Power Anklet (passes down Speed). To pass down natures, have the Pokémon with the nature you want hold an Everstone, which will pass the nature of the Pokémon holding it to the baby., In Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, you don't have to gain levels to give your Pokémon EVs. By using Super Training, you can give your Pokémon EVs using training bags and regimens. For the Charmander example, you'll want to use the training bags and regimens that give Special Attack and Speed EVs. The higher level the regimen you play, the more EVs a Pokémon will get. Completing regimens will get you training bags, which you can use to increase your Pokémon's EVs. Once you're done giving your Pokémon EVs, you can use Rare Candies or wild Pokémon that give low amounts of experience to level your Pokémon up to level 5. In the earlier games, EV training a Pokémon to level 5 is much harder - you have to separate the experience between your party in a battle enough so that the Pokémon you're training doesn't get too much experience, though the vitamin items make it easier (albeit being expensive)., Many popular items used in competitive play, such as the Life Orb, Focus Sash, and ""Choice"" items (locks a Pokémon into one move while increasing Attack, Special Attack, or Speed) can be bought at a battle facility using Battle Points (BP) that you get from winning battles there. There will also often be Move Tutors, which can teach Pokémon moves that they wouldn't normally be able to learn otherwise. Take advantage of these, along with egg moves and TMs and HMs, to build your perfect Little Cup team."

The Pokeathlon.",How to Be a Pokémon Master," You'll also need a Nintendo DS, DS lite, DSi, DSi XL,3DS or a Game Boy.It is highly recommended to get at least one Generation VII game, Generation VII spin-off game, Generation VI game,Generation VI spin-off game,Generation V game, Generation V spin-off game, Generation IV game, and a Generation IV spin-off game (some examples of spin-off games are Battle and Get! Pokémon Typing DS and Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs). Generations I-III are played on the Nintendo Game Boy. The newest console you can play generation 1 and 2 games on is the Game Boy Advance SP, but Generation 3 games can be played on the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite. Starting in Pokémon HeartGold and Pokémon SoulSilver versions, you can catch almost all of the first 493 Pokémon and there has been almost no need for migrating since. Once you have gotten your game(s) and have chosen your starter Pokémon, go on to step 2.;
,, When you get some Poké Balls, catch some new Pokémon. They have to be wild ones, so head into some grass to randomly fight a wild Pokémon. Have your current Pokémon fight it, and weaken, but not defeat it. Once they are as weak as they can get, throw a Pokéball at the wild Pokémon. The less health has, the better chance the capture is successful. Once successful, you can use your new Pokémon immediately if you have an empty spot in your party. You have 6 slots in your party. Any Pokémon caught without an empty slot is transported to Someone's (soon to be either Bill's, Lanette's, Amanita's or Bebe's, depending on the version you chose) PC, which can be accessed at computers at a Pokémon Center.

, The above method is a good way to catch Pokémon. Now you have to train them! Have them battle against wild Pokémon and gain experience points. Make sure that you heal your Pokémon at Pokémon Centers in cities and towns. Pokémon Centers give their services for free. Also, go shopping at Poké Marts for important items that will help you on your journey. If you look at the statistics of your Pokémon, you can see how many experience points it takes for them to get to the next level. Every Pokémon defeated is worth some experience points for your Pokémon, and every level gained makes your Pokémon stronger.

, Every level gained makes your Pokémon stronger. But how much stronger? Take a look at the statistics screen. It should have Hit Points, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Hit Points indicate how much damage the Pokémon can take before fainting. Attack controls how powerful your Pokémon is with physical attacks, such as Giga impact or Outrage. Defense controls how much damage your Pokémon take from physical attacks, the more defense the less damage. Special Attack controls the strength of special attacks, like Ice Beam or Thunder Shock. Special Defense is like normal Defense, except against Special Attacks. (Note that in Red, Blue, and Yellow, Special Attack and Special Defense are simply one stat: Special.) Finally, Speed determines which Pokémon goes attacks first each turn.

, By playing the game, you should already figure out how the game is played. But you can go even further. Pokémon with higher speed get the first turn in battle, which can be very crucial. In battle, a Pokémon's moves have a chance of hitting the opponent. A Pokémon even has a chance of doing double damage with an attack, called a critical hit. Each attack has a Power Point usage count. This count determines how many times a Pokémon can use the attack. Attacks like Tackle have a high PP count, of 35. Stronger attacks, like Thunder, have a PP count of only 10. Make sure that you balance moves by choosing attacks that are efficient; Thunder is powerful, but you can only use it 10 times, and it is inaccurate. Thunderbolt is weaker, but you can use it 15 times, and it is very accurate.Remember if your Pokémon is out of power points for all moves, you start using a move called struggle Some types of moves are great against others (like water against fire); whereas certain moves are not very good against others (like fire against water).

, A status effect has a chance of happening in battle, and they have negative effects for the affected. These effects are: Paralysis, Burn, Poison, Freeze, and Sleep. When a Pokémon is paralyzed, their speed is halved and there is a 20% chance of being completely unable to attack that turn. When a Pokémon is poisoned, they begin to lose some HP each turn, until they are defeated. When a Pokémon is burned, their attack goes down slightly and they lose some HP per turn. When put to sleep, Pokémon cannot attack until they wake up at a random number of turns later. Finally, the most potent affliction is freeze. A frozen Pokémon cannot do anything at all until they thaw out. There are also other status effects, which are not immediately visible. These can overlap with the obvious ones, such as Sleep or Poison. These effects include flinching, in which the flinched Pokémon does not attack that turn, Confusion, in which the Pokémon has a chance of attacking itself, and others. Also, Pokémon with status conditions are easier to catch (sleep and frozen are more effective).

, That isn't good. So don't bother entering if you want to complete your PokeDex. DO bother yourself if you want to see how powerful a Pokémon really is. You can buy/earn helpful items such as HP Up, Rare Candy, Life Orb, and TMs! These items will make your Pokémon super powerful!

, Start battling trainers once your Pokémon have battled against wild Pokémon and get stronger. A trainer has stronger Pokémon than wild ones, and these Pokémon give more experience than wild ones. Some people assert that ""forcing"" Pokémon to fight each other is abusing them; what these people forget is that Pokémon are competitive and love to battle each other, so go ahead and battle to your heart's content! You can also battle your friends at any Pokémon Center, so grab your friends and see who's the best! You can get some great practice from this.

, What's a good Pokémon quest without some spelunking? If you see a mysterious cave, then by all means, go inside! If you see an abandoned power plant said to have a wild and wildly power Pokémon rampaging inside, then go inside it despite the pleas of the engineers! If you see a long tower leading up to the sky where the primal Pokémon of the sky that can easily tear you apart lives, then start climbing that tower! You won't get anywhere if you just stick to catching Pokémon that appear randomly in some National Park! Go adventuring, find some treasure, find some strong Pokémon, and some insanely strong Pokémon.

, In games where trading can be done with GTS Negotiations, try it. It's much easier than having to wait for a Pokémon in the GTS, and then getting a level 1 Pokémon., Gym leaders are the elite trainers, and they have stronger Pokémon than most trainers. There are eight gym leaders in a single region, and each leader has their own theme, such as Rock-types Brock of the Pewter Gym, Ghost-type Morty of Ecruteak City, Flying-type Winona of Fortree Gym, and Electric-type Volkner of Sunyshore City. Each gym leader gives you a badge, proving you beat him/her. Earn eight badges and you'll arrive at the Pokémon League, where the most powerful trainers hone their skills.

, Your region should have a group known as the Elite Four, the top four trainers of that region who preside over the Pokémon championships. It takes eight badges to prove your ready for the Elite Four. The Four follow a theme like the gym leaders, except they are just a little more lax on their theme type. The Elite Four must be fought right after the other, without breaks, unlike gym leaders who are fought when you get to their respective towns. Once you beat them, you are the best! Or are you?

, You didn't think that you're the first one to beat the Elite Four? You'll usually find out that your rival just made it to the Elite Four before you did, and he already took the cake. Or, you might get to the Elite Four only to realize that a well-trusted ally is the champion, leading to quite an interesting battle. No matter, what the case, the Champion is even stronger than the Elite Four, and usually has the most varied mix of Pokémon. Once you beat him/her, you are the best!

, Well, if you became the Champion, you are just a very, very powerful Pokémon trainer. If you want to be a true Pokémon master, you'll have to do a lot of things. You'll have to catch all the Pokémon. If you got far enough to beat the Elite Four, you should have enough money to buy the new Poké Balls, such as Ultra Balls, or the special balls like the Timer Balls or Quick Balls which are more specialized. You have a lot of Pokémon to catch; Pokémon researchers have found 802 Pokémon so far. You'll need to trade around for some of the rare Pokémon, like Meloetta. You'll also need to transfer the legendary Pokémon from original GBA games into Diamond and Pearl in order to have the complete set.

, There's more to Pokémon than just battling! There are also contests of coolness, cuteness, toughness, smartness and beauty! Enter your Pokémon into these contests and have them participate in three rounds. The first round, they get judged by the audience based on appearance and high statistics, based on the theme. The second round consists of a dance exhibition. The final round is a mock battle in which the point is to make the Pokémon look cool, cute, tough, smart, or beautiful when they use certain attacks. Winning these events will win you ribbons.

, If you can build a perfect Pokémon, and feel good afterward, then do it with your entire team! For help, click here.

, Now that you've won a bunch of ribbons, collected all 150 Pokémon in Red/Blue/Yellow, 251 in Gold/Silver/Crystal, 386 in Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/Fire Red/Leaf Green, 493 in Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver, 649 in Black/White/Black 2/White 2, all 721 Pokémon in X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, and all 802 Pokémon in Sun/Moon, became Champion, and trained a team of perfect Pokémon (if you did it), you can start being a true Pokémon Master! But wait, what if you want to be the Pokémon Master? Well, start competing against other Pokémon Masters in high-powered battles and contests. Take it to the next level, the 3-D consoles, in the Stadium, Colosseum, or even the new Battle Revolution and fight against pumped up trainers. Find the people who have both come out on top in being the Champion, capturing all the Pokémon, winning all the contests, maybe got to training the perfect Pokémon team, and won in the 3-D consoles to further separate the Pokémon Master from the Semi-Pokémon Master.And, if you can, be legit and don't cheat.

, In HeartGold/SoulSilver there is a new feature called the Pokeathlon, it is the words Pokémon and Triathlon because you select 3 Pokémon and do 3 events. There are 5 courses: Speed, Stamina, Power, Jump, and Skill. All of the Pokémon have base stats in each category and a maximum amount they can get. You can raise the base stat up to the maximum stat by using Aprijuice. There are ten courses total: The Snow Throw, the Pennant Capture, the Goal Roll, the Relay Run, the Hurdle Dash, the Disc Catch, the Lamp Jump, The Ring Drop, The Block Smash, and the Circle Push. What's cool about the Pokeathlon is your Pokémon can do good without being highly trained, just high evolution and lots of aprijuice. So what are you waiting for? Go out there and start your Pokémon experience. Tough battles and exiting challenges await you. Once you have become a master, remember to tell your friends to come here if they want to be masters. Now go out there and show the Pokémon world who you are!Now that you've defeated the Johto gym leaders you are ready to travel over to Kanto! To get to Kanto just go to Olivine city and go over to the Olivine port and talk to the man to get on the S.S. Aqua(only after you defeat the elite four) The ship only runs on Mondays and Fridays and your in Vermilion city. Or you can take the Magnet Train once you get the pass from Copycat.

, Blissey has the highest HP stat in the entire game, even with a pathetic defense stat, she'll most likely survive a physical hit. As well as that, competitive players will usually EV train Blissey's Defense so it is much more likely to survive a physical hit.

EV stands for Effort Value. Every Pokémon, when beaten gives effort values. When your Pokémon gains a level, every fourth effort point equals one point up in the respective stat, unless you've reach the maximum number of effort points for the Pokémon.

Communicate well.,
The reason that the word 'building' is usually omitted is that it is a long word to say when in the thick of combat.,
Create good custom classes.,
Be stealthy.,
Flank your enemies (or not).,
Don't camp for too long.",How to Win in Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer," Communicating in CoD4 is arguably more important than in any other FPS (first-person-shooter) on the market today, given the extremely small room for error given the speed and intensity with which the game moves. Most of your communications will be taken up with relaying or receiving locations or enemies or objectives. Here are a few maps where you need to know the names for certain locations-


Crash- The 'blue-room' or 'blue-building' is the building across from the crash site that has a blue interior, also distinguished by the amount of damage on the house, leading to it also being called the run down house/building etc. The other location of importance is the three story building located diagonally across from the blue-room. This will usually be referred to as the 'third-story', i.e.-
""Where is that sniper?""
""Third story, third story!"";
,


Cross Fire- First and foremost, controlling the sniping posts at either end of the street are paramount. These are usually referred to as- ""He's in the sniping building at the end of the street."" With it being expected that you can figure out what end of the map the majority of your forces are on, therefore being able to orient yourself accordingly. Another important area to control is the 'balcony-building' or just 'the balcony'. The balcony juts out from a second story building over the main street, giving whoever is there and unparalleled line of sight. Fortunately, this easily combated, as there is little cover on the balcony or the building attached to it. The third place is the second story building next to the balcony building, which is referred as the 'water-melon' shop.
You will pick up more lingo as you go along in game.

, If you're fighting close range combat, you wouldn't use a sniper rifle, now would you? Make sure that you choose or create a class that is set up for the kind of fighting you intend on doing. Here are the weapon classes listed from shortest to longest range-


Shotguns/Pistols
Sub-machine guns
Assault Rifles
Light machine guns
Sniper Rifles
Here are a list of good classes even the newest player can use that cover most types of combat-
M-16- M-16 w/ red-dot sight, M-9 w/ silencer, Perk 1-Claymores/RPGs, Perk 2-Stopping power, Perk 3-Deep Impact
Ak-47- AK47 w/ Grenade Launcher, M-9 w/ silencer, Perk 1-Attachment, Perk 2-Stopping Power, Perk 3-Steady Aim
Sniper- M40A3, M-9 w/ silencer, Perk 1-Claymore, Perk 2-Stopping Power, Perk 3-Deep Impact
Spec Ops- MP-5 w/ red-dot or silencer, Perk 1-Claymores, Perk 2-UAV Jammer, Perk 3-Steady Aim
Custom Class 1/2/3/4/5/6- M16 w/ ACOG, Side-arm= Deagle or M1911, Perk 1- Bandoiler or RPG, Perk 2- Stopping Power, Perk 3- Deep Impact. This class offers countless one-burst kills from the M16.

, Depending on the game mode, stealth can really help. Use a silencer, the Dead Silence perk, and the UAV Jammer perk. Use a sniper rifle, or the M14 with a Red Dot or ACOG sight if you intend on medium to long range firefights on large maps such as Backlot. Use flashbangs so that the enemy cannot see your position.


Use your knife. Knifing is the quietest attack method in Call of Duty 4.
Remember to silence your secondary weapon as well unless you want to get attention.

, Flanking has many benefits including the fact that: fewer enemies are attacking you, you are less likely to die, and because you will get more kills. You can also use a Light Machine Gun and get the attention of your enemies while someone else goes to flank.

, Enemies will either flank you, throw a grenade at you, flash/stun you, or shoot you shortly after you start camping. Only camp if you are using a Sniper Rifle, and have a claymore in order to not get flanked.

Run around: Once successful, repeat step 3 and run around the edge of the map.,
Watch your radar for targets.",How to Use a Sub Machine Gun Effectively in Call of Duty 4,"

Choose Bandolier for perk 1.
Choose UAV Jammer for perk 2. Using either Double Tap or Stopping Power is important to the P90. It has low damage (but very high fire rate), so adding damage or maxing out the fire rate will help kill faster. SMGs are usually very weak at long range. Using Stopping Power will help. That is, if you don't care about staying stealthy.



 


Choose either Dead Silence, Extreme Conditioning or Steady Aim for perk 3. Extreme Conditioning will help you sprint very far, Dead Silence keeps you stealthy and Steady Aim helps you with hip firing. SMGs already have high hip firing accuracy, so adding Steady Aim will help you dominate at close range, without needing to aim down the sight.





;
, When in ADS mode, you don't lose speed walking. So strafe and fire!

, Remember, SMGs are best at close range, and in a building, you should be able to dominate.

, If there is a battle in one part of the map, use the following tactic. Never go straight into a battle with an SMG. SMGs let you sprint fast and far. Try to go behind the enemy (by running around the battle) and flank them.

, Preferably find targets around the corners or camping.

Find out if LMG's are right for you.,
Next, decide what LMG is for you.,
Once you know which LMG you like the most, you are ready to create a class to support it.,
Learn the tactics- A LMG player has to be smart.,
Find your own style of play.,
Have Fun!",How to Use Light Machine Guns Effectively in Call of Duty 4," The LMG is the most awkward class of gun in the game. With a high RoF (Rate of Fire) clip size, and damage, it seems as though it would be an awesome class of weapon to use in close quarters. The reality is that most times they are best used at mid-mid long range because of the amount of kick (Recoil) they usually have. If you are a slow and methodical player who loves the systematic destruction of your foes, this class is for you.;
, There are three LMG's in the game; The M249 SAW, RPD, and M60E4. They all have drastically different characteristics. In example, the SAW with steady aim is nearly as accurate as the M4, and has an amazing RoF, it compliments well players that like to hip fire. The RPD is in the middle of the road, as it haves both decent damage and RoF. The M60E4 is inaccurate from the hip, but boasts the most shot-for-shot damage of any LMG and compliments very accurate players. Once you know what play style is for you, you are prepared to create a class.

, It is a smart idea to try to 'balance out' your guns performance, in example, if your gun does a massive amount of damage but low RoF, why put stopping power on it? Try double tap to balance out your guns stats. Here are a few examples of classes.-


Primary Weapon- M249 SAW, Attachment- RDS (Red Dot Sight) or grip, Pistol- Any, Perk 1- 3xFrag, Special Grenade x3, Second Perk- Stopping power (for normal)/Double Tap (Hardcore)/ UAV Jammer (Hardcore) Third Perk- Steady aim. This is an awesome class for both 'LMG Sniping' and running and gunning. With a grip this gun is as accurate as some SMG's, and with a RDS it has so little kick that you can pick of targets at long range, but be prepared to dump a barrel of bullets into someone; this gun has notoriously low damage. This is the preferred class of LMG for hardcore, but the second perk can be changed out for either double tap for a literally insane RoF, or a UAV jammer to be stealthy. Note- Don't use anything other than stopping power in Normal modes.
Primary Weapon- RPD, Attachment- RDS or grip, First Perk- Frag x3, Special x3, RPG, Second Perk- Stopping Power/Double Tap/Uav Jammer. Third Perk- Steady aim/Deep Impact. This is the most versatile of all LMG's. It has a decent damage output and RoF. In normal, it is best used with either RDS with stopping power and deep impact (My favorite RPD class) for range, or double tap and grip for close combat.In hardcore, using double tap or UAV jammer is great on this gun, I suggest grip and steady aim, but I have seen other classes with RDS, ACOG Scope, and Deep Impact work equally well.
Primary Weapon- M60E4, Attachment- Grip/RDS/ACOG, Pistol- Any, First Perk- 3x Frag, 3x Special, Claymore (For sniper class), RPG, Perk 2- Stopping Power/Double Tap/UAV Jammer, Perk 3- Steady aim or deep impact. There are really only 2 ways to use the M60; Long range or point blank. Long range M60 classes are very effective in hardcore. Try LMG sniping, using ACOG, double tap, and claymores. It only takes about two hits to drop someone, and if they get close....it is a LMG after all. The ACOG can be replaced with a RDS for closer range. Closer up, I like using the grip, with steady aim and double tap. This works in both normal and hardcore. In normal, you can always substitute stopping power for double tap, but this gun already does a lot of damage.

, It is best to be cohesive with a unit so they can point out targets for you. As the LMG takes so long to reload and bring up to its sights, it is necessary to know where your enemies will pop up at. Run with a partner so he can spot targets for you directly, or hang back, watch your radar (Or listen for hardcore) and provide long range support. Remembers- All your movements are slower with a LMG, so good intuition and foresight is a MUST.

, An LMG player is in a class of his/her own. At medium range, you're lethal; at close range, you're lethal; at long range - well, two shots and you're still lethal. Refrain from running around a lot, like an SMG gunner; and don't act like a sniper, either. From my point of view . . . LMG = raw firepower + ambush. Develop your own play style, but refrain from running around without cover - your gun's low mobility will let you down. I know player who perform ""assassination"" - barging into enemy pockets, blowing em all to kingdom come; high-speed sniping - and also ambushing. An LMG's very versatile.

, A good LMG user is devastating, able to pick off enemies from almost any range while not having to move much. They are good anywhere on the battlefield, from urban assault to locking down entire fields of fire in the open. Maybe you use the LMG because of the damage, or the style, or maybe you just hate reloading.

Pick out an attachment.,
Grenade Launcher: seems like a good choice but it has some drawbacks.,
Silencer: This can be useful to you if used correctly.,
Red Dot Sight: If the iron sight annoys you this is the perfect choice.",How to Use the M16 in Call of Duty 4," To pick the right one we need to think about how your going to use the gun in game. The M16 fires very accurate 3 round bursts, so using it at mid to long range would give you the biggest advantage and also give you room to breath if you miss. Knowing this, lets take a look at each attachment.;
, This is a close range attachment and we are using a long range gun, so if you find yourself in a situation where the launcher becomes useful you’ve made a mistake in choosing a spot. Not to mention its going to eat up a spot in your perks.

, You don't want a silencer when you get into 1v1 fights since it hurts your range. You do want the silencer when you peek through windows or perches to get pick kills.

, It doesn’t effect anything important on your guns stats so that gives it an advantage over the others.

Start out by using the default assault class until you reach level 4.,
For a second class, use an AK-47 with the same perks as the M-16 class.,
Once you unlock the M4 Carbine make a class with stopping power and steady aim.,
The G3 and M14 would be used more like an M-16 on big maps but if you put steady aim on them they become more like No-Scope weapons.,
The G36c is a very good gun due to its lack of recoil.,
The MP44 is pretty much a degraded AK-47.",How to Use Assault Weapons in Call of Duty 4," Once you reach level 4, create an M-16 class with a Grenade launcher or Special Grenade x3.(Flash-bangs blind your opponents but do not give hit indication. Stun grenades dramatically slow turn speed and give a hit indication.) For Perk 2 use stopping power or if you have a grenade launcher, use sonic boom but make sure you hit them in the head for a one burst kill. For Perk 3 use deep impact.;
, Use the M-16 for big maps like Overgrown, Countdown District etc. Use the AK-47 for small maps to medium maps like Vacant, Strike, Backlot etc.

, Use this class for medium maps such as Ambush, Backlot, and Pipeline. (The M4 has much lower recoil than the AK-47 making it more suitable for long range battles but the AK 47 does much more damage so it is better at closer range.)

, (Use with Bandolier, Stopping Power and Deep Impact.)

, Use with stopping power and steady aim, in a sub-machine gun fashion. Works well with silencers.

, It has lower or equal stats in every category, and it is not recommended that you use it unless you are attempting to unlock the Golden camouflage for the AK-47.

Try games that involve mind skills.,
Play Armadillo Run.,
Get into Tetris.,
Play Total War.",How to Use Video Games to Improve Your Brain Power," For example, Nintendo's game Brain Training is a non-game that challenges you to various mathematical puzzles and sees you scribbling answers directly into your machine using some sort of magic technology. Quite a gamble given that most games revolve around killing aliens and not ""adding some numbers together"", but it's proven extremely successful with various versions now available for Nintendo's DS and Wii consoles. Brain Training was designed by a prominent neuroscientist, and has the express purpose of improving your maths skills and helping you to remember things. With just a few 10-minute-a-day exercises, you'll be remembering your shopping and divvying-up restaurant bills in next to no time.;
, Armadillo Run has a relatively simple premise – get the armadillo into the hole by building platforms and what-have-you for him to roll about on. In practice, you'll find yourself inadvertently learning about physics and tensile strength and gravity and tension and all that other stuff you ignored in school because you were too busy doodling on the rude pages of your biology textbook. That's because Armadillo Run has a very accomplished physics engine, which accurately models the behaviour of rope, metal, rubber and cloth to aid you in your task. The sheer brilliance at work here is that Armadillo Run will get your noggin throbbing without you even noticing as it's outrageously good fun to boot.

, It seems that pretty much everyone has played Tetris at some point. It's that game where some blocks tumble from the sky and you have to use your spatial awareness skills to arrange them nicely so the screen doesn't fill up. Science boffins have actually done tests on peoples' brains when playing Tetris, and the results show that subjects' brain power increased the more they played. The trouble is that the game is getting on a bit these days, so if you're bored with it, there are modern-day equivalents that require the same degree of mental agility – look into Lumines, Meteos or Puzzle Quest. They're all the same sort of thing, packaged up nicely and a bit different, and each one will get you thinking…

, The Total War series of games is a classic example – they basically recreate full-on proper battlefields from the olden days, and force you into the shoes of a general in charge of all the little men. Get your head around massive concepts like strategy, tactics, planning and resource management in an attempt to out-wit and out-shine your opponent. It's like chess, but with more archers. Of course, the fact of the matter is that pretty much all video games require you to use your brain these days, whether you're using physics to negotiate a dystopian Orwellian future in Half-Life 2, solving ancient puzzles and what-have-you in Tomb Raider or simply surviving in a rich, ultra-detailed economy in deep-space trading simulator X3: Reunion.

You will want to select your spouse carefully because some spouses cannot be made into vampires. Ysolda is a favorite choice of spouse because of the unusual markings she gets from being made into a vampire, as well as her relative ease to convince to marry. She can be found in Whiterun in the market.;
, You will not be able to get the quest, “The Gift” if you are married to any of the following people: Aela the Huntress, Argis the Bulwark, Athis, Benor, Borgakh the Steel Heart, Cosnach, Derkeethus, Dravynea the Stoneweaver, Farkas, Ghorza gra-Bagol, Jenassa, Octieve San, Omluag, Perth, Romlyn Dreth, Scouts-Many-Marshes, Shahvee, Sondas Drenim, Stenvar, Torvar, Vilkas, Viola Giordano, or Vorstag.


Avoid marrying any of the people listed above.

, In order to get married you will need to speak to Maramal in Riften. He will open new dialogue options to your intended. If you do not already have an Amulet of Mara, you can also purchase one from him. Then wear it when speaking to your new beloved.

, In order to receive the quest “The Gift” you must first complete an undetermined number of side quests for the vampires of Castle Volkihar. At this time, there is no indication of exactly how many quests need to be completed before you can receive the mission from Vingalmo.If you do not receive the quest, even after performing many tasks for the vampires, you are likely married to an incompatible character. Double-check the list above.

, Vingalmo will give you the suggestion that you should turn your spouse into a vampire by using the Vampire’s Seduction skill. This skill will either automatically show up in your skills list upon receiving the quest “The Gift” or it will appear sometime during the next day. If you do not see it in your skill list immediately, use the in-game ability “Wait” to wait a total of 24 hours.


Do not speak to your spouse before you have the skill Vampire’s Seduction after you gain “The Gift” quest, as this can bug the rest of the quest and make it impossible to complete.

, Be careful as this power can only be used once an in-game day. Once you have used it on your spouse you can bite them and effectively turn them into a vampire. Do not use the Vampire’s Seduction power on your spouse while he or she is sleeping.

, Once your spouse has entered the change from human to vampire you can return to Vingalmo to finish the quest. Finishing the quest will make the Vampire’s Seduction power permanent.

Take a look at the current map. Size, how many players, what type of map it is ( be it urban, open scape, closed hallways indoors), and your play style all must come into play with this.
The heavy machine gun is a great weapon, but only under a select few circumstances. first off, if you're in a free for all map, then you will reign if you find a nice corner and sit down with a hard hitting, fast firing, 200 round machine gun, pounding countless rounds into people spawning and running around corners.
Try using a sub machine gun or an automatic shotgun if you're in a tight quarters map. Pump shotguns are too slow when risking getting more shots off, hence auto shotguns give you the ability to rake down hallways with lead, leaving whatever poor soul is stuck in front of you to be mowed down.
Sub-machine guns are great since in the FPS world, their accuracy at full automatic is relatively the same when you run just as if you are standing still, giving you the advantage of strafing, jumping, ducking, without the loss of accuracy with an assault rifle.
The assault rifle and sniper rifle are top choices for more urban or open ended maps. The accuracy and range of the assault rifle is perfect for blasting people at 60 yards (54.9 m) with 3 or 4 shots to the body or a stray to the face. Also take note that when you move your accuracy goes down the drain, especially when jumping, you can almost always destroy an opponent by standing still or crouching and not moving. With an enemy jumping all over the place you may get hit 1 or 2 times, but with you planted your firing rate and accuracy will be on top of them, pounding them with rounds before they even hit the ground. Moral of the story: plant yourself and let loose that itchy trigger finger on people who want to jump and jive.
The sniper rifle is self explanatory. Just make sure you have a nice vantage point, preferably slightly below your enemy, when people see sniper fire they usually suspect it from coming from top windows and on top of buildings, being dominated time to time from these alley snipers can teach you to do just the same.;
, Most the guides and tips always say explosives are horrible to use, which is not always as true as it seems. Most reasons that people don't like them are because they're cheap. When shooting someone with a grenade, it is surely going to get them pissed, but they can do the same to you. Winning is all you care about, not how you play. Other players can whine calling you a ""noob"" since you use an underslung grenade launcher or rockets. Hey, free kills, they can cry all they want, but when you're sitting at first place, you can laugh in their face.


Spamming grenades only rarely works, and if it does, it has to be the right circumstance, such as enemy spawns, hallways, and tight buildings. You can always use grenades, they work best for a flush maneuver.
Mines are just as good, just remember where you plant them so you don't step on your own bomb. If you are a sniper and sitting in a house, you should place mines in the entrance of the house, in case an enemy comes in.
Rockets and underslung grenade launchers reign supreme when it comes to explosives. The ability to do heavy splash damage over a large distance is suburb. You can almost always use the underslung grenade launcher in call of duty 4 and battlefield 2. After a few weeks of play you'll be able to hit targets at over 100 yards (91.4 m) in the face with a nice underslung. It's all about practice, remember to stand still when you fire, you get the hang of the distance and the way you fire as you play.

, Here's a few tactics that can be applied and that most of the time let you get the drop on enemies:


The Flush: this tactic is superb when you get an enemy that loves to camp hallways and rooms. It's a simple tactic that, almost always works. First you have to know where your opponent has decided to camp. Next get out a grenade. strafe past the doorway/hallway and let your grenade go behind him, chances are, since they can't see it, they'll move forward, either jumping or sprinting to get away from that 3 second fuse. At that time, as soon as you loose the grenade and are past the doorway, take out your main weapon and charge in firing in bursts, most likely he'll catch the first few rounds in the face and he's trapped between your weapon and the grenade behind him
Baiting: this tactic not only works, but also, it always can grant you a few laughs! And it's extremely simple. Locate a group of enemy's, shoot one or two rounds and let them see you, then slip out around the next corner and wait. Sure they'll expect to see you there, but most players will still be shocked to see a rifle in their face! Pull the trigger for some easy kills. You can rack up 10-15 points a round with this beauty. Consider using a heavy machine gun, just so you don't have to reload and superior fire power. Another effective weapon is the land mine in this situation, just be out of range when it goes boom. You can also go around and get some kills from behind, as they won't usually expect you to go around.
Breaching, is much like the flush, but instead of explosive grenades, you use a flash bang grenade to stun your enemy and blind them. Leaving them most likely to blind fire a few rounds. This gives you the best advantage. Being able to see! Follow the same routine as the flush.

, Be quiet as you can when you move. Don't rub up against the wall, watch where you step, and keep your equipment quiet.


As you turn a corner, your body should be planed at an angle so as not to expose any part of your body other than your eye and muzzle, which move as one.






The first thing your opponent should see is just a piece of your eye and the muzzle of your weapon (if you are using one) sighted in on them.







, Concealment hides you, cover stops bullets. Use cover and concealment whenever possible. Do not ""crowd"" cover. Crowding cover, risks the chance of a piece of equipment peeking out, and decimates the chances of being hidden.

, Be sure to have a route to this new cover, as getting shot is frowned upon in many cultures.

, Maintain good use of cover and concealment and take a slice of a corner at a time. This means, that you should move as slowly as possible, when turning or looking around a corner, while at the same time, not staying in a place too long.

, Your opponent is probably not trained, unlike you will be, and there is a chance that your adversary will miss when you have distance between the two of you. Maximize it if you can, because distance favors the trained shooter. Any idiot with a weapon can shoot at 18 feet (5.5 m).

, Visually, we tend to search in horizontal bands which creates problems in that you don't see what is in the foreground and background of the horizontal band you are searching. Instead, search in vertical bands. Search from the tips of your shoes to the horizon, then shift your stance a little to the left or right, and rinse, then repeat.


Know that you may not see entire person. Look for anomalies, then remember where you saw them. Continue searching, the go back to the anomalies. If they are not there repeat your search.







, Knowing what to look for is important, if your adversary is concealed. Look for these:


Toe of boots. Fact of life, people don't watch where their feet are. Well, not that often.






Elbows. Usually, people don't mind their elbow, because it is not a place that commonly comes into contact with surfaces.






Equipment such as hats. Chances are, if it's not part of your body you aren't watching what that thing is doing.







, Smell is usually a dead giveaway if you are downwind. Cigarettes, alcohol, Body Odor, or strong scents like aerosols or food can give you or your opponent can give you away.

Pulling and Releasing.",How to Play Call of Duty 4 on Veteran Difficulty," If you don't have a full magazine and you go running into combat, you're going to be either dead or lucky. The majority of the time it's the first one. Reload when you can so you don't have to do it in a combat situation.;
, The most basic rule of modern combat, if you don't take cover, you're going to get hit, and if you get hit in the Veteran mode for more than 1 second, then you're going to die. Call of Duty 4 utilities an engine that conveys realistic physics so you can penetrate weak cover. However, unlike multiplayer, the enemies in the campaign cannot penetrate ANY cover. Use this to your advantage. If you are struggling to hit an enemy, take careful note of his position and kill him through your thin cover without having to worry about getting shot. Go prone. If you go prone and slowly edge around your cover, then the enemies will hardly notice you, assuming that the enemy is at eye level.

, Fully automatic fire-like in real life- causes recoil and wastes ammunition, but controlled bursts aimed correctly at the head are far more efficient. Use your iron/red-dot sight to get a shot then pull back the trigger and quickly release it to fire a burst.

, Something that Call of Duty 4 lets you do that other games don't is the option to throw back Fragmentation grenades. Always try to throw back grenades otherwise they may explode, and you can get severely injured or killed. On Veteran difficulty, the enemies have an almost infinite supply of grenades so don't be afraid to throw them back.

, Using a flash-bang grenade is very useful when you want to stun enemies, clear a building, evade or just to use them as a decoy. Flash-bang grenades are non-lethal, but they blind and deafen enemies temporarily so you can go in for the kill. When used in conjunction with a shotgun or knife it's quite deadly.

, Besides, your primary weapon you have a secondary and a melee weapon. Switching to your secondary weapon is always faster than reloading your primary weapon when in a tough spot. The Pistols in this game pack a major punch and are quite deadly. There have been players who have eliminated entire squads of enemies with a pistol. The knife is a melee weapon that kills in one hit. Keep in mind that when you finish your knifing motion your weapon won't be available for a second and that's all it takes for enemies to neutralize you.

, There are a variety of explosives in COD 4 ranging from Fragmentation grenades to air strikes. The Fragmentation grenade is mainly used to clear buildings, eliminate large groups of enemies or flush enemies out. It can also ricochet off walls. The M203 grenade launcher can be used on infantry, or on infantry gunships which can potentially leaves fewer enemies to fight.

, Sniper Rifles can be found in numerous positions around levels, and an experienced player can take out multiple squads. The best strategy is to go prone in a hidden area (preferably high up) and aim for head shots.

, Remember the message you receive on the first mission: ""You're Hurt! Get to Cover!"" It is imperative that you follow this instruction here because checkpoints are sparse so dying isn't the best idea.

, You can use every strategy in this 'How to' and not be successful until you realize a lot of stages have units that will NEVER stop respawning. No matter how many you kill and how thin you think you're making their lines, they'll be back before you can fully advance. Be prepared to get creative. Gas grenades and just being plain crazy are two ways to get around the infinite respawn.

, Although checkpoints can sometimes be sparse, they are your best asset in beating the hardest levels. How do you reach a hard checkpoint? Use some of the tips above. Also keep in mind being crazy might just work. (See the next step)

, Why does being crazy sometimes work in your favor? If you run ahead through fire, dive behind some cover and stay there, that might get you past the hardest stages in COD4. This is true for two reasons. (1) Your team is invincible and will never die. (2) Your team only advances as far as you do. Using these two facts together, if you advance hard and fast, so will your team. Eventually, if you wait long enough ahead of them, they'll advance slowly and steadily, killing everyone along the way, and will eventually catch up with you. Soon after your screen should say you reached a checkpoint.

, Call of Duty 4 has an auto-aim feature like past Call of Duty titles. Clicking the ""aim"" button whilst the cross-hair is near an enemy will get it automatically centered on the enemy. Use this often as it is a great way of neutralizing a squad.

The typical way to kill someone with a sniper rifle is to look down the scope, and wait for targets to enter your cross hairs.,
Quickly tap the button to look down the scope, and fire the trigger simultaneously.,
Choose the best gun.,
Decide what perks you will use.,
Decide what equipment you will use.,
Choose the sensitivity you should use?",How to Quick Scope on Call of Duty 46," Quick scoping, on the other hand, does not require the need to look down the scoop.


The snipers will typically run around, with the sniper in hand, an attempt to kill you without looking down the scope.

, By looking down the scope for a split second, the gun becomes very accurate. By firing instantaneously, the bullet will be shot in the direction that it was pointed at, utilizing the full power of the sniper rifle. These are typically one-shot kills, which can be huge advantage in games such as search and destroy.

, The best class to use is a sniper rifle with either the Intervention or the Barrett 50 cal. The most used gun is the Intervention, though it is very possible to do with the Barrett 50 cal.


Make sure you have FMJ on it. It is necessary for you to get a one-shot kill, because you will likely be killed if you do not kill the other person in one shot. For this example, let's assume that you are going to be using the intervention with FMJ. Your secondary weapon can be whatever you choose. Typically you would use a handgun such as the M9.

, With quick scoping, there are a few essential perks that you need to have enabled.


The most important perk of all is sleight-of-hand. This will be in the first lot of the perks; it is essential for you to look down the barrel very quickly.
The second perk is entirely up to you, but one that is typically used is stopping power. Stopping power in combination with FMJ ensures a one-shot kill 80% of the time.
The third perk that you should consider using its steady aim. This can help hip-fire shooting, which may help your quick scoping efforts. Many people do not like to use this, but some do. If not, ninja is also a very good perk.

,


Most snipers who quick scope uses a throwing knife as their equipment. If they miss the first time with their intervention, the throwing knife can save your life very quickly. It is thrown almost instantaneously, and always a one-hit kill.

, What comes to your character sensitivity, it must be a balance between control and speed.


You want it fast enough for you have quick reactions toward people.
low enough to where you can control it in a matter that is very accurate.
When not quick scoping, some keep their sensitivity set on insane, but when quick scoping it is usually set it one notch higher than the ""high"" setting. Some find this a great balance between the two problems, and perfect for quick scoping.

Get the correct perks and weapons.,
Choose your perks.,
Find a correct sidearm for your weapon.",How to Play Call of Duty 4 the Stealthy Way1," You'll also need good attachments for your weapons. When being stealthy the best weapon for ground war (excluding sniping) stealth would be the MP5, which is a SMG weapon.

There are a lot of different attachments and perks to use. When using the MP5, the best attachment you can have would be the silencer. Using the silencer will cause everyone in the game to not know where you are or shooting from. Plus, you will not appear on the enemies' radar with the silencer.



 

;
, When choosing your perks, be smart - using the perks as followed would be good when using your MP5 silenced.

For the first perk it's a good idea to use the Bandolier perk. Although the MP5 is an excellent weapon in Call of Duty 4, it may run out of ammo pretty quickly. It depends on your style of play and shooting. If you don't need the Bandolier perk (you conserve ammo and/or find ammo along the way) then Bomb Squad is a useful perk. It will allow you to see enemy claymores and C4 and avoid them. It's essential to avoid them, since shooting and blowing them up will alert enemies to your presence.






For the second perk use UAV Jammer. Not using this will negate the use of a silencer as the enemy will inevitably acquire a UAV and discover your location anyway. Don't make the mistake of using Stopping Power, as this defeats the purpose of using a stealth kit in the first place. The whole point is to sneak around the back and kill your target before they know what's hit them.






For the third perk it is very wise to choose the Dead Silence perk. Using this will just add more of the stealthier style to your class, because you will be completely silent when moving with this perk. Using Extreme Conditioning is also a good idea as you'll be able to sneak around a lot quicker, giving you an edge. When sneaking up on a group, simply crouch, as this works the same as Dead Silence and makes you less of a target.







, (A sidearm is a pistol.) Probably one of the best weapons for the stealthier class would be the m9 with a silencer. This is because the m9 and mp5 use same ammunition, so instead of starting out with 90 bullets you will start out with 120. Make sure you are using a silencer on your pistol or it will reveal your location to the enemy.

If no one is coming, leave the area. When becoming stealthy with a SMG or fully automatic weapon you will not want to camp for too long (or not at all if possible). You will want to stay somewhere, shoot, kill, and leave that area. Even though you will not be seen, it is not smart to stay in one area if you want to get kills, because when being stealthy you will need to take your time. The kill cam also ruins staying in one place, since enemies you recently killed will know where you are, and might throw a grenade right onto you.

, When you actually shoot someone you will want to stay in that area shortly to wait for other enemies to come, due to your enemies' fire. If someone doesn't come soon, you can leave the area.

, This is smart when you're being stealthy in Call of Duty 4 with an SMG or fully auto weapon, simply because you will not be seen or heard by them.

, Doing this will either get you sniped or spotted by the enemy and followed without you knowing.

Use a bolt sniper rifle which are the M40A3 and the R700.,
Choose the perks:


Bandolier (Chances are, you will miss most of the time.),
Equip an ACOG scope, as it will increase damage. ,
Use a no scope trick such as strafe shot, crouch shot, prone shot, weapon-switch shot, g-shot, etc.,
Practice on a private match, on a wall.

",How to No Scope on Call of Duty 4," Do not choose a semi-auto, as you will end up spamming bullets!;
,
Stopping Power (For one shot killing. If you play on hardcore, use Sleight of Hand.)
Steady Aim (To increase hip-fire accuracy which is the whole idea of no scoping.)

,, Everyone has different preferences. These tricks can be considered 'exploits', as they take advantage of the fact that there are certain times where the bullet is closer to the center when you no scope.


Strafe shot - As soon as you no scope, move sideways. You might want to accompany this with a fast movement of the gun.






Crouch shot - As soon as you no scope, crouch down. You must do this almost simultaneously.






Prone shot - Just go to prone position before firing, because the cross hairs are the smallest when you are in prone.






Weapon-switch shot - Press the 'weapon switch' button two times quickly, then shoot when the cross hairs shrinks to its smallest position






G-shot - Move sideways, then shoot when the cross hairs shrinks to its smallest position.

Little Building.,
The building in-front of the train derailing.,
Power plant.",How to Play on the Map Pipeline on Call of Duty 4," The train derailing is a place where there a many train carts just sitting there. These are obvious places for campers, and snipers alike. They provide both cover and a somewhat invisibility check. Further on back are some barge-crates which again are ideal for campers, so if you go in this are(especially during Free-For-All) watch out for campers.;
, These buildings are filled with nifty yet hidden spots for snipers to hide so watch your back, and be sure to do a full clearing whenever you go up into one. For starters, there are three buildings all lined up in a triangle. The building that is at the point of the triangle, is greeting spot to be killed by snipers. Other than that, there is really nothing in there. The building that is on the right side, is the bigger building that features numerous ground coverage, along with offices that provide cover, and four different sniper spots. Along with a in-ground walk way to a building on the other team's side of the map, or your side. Depending on your starting position.Now the building on the left, has the most conflicts to occur in it that I've seen. It is the middle one in spaciousness, but it has two broken down cars, an office building(with a ladder leading up to what most lower leveled people do not know, is an upper deck to the building that can be probable position for snipers, and can also lead out onto the roof for a good sniping spot, and good viewing point for optional reasons.

, There is a hill that is also a very good sniping point to locate at, seeing is it is inflated tall weeds and a view split trees right down the middle, making this a breathing ground for snipers, but if one is blessed enough from the opposite team, they can get themselves quite a few kills if they get to the hill.

, There are also two silos that provide camping coverage and as well as running coverage. You can easily lose a tail chaser if you manage to weed through the silos.

, There are also some electric grids over on the far side, or west side, and they provide instant protection, and without resorting to a camper either, so you can freely hide behind these and not be a camper.

, There is also a little building that is near the train derailing where assault people tend to flock, and wait for enemies to run by on the walk path below. But be careful when you're in here, cause the walk way from the right hand side building leads into hear, and also people will shoot back from the walk path below, and the door is open behind you.

, Before the little building there is a small office, where there is not much cover, but it is dark and provides protection, unless one has the night-vision on.

, In the deep part, past the hill is a power plant that is seldom used, considering not many people hide behind there or ever go back there, except when first spawning and then never spawn back there.

Many find a 'run and gun' technique to work wonders on Search and Destroy, mainly for the shock factor, as not many expect it. However, you do need to be very skilled to pull this off, if you're not, then camping near the bombs while defending works wonders in some cases. If you're cautious, plant Claymores at A/B and then camp near the bare bomb location.;
,, The M16 with red dot is good when fighting someone from a distance. Camping with ANY gun WILL make you look like a scrub.

, Its good to be against a wall or crouching in a bush.

, Keep confidence, your team isn't relying on you as much as you feel and remember; It's just a game. If you're defusing, be sure to find a spot close to one bomb(A/B), yet a spot where you can see the other bomb. This way, you'll either see them running to one bomb, or planting at the other.

, Maybe t-bag a little or flash your night vision on or off, if you want to look like a scrub. Have some respect for the other team, and they'll have respect for you. Don't look like a jerk by teabagging things, just play the game. It takes 5 seconds to plant and defuse a bomb. It takes one second to pick up the bomb so watch out.

, After planting the bomb, throw some C4, so when someone is defusing, they are killed, and you don't give away your position. Then there is one guy down, and you haven't given away your position. Don't make your C4 obvious. Maybe throw it under something, just as long as it's well hidden but still in range.

, People will call you a noob, but who cares? You have 50 more exp for being a ""Noob"". People just don't like the fact that it is too easy. This is an example of terrible advice. The Grenade Launcher is a very helpful thing, but on Search and Destroy it is a way to get easy kills, which nobody likes. You want to learn to be GOOD at Search and Destroy, this won't help. It is a very easy way to get at least 400 points per game, but they will make you largely disliked amongst the players. Alternatively, take an RPG, as these are just as powerful, yet don't make you look as ""noobish"".

Prestige!",How to Improve Your Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer Game," The classes are assault, special ops, heavy gunner, demolitions, and sniper. Each one has different weapons and perks, which will be described momentarily. Try to find your strength.


Assault is a fairly balanced class, allowing fast-paced action and intense firefights. If you are new to Call of Duty, it is probably your best bet.
Special Ops is a stealthier class. With a lighter primary weapon, you will move slightly faster and run slightly longer. The sub-machine gun (SMG) has a high rate of fire, though, so watch your ammo consumption.
Heavy Gunner is a squad-support class. With the powerful M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), a skilled gunner can mow down an entire line of advancing enemy troops. If you play as a HG, try to find a second-story vantage point within close range of the hotspots. Think of it as being a close-range sniper.
Demolitions is an underrated class, but can be very powerful. With a high-capacity shotgun, the Demolitions class can storm an enemy-held building with a small team and quickly clear it, minimizing damage to his/her team. But be careful, because the shotgun has a short effective range and will lose power dramatically as the buckshot travels farther. That being said, don't be afraid to try it! Demomen (As they're called) are in short supply, and can really dominate on small maps. The shotguns can also rip through walls at close range, damaging enemies on the other side.
Finally, Sniper is a personal favorite of mine. You unlock the Sniper class at Level 8. (Don't worry, budding sharpshooters, you will progress through the early levels quickly.) Armed with a powerful scoped rifle, you have the ability to deliver death to your enemies from a great distance, and then disappear. Like in the single player campaign, the scope will waver about the screen unless you hold in the left analog stick to hold your breath. On Eastern European maps (SAS vs. Spetznaz) any character with a sniper rifle as their primary weapon will spawn with a ghillie suit, allowing them to hide in the bushes and snipe to their heart's content.;
, By now you've played a few games, and found different weapons and perks that work especially well for your playing style. The only problem is that they're spread over the different classes! Pick a gun you like, give it a camo pattern you like, and pick your perks! Don't worry, you can go back and change these settings anytime between matches. And with 5 slots open for customization, you can make your experience as unique as you want.

, Perks can change the tide of a game. It's vital that you find the right combination of perks that gives you an advantage.


Slot 1 Perks affect your Inventory. They give you extra things to carry (Except Bomb Squad). Try to base this perk on both your playing style and the game mode. NOTE: If you have a grenade launcher as your primary weapon's attachment, the Slot 1 Perks will not be available.
Slot 2 Perks are passive abilities. These are things that are constantly in effect and allow to enjoy things such as faster reloading, higher health, higher bullet damage, etc.
Slot 3 Perks are active abilities. They give you a noticeable edge on the battlefield. For instance, everyone will know if you have martyrdom enabled, because you will drop a live grenade when killed.

, In the Barracks menu, there will be a sub menu chock full of challenges to complete. Some are easy, requiring you to do no more than call in support. Others are absurdly difficult, and may require the help of a friend on the other team. Don't forget these. All of them give valuable experience points (XP). The weapons challenges are particularly good, because when completed, they unlock accessories and camo patterns for the gun you completed the challenge with! Scoring so many kills with a gun will unlock a new accessory for it. Scoring a certain number of headshots with a weapon will unlock a new camo pattern.

, Your gun is meant to be customized, and you won't last long if you leave it uncustomized. Apply an accessory to increase its lethality and an appropriate camo pattern to help your gun blend in with the map.

, Grenades are an important part of gameplay, especially on smaller maps. Remember that if a grenade lands next to you, you can pick it up and throw it back if you're quick enough. To avoid this happening to you, cook your grenades before you throw them. To do this, hold down the right shoulder button (You can only cook frag grenades), but don't release it just yet. You will see your crosshairs start to pulse; you have five pulses before the grenade explodes. Cook it until the third pulse (Four if your target is nearby or your really daring.) and release the shoulder button.

, Some of the multiplayer maps are taken from the single player mode, and if you play them normally, you get an idea of what enemy AI will do, where they will fall back to, etc. BUT DON'T rely on this; online opponents are not AIs.

, Try to play on all the maps, so you know where everything is on each map. The best sniper spots, possible choke points, where the flags are in Domination mode, where the HQs spawn in Headquarters, where the bomb points are in Search and Destroy, etc. Just don't play on private servers too long; you don't earn ANY XP, no matter how well you play.

, This way, you know what you're good at and what you need to improve on. Every once in a while, leave the Team Deathmatch lobby and go play a round of Sabotage. Remember, you gain XP faster on some game modes!

, It may seem boring, but you see exactly where your killer was when he popped you. Who knows, you could ambush him there, or get him from that same spot later in the match!

, Don't get discouraged when you see that you aren't leveling up as fast as you were before. Leveling takes time. Trust me, the rewards are worth it.

, When you top out at Level 55, you can make a choice. you can continue playing at Level 55, or you can begin Prestige mode. If you go Prestige, you will begin at Level 1 again, losing all of your equipment and perks. To compensate for this, you get a neat little icon next to your name where your rank symbol used to be. You can go Prestige a maximum of 10 times, getting a cooler icon every time.

M40A3 Recommended






Pros: High Power and Accuracy, Low Recoil. Cons: MUST be used with stopping power if not in HC.

Pros: Semi-Auto, Good Accuracy, Low Recoil, Can be used in CQB situations. Large headshot hitbox.
Cons: Low-Medium Power, Most players will become agitated upon being killed by the M21



Dragunov






Pros: Semi-Auto, Medium-High Power. Large headshot hit box.
Cons: Medium recoil makes some players uncomfortable when attempting to land a followup shot.



R700






Pros: High Power and Accuracy
Cons: Medium-High Recoil, 4 bullet magazine compared to 5 on the M40A3. 1 shot kill is as unlikely as the M40A3 when not using stopping power.



Barrett .50cal






Pros: Semi-Auto, High Power, Large magazine, highest bullet penetration in the game. Combining this and Deep Impact will allow you to hammer through walls. Looks and sounds amazing.
Cons: Kicks up and to the right like a mule. Highest recoil in the game.

Understand the perks.",How to Get Good Sniper Fire in Call of Duty 45," It's almost a free pass to your favorite sniping spot. Depending on the game mode, you'd either want to overwatch an objective, or a hot spot. The bridge in Overgrown could be considered a hot spot in Domination.

, Bolt action snipers (M40A3 and R700) are highly recommended for campers, the M40A3 more so than the R700. This is due to the one-shot-kill damage stat. The Barret .50 Cal is still a viable option, yet not so much as the M40A3. Which sniper you use is up to you, the M40A3 has one more bullet but the R700 (supposedly) does more damage. This is false. All sniper rifles do 75 base damage. The multipliers are what really makes them different.

, For traditional campers, perk one should be claymores, perk two should be stopping power (normal match) or UAV jammer (hardcore), and perk 3 should be Extreme Conditioning, Steady Aim (for random CQC encounters, or Deep Impact if the map has a lot of cover points. For stealth campers, perk one should be bandolier. You will be moving a lot, so claymores will just convince you to stay, thus defeating the entire purpose of your class. Perk two should be UAV Jammer (hardcore) or Stopping Power (normal match), and perk three should be Extreme Conditioning or dead Silence.

Mobile sniping is VERY hard.",How to Get Good Sniper Fire in Call of Duty 46," Do not even bother to attempt this in Core, as the lack of Stopping Power will make it impossible to achieve any real success. If however you want to try it anyway, the Dragunov is the gun to use in Core. M21 should only be used in Hardcore. You MUST know the map. Learn it better than the developers. Learn where the unused routes are, the tricky lines of sight to a common camping spot. Playing a mobile sniper is almost like playing a stealth sniper. In fact, it's exactly like it."

First become familiar with the game and the basic concepts of fighting and moving.,
Become familiar with your weapons.,
Learn how to use grenades.,
Become familiar with using your radar.,
After that, begin to train yourself how to respond to certain situations.,
Practice taking cover!,
Bearing in mind the above points, begin to develop a strategy that suits you.",How to Dominate in Multiplayer Call of Duty 4," It's recommended that you beat the single player before attempting to fight online.;
, Learn how each weapon shoots and their details. For example does your weapon have a high rate of fire? What is its level of recoil? How long does it take to reload? Is it best in close quarters or at a distance? Knowing the answers to these questions can help prepare you to choose the best weapon for your particular situation.

, Stun and frag grenades are especially useful against multiple enemies in a tight, enclosed setting, such as a building in the Headquarters multiplayer mode.

, The radar is an essential tool which can show where your enemies are, and is especially useful in Free-for-All matches online. But remember the radar only shows where people are if they fire their weapons; if they have silencers on their guns they are essentially invisible to radar.

, If an enemy is rushing into a building in which you are hiding, do you start taking fire? In order to become good you need to be able to respond to these situations with split second reflexes and accurate decisions that will help save you and your teammates but will still defeat your enemies.

, Learning to take cover is one of the most important tools in the game. If you are getting shot, taking cover behind a wall can save your life. But remember that certain surfaces can be penetrated by bullets (which can be used to your advantage). For example if your enemy hides behind a thin concrete wall, you can finish him off through the wall; your bullets will give him less damage, but you should still be able to finish him off fairly quickly.

, If you're a sniper, train yourself to head to good sniper spots and be patient. If you prefer to rush straight into the battle, learn how to rush, shoot from the hip, and use grenades.

,, when you fire an un-suppressed gun, you will appear as a small red dot on enemy radar and on a map that is pulled up by an enemy before he calls an air strike. Firing a suppressed gun does not make you appear on enemy radar.

, You will remain invisible to enemy radar when an enemy calls in a UAV, which reveals the location of certain enemies for a period of about 30 seconds.

, AS SOON AS RED JETS APPEAR ON YOUR RADAR, GET INDOORS IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE AN ENEMY AIR STRIKE IS COMING IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS. Green jets are O.K. because that is a friendly airstrike and it can't kill you (unless friendly fire is on).

, It takes a lot of bullets, but it can be destroyed. It is recommended that you have an RPG on your team so he can destroy it easily.

,, Find the one you like. I personally like the MP5 with a Silencer 3 Flashbangs or Stun Grenades for Perk 1, Stopping power or Sleight of Hand (faster reloading) for Perk 2, and Martyrdom or Last Stand for perk 3.

, Avoid sprinting the whole lot, since its pretty easy shooting a linear moving foe.* No cover? Do the following drill, sprint->Jump->crouch->sprint, impossible to get a clean torso/headshot.

When an enemy is at very close range, you probably won't get a chance to ADS (Aim Down Sights) so fire off the hip, try not to use a whole clip though otherwise you may run out of ammo whilst on a streak or when in need of it.
Double-tap and stopping power both multiply their respective attribute by 1.4. This means that a gun shooting an already powerful round, will benefit more from double tap, and that a fast gun benefits more from stopping power.
When 'camping' in a building, use the element of surprise to your benefit. Don't stay in the same spot.
Dodging enemy sniper fire is done easily by sprinting, jumping, ducking then sprinting further. Do it when you're about 75% of the total path. It helps not getting shot in the chest, which would result in your death.
Unless an enemy is at close range, shoot in bursts (3-4 bullets).
Know what you're doing. The better the players, the more a game gets chess-like properties. That means you have to plan moves ahead, and keep their possible moves in mind. (Example: You're lying prone 'camping' by a doorway. Somebody can easily throw in a grenade and kill you before you get away.)
Try keeping your Kill Death Ratio above 1, it will help you finding a productive playstyle, keeping balance between playing defensive and offensive.

Equip the Hand Cannon or Shotgun.,
Use the vigor Murder of Crows to slow down the Handyman.,
Avoid the use of sky-rails for too long.,
Aim for the heart!,
Keep moving around the map.",How to Beat the Handyman in Bioshock Infinite," The Shotgun or Hand Cannon are the two best weapons for attacking a Handyman, as they deal a fantastic amount of damage. When aiming these weapons at the heart of a Handyman, you can take out chunks of his health quickly, as seen by his health bar above his head. Upgrading these weapons will further increase the damage, and make these battles easier.;
, Murder of Crows is the third vigor you acquire. You won’t face a Handyman before you equip this vigor. The benefit of using this vigor is how it slows the Handyman down. He will attempt to swat at the crows for a few seconds, giving you the time to either get away or get a few shots off at him. Once this wears off however, the handyman can lunge towards you and continue attacking!


You can keep hitting the Handyman with Murder of Crows, but you will eventually run out of Salts. Salts can be found around the map if you begin to run low.

, Sky-rails can be a fantastic way to get away from the Handyman quick; however, if you stay on for too long he will electrify the rail. This will harm you and cause you to fall off the rail. If this happens to you, get off the rail as fast as possible! This is not saying you shouldn’t use the sky-rails at all when facing a Handyman, though. Just use it briefly and jump off to a location away from the Handyman.

, Shooting at any body part of the Handyman other than the heart will result in you using a ton of ammo. The handyman’s weakness is his heart. It can be found in the center of his chest but can be tough to shoot due to his large arms getting in the way of your shot.


Using the Murder of Crows will make the Handyman swat the crows well away from his heart. This gives you a clear shot to pump in a few shotgun slugs. This will cause devastating damage to the Handyman and quickly deplete his health.

, You can’t face the Handyman head-on. His large metal body is far stronger than yourself. Your advantage is using sky-rails to quickly jump around the map and the vigor you possess. If you give the Handyman time to get close to you, he can potentially deal a ton of damage and even kill you.

Find the Little Sisters.,
Defeat the Big Daddies.,
Decide what kind of ending you want.,
Get the best ending by rescuing ALL the Little Sisters.,
Get the sad ending by harvesting only SOME of the Little Sisters.,
Get the worst Ending by harvesting them all.",How to Get All the Endings in Bioshock 1," For the happiest ending, you will have to rescue each Little Sister you come across. In total, there are 21 Little Sisters that you will need to rescue. Little Sisters move around the map as you progress in the game, and rarely stay in one spot for too long. They can be identified by their Little Sister icon on the map.


For a total headcount of little sisters, there is 1 in the Medical Pavilion, 3 in Neptune’s Bounty, 2 in Arcadia, 1 in the Farmer’s Market, 4 in Fort Frolic, 3 in Hephaestus, 2 in Olympus Heights, 2 in Apollo Square, and 3 in Point Prometheus.;
, There are some Little Sisters that cannot be harvested or saved; however, those that you can harvest or save are accompanied by a Big Daddy, which act as guardians. To rescue the Little Sister, you will have to defeat the Big Daddy regardless of which ending you want.


Big Daddies are arguably the toughest enemies in the game, so use caution when engaging them in combat. They will only become hostile if you attack first, so feel free to explore the level and collect any power-ups you need before attacking.
Big Daddies fall into two categories: Rosies and Bouncers. Rosies are encountered in the Neptune’s Bounty level. Their main attacks are shooting with the rivet gun and throwing proximity mines. You’ll encounter Bouncers in the Medical Pavilion level. They charge at you with their drills, or use melee attacks.
The electric Buck bullets with the rapid-fire shotgun are effective on both types of Big Daddies, as they do a lot of damage and pierce through the armor. Overall, it is best to keep your distance when fighting Bouncers, as they excel at close combat. Rosies can be beaten if you can avoid their fire and attack with armor-piercing bullets.

, After you have defeated a Little Sister’s guardian and before you go on, think on what ending you would want for your game. You can have the best, sad, or worst ending; and all these depend on how you treat the Little Sister whose guardian you just killed.

, To achieve the Best Ending, every single one of the 21 Little Sisters must be rescued. To rescue a Little Sister, approach her after you have defeated her Big Daddy guardian. She will most likely be crying over his body and will not run away.


Two options will appear: “Harvest” and “Rescue.” Hit the “Rescue” option by pressing the Triangle button (PS3), Y button (Xbox 360), or the L key (PC).
The best ending is markedly different from the two variations of bad endings. Rather than the splicers taking over Rapture, Jack escapes to the surface and adopts all the rescued Little Sisters.

, For the second ending, you will have to harvest a few of the Little Sisters, but not all of them. When you approach a Little Sister after defeating her guardian, select the “Harvest” option for some of the girls while choosing “Rescue” for the others.

, This is simple; instead of rescuing the Little Sisters, you harvest them ALL. Sparing even just one of them will give you the second ending.


Note that the second and third endings are nearly identical; however, choosing to harvest all the Little Sisters will result in the narrator sounding angry, rather than sad at you. The cinematic sequence remains the same.

You are not able to take it down from the ground; instead you need to board the airship.;
, The only way to get onto the airship is by sky-rail. Use your Sky-Hook to grapple onto the sky-rail and ride it up to the airship. The sky-rail can be found to the right of the platform you are on. The airship is on the same side as the sky-rail, and once you board the ship, you will need to clear out any enemies on board.

, On the airship, you will come across a dozen Columbian soldiers and one Mechanized Patriot. The best way to eliminate the Patriot is by using a Volley Gun. There is one located on a table within the airship. After you have fought your way through the enemies, you will need to locate the engine.

, The engine can be found at the back of the airship. It appears as a large machine with wires at the center of the circular exterior. The words “FINK” can be found at the top of the engine.


Before you proceed to destroy the engine, consider looking around the rest of the airship for supplies, such as the Volley Gun on the table or the Grenade Launcher found at the front of the airship.

, Using your Sky-Hook, tear apart the bare wires keeping the engine running. Once you destroy the wires, the airship will begin to fall out of the sky.

, Quickly exit the airship before it crashes and explodes by using the door on the left beside the destroyed engine. Grab onto the sky-line and ride it towards the platform from which you came on before.

, Once you are on the sky-line, land near the main doors leading to Fink’s Headquarters. Meet back up with the Vox rebels and continue with the assault.

",How to Defeat the Ghost of Lady Comstock in Bioshock Infinite," Carbines have a high rate of fire, decent firepower, and is pretty stable


Although you can use any gun you want to, the Carbine is definitely one of the best choices.;
,


Ammo cap gives a 40% chance to auto-reload your gun.
Quick hand let's you reload 30% faster.

, You'll be relying heavily on salts for this battle, hence Blood to Salt will be a great asset.

, Headmaster gives 50% more damage for critical hits.

, Tunnel Vision gives 25% more damage when aiming, but it lessens your damage by 25% when you don't aim, so it's a double-edged sword.


If you don’t want to use Tunnel Vision, you can use any footgear you want.

, This will help you thin down the amount of zombies that Lady Comstock raises.

, This will act as a second shield once your shield breaks down.

, There's going to be a small time frame in which she raises the dead, and you'll have a chance to shoot her during this time.

, This will quickly get rid of them and maybe even damage Lady Comstock.


Once you've killed all her zombies, she'll raise more to replace them.

, She raises her hands when she tries to revive zombies.


This is the best timing for doing head shots.

, If you use Return to Sender, you're invincible for as long as you have salts.


This is also where Blood to Salt kicks in after using most of your salt for Devil's Kiss. Chances are you'll have some left for Return to Sender once your shield breaks.

, This will do a lot of damage to her and the zombies around her. After that, switch back to Devil's Kiss and continue burning Lady Comstock and her zombies.

, You’ll might run out of salts. When you do, run for cover and wait for Elizabeth to throw some salts at you.


Covers are also good for getting a clean shot at Lady Comstock, so use them when necessary.

If there is a near by puddle, you can deal even more damage by using the water as an amplifier for the electricity. This tactic usually eats up more ammo than other ways, but it leaves you with less damage done in the end.

, Though using your Proximity Mines may seem like a bad waste of ammo, it's not. The only real use for these mines is to set up a perimeter, and when a perimeter is needed in the game there are usually turrets and cameras provided. Simply stick 3 or 4 proximity mines on a telekinetically-moveable object (an oxygen tank would be most effective) and pick it up using your Telekinesis. Hurling the bomb at the Big Daddy will certainly ruin its day, if not kill it completely. If the monster survives the initial explosion, finish off its few remaining health with any ammunition you choose (armor-piercing bullets are best).

, Getting a higher vantage point is crucial in scoring a direct hit against a Big Daddy. Once you are above the Big Daddy, through means of winding stairs or a balcony, start off with a frag grenade. This will surely get the Big Daddy angry, which causes him to get closer to either charge or shoot you. He'll take the quickest route to you, so keep him in sight as you launch RPGs at him. This should be able to kill him, unless he gets behind cover. If that's the case, find another spot to start, or he'll find you. Avoid using RPGs against an unaware Big Daddy, because they are far more expensive than the standard frag grenade, but just slightly weaker.

, Once you have used the plasmid on a lone Big Daddy, lure it to a Big Daddy with a little sister and shoot it with any bullet. When the Big Daddy attacks, your Big Daddy defends you. Once the dust settles, you may find your Daddy won, or the other did. Either way, finish off the survivor with the shotgun or other weapon and claim your prize of the little sister and a wallet-full of cash.

, Trap bolts are powerful, but not so practical against normal foes, so they meet their full potential defensively. Find a suitable hallway and proceed to shoot the trap bolts so they make a corridor of electricity. Once this is done, lure a Big Daddy (by either angering or hypnotizing it) through the shocking pathway. To avoid setting off the wires yourself, crouch as you walk to avoid wires shot at chest-level.

, Big Daddies offer a large sum of money, as well as many inventing items. Using the 'Scrounger' tonic (found by researching leadhead splicers) can find you extra money and/or inventing trinkets as well.

Become a sniper.,
Get a sniper rifle.,
Get to a good, concealed sniping spot.,
Get into a sniping position.,
Wait patiently for unsuspecting enemies to come near your scope/iron sight.",How to Be a Sniper in Call of Duty 3," Get an interest in becoming a sniper. A good way to do this is to practice burst-firing with assault rifles. They are accurate, have a relatively low recoil, and have a greater range than Submachine Guns.;
, You should try to preferably get one with a telescopic sight, but you don't have to have a scope to be an effective sniper. Since battlefields in this game aren't that big anyway, an iron sight is good enough.


Snipers with low magnification are the best because you have a wider field of aim. A 10x scope would only have a FOA of a few feet. Worse as you zoom in. The scope design will not matter.

, A sniping spot is not the same as a hiding spot. A sniping spot is some cover from enemy fire and a good view of what area you will be sniping.

, Remember the lower the better. Crouching is OK, but if you can go prone (lay down) that is much better. Make sure you can still see the battlefield from your sniping position.

, If you have some degree of practice aiming at the head, then aiming there will always he a one-hit kill. However, aiming at the torso is fine too.


When the target is moving, aim the cross-hair a little to the left/right (depending on where the guy is running). This compensates for the target's speed and the speed of the bullet. It also compensates for some lag that might happen.
This usually doesn't happen, but if you are moving and your target is stationary, aim a little behind the target. This is to compensate for gravity - the bullet will move to the direction of your motion as you fire your gun.

Mounted Machine Guns.,
Mostly, have patience!",How to Play Call of Duty 2 on Veteran Difficulty," Except in this case. Because the game was developed in 2005, the friendly AI aren't helpful and will barely follow you. So get used to fighting alone.;
, When clearing a building use a sub-machine gun. Because they are fast firing and aren't cumbersome to aim or reload. A Thompson or MP40 is preferable. Also do this prone, so you are very hard to hit, because the enemy will not see you.

, Because you get such a limited number of smoke grenades and you'll often have to move into open space where the enemy has a clear shot. Your going to have to decide when to use them or not. The best guide of deploying smoke grenades is when your commanding officer tells you to, or if your approaching a heavily armored vehicle.

, Frag grenades will often be in abundance, so don't worry about them being in short supply. Also enemies can throw these at you and since this isn't Call of Duty 4, you can't throw these back.

, Some weapons are better than others in certain situations. For example, the Mosin Nagant, Kar98K, Lee Enfield are bolt action and require cycling after firing, so are inadvisable in CQB situations. Sub-machine guns are a better all around choice. The Thompson only has a 20 round magazine, but those 20 pack a punch. The British STEN is less powerful and less preferable, so swap it for something else when available. The MP40 behaves extraordinarily like an assault rifle and the ammunition is in vast supply, because it is used by the majority of Germans. Pistols are rarely ever seen but are a good choice for CQB situations. Light Machine guns such as the BAR or the Bren LMG are less preferable, partially because of the high recoil and the fact you'll never get to stay in the open long enough to fire it. The MP44 is a good all around weapon, as it is an assault rifle. There are also semiautomatic rifles such as the Gewher43, the M1 Garand, which are good substitutes for rifles such as the Kar98k because they self-load their ammunition.

, Use them whenever you get one. These weapons are useful to eliminate large amount of enemies without them seeing you.

, Mounted machine guns are mostly inadvisable unless you are laying down the first shot. Only then are they useful.

, This is probably one of the most frustrating difficulties of any game. If you aren't careful you'll find yourself breaking your own controller with out conscious thought.

Remember the basic game play.,
Pick things up!,

Cubes are your friend!,
Turrets are your enemies!,
Solve the energy ball puzzles!,if you get stuck go to options activate cheats hit ~ to find cheats go to http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/code/934386.html

",How to Play Portal," In Portal, you have to use ""portals"" to complete puzzles and move onto the next one. There are two portals: blue and orange. When you go in one portal, you come out the other. However, not all surfaces can accommodate a portal!;
, Using the ""X"" (on Xbox 360) or ""E"" (on PC) button, you can pick objects up. Almost all objects can be picked up. This will become essential if you want to solve every puzzle in Portal.

, In Portal, many puzzles are solved by the laws of momentum. Momentum is kept through portals, so when you are falling at a fast velocity into one portal, you will come out of the other portal at a fast velocity. This is useful for levels in which you need to jump a long distance otherwise unreachable.

, In Portal, you will frequently be given cubes to solve puzzles. You may ask, ""How can a cube help me solve a puzzle?"". It will help you more than you think. When a cube is given to you, it is usually for the purpose of placing on buttons to open doors to advance. They can also be used as shields against turrets and energy balls.

, In certain levels, you have to fight against turrets. Once these turrets point their laser sights at you and lock on, you will be shot at relentlessly, and without proper cover, die very quickly. To stop a turret, it must be knocked down. This can be done many ways. Shooting a portal below the turret usually does an adequate job. However, you can also shoot down a turret with another turret, or knock down a turret by running at it. Another way is to shoot a portal above the turret and a portal under a cube to knock the turret over. When protection is needed, you can use many objects to protect yourself. A cube or another turret can help you with that job.

, In order to go on to the next puzzle, you might have to solve ""energy ball puzzles"". These ""energy balls"" are electric balls that fly and bounce off of walls. In order to solve these puzzles, you need to get these balls back to their ""holders"" using portals. Once they lock into their ""holders"", something, such as a lift, will activate. However, watch out! If these energy balls contact you, you will die! Much like turrets, use items such as cubes to protect yourself from them.

The basic Portal technique.,
The Cube technique.,
The Energy Ball technique (Portal only).,
The Sneaky way.",How to Defeat Turrets Easily in Portal/Portal 2," This is pretty much the easiest technique to defeat a turret requires the turret to be on a portal-friendly surface, and another portal-friendly surface, preferably on a wall or on a roof of the test chamber. It will fall in the portal, and when it hits the ground, it will randomly fire and then go into sleep mode.;
, The cube technique is very similar to the Portal technique. First, you must have a portal-friendly surface above the turret, a cube, and a portal surface near you and out of the turret's firing range. Put a portal over the turret and near you, grab the cube, and drop it through the Portal. It should hit the turret, and with the same results as the Portal technique. Another use of the cube is to whack the turret over with the cube, but this really doesn't help, as you will be in it's firing range if you succeed or try to succeed.

, To do this, place a portal in a direction facing a Turret, and another where an Energy Ball is about to hit. It will knock the turret over.

, If you can, sneak up behind the turret and knock it over by simply running into it. You can also pick it up by pressing X on your controller (or E on your keyboard) and dropping it back down so it falls over and shoot randomly then closes.

More often than not, the player inserts pieces of their own personality, likes, dislikes, and perhaps even their beliefs, into their character. Try to be unique but, in some way, realistic. Think about what your character may have gone through in their past and how that may shape their personality.;
, In established settings, learning the lore is important. Someone took the time to really make a great setting for you, the least you could do is learn some of the lore. The lore in Final Fantasy XIV is rather solid and easy to grip. There is some lore that can be speculated and bent to benefit your character or the kind of RP you're looking to do, and that is where the fun comes in.


Some examples of lore includes:

Naming conventions: Understand how naming works across the races you can choose.
How magic works within the world.
""The Void"" and it's place within the world.
Primals - Giant, summoned beasts.


Naturally, not all people stick to the lore 100% and that is completely fine.

, You are paying for the subscription after all, so try to enjoy the game as well. As you play, you will understand the lore, and get a feel for your character. This is also how you make friends and find out more about other roleplayers. Exploration is part of the fun!

, It can be hard to play the game or roleplay in an uncomfortable position, try your best to find a setup that works for you. Don't roleplay in pain!

, It is important that you take care of yourself, aside from snacks, make sure you are keeping up with your real life. If you are hungry, eat. If you are tired, sleep.

, There is a world of roleplayers out there, waiting for you to befriend them. Take the time to learn about people, about their characters, and you will make friends in no time! Without a friend, your roleplay is not much of a roleplay. Try your best to find forums to find roleplayers, or check out Tumblr, where many roleplayers in Final Fantasy XIV visit!

, Try out different kinds of roleplay with different people and see what is right for you. Often times, simple interactions like having your character go out to eat or drink, can open up many other doors for you. Sometimes, all it takes is a simple interaction to get pulled into a part in a much larger roleplay story.

, Part of learning your style is also learning the lingo like ""In-character (IC)"" and ""Out-of-character (OOC)."" If you are new to roleplaying this way, try to learn the lingo by involving yourself with as many different roleplayers as you can. Here are a few examples:

IC - In-character interactions, things your character does or says.

""I only like apples,"" He scoffed.


OOC - Out-of-character interactions, things you say or do, usually prefaced with ""OOC tags"" like parenthesis.

((I like apples too!))


Godmod - Controlling another person's character to benefit your own, this is usually a bad thing unless agreed upon among the two roleplayers.

A character punches another character and lands the hit without the other player being able to react.



, This step is important. If a character does not like your character, that does not necessarily mean that the player does not like you. Sometimes, characters don't make friends out of everyone. Sometimes, a character is evil. It is up to you to keep your in-character interactions separate from out of character ones to avoid confusion and conflict.

, Of course, you should be having fun the entire time, but overall, if you are not having fun while roleplaying, it may not be your thing. Roleplaying should be fun and enjoyable. People should get a real kick out of writing stories together and having interaction through their characters. Always have fun, do not make roleplaying a chore!

After you have selected which song to play, choose which instrument you want to play (Guitar or Bass when using a guitar controller), and then choose what difficulty you wish to play on. Choosing the Easy difficulty might be a good idea if you are a stranger to music games in general, while Medium is probably the way to go if you are a bit more familiar with rhythm games.

,, When playing the game, ""notes"" with colours representing the buttons on the guitar neck will come towards you on the game screen, and you are supposed to press the the strum bar, the white thing at the body of the guitar, down with your thumb while holding down the correct ""fret"" button(s) as these notes hit the ""hitline"" on the bottom of the screen.

,


Hold the guitar like a real guitar. Put your thumb on the strum-bar, and learn how to hold the fret buttons.
Check out the tutorial menu, after reading this article.

, Pick one that suits you best. When beginning, you will notice a bar coming down, with five colored targets at the bottom. You will then see colored circles moving down the screen. Match up the colors with the targets, and hold that fret button. When the color passes over the target, strum! Voila'! You've hit a note! Sometimes, notes will be repeated. Instead of releasing the fret button each time, simply hold it down and strum. Guitar Hero controllers are just like real guitars, especially in the way they are played.

, This is a long note. You hit this the same as a regular note, but you hold the fret button for the entire note. You do not need to hold the strum bar down. Once again, just like a real guitar! Hooray for similarity!

, By playing all these notes without missing any, you will gain Star Power, a power-up that boosts your rock meter (see next section) and your points! You can engage star power by tipping your guitar up, Slash style, or quickly pressing -.

, The one of the left is your score multiplier, which shows your points, note streaks, and multiplier. On the right sits your rock meter. This meter shows what the crowd thinks of you (RED = Poor, YELLOW = Average, GREEN = Good/Great). If your rock meter declines too much, you will fail the song. On top of the rock meter is a number of lightbulbs. These measure your star power. When they are yellow, your star power cannot be engaged, but when its blue, it can be engaged.

, This will cause the note to alter, and you can add your own originality to the song with it. You can also extract Star Power from long notes in the star sequence.

, Sometime, notes will be too fast for you to strum and hit at the same time, so you can hammer on and pull off the notes. You can do this when notes have a light coming from their center. To hammer on and pull off, just hit the notes, but don't strum.

, For instance, the hardest song on Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock is Through The Fire and Flames. That's just some knowledge that can come in handy.

Do whatever rock moves you want to do, and encourage your friends to do the same.

, If actual people watched you perform, ask them how you did. If stuffies or dolls watched you, you decide yourself. Practice lots before your next 'performance' based on how well you did on your first one.

Get to know the song you're playing.",How to Jump from Medium to Hard in Guitar Hero," Instead of having your index finger on green, slide it up to the red fret. It is much easier (at least for most people) to stretch from the red fret to the green fret with your index finger than stretching to orange with your pinky. This may take a while to get used to. Try the intro to Sweet Child O' Mine until you can do pretty well on it. If you want to practice on medium, use the hand position and reach to press the green button.;
, I recommend Jessica and Less Talk More Rokk on expert for practice. If you are still on medium it will probably be too hard on expert so try it in practice mode on a slower speed. A good song for practicing hammer-ons and pull-offs on medium is Killing in the Name. While this is not necessary, it is highly recommended to succeed on hard and expert.

, Basically alt-strumming is strumming up and down, instead of only using down-strums. This is very useful when notes come fast at you (Misirlou). There are many ways to alt-strum, such as holding the strum bar like a pick and strumming up and down that way, with the palm of your hand, or your elbow (strange, but surprisingly effective).

, Chances are, you haven't spent hours upon hours in practice mode on easy or medium practicing solo 7 in Hangar 18. Well, once you get to hard and expert, you'll have to. Find a certain spot in the song that will allow you to do better if you hit it. This doesn't necessarily mean the hardest part. Star Power phrases and parts leading into hard parts (to keep your ROCK meter in green) are good ones to practice.

Learn trills.","How to Improve Your Skill in Guitar Hero I, II and III"," In the game they are explained in the 'advanced' tutorial. What hammer-ons and pull-offs (further in the article called ""HOPOs"") are are when there is a series of notes that go from the green to orange or orange to green direction you can use the strum bar once, and get all the notes. Timing when hitting the fret buttons is essential! A good way to practice your H.O.P.Os is to play ""Less Talk more Rock"" on Expert in the Practice section of the game, playing only the ""Speedup."" One more thing about HOPOs, when there is a long note, you will have to strum for the next note. You cannot strum between long notes or power chords (one or more frets at the same time) A way to make sure when it is okay to HOPO is when the ""orbs"" do not have a black ring on top. If there is a black ring, you must strum. NOTE: HOPOing is very hard to do in GH I.;
, This is going both up and down with the strum bar. In Expert, this is a necessary thing to do for most songs: Looking at Misirlou and Jordan for examples, there are many close-together notes that are too hard or impossible to all hit strumming one direction. This skill takes time to master, so double strum when necessary at the beginning of your training to be better, and then try to move completely to double-strumming. This not only lets you get many fast notes, but it also is a lot less tiring. Also learn to gallop strum, which is fancy for the type of strumming needed to get 100% on Six and The Trooper on Expert.

, Not only does this force you to try to do stuff you can't usually do, but if you try to hit every note, you'll keep getting higher percentages, and you'll get better at your difficulty. (But don't beat yourself up, if you can only play easy (which is really sad) and your friend is playing on expert, this will only depress you) If they're a good friend (good enough at the game to notice when you screw up, and are nice) they should show you where you're messing up and give you some advice of some extra tricks they might have.

, If you're playing a song that is difficult, save up your star power until your ROCK meter is at the bottom of the red zone, preferably right before or when it starts flashing red and use it to save your life. If you're playing a song you can beat easily, then when you have a 4x Multiplier going, use Star Power and use the 8x Multiplier to raise your score. If you can beat the song without Star Power, but you end up in the yellow zone or red zone at the end: Practice more. Strive to end your songs in the Green region. Then when you can get 4 stars without star power, play again, and go for five. Note: The only way to get five golden stars is to get 100% of the notes. Otherwise they're penciled in.

, This can be extremely helpful in some songs (Jordan - Bridge, Thunderhorse, Misirlou) where there are many of on color note on the left (if playing right handed) and few on the right. Example: In Jordan's Bridge there are many green notes coming fast, and some red-orange dotted throughout, it is best to hold the green fret button, strum as you would, and touch the other frets when needed. If there is a red note to hit there, and you are holding the red and green frets, and you let go of the red fret only, it works as a pull-off from red to green. This is only effective during pull-offs. Hammer-ons cannot be performed this way.

, Tapping in Guitar Hero is learning to use both hands on the fret buttons. A good example of tapping is shown in this YouTube video when he gets to Solo B. Tapping in Jordan on Expert This video is a great combination showing everything mentioned here flowing together. This is intended only for expert players who want to get 100% on every Expert level song.

, Those are the notes things that are like a horizontal trapezoid. Learn this and you can beat Shout at the devil on expert!

Listen to the song in real life.",How to Beat Through the Fire and Flames on Expert," The intro section of this song, which forces you to alternate between green notes and the other notes on the neck at a rapid-fire pace, is considered by many to be one of the most difficult sections in the whole song.One common trick that Guitar Hero experts use to make this section easier is to keep the green note held down with a tool like a rubber band, a hair scrunchie, or an actual guitar capo throughout the whole section. This way, the player only has to focus on the other notes — not necessarily an easy task, but an easier one.


If you want to use this trick, make sure the tool you use has a tight enough hold to keep the green button held down consistently but is loose enough to be quickly removed from the green button when you want to transition to the rest of the song.;
, After the very first red note, the whole intro section is one giant sequence of hammer-ons and pull-offs, which don't require you to strum, just to touch the correct buttons. This means that, amazingly, it's possible to clear this section only strumming the first note. Extra strums won't lose you any points if they're on the correct notes, but they're not necessary, so you may want to focus less on them than on hitting the right notes.


Hammer-ons are played by strumming one note and ""hammering on"" the second note above it by touching it without strumming. Conversely, pull-offs are played by strumming the first note and touching the note below it without strumming. In Guitar Hero, hammer-ons and pull-off notes have a white center (without a black border).
The difficult thing about using solely hammer-ons and pull-offs for the intro is that, if you miss a single note, you will need to strum again to reset the ""string."" If you're not paying attention, it's easy to miss dozens of notes by forgetting to strum after a mistake.

, Playing the intro section can be very difficult to play with one hand. If you are having a hard time reaching the blue and orange notes while keeping the green note held down, consider using your strumming hand to help.


To do this, bring your strumming hand up the neck of the guitar after the first strum and use your index finger and middle finger to handle the blue and orange notes. For example, if you strum with your right hand, you would strum the first note with your right hand and then use your right index and middle finger to play the blue and orange notes (if you're a lefty, do the exact opposite.)
Some high-level players even use the elbow of their strumming hand to hit the first note — this allows them to have their fingers in place for tapping right away.

, Having trouble hitting every note in the intro section? Try restricting yourself to just four and leaving out one of the more difficult ones to hit (like, for instance, the orange note.) You'll miss some points, but there are enough notes in the intro section that you won't do poorly enough to fail as long you hit everything else.


Keep in mind that, if you miss notes and break your streak, you'll need to be ready to strum again — your sequence of hammer-ons and pull-offs won't carry through.

, One of the hardest things about the intro is that, after repeating the same extremely difficult pattern over and over, it ends with a very fast sequence of scales that aren't at all like what came before. However, this part isn't impossible if you know what's coming:


The intro pattern ends on a green note and the scales start on an orange note — these happen to be at the same places as they are during the intro pattern, so if you're paying attention, you can transition smoothly from one to the other.
The first downward run is all pull-offs. However, the second green note at the bottom of the scale must be strummed again. After that, the second orange note at the top of the scale must be strummed as well.

, If you used the rubber band trick described above, it may seem like you need to take the rubber band off of the green note as soon as the intro is over. This isn't actually true — in Guitar hero, if you're playing a single note, you can have any notes ""under"" it (further down the fret) held down and you'll still hit the note. Because there aren't any chords (two notes or more at once) until just before the lyrics start, you can actually leave the rubber band on until then and it won't affect your playing.


This is handy because it keeps you from missing notes by taking a second to move the rubber band out of the way during the early parts of the song, which are packed with notes. After the first chord, there's a brief pause in the guitar part, so you'll have a second to get rid of the rubber band safely.

, Throughout the song, there are numerous parts where a single note must be played very rapidly for a second or two. The best way to tackle these parts is not to wildly strum as fast as you can — this can actually cause you to lose points and break your streak by playing too many notes. Instead, you'll want to use a quick but very steady rhythm. Since there are so many notes packed into these sections, using a strumming tempo that's not steady can cause you to miss dozens of notes.


For sections like the ""Post Insanity"" section right after the intro where this fast rhythm alternates between multiple notes, concentrate on keeping your strumming steady and just move your fretting fingers when you need to switch notes. Once you get your strumming under control, these sections actually aren't that hard.

, Having a reserve of star power to fall back on during this song can make the difference between victory and failure. Because of this, you'll want to make sure that you take every opportunity to build up star power that you can get. Missing an easy star power section is not an option in this song! Below are a few of the less-difficult sections near the beginning of the song where you can earn star power — if you can get these, you can get the easy sections throughout the song:


Right before the loud instruments kick back in during the first verse there are a few easy chords followed by a short scale which can be hit for star power.
Right after this, there is a long string of rapid green notes which give star power.
When the lyrics switch to ""So now we fly ever free/We're free before the thunderstorm,"" there are two easy star power sections right in a row.At the start of the first chorus (""So far away...""), there's a very easy two-chord star power opportunity. Use the whammy bar here to get extra star power!

, In a difficult song like this where survival is more important than winning points, star power isn't helpful if you don't use it to help you through the trickiest spots. While almost the entire song is difficult enough for any part to cause failure, there are a few parts that most high-level players agree are even harder than the rest. These are listed below (the names for each section come from Practice mode):


""They're hammer ons"" (the intro)
""Blackest waves""
""Climactic Buildup""
""Herman's Solo""
""What the..!?""
""Rampaging Dragons.""
""Twin Solo"" — if you can get past this, the rest of the song should be manageable.

, Guitar Hero's built-in practice function is your best friend when it comes to conquering extremely hard songs like ""Through the Fire and Flames"". In Practice Mode, you have a wide variety of handy features that make it easy to gradually work up to playing the ""real"" song. These include:


The ability to slow down the tempo of the song.
The ability to practice individual parts of the song without having to play the rest of the song.
The ability to adjust the scrolling speed — note that this requires you to input a cheat code via the Options menu., Unless you have the skills of Herman Li (guitarist and songwriter for Dragonforce),the odds that you'll be able to clear this song on Expert the first time you try to are very, very slim. The best way to get good at this song is generally to start at a difficulty that allows you to get through the whole song consistently (even if that difficulty is easy.) This will give you a feel for the important ""moments"" of the song and help you gradually build your speed and accuracy (even if the jumps from normal to hard and hard to expert are pretty massive.)


In addition, playing at easier difficulties will allow you to get past the intro so that you can practice the parts that come after.

, The skills that allow you to beat other difficult Guitar Hero songs are just as useful for ""Through the Fire and Flames"" — plus, practicing other hard songs will give you a little variety to keep you from ""burning out"" on Dragonforce. Below are a selection of Guitar Hero songs from the games that have ""Through the Fire and Flames"" that are considered to be some of the most difficult:Guitar Hero III
""Raining Blood"" by Slayer
""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" (cover) originally by Charlie Daniels Band
""One"" by Metallica""
Guitar Hero Smash Hits
""Play With Me"" by Extreme
""Beast and the Harlot"" by Avenged Sevenfold
""The Trooper"" by Iron Maiden

, Part of what makes ""Through the Fire and Flames"" so hard to clear is that it's very difficult to guess what will come next. However, listening to the song in real life until you more or less remember how the whole thing goes can make this a little easier. Once you have a good feel for the progression of the song, you can plan ahead as you play it in Guitar Hero — for instance, if you know that Herman Li's impossible solo is about to start, you may want to hold off on triggering your star power until you really need it.

"
"
Complete the intro.,
Save every star power you get until mentioned in here to do so.

,
Next is the 2 post insanities which should help get your rock meter up no problem whatsoever.,
Collect start power in the second chorus.,
Be prepared to lose some of your rock meter during the mini solo.,
Collect star power with the first few notes.,
Don't use your star power yet.,
Practice for the climatic build up just before the main solo.,
here we stand: the solo is done and you believe you have done the song.....NO!,
Take advantage of a high rock meter at this point.,
After this you are at the rampaging dragons where you can taste success.,
you rock!,
After this you will have completed the hardest song on guitar hero 3 on expert.

",How to Complete Through the Fire and Flames on Expert on Guitar Hero 3," Hopefully you have completed the intro if not then look at the tips section.;
,, After this you should have very little problem making it to the little solos after choruses get as much star power as possible in this 1st chorus .


The 1st solo shouldn't knock you out. there are two star powers in this solo and you should use yours after getting or missing the 2nd star power. after the star power is gone it should be the next part which is an easy combination of green red yellow and blue frets keeping your rock meter high.
After this, there shouldn't be a worry either. A few tricky parts, but nothing to knock you out.

, here is the second chorus where there is star power to be collected. when long notes, whammy for as much star power as possible. this part is very easy and you should get your star power back. if not don't worry because there is more before the main solo

, Next after the chorus is another mini solo. This shouldn't knock you out either but will take your rock meter down a lot but still keep your star power. From now on is where it gets tricky.

, now we are 1/2 way through the song and at the synth death. The 1st few notes are the easiest star power of the song and should be collected. Whammy on the final note for more star power. hopefully at this point you will have full star power. Then there are plenty of hammer ons which is tricky. on the red and yellow only points keep your finger on the red and just press the yellow when necessary. The slides up and down may catch you out but you must go for every note as possible. The star power at the end of synth death isn't much bother.

, At this point your rock meter is most likely very low. But don't use your star power just yet because then there is the grinding scales and solo fills. the grinding scales are a life saver after synth death as it can help get your rock meter right back up to the top as it easy an easy case of just strumming up and down and changing fingers. This is not fast at all. these and the solo fills shouldn't be much bother.

, This is tricky at the end as this normally gets me flashing red on my rock meter. This will probably do the same for you and you must use your star power about 1 or 2 seconds before Herman's solo begins. if you use it earlier the solo will be harder as you will be doing parts of the solo without star power. if you use it during Herman's solo you will miss a star power needed for the solo. To see when to use it go on practice and go on the climactic build up. from here it is easy to see where the last note is. Now the main solo begins!


Herman's solo: This is very fast and can knock out many talented guitar hero players. However, if you have used the star power when mentioned above, then this should be a walk in the park. hopefully your star power will run out right before the easy part of the solo which contains star power. you WILL need this. if missed then you will fail.
Sam's solo: For many this can be very very hard. However, in many parts of this there are points where you can hold the lowest note and just pull off on higher notes for example. There is a point where there is a sequence involving green then red, green then yellow, green then blue. Just hold the green down in this case and press the rest of the frets and you will be fine.
Herman's solo2: this isn't very fast but can catch people out. The hardest part of this is the part to collect the star power which you will need to collect. if not you will have to survive the extremely fast ""what the"" without it! It's possible but the odds of doing it are not very high.

what the: if you have collected the 2 star powers from Herman's solo 1 and Herman's solo 2 then use here and you will have no problem. if however your rock meter is in the top 1/2 of the green, you can probably do this without it which will make the twin solo easier.
twin solo: this is the final part of the solo. This may feel good to get to but the challenge isn't over as this is considered by many as the hardest part. The 1st 1/2 up to the star power is easy and won't take much of your rock meter out. If you have completed the what the using star power then you are in for a challenge. if you have completed the ""what the"" without using star power, use it immediately after getting the one in the middle of this solo. this will carry you through the solo all the way to the end of the solo. if you haven't then you are in trouble of failing here. The only advice i can give here is that only the final part where there is a continuous chain of 3 notes, hold the bottom note and tap the other 2 otherwise you will fail guaranteed.



, it's not over yet. this bit is easy and you won't need to collect the star power.

, After is the final chorus containing a very challenging star power involving many reds. Your rock meter should be high at this point and you can make it through this is if you go for as many reds and greens and oranges as possible. don't try to do tapping with our other hand just strum with it and go for as many as possible You are almost certain not to get the star power but as this lasts about 2 seconds this won't be much bother.

, this is the same as the post instabilities at the start of the song. your rock meter shall go back up to the top here. there are some star powers here to. They aren't needed but they will be nice for points

,: this is the final part of the song and you should complete as long as you keep your finger on the red and go for the blue and orange.

Practice drills.,
Use the stiff arm when needed.,
Trick your opponents.,
Time your moves and ball passes.,
Practice makes perfect.",How to Be Good at Madden 25," Knowing whether your team specializes in defensive or offensive plays is one of the basic information you need to know before playing the game.


If defense is your team’s strength, focus on interceptive plays and tackles.
If your game is mainly offensive, take advantage of the skills and stats of your quarterback, switching between passing and running plays.
All the details of your team can be seen on the team stats section accessible from the main menu.;
, Remember what they said about great defense being the best offense? Well, this applies to football too. Check the stats of a player to know their ratings and assign strong players on the defensive line. A great defense will stop the opposite team from scoring a touchdown, which in turn gives you a better chance on scoring one yourself.

, While playing the game, don’t just randomly choose a play. Choosing the right strategy, especially during crucial events like when there’s not enough time left, is very important and can be the deciding factor whether you’ll win the game or not.


You can select the appropriate strategy to use from the Playbook section of the game.

, Turbo lets your runner speed up for a short amount of time. But don’t just press the turbo! Use it in a timely manner to get past tight defenses, avoid tacklers, and leave behind other running backs or players chasing you.


Remember also that constantly using turbo drains the energy of your player.

, As per the American Football rule, each team only gets three timeouts per half of the game. Use your timeouts conservatively, or if possible, save it until the later part of the game when your players’ energies are already drained out.

, Drills let newbie players understand the basics, not only of the game, but also the rules of the American Football. Playing drills allows you to formulate your strategies before playing a real game.


Achievement and trophies can also be unlocked when you play drill games.
You can easily access Madden 25’s drill section from the main menu.

, A stiff arm is a technique where the player holding the ball extends his arm to parry opposing team’s defending players. It’s a great way to ward off tacklers.


Press the X or A button on your controller (depending on the console you’re playing) to use a stiff arm.

, Sometimes, you don’t have to force your way against defenders. When a huge wave of line defenders are standing in your way, ramming your player against this wall is not the best idea. Instead, you can try to use spin moves or jukes to trick or evade opponents crossing your path.

, Timing is everything. Executing your moves at the right moment, whether it’s offensive or defensive, can do wonders.


Running across the playing field can be just a walk in the park using perfectly timed spin moves and jumps.
Anticipating the running or passing path of the opponent carrying the ball can lead to a great tackle or steal.

, Even the most skilled Madden 25 gamer didn’t instantly become good at the game. Pro-football players may even find it hard to master the game. Keep on practicing and you’ll eventually be good at Madden 25.

, this will help later on in the song during the solo.

, The more the better, and a full bar might help a lot.

, You don't want your performance meter to be down on the red when the triplets of death solo hits you. Listen for the amount of drum hits on the slowest speed (there are about six to ten per line of green notes) if you struggle to find the tempo: the guitar and snare drum follows the same tempo.

, Keep it anchored there while trying to hit the rest of the note with your other fingers.

, If the triplet goes Green-Red-Yellow, strum the Green note and then slide your fingers upwards the neck to try to hit the other notes. This requires practice and possibly sweaty fingers to make them glide easier. You might find not holding in the lowest button easier in some cases.

, Be sure you can handle it. Finger-gliding works pretty well on it, as long as you do not anchor (permanently press down a button) any notes and uses all fingers in the process.

Get your Star Power.",How to Beat Jordan on Expert (in Guitar Hero)," It shouldn't be that hard to master if you've already beaten every other song.


The guitar break and solo A. You cannot beat this song if you can't get at least 70-80% on these parts. You must be in the high green after this part if you want to succeed because you are about to play...
Solos B and C. The hardest section so far in the Guitar Hero universe, this monster of a solo is probably going to be the reason for your future arthritis. There is no real technique for this part (except tapping, but if you are just trying to squeak by the song, it's not a good idea) except button mashing and strumming-speed. You will probably want to consistently get 60% on this part before you move on.
Solo F and Bridge. Once you hit the blue note of freedom, you should pass the song, but if you fail at this last hard part, you will be kicking yourself in the face. Once again strumming speed is important in the bridge.
Hammer-Ons and Pull-offs. Jordan has a lot of these especially in the beginning. Play the tutorial to learn how to do them.;
, When you hit the ascending scale slide your finger up from green to red so you can hit the B-O-B notes.
Break - I prefer a 123-123-123 fingering on this, and I strum every 3 notes. 123-123-234 also works pretty well.
Solo A - There are two ways to do this. Either a) pull off every note as shown and strum every three notes. or b) play 4 notes at a time to ensure that you hit every note when the notes skip. Also holding lower notes so you can focus on the high notes might help, but it will require more practice.
Solo B - This will mostly consist of button mashing and ultra-fast strumming, but try to hit the extended trills because that is the easiest part.
Solo C - Strum slightly slower that solo B (maybe a little bit less than Misirlou speed). Again, there isn't much of a technique here except try to hit as many notes as you can.
Bridge - Hold green the whole time. If you prefer, you can hammer-on the note after the two quick green notes. Strumming speed is slower than you probably think. Experiment until you find it.

,


Save your star power until solo B. Do not activate your star power until your rock meter is in the blinking red. Get through the first break in solo B before you use your star power. This activation may require using the select button.
Once you hit the Blue Note of Freedom, You have to start saving up your star power again for Solo F and the Bridge. There are a few star power phrases in the bridge but chances are you won't hit them. If you activate star power in the middle of Solo F you should be able to knock out most of the Bridge.

Hit all the Battle Gems in a sequence to obtain an attack.,
Know that you can store up your attacks.,
Tilt the guitar once to use the attack you obtained the shortest amount of time ago.,
Repeat steps 1-3 until your opponent has failed the song.",How to Battle in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock," The attacks include:


Broken String: A fret on your opponent's guitar will not work until fixed by rapidly pressing the broken fret.
Amp Overload: The scrolling notes on your opponent's fret board will shake and flash, making the incoming notes hard to read. It will lose its effect after an amount of time.
Difficulty Up: The difficulty of your opponent's song will increase one notch. For example: Medium turns to hard. This attack does not appear when playing against someone who is on Expert. Effect vanishes after an amount of time.
Whammy Bar: None of your opponent's frets on the guitar will work until fixed by rapidly using the whammy bar.
Power-Up Steal: This attack steals your opponent's next weapon. If they have no weapons when you use this the attack will have no effect and be lost.
Double: Your opponent must play two-button chords instead of single notes and three-button chords instead of natural two-button chords. Effect wears off after an amount of time.
Left/Righty Flip: Switches righty players to a lefty setting and lefty players to a righty setting. Effect wears off after an amount of time.
Death Drain: Only available in sudden death (explained below). This attack makes your opponent's rock meter slowly drain. Their fretboard will also be covered by an animation. It is not fixable and does not go away until the victim fails.;
, Once an attack is gained, it is stored in an attack bank. Up to three attacks may be stored here.

, You can also throw attacks by using SELECT. It will make lot easier for multiple attacks at same time.


If using multiple attacks at the same time does not work, try releasing the second attack immediately when the first attack ends, and so on. This will increase the time the opponent is a victim to an attack.
Try to attack when your opponent is hitting battle gems. This will make him/her miss one and miss the opportunity to get a weapon. Whammy Bar is effective for this tactic.
Try to use two or more attacks at one time. An effective combination is Difficulty Up, Double, and Whammy or Lefty Flip.

,


If neither player fails by the end of the song, the players replay the song in Sudden Death mode. This does not occur in Career Boss Battles. Every attack will be the Death Drain.
In Boss Battles, you must defeat the boss before the song ends. Otherwise, the boss is victorious.

Beat Easy.,
Beat Medium.,
Beat Hard.,
Beat Expert.",How to Beat Guitar Hero 2," This is of Course the easiest level out there. You only need to use Green, Yellow and Red in the level. This is highly recommended for first time/ new players who want to get used to the game. It is okay to fail you're first few songs. Almost everyone does.;
, Medium is more difficult than easy. In this level in addition to having to worry about red yellow and green, You must now use the blue button. Not too hard though. The speed of the game is a little faster, and there are a few more notes that easy. But you should be fine after a few tries. Not Recommended, but not impossible for first time players.

, This level is a lot more crazy that Easy and Medium. Hard introduces the orange button, witch makes you use every button at some point in every song. A pretty fast note speed, and there are even more notes to hit. With more notes to hit, the less mistakes you can make before you fail. Definitely not recommended for first time players, And would be very difficult for first timers to keep up with the pace on hard.

, The hardest of the levels. Absolutely crazy. There are no more buttons to be introduced in expert, But the notes move very fast. Also there are many notes that come so close to each other They look impossible to hit both. But it is possible. It will take you a while to get to Expert. And it feels like a long jump from Hard to expert but just keep trying. Pretty much impossible for first time players.

Start up GH3.",How to Add Custom Songs to Guitar Hero 3 PC," You will also need to download either 7Zip, WinRar, WinZip, or other file extracting software if you do not already have one downloaded (won't go into detail on how to use file extracting software). The file extracting software will be used to extract the files for GHTCP.


Download GHTCP here, located in the intro section of the thread: http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=72367

Download the GH3 1.31 patch here: http://www.patches-scrolls.com/guitar_hero3.php

Download Microsoft .NET Framework by searching the Microsoft download main site: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx
;
, To install GHTCP, run GHTCP.msi or setup.exe (it isn't necessary to run both), and complete the installation process.

, On your first time using it (and sometimes even after your first use), a disclaimer/user agreement will pop up, and you will click ""I ACCEPT"". Once the control panel is opened, go to file, and under file, click on ""Open Game Settings"". A list will pop up with ""Guitar Hero III"" and different languages. Choose ""Guitar Hero III (English)"", and click OK. After several seconds, your game's song list should load. Now, you will learn how to add custom songs to the game. It's suggested that you use the FretsOnFire website to find songs to add to the game, as FretsOnFire has the most extensive list of song downloads, and you will have to do as little work as necessary to download songs from the site.

, It is necessary to create an account to access the forums to download custom songs.


FoF Forums: http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/


, This is where you will find all of the custom songs. You can either browse through the various threads which contain other users' custom songs, or to make it more simple, which it is suggested you do, you can go to the ""SONGS DATABASE"" thread, which is stickied and located near the top of the page. In the original post, there is a link next to where it says ""custom songs:"". Click on it to access the FoF wiki which has a huge database of custom songs, listed from A-Z, 0-9, Packs, and Albums. Keep in mind that the A-Z and 0-9 are listed by Artist name, and not song name. In the next steps, you will be shown how to download a song and add it to your GH3PC using the GHTCP.

, Some of the download links will take you to a download/dropbox site where you can download the file, while others will take you to the thread which contains the song download. The song used for an example is ""Nottingham Lace"" by Buckethead. Under ""B"", you will scroll down to find the artist Buckethead, and the song Nottingham Lace. Notice that there are multiple links for the same song. Click on the link next to ""Puppetz"". The link will take you to a separate forum, which contains FoF user Puppetz. Located under ""My Official Career Packs"", click on ""Puppetz Hero Zero""; this will take you to another thread with a setlist of songs from PHZ. Scroll down to the list of songs, and find Nottingham Lace once again, and click on the download link on the right. This will take you to an external site where you can download the song .zip file. Download the song from the external website. You will again need to use your file extractor to extract the files from the download into another folder.

, Find the ""Add"" tab, click on it, and under that, click on ""New Song"". This will open a pop up where you will add the song files.


If you are following the example, type in ""nottinghamlace"" in the Song Name section. After that, go down to where it says ""Guitar Track"", and click on the ""..."" to the right of that. Now you will locate the folder where you extracted the song files to. Open the guitar.ogg file from that folder. You can preview the guitar.ogg below to make sure the file works properly. Next, go down to ""Chart File"", and click on the ""..."" to the right of it. Open the notes.mid file from the same folder. Once these steps are completed, click on ""Apply"" in the top right of the pop up. This will take you to another pop up, ""Song Properties"".
Here, you will enter the song title, Artist, and Year (optional). Once this is done, click on ""Apply"" once again. The song should now be added to the GHTCP. Next, you will add that song to the in-game setlist using GHTCP.

, On the main screen of the GHTCP, right under the tabs at the top, you will have another row where it says ""Setlist:"". For this example, a separate new setlist will be created to add the song to. Click on ""Create Setlist"". Next, you will name your setlist whatever you'd like to name it, and you will name the tier where you will be adding the song to. Once you name these, locate your song in the song list to the left, and drag the song over to ""Tier Songs"". Next to ""Default Unlocked Songs"", click on the ""="". This allocates space in the game for the song that you are adding (in the picture it shows 0 for default unlocked songs, but it should say 1). Once all of this is done, click on BOTH ""Apply Tier Changes"" and ""Apply Setlist Changes"". The next step will be one of the most important steps which you must not forget to do.

, Under the File tab, click on ""Execute Actions"". This will execute every action you have done so far on GHTCP. Click on yes to execute actions. This opens another pop up which shows the progress on applying all of your changes. This may take a minute or two, so be patient. Once everything is done processing, close the pop up. You are now ready to start up GH3, and complete the final steps!

, When you get to the main menu screen, you may have noticed that there is a new option: ""Custom Menu"". This was added to the game with GHTCP. There are a lot of cool features to use within this custom menu, but the one that you are going to use for this tutorial is the ""Setlist Switcher"".


Go to that menu, and you will notice that it lists all of the in-game setlists like ""Quickplay"" and ""Bonus"". Go to the ""Download"" setlist, and scroll down through that until you find your newly created setlist. Once this is done, MAKE SURE TO PRESS THE ORANGE BUTTON. The game will not change to the new setlist unless you press this button. Once this is done, go back to the main menu, and it will save these changes.
Go to Quickplay, and then go to the ""Download"" setlist. If everything went right, the new setlist and the song that you added should be here. You are now ready to become a plastic guitar legend!

Get to know your guitar - while not being nearly as complicated nor as big as an actual electric guitar, your mini-guitar has sufficient features to make it a real challenge to play.,
Start up the game - Connect the guitar to your console.,
Play.,
Advanced techniques - there are a number of advanced techniques that you can use:


Star Power, alluded to above, as a quality which you increase if you play all of the notes successfully in a series of ""star notes"".",How to Play Guitar Hero," First and foremost is the strum bar, the two-directional switch in the center of the guitar. You push or pull this up or down in order to play a note. The note which you play is determined by pressing some combination of the five fret buttons on the guitar's neck. They are colored for quicker identification. Near the strum bar is a whammy bar, a small stick which you can move in order to modulate the sound produced by an extended note. Finally, the usual Start and Select buttons from normal controllers have been formed as fake volume and tone knobs. Just don't try to turn the volume down with them.


If you're right handed, use your left hand to hold the guitar's neck with your three or four fingers placed over each of the fret buttons; keep your right hand on or near the strum bar. Left-handed people may just do the opposite, though you will also have to accommodate the whammy bar.
If you play sitting down, then you can rest the guitar in your lap; but if you want to play standing up, you will probably want to use the strap provided.
Take a while to get used to holding the guitar comfortably, something that you may find yourself doing a lot!
If you want, personalize your guitar using the stickers provided with the game. It's your instrument!;
, Turn on your TV, your console, your sound system (if applicable) and put the game disk into the disk tray. If you're using a Playstation 2 to play, you'll probably want to use a memory card to save your high-scores and unlocked songs.


If you're playing career mode for the first time, you need to come up with a name for your band. Be as inventive as you like, it isn't the most important decision that you'll ever make.
The main option screen will give you a number of options: Career, Quick Play, Multi-player, Training and Options.

Career is where the bulk of the game's fun lies - playing up to 35 songs across four difficulty levels allow you to accumulate cash, kudos and fame; the completion of each set of songs increasing your status, allowing you to play at a new venue and unlock a new set of five songs. Your earnings allow you to ""purchase"" unlocked options such as new guitars, songs and characters.

Quick Play allows you to play any of the songs that you have unlocked on Career mode (10 are unlocked by default) at any difficulty level as a single experience. It includes a high-score table.

Multi-player will be unavailable unless you have two controllers plugged in. It is possible to use a standard controller with Guitar Hero if you really want to. A second guitar controller is available individually, or else a friend may also have the game whom you can play with. In Guitar Heroes 2 and 3, there are multiple modes of play. Face-off splits the songs notes between two players (like the legacy Guitar Hero 1 play), while Pro Face-off allows both players to play the song as they would in Quick Play mode. Guitar Hero 3 also features a ""battle"" mode, where you use ""battle power"" to try to make the other player fail the song.

Tutorial is a great introduction to how to play the game; giving you experience with playing the simplest of notes outside of the pressure of a full song. There are multiple tutorials, and it's recommended that you play through each tutorial sequentially. This how to introduces play from first principles and, though playing the tutorials is certainly beneficial and more visual, this guide assumes that the player hasn't.

Options - important if you have wide-screen or need to change something. A very important option here is lefty-flip which you will want to turn on if you are left-handed and pressing the fret buttons with your right hand - it will make reorient the notes on the screen to your perspective.

,


The best way to get used to playing is by having a crack at a song; and the simplest songs are the songs at the very beginning of the set list. If you already have a good sense of rhythm or musical background, you should try playing the Medium difficulty level first. Easy will likely be TOO easy for you. Start playing by going to the main menu and selecting ""Quick Play"" or ""Career"" and then choose the first song in the set list.
After a loading screen which will consist of a helpful message and last few words of advice, which could either be pertaining to playing the game or entirely unrelated; you will be greeted by a spiraling view of the venue that you're playing in, the band that you're a member of and your (randomly selected, if playing Quick Play) avatar holding a guitar. A board will then appear in the lower middle of the screen, along with two structures in the lower corners.

The main bit, and the key to your success, is the scrolling fret board in the middle of the screen. On this, notes are positioned with colors corresponding to the colors of the fret buttons on your guitar; their position on screen also reflects their position on the neck (i.e. the green key will always scroll down on the far left of the board - or right if lefty-flip is on). At the bottom of the screen are a number of unsaturated colored circles; pressing one of the fret buttons lights up the corresponding circle.
On the lower left is your score, and ""score multiplier"". You receive a certain number of points for each note you hit, but stringing together 10 successive notes will increase your score multiplier so that you get twice as many points per note. This increases up to a 4x bonus. If you miss a note, the multiplier is reset to 1x.
The lower right has a meter which shows the crowd's opinion of you. A needle will swing to the green when you're playing well and the crowd is loving you. The needle will swing into the red when you're playing poorly. If it goes too far into the red you will get booed off of the stage and have to restart the song. Above the meter is a bar which is your ""star power"" indicator - this is explained later.


On Easy mode, only the green, red, and yellow buttons are used. On Medium, the blue button is added. On Hard and Expert difficulties, all five colored buttons are used.
Colored notes will begin to scroll down from the top of the scrolling fret board. When you see the first note, hold down the corresponding fret button. When the note reaches the bottom of the screen level to the greyed out circles, strum using the strum bar. For each successive note, strum again. Other notes are played in exactly the same way: you press the corresponding buttons and strum when the note reaches the bottom of the screen - using the music's beat and melody will help you gauge when to play. Distilled to its most basic level - that's all there is to this game, strumming in time to the note while using the fret buttons to play the appropriate note. If you play too late or too early, you'll ""miss"" the note, hear a ghastly noise, and lose some popularity.
This will be extended by playing chords: here you have to press two or more of the fret buttons instead of one. Again, the buttons you press correspond with those denoted on screen.

Long notes are notes where the note is sustained after it has been played. They are denoted by a colored line trailing a note down the screen; and are played by holding down the appropriate fret button until the line has passed. After playing its initial note, you do not need to strum again. Instead, you can use your strumming hand to operate the whammy bar and distort or sustain.
That's it! Play the notes that are requested on screen. Don't be put off if you fail on your first few attempts, because it takes a while to get used to playing competently. Working through songs progressively, regardless of how badly you feel that you are doing, and how low the scores you scrape through with are, will make you better - even though you don't realize it. As soon as you feel confident that you can string a few notes together, hop onto career mode and play through some songs. They won't be any harder here.

, These notes appear in the shape of spinning stars rather than circles, and often appear in the more grandiose pieces of music. If there is a long star note, using the whammy bar on this will give you extra star power. Try to nail these if you can! If you get enough of it (the meter fills up beyond its mark), you can ""use"" it and enter star power mode by briefly tilting up your guitar or pressing the Select button. This will temporarily double the points that you get from each note, and drastically increase the rate that your popularity rises; so try to use it when there are lots of consecutive notes. Also, once you enter Star Mode, there is no exiting it until the power meter drains out, so wait until there are notes coming up or your Star Power will be wasted. You can also use Star Power to help you get through tough parts of songs that you can't get through otherwise.
Hammer-ons and Pull-offs, Looking closely at the notes moving up the screen, you'll see that some notes are different than others. Normal notes have a hollow, black center, while ""hammer-on"" notes have a filled-in, white center. To simulate real guitar playing, some sequences of notes can be played by hammering-on or pulling-off: Simply strum normally for the black-center note (the first note in the sequence), and just press the correct button for the filled-in notes at the right time. ""Hammer-on"" notes will register as correctly played as long as you time it correctly. Try to perfect this technique, since eventually, on the most difficult songs, notes become too fast and close together to strum accurately.
Whammying, If you can hit long notes, then you can use the whammy bar. On long notes (sustains), move the whammy bar up and down. Make sure you whammy on the star power sustains, you'll get more Star Power in your meter! Whammying does not give you any advantage on normal held notes, it's just fun to do.

Make sure you're running at your full speed.,
Plan your paths accordingly.,
Dress your character in lighter armour.,
Keep your weight capacity as low as possible.,
Keep your weapons holstered.",How to Run Faster in Fallout 31," This may sound extremely obvious, but it's nonetheless worthwhile to make sure you're already running as fast as you can. This is especially pertinent for PC users, as the Caps Lock button can mean the difference between walking and running. Keeping the Caps Lock button activated should keep you running while you're using the directional keys. For console systems, ensuring you're pushing the control stick as far as it can go will maximize your speed. Again, this may sound painfully obvious, but there are rare cases where a controller may not be working to one's complete satisfaction.;
, While it doesn't necessarily affect your real speed, if you're trying to run somewhere fast, you should pay attention to the smartest way to get there. Running up steep surfaces won't get you somewhere nearly as fast as smooth pavement. Outside of Washington DC, Fallout 3's open world is generally pretty easy to navigate, so try to make the most direct route to wherever you're going.


At the same time, you should take care to avoid enemy-heavy areas; if you're trying to move as efficiently as possible, getting into fights will only serve to slow you down.

, As is true for all Bethesda RPGs, the type of armour you wear will have a notable effect on your movement speed. A light armour, like leather armour, will keep you moving briskly. Better still, you can go without armour completely for maximum speed.


Also keep in mind that armour tends to have a big weight associated with it. Not only will wearing a heavy armour slow you down, the weight attached will bog down your weight capacity considerably.
On the other hand, some sets of armour like Power Armour come with a Strength bonus, which in turn will help boost your weight capacity.

, One of the most common speed-related complaints in Fallout 3 is the speed penalty you get from carrying too much equipment. If you're finding your speed bogged down, try dropping or selling some of your supplies. Before too long, you should find your character running at a better rate.


Aim to discard junk items and extra sets of armour, as they tend to be the heaviest items in the game.

, Your character will be slowed down naturally if you have any weapons out. Try to make a habit of holstering your weapons whenever you're not using them. A hefty portion of the game's not going to require constant use of weapons, so while you might want that extra bit of caution, in most cases it's unnecessary.


You can holster your weapon by holding the Reload button.
Keep in mind that two-handed weapons (e.g. rifles, flamethrowers) will slow you down more than one-handed weapons, like pistols.
If you're still worried about downtime while you're drawing a weapon, you can get the Quick Draw perk, which will make the holster/draw process 50% faster. "

Keep in mind that an imbalanced character can incur its own challenges. Attribute points you're giving to Agility will be coming out of somewhere else, so it's recommended you take the time to consider whether speed is important making the game more difficult in other areas.

, Weight capacity is calculated via several factors, not least of all being your character's Strength attribute. Setting a high Strength will mean your character can hold significantly more before having to slow down.


Choosing the ""Strong Back"" perk later in the game will also significantly help the weight carry issue. , Command codes only work if you're working with a PC; however, they're the fastest way you can increase a character's speed. First, press the ~ key, then type ""fmoverunmult #"", with the number standing in for whatever speed you choose. This technically counts as cheating, but if you're looking for a simple way of increasing speed, command codes are just the thing.


Inputting ""player.modav carryweight #"" and changing your weight capacity will solve any issues if you're constantly going over your weight limit.

, Again, this technically counts as cheating, but there are mods out there for virtually every issue in Fallout 3. Look on some of the Fallout 3-specific and modding websites. There are several speed-altering mods available for the PC. "

When engaging opponents in V.A.T.S, always scroll through the various target points.,

Having trouble in a particularly difficult fight?,
Get the first shot.,
Ammunition can be hard to come by in the wasteland.,
Out exploring and looking for signs of civilization?",How to Play Fallout 3," Occasionally an enemy will be wearing a grenade on their belt, and one well-placed shot will turn them into ground chuck. But in case no grenade always go for the head, for an awesome bullet through the brain and maybe a slow-mo bullet shot.;
, If you see them while you're exploring the wasteland, tail them for a while. Chances are they'll get into a fight or two. While they can hold their own for a while, eventually they'll be overtaken. Now's your chance to swoop in and take the pickings from their fresh corpses with no loss of karma. Hey, life is tough in the wasteland, and even the holiest of the holy would do the same to you.Just remember, they won't be using it anymore, anyway. Note that if a trader falls, this also means the caravan will no longer be accessible in the wasteland. Oh, and don't forget to grab the trader's key and loot his Brahman...all in the name of survival, of course.

, While pickpocketing someone, drop a spare grenade in their pocket. It's like the Fourth of July, only with all ten fingers blown off.

, Stay behind cover and let them come to you. Bullets can't hurt you if they can't hit you, and never underestimate the power of a close range shotgun blast to the face as your enemy comes looking for you.

, Getting the first shot is a big advantage. If you suspect there's a nearby foe, crouch and tap the V.A.T.S. activation key repeatedly as you look around. If they're in your field of vision, V.A.T.S. will detect them. Remember that you score an automatic critical for massive damage if you can hit an opponent without them sensing your presence.

, Be sure to carry a variety of weapons that use different ammo types so you'll never have to depend on a single bullet caliber or power source. You can also conserve ammo by using bats, sledge hammers, shish kebabs, and other melee weapons when you're close to easy or wounded opponents.

, Try following old roads, rivers, and those rows of destroyed power line towers you see dotting the landscape as they can be good guides for places of interest.

Avoid perks that raise Skills.,
Avoid perks that focus exclusively on reducing RAD damage.,
Avoid the Computer Whiz and Infiltrator perks.,
Choose the Comprehension perk.,
Balance your skills.,
Plot out which perks you'll get and at what levels you'll get them.",How to Make the Most of Leveling Up in Fallout 3," When you set your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points during the intro, increase Intelligence to 9 -- no more, no less. Intelligence determines how many Skill Points will be available for distribution whenever you level up. With an Intelligence of 9, you'll have 19 Skill Points to freely distribute any way you see fit whenever you level up.


You might be wondering, ""Why set Intelligence to 9 when I can set it to 10?"" The answer is because the Intelligence bobblehead can be obtained in the Science Lab at Rivet City (located on the southeast corner of the map). It is highly recommended that you obtain the bobblehead as soon as you exit Vault 101.;
, Perks that fall under this category include Gun Nut, Little Leaguer, and Tag!. Pass up these perks for something more useful, as these skill-raisers quickly become redundant once the Comprehension perk has been obtained. (See Step 5 for more details.)

, Perks that fall under this category include Lead Belly and Rad Resistance. These perks are hardly useful in most cases, as there simply aren't that many instances in the game which would require intense radiation protection. This is compounded by the fact that Rad-X and Rad-Away are plentiful throughout the game, from either various merchants or in the Wasteland. There are also doctors who will completely remove radiation effects for about 100 caps, or for free with the My First Infirmary housing improvement.

, Available at Level 18, these perks grant you one more chance to hack a locked terminal or pick a broken lock, respectively. The only problem is, unless virtually every terminal is locked or every lock is broken, these perks are pointless. It is easy to avoid locking down a terminal or breaking a lock in the first place by simply exiting the mini-game and restarting it. Upon restarting it, you'll have four attempts to hack a terminal (though the password is randomly generated), and the pick will be at full strength. Never force open a lock unless there is a 100% chance of success.

, Available at Level 4, this perk grants 2 skill points (rather than 1) for every skill book read. There are special books for every skill that, when read, will permanently increase that corresponding skill. On average, there are 25 of each of these books. With Comprehension, that equates to an extra 50 points (more or less) for every skill without having to spend skill points at the level up screen (which is why skill-raising perks are worthless). It is highly recommended you take this perk as soon as it becomes available.


Take the time to scour the Wasteland for these skill books. While they can be tricky at times to obtain, they are well worth it. With this perk and the skill books, you'll notice your character become more powerful in less time.
Do not read any skill books before the Comprehension perk has been acquired. Save them and make them count for when they grant you 2 skill points.

, Because of the generous amount of skill increases that Comprehension provides, focus less on specializing and more on creating a balance of power. Don't let one skill get drastically higher or lower than the others; patience will pay off soon enough.

, This will probably be the most daunting task you'll face. It can be challenging to prioritize which perks will be most beneficial to your style of play, but you must consider realistically how often you'll be using a specific perk. If a perk won't be put to use often, you may want to consider choosing something you'll use more frequently.


Be aware that many perks have certain statistical requirements, such as having Charisma or Barter at a certain level before the perk becomes available. Keep these in mind before leaving Vault 101.

Raise your Science level.,
Get familiar with the hacking interface.,
Select a word as your first guess.,
Determine how many characters are correct.,
Choose the next word.,
Use bracket tricks before moving on to the third word.,
Choose a third word.,
Don't try the fourth attempt right away.",How to Hack a Computer Terminal in Fallout 3," Your Science level determines which terminals you can even attempt to hack. You can add points to your Science level whenever you level up, and you can pop Mentats to get temporary a temporary boost. The scientist's labcoat from the quest ""Those"" will give you a +10 to Science when you are wearing it. You can put up to 100 points in Science, and there are five different tiers of hacking difficulties. You cannot attempt to hack terminals that you do not meet the requirements for:


Very Easy - 0
Easy - 25
Average - 50
Hard - 75
Very Hard - 100;
, When you interact with a terminal that you can hack, you'll be taken to the hacking screen. The top of the screen will tell you how many attempts you have left. The bottom of the screen will be a garbled mess, and you'll be able to make out a variety of words among the random characters. These words are potential passwords, and you'll need to guess the correct one before you run out of tries. Words may wrap down to the next line, and all of the potential words will be the same length.

, Try to pick a word that has lots of unique letters in it, as this will make it easier to narrow down the potential candidates. If you get lucky and select the correct word right away, you're good to go. If the word is not the correct password, you'll be shown a number.


A higher Science skill will reduce the number of words that you have to choose from.

, When a password fails, you'll see a readout telling you how many characters were correct and in the right position. For example, a 4/9 would mean that four of the letters in the chosen word were the correct letter in the correct place. There could be more correct letters in the word, but they don't count if they weren't in the right position.

, Compare the word that you selected to the words remaining on the screen, and try to narrow them down. For example, if you got a 3/12, and the word you selected is CONSTRUCTION, the other words will need to have three letters in the same place. There's a good chance that the other word ends in ION, as it is a common ending. Select the next word that you think could fit to see the results., One of the keys to successfully hacking is using ""bracket tricks"". If the terminal contains a bracket pair, removing it will get rid of incorrect choices or add tries back to your counter. This is why it's recommended that you save the brackets until you've made a few guesses so that you don't waste potential retries. Bracket pairs appear at random, though more tend to show up with a higher Science skill.Brackets are {}, [], <>, and (). The bracket pairs can contain any number of characters between them.
The easiest way to find a bracket pairs is to slowly move your cursor across every character on the terminal screen. Bracket pairs and all of the characters in between will automatically be highlighted.
You may want to save a bracket pair or two in case you need them before your last attempt.

, If the brackets haven't helped and you haven't chosen the correct word in the first two chances, you should at least have a better idea of what letters are in the correct space. Compare the results from the two words that you've already chosen and see if you can determine the letters that are supposed to be there. Use this comparison to pick the next word.

, If you get the fourth try wrong, you will be locked out of the terminal completely. The only way to open the terminal after being locked out is to find an item in the world that contains the password, which you can't find for all computers. There are a few different things you can try when you reach your fourth attempt:


Use any remaining bracket tricks. If you've saved any brackets, you can use them now to try to get another try added back to your tally, or to remove enough options so that you know which word to pick.
Exit the terminal and start over. When you leave the terminal by clicking the power button, you can reset the process. The words will be shuffled and you'll be starting from scratch, but you'll get all of your tries back and won't get locked out.
Blindly try to guess the fourth word. This is rarely recommended, due to the fact that you can easily lock yourself out. Consider exiting and retrying instead.

You can see Megaton in the distance after you leave the vault at the beginning of the game. It is a large structure with nothing around it, so it sticks out very well.


You will not come across any enemies when you make this small trip.;
, Once you have located Megaton, head east towards the D.C. area. You will come across the Super-Duper Mart. You will see the backside of the store when walking towards it. Just beyond the Super-Duper Mart is a major river flowing through the D.C area.

, Continue heading east until you reach the river. You will need to find a way to cross this river, either by bridge or by simply swimming across. If you cross by bridge, keep an eye out for landmines, as they can deal a ton of damage.


Swimming across the river will inflict radiation. Be as quick as you can to reduce the risk of radiation poisoning.

, Once you have crossed the river, follow it south until you reach the southern part of the D.C. area. Eventually you’ll see the Jefferson Memorial in the distance.


You may encounter strong enemies such as Super Mutants or raiders along the river during this trip. It is recommended that you are well-equipped before venturing to this part of the ruins in D.C. Being equipped with leather armor and some sort of ranged weapon such as a plasma pistol will protect you in the Wasteland.

, Follow the water until you begin to see a large ship. Avoid approaching the Memorial itself, as it is crawling with Super Mutants.

, This is the only massive ship which is beached. The ship is split in two and the back end is where Rivet City is located.

, As you come closer to Rivet City, you will need to locate the bridge on the right side that allows you to cross onto the beached ship. The only way to board the ship is by a small structure with stairs leading up to the bridge platform.

, Once you are at the top of this metal structure, click on the Intercom at the top of the platform. A bridge located on the aircraft carrier will swing over to the platform you are on. Cross this bridge to enter Rivet City.

, You can either go through the door directly facing you which leads to the market, or enter the door on your left which will lead to the inner city. The inner city features the bar, the science lab, houses, and the ship church.

Perfect S.P.E.C.I.A.L.,
Perfect your skills.,
Perfect your Perks.,
Looting.,
Go exploring.",How to Be an Awesome Fallout 3 Player," SPECIAL is basically a nickname for the 7 main stats your character has. At the beginning of the game you get to choose your SPECIAL. You get 40 points between them (note: This is the only time you can choose them). The maximum for one stat is 10. The higher the number is, the better the ability is. The 7 skills of Special are strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. Every main stat gives your character little boosts in certain skills like Speech or Small Guns. Each of the 7 skills also gives you special abilities.


Strength gives your character the ability of being able to carry more stuff and increases your melee weapon damage (but not your unarmed damage).
Perception gives you the ability to detect enemies from a farther distance on your compass.
Endurance gives your character additional health and determines you natural resistance to radiation and poison, as well as your lung capacity (only useful for diving).
Charisma increases disposition of NPCs and gives your character higher speech skills.
Intelligence gives you more skills points every time you level up than normal. (This is probably the most influential S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat, as it accelerates the players scaling versus the enemies.)
Agility increases your amount of action points (which are used in V.A.T.S.).
Luck will increase your chances to win a critical hit and it increases your skills by half a point every time you add a point to it.;
, Every time you level up you get to distribute a certain amount of points between your 13 skills. Those skills are Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, Melee Weapons, Explosives, Medicine, Sneak, Lockpick, Science, Repair, Barter, and Speech. Your SPECIAL stats help increase these skills as well do perks and distributing your points. Skill books (value 50, weight 2) increase a skill by one point (or two points with the right perk), there are ~20-25 skill books of every type in the game, so you can max every skill.


It's recommended that you max skills that fit your playstyle. A heavy armored bruiser, who wants to gun down everything, doesn't need speech, while a speech oriented character probably won't need heavy weaponry.
Science and Lockpicking are normally only used for locked terminals and locks. It's adviced to get multiples of 25 in those skills, as the mini games are locked at 25/50/75/100 skill level (e.g. 74 won't allow you to pick a hard lock, which has the requirement 75).
Skill soft caps that should be met rather sooner than later are Repair 45 and Explosives 30.
Heavy weapons usually don't matter in early game, as high maintenance costs and rare ammunition limit them. It's adviced to skill into small guns, energy weapons (might need merchants to supply the ammo in the early game) or melee.
Barter kind of irrelevant, unless you need money for repairs and ammo. Yet you can easily maintain a higher quality of your gear than merchants could.

, Each time you level up you get to pick between one perk. As you level up more, more perks become available for your use. Some perks give you increased skills. While some give you the ability to use your words to get members of the opposite sex to do things for you! There's pretty much a perk for everything in the game.

, Try not to take too much so you don't become over-encumbered, but if you ever find yourself inside a house remember to take anything useful. This includes things such as:


Stimpacks/medicine/stealth boys
Ammo
Grenades/mines
Weapons (just grab all, and once you get over-encumbered repair your stuff or drop the lowest value ratio)
Cigarettes (single, pack and carton)
Pre-war money and pre-war books
Quest items/files.
Anything weightless or with a value ratio of 25 caps per weight

, Never just do the main storyline and finish the game as quick as possible. There is no rush, not once are you timed. Just go around and explore. Pick up items. Pick up food. There is much to find in Fallout 3. Fallout games are loved not just because of their storyline but also because of the wide range of activities available.

When you are in an Underground Metro Station, search every room for a metro ticket.,
Find the Protectron and activate it, either by going to a terminal and hacking it to start the Protectron, or just opening the Protectron-Pod.

Some instruments, like the microphone, require less skill to master. Other instruments, however, can only be mastered if you have good timing tapped deep into your soul. Although they are harder, they're usually more fun. Choose either the microphone, the drums, the guitar or the bass before continuing.;
, It may sound strange, but you have to walk before you can run and you have to crawl before you can walk. To start crawling, beat the game on easy. Try to get at least 95% on each song. Make sure that you don't slack though, the next difficulty will be too hard if you do. Just play through each song on your chosen instrument until you've got it. If it helps, go into practice mode.

, Now that you can crawl, you have to learn how to walk. To get walking, beat the game on medium. The same rule applies, aim to get 95% or more on every song. This may take a little bit longer than the last step but every minute you play will ready you for the higher difficulties. Practice mode can be a huge help here as you can slow down the song to play it at a comfortable speed. You probably won't need to practice if you're just singing though.

, Yes, you guessed it. After walking, comes running. To get yourself on track, beat the game on hard. Because you're still trying to get 95% or more on each song, this step may take quite some time. It's best to try a song until you get 95% or more rather than completing the game and coming back to it later. If you correctly followed the last two steps, you should be pretty comfortable playing through the songs. Don't worry if you're not, just go into practice mode to help you out.

, Now that you've learnt to crawl, walk and run, you should be sprinting in no time. Even though you've already reached your goal of getting to expert mode; you should still be trying to get 95% or more on each song. You've come this far, don't start slacking now. If you mastered the other three difficulties, you should know what to expect. You should also be taking it quite well. You may have noticed that you can complete songs that you couldn't complete before. This is because you practiced skills like speed, precision, patience and timing. Without these skills, expert mode is going to hurt. If you're still not taking it well, head into practice mode and try there.

Cut one of the mending plates in half.,
Drill a pair of 1/4"" holes through the pedal with the drill press or electric hand drill, after measuring with the mending plate that is still intact.,
Put the plates on both sides of the bottom hole.,Secure the top of the mending plate with the other nut and bolt, which will hold the top of the plate in place.,
You're ready to rock again.

",How to Repair a Broken Rock Band Pedal," That half will be going underneath the pedal, so the top plate will stay in place, but will be short enough to not interfere with the spring that bounces the pedal back into place after you press it with your foot.
, Be VERY careful here. Don't drill through and of the ribbing on the underside of the pedal. Chances are you will have to drill through the orange, so make sure the hole is in a place that will not affect the movements of the pedal. If you don't have a drill press or an electric drill, ask one of your friends that does. If you're still in school, your school or university/college probably has a shop, ask the teacher if you could use the machines. It's a good idea to use either clamps or a friend to hold down the pedal while you make the holes.

, Put the bolt through the hole and secure it in place with the nut. Be careful not to over tighten the bolt, or you run the risk of breaking the pedal. Again.

Play your instrument well.,
Learn decent material to play.,
Note that almost all rock is blues and jazz based (deathmetal/screamo being the exception sometimes), so learn your blues and jazz scales/chords.,
Play loud but be clear.,
Get quality gear.,
Be considerate of your bandmates.",How to Play the Guitar in a Rock Band," Most rock is electric guitar driven so focus on having a tight sound because you are the sound!;
, The material you learn will be very important. Depending on what type of rock you want to play. Look through classic rock, blues, jam bands, etc. To prepare for a try-out for this type of band, listen to giants of these genres.


It's also important to dig to the roots of the music you like. If you want to play metal you should know how metal started, who its founders were, and when they played (for example, if you like Widespread or Phish, you should know something about the Grateful Dead). This is important because your band will most likely end up covering a lot of the songs you've heard.

, Understanding these thoroughly will greatly help your knowledge of music theory.

, Loud is good, but not being able to understand the words or hear the bassline because your gain is on 11 isn't. And remember, you will be able to understand the words better than the audience because you know all the songs.


If you have 2 guitarists, make sure to variate your chord voicings (positions) so you aren't playing the same riff and the other guy except during solos.

, Pedals and processors and be a good thing but before you go spend $1000 on that make sure you have a legit guitar and amp 1st. For blues, rock, country, jam bands, and reggae, an all tube amp is recommended. Not so much for metal and hardcore.


Whether you have a guitar now or not, research how different guitars are suited for different styles. Strats and Les Paul's for blues, Tele's for country/folk or whatever. You don't want to cover metallica with a semi-hollow body Ibanez.

, It's all good if you have to cover a song you don't like. And if you take nothing else from this just remember IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC!

, Don't keep your foot on the upbeat whenever it's not playing. Rest it by keeping it pressed down when there isn't a note for the bass. Also, practice with shoes and take them off when you're attempting during a show.

, Have your foot on the pedal with the balls of your feet on the edge of the top of the pedal. It increases stamina and responds faster. Keep your heel up!

, Use the same stick weight at all times. It is recommended to use a 5A weight and size. Practicing with heavy sticks, then not playing with the heavy sticks will hurt you more than help you.

Choose your weapon.,
Know your school.,
Always write your own songs.,
Be authentic.,
Be reckless.,
Innovate.,
Go out and play.",How to Become a Noise Rock Musician," To play Noise Rock, you must first know what instruments you can play. For example, the classic ones are, of course, guitar, drums, bass and vocals. But we're in a brand new musical era, so you can play keyboards, make your own mixes like Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails or any innovation you can create, like an alternative drum set made from old junk. Use your noisy imagination.;
, Of course you know Noise Rock isn't new. Bands like the Butthole Surfers (at least until Hairway to Steven), Scratch Acid, Glazed Baby, Big Black, Jesus Lizard, and some of the Melvins' material are great places to start, but it also helps to remember that more conventional bands like the Grateful Dead, Black Flag, Iggy Pop and Nirvana (at least for Bleach and parts of In Utero) either influenced or dabbled in what could be considered noise rock; study them, catch the vibe on their songs, the way the lyrics are written and the dissonance in their music, and go from there.

, They don't need to be philosophical or save the world at the note. You write about the things you know the way you know it. If you want to be a noise rock musician, you must feel some noise that wants to go out, let it out in a song, in words and noise itself writing your own original songs. What leads us to the next step.

, Maybe the most important thing is that you have to be yourself. One admired thing about Noise Rock it's the authentic of their musicians. There's no other goal that take your instrument and go out on stage with only one mission: ROCK OUT! money doesn't matter anymore, just go out there bathed in spit and beer and rock!

, Let your inner beast go out for a walk on the stage. Imagine that the things in this world that makes us fail as humanity all compressed in your strings or drums and then play the brains out of it, perhaps destroying the whole instrument against your amplifier in the process.

, That's for sure. You can be noisiest rock band in the world, but if you don't innovate, you'll be dead. So make sure that your band is always fresh, new instruments, new ways of writing songs and new way of tuning. Be in constant change. Avant garde it, baby.

, After you made your own songs, go out and search for a bar, friend's house or any party. Any place where you can play will do, jam nights, open mic nights, you got to innovate that too!

Take it easy on playing drums, you need to practice and hear the song well.,
Start off on Easy.,

Choose a guitarist with good dexterity and a sense of rhythm.",How to Assign Instruments in Rock Band,";
,, Take turns at first, while everybody is learning.

, Enjoyment can go a long way toward motivating people to keep at it and practice enough to get good.

, Drums require a lot of attention and coordination, not to mention energy. The higher the level, the more complex the drum part will become.

, The vocals are scored based on pitch, rhythm, and (to some extent) how accurately the words are pronounced.

, Remember that a second guitarist can play bass if you have a second guitar. The bass parts tend to be a little bit easier than the lead guitar parts.

Understand what normal strumming is.,
Go into practice mode, and find a song with long, repetitive passages, example: Paranoid by Black Sabbath.,
Alternative strum by strumming up and down.,
Practice!",How to Alternative Strum in Rock Band," Normal strumming usually involves pressing down on the strum bar with your thumb to strum a note, or much more rarely, using your fingers to strum upward, like how one would play on a bass guitar.;
, Play it just one speed notch underneath what is comfortable for you.

, Hold the strum bar with your thumb and index fingers, and strum up and down in a pattern, typically Down Up Down Up Down Up Down Up... well, you understand.

, You should always practice songs like this if you're having difficulty. Some people-like the author-are too hyper to alternative strum a song to the point of a x4 multiplier or x6 multiplier on the first try. If you're like that, Practice Mode is a must.

, When you're ready, move on to hard mode.

, You will soon want to move on to expert, but you shouldn't do this until you feel your hands respond without thinking. This normally happens around the 3rd day you've been playing on hard mode. If it doesn't, just keep practicing. Remember that there are some people that have the rhythm already in their heads, and some that need rhythm to be introduced little by little.

Present the cake to the recipient.",How to Make a Rock Band Drum Set Cake," It really helps if you have a drum set. It doesn't matter if it's for Rock Band or Rock Band 2; for what counts, they're as good as the same.


Take a piece of cardboard the width of your drum set and two and a half times the depth of it and fold it about 45% over 55%, and then fold up the remainder. Tape it so you have an inclining stand.
While looking at your Rock Band drum set, or a good picture of one, consider where the yellow and blue cakes are going to be. These are the two inner cakes. There should be a gap if you are going to do the controller part, which this guide will cover.
Trace the four 9"" pans on the cardboard. It doesn't have to be perfect or centered, you just want to get a good idea where things will go.;
, One boxed mix will make two, so you can have two drum pads be one flavor and the other two be another, or they can all be the same.


When the second two 9"" cakes are baking, have the first two cooling on a wire cooling rack in the fridge. These two will be frosted first.

, This cake will make up the controller part in the middle and part of the foot pedal, but most will be scrap (snacks, hey...).

,


This article's original author's wife uses Wilton brand frosting dyes from a cake decorating kit, which she highly recommends to aspiring cake decorators, but while you may be able to wing it with regular food coloring, good luck finding black, which did come with the kit. You will need black for much of this project, so a kit would be a good idea. And it has other things which will make your task much easier.

You can also take a look at How to Make Black Food Coloring.


Divide the vanilla frosting into four bowls after setting aside a smaller portion. Use increasing amounts of dye until you find the depth of color which matches the pads on your drum set. The drum pads are, from left to right: Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. The fifth, smaller portion is orange; this is used on the bass pedal.
Dye the chocolate frosting black. It will take a lot of the black dye to darken the chocolate frosting. It may help to get the deepest, darkest chocolate frosting you can find to start with. But the drum pads and controller base are black, not brown like chocolate.

, Start at one end and hold one of the 9"" cakes over one corner, and carefully cut along the edge of the round cake. Now hold the same cake over the other side of what's becoming the controller part, and cut that side as well. When you set this piece between two of the round cakes, it will clearly form the middle piece.


There are actually smaller such pieces connecting Red and Yellow, as well as Blue and Green, but you can overlook these minor details. Forgetting the controller, however, would be wrong.

, Return them to the fridge when they are frosted.

,, Don't worry about the guide you traced; you should have a good idea now about how things will go.

,


This article's original author's wife used a #12 tip from the cake decorating kit with disposable frosting bags, and then a butter knife to flatten the rings around each pad.
You should now have four cakes, each with a colored ring around the top: One red, one yellow, one blue, and one green, henceforth to be called the red cake, yellow cake, and so on.

, Place the yellow cake on the left and the blue cake on the right, the edges of the cake touching the controller part. Now place the red cake to the left of and just forward of the yellow cake, and the green cake to the right of and just forward of the blue cake, as they are on the actual drum set.

, These directions are for the Xbox 360 version. Other editors who have Rock Band for the PlayStation and Wii platforms will have to elaborate on how to make the cake look more like those versions of the controller. Even if your drummer does not have an Xbox 360, they will probably appreciate the cake regardless.
#*At the top of the controller part, in the dead center, is the Xbox ""Guide"" button. This pulls up the system menu. Place a green M&M face down. If you have a small tool and a lot of patience, you can paint four triangles on the back with some white vanilla frosting to make it more authentic, but this isn't necessary.


On either side of the Guide button are two system buttons called Back and Start. Shove two brown M&Ms into the cake side first so only half is sticking out.
Below the Guide button and to the left is a standard directional pad. Do like you did for the Back and Start buttons, but with four brown M&Ms, and put them in a cross formation. (Actually the D-pad is grey; if you can get silver M&Ms they will work better for this.)
Below the Guide button and to the right are four action buttons, and they're the same color as the pads. (Little known fact: You can push these buttons instead of hitting the pads to play, but it's a lot harder!) The four buttons make a cross, just like the D-pad. Yellow is on top, blue is on the left, red is on the right, and green is at the bottom. These four should be face down as well. If you can get edible writing on them, you can add Y on yellow, X on blue, B on red, and A on green, if you like.
Finally, take an orange M&M and jam it in the back of the controller part. This is where the bass pedal's cord plugs in; you'll see on the real drum set the plug is orange.

, Trace the actual bass pedal's base onto a piece of paper and cut it out; also trace the pedal itself; cut that out.


Place the base template over the remaining cake and cut around, and then carefully cut the top half off, so the bass pedal cake base is about half an inch thick. Frost this and refrigerate for now.
Break apart the chocolate bars and melt them in a double boiler. A microwave can also be used in a pinch.
Arrange graham crackers on the pedal template, then cleverly break additional graham crackers to fill in the remaining shapes to add up to a graham cracker pedal.
Carefully transfer graham cracker pedal to wax paper, coat pieces with melted chocolate. Let solidify; turn and coat reverse side.
Additionally coat a piece of graham cracker (a half of a half) in chocolate; this will be used as the support.
Furthermore, if you want the bass pedal to appear broken (as the actual bass pedals commonly break) coat additional pieces in chocolate and arrange at the base. Insert the prop where, on the original pedal, the post is, and prop the chocolate graham cracker pedal up on the prop.
Frost the pedal with a strip of orange-dyed frosting about a third of the way from the top going the width of the pedal, just like the real one.
The pedal should remain frozen until the cake is ready to be presented.

, Two paper towel rolls, cut in half, can be used to elevate the stand, but do make sure they are even.

Press .",How to Duel in Red Dead Redemption," The West is a dangerous place, and conflicts are often settled by who has the fastest hand. There are a few ways that you may find yourself in a duel during your adventures:


Several story missions feature a duel, as well as a few of the Stranger quests.
You can get challenged to duels as you increase your Fame. The higher your Fame, the more likely you are to get challenged by someone looking to make a name for themselves. These challenges can happen as you are walking through the game's various towns and settlements. Fame can be increased by completing missions, jobs, and challenges, as well as winning at poker and killing enemies.
If you get caught cheating at poker, you'll may find yourself in a duel with the person you cheated against. If you're wearing the Elegant Suit and cheat at poker, you'll get into a duel every time you're caught.You may get challenged to a duel when you knock someone over with your horse, but this is much less common.;
, When you start a duel, you'll see two bars in the lower-right corner of the screen. The blue bar represents your score, while the red represents the opponents. In order to win the duel, you'll need to raise your bar before your opponent raises theirs. Targeting the head and chest, as well as marking shots at the appropriate time, will fill your bar quickly., LT / L2 when ""Draw!"" appears on the screen. This will unholster your gun. If you press the button to early, the camera will zoom out and it will be more difficult to hit your opponent.


You can also draw by flipping your Right Stick DOWN and then UP to simulate pulling the gun out of the holster.

, Time slows down as soon as you draw your weapon. You can slowly move the crosshairs using the Right Stick. Aim for the Head or Chest to fill your bar the quickest. You can also try to aim for your opponent's gun hand, which can disarm your opponent and increase your Honor.Avoid shooting the Stomach or Legs, as this will not fill the meter very much.
Note that you may not be able to disarm opponents during story duels.

, As you move the crosshair over the opponent, you'll see the color and size change. When it is large and red, the shots won't be worth as much. When it is small and white, the shots are worth the most.

, RB / R1 to mark the target. When the crosshairs are small and white, and you are aiming at the part of your opponent you want to shoot, press  RB / R1 to mark the target.


If you are aiming for the gun hand, a proper shot with a white crosshair will likely fill your bar in a single mark. This is a tough shot, so if you aren't able to hit it on your first two marks, consider making a quick shot for the head or chest so that you can still win the duel., With the revolver, you can mark your target up to six times. The number of available marks is determined by the gun you are using for the duel. Each time you make a mark, you'll see your bar increase. You don't need to fill the bar completely, you just need to have more filled than your opponent.

, RT / R2 when you are satisfied with your marks. This will end the duel, and if your bar is more full than your opponents, John will shoot the opponent in each of the places that you marked.


If you fill the bar completely or use all of your bullets, the duel will finish automatically.

, This will bring up an inventory screen with ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" sections. Select ""Buy.""

, Typically, the more expensive a horse deed is, the faster and more robust the horse is. Horse speed is ranked by a star system, where more stars means the horse is faster and fewer means the horse is slower. These are the prices and star ranks of each horse breed that is available to buy:


Three-star horses such as the Kentucky Saddler, American Standardbred, and Hungarian Half-bred can be purchased for $1500, or for $750 if you have high honor. These are the fastest horses in the game.
Two-star horses such as the Highland Chestnut, Painted Quarter Horse, Painted Standardbred, Quarter Horse, Standard Bred Pinto, Tersk, Tobiano Pinto, and Welsh Mountain can be bought for $500. Other two-star horses like the Turkmen, Ardennais, and Cleveland Bay can be bought for $500, or for $250 with high honor. Dutch Warmblood can be bought for $500, or for $250 if you have low honor, at Thieves' Landing. These horses have moderate speed.
One-star horses such as the Jaded Tersk, Lusitano Nag, and Infested Ardennais can be bought for $100. These horses have slow speed.

Break Ins. You will see a man trying to break into a window of a house. You may kill him or tie him up
Fights. You will see two guys having a fist, you can kill them both or shoot the ground and they will run away.

Be bold.,

Insert your money or tokens into the arcade machine.

Drop your victim over the edge of the cliff, ledge or bridge you are on.,
Admire your handiwork.",How to Hang Someone in Red Dead Redemption," There isn't a true method or action to hang someone per se, but to hang someone using this article's method, you will need the lasso. The lasso is a length of rope you can equip to hogtie victims, break in wild horses or subdue criminals. It is only available in the single-player game, and can only be unlocked during the quest ""Wild Horses, Tamed Passions"". Afterwards, you will be able to use it fully.;
, Simply draw, aim and fire the lasso as you would a normal weapon. The reticule will point where the lasso will fire, and if you are close enough, it will lasso the target. Beware, however, the lasso does cause some damage to the target and therefore will count as assault if you are spotted by lawmen, in addition to any counts of kidnapping you will incur. Practice on criminals or gang members instead.

, Unlike in real life, where a tree or gallows would be suitable, due to the game's mechanics, you will need to find a low bridge, cliff or balcony. There are several cliffs around the Red Dead Redemption world, although there are fewer bridges. A good choice for one would be the bridge to the Tumbleweed gang hideout - it is low enough to hang people from and easily accessible. Balconies or ledges can be found in most towns.

, Ideally, they should be close to the area you have picked so that by the time you reach it, they haven't been dragged so far that they die. Alternatively, if you are using the bridge to Tumbleweed, you merely have to wait for a victim to pass by underneath.

, With your previous practice, this should be easy. Now it is a matter of dragging the victim to the hanging spot, making sure not to accidentally let go of the rope before you reach it. Try not to go through too dense a bush, as it will kill your victim faster before you reach your destination. If you are using the Tumbleweed bridge or similar, again, you will not have to move far, or even be on your horse to lasso and hang the target; you can simply lasso and enjoy.

, This can be done by riding diagonally at the cliff or similar, and then turning and riding parallel to it. Your victim should swing off the cliff, and if you come to stop, they should be hanging in mid-air off the ledge. Make sure to keep the rope held firmly. This step can be skipped if you are using the Tumbleweed bridge method, as they will already be hanging as soon as you lasso them if you lasso them as they pass underneath.

, Whether you're bringing an outlaw to justice, or doing dastardly deeds, the outcome should be that the victim will struggle for a while on the lasso before the rope either breaks or they collapse, dead.

Do not learn to play just one song perfectly to show off!",How to Master Dance Dance Revolution2," Look at the number of ""feet"" displayed on a scale of 1 to 10 at the bottom of the screen. The higher number of ""feet"", the harder the song will be.

, This is rated in beats per minute, or BPM. The higher the number, the faster the song will be. Determine what speed you are comfortable with. Some songs change tempo during the course of play. All of these factors are displayed on the screen where you select songs. BPM does not change the level of difficulty. It may however change the way you must read the notes.

, If you pick the same song every time, it usually annoys other players. Only do this if you are new to the game. To really improve once you start playing Light/Basic (yellow) and Standard/Difficult (pink) difficulty, you should play a larger variety of songs to learn new patterns.

, Once you've gotten that down and you've moved to Light, you can begin to actually dance along with the beat before you finalize your song selection.

, This is very important. The tutorial shows the character standing on the middle (metal) platform, but to play any song harder than about 3 feet, your ""ready"" stance should stand mainly on the Left and Right arrows. The game does not penalize you for stepping on an arrow if there isn't one on the screen; with this posture you'll be much more prepared for the arrow patterns.

, A lot of beginners will use one foot(usually their 'bad' one) only for one arrow. For example, a right-handed(or footed) beginner would use their left foot only for pressing the left arrow. Don't do this! I have seen this many times and it makes them look stupid! You must learn to use both feet on more than one arrow. It can save energy(when going Up,Down,Up,Down etc.) and WILL help a lot when you play on harder levels.

, For instance, suppose you are given the steps ""Right Right Right."" The best way to do this is to keep your weight on your left foot, while tapping the right button three times with your right foot. This avoids the common beginner mistake of shifting one's weight onto the right foot after the first step, causing one to have to hop to hit the right button again, and often being thrown off balance. Similarly, suppose one is given the steps ""Right Left Right."" This is best done by ""walking"" on the arrows, shifting your weight to each step as you hit it. This avoids the mistake of keeping your weight on the right arrow the whole time, which would make it easy to tap the left button but would force you to hop to hit the last right button. So if you were given ""Right Right Left Left Right"" and you started with your weight on your left foot, you should do the following: tap the right arrow, step on the right arrow (shift weight), tap the left arrow, step on the left arrow (shift weight), and step on the right arrow. Most of the beginner songs consist of steps that can be done by some combination of ""walking"" from arrow to arrow, and tapping an arrow if that step is repeated, and these are the techniques you need to learn before you can do harder songs.

, It's a great way to see how much you've improved! Then, after playing the game for a solid time, tape yourself again. When watching the beginning tape, don't criticize yourself. Watch the new tape and you'll see how far you really have come!

, It may look good if you are playing a home game, but at an arcade, you get 3 tries. Playing the same song 3 times in a row will just show people you want to only show off! Step outside your comfort zone! If anybody teases you, ignore them. They were beginners once too, or they haven't ever played it! Never underestimate DDR. It's far from as easy as it looks!

Use speed multipliers.,
Learn the difference between the steps.,
Work on mastering 1/16th notes.,
Practice crossovers.,
Galloping is where you, well... gallop.,
Sometimes it's hard to see gallops in the middle of a stream of arrows.,
Be aware that some songs have specific tricks:


Some songs use triplets.",How to Master Dance Dance Revolution3," Hold down the main button when you select your song, and an options screen will be displayed. If you like your songs fast, do 2X. If you like your songs average/fast, do 1.5X. Although speed mods make the arrows move faster, they add space between arrows so crossovers and other complicated patterns are easier to read and react to. Some players frown on speed mods just as some players frown on using the bar for support. It is important to remember that speed mods and the bar are there for your assistance; there is no right or wrong for DDR, so do what works best for you.

, 1/8 steps are twice as fast as the ""normal"" beat of the song (say to yourself, ""one and two and three and four and...""). A common step pattern on Standard is three notes at double speed (think, ""one and two, three and four.""). You'll definitely need to be off the middle of the pad to get these steps (see #5 above). Try to listen to and use the rhythm of the song, and gradually you'll master it.

, These are even faster than 1/8th notes and are usually packed tightly together on the screen. Using Speed Multipliers to spread them out will greatly help your ability to ""read"" their rhythm (a straight run of 1/16th notes is counted ""ONE-ie and ah TWO-ie and ah THREE-ie and ah FOUR-ie and ah,"" although you'll rarely see this pattern on standard; usually, what appears are groups of three 1/16th notes in a row. Count this pattern as, ""ONE-ie and, TWO-ie and,"" etc.).

, Crossovers are steps where you either have to turn your body sideways or cross one leg over the other to successfully ""walk"" along the steps. For instance, if you must hit ""Left Down Right Down Left Down Right Down Left ..."" then you should switch feet, using your left foot to hit the left and right arrows and your right foot to hit the down arrow (or vice versa). This will require either crossing your legs or turning your whole body 90 degrees to the right (making the steps analogous to ""Down Right Up Right Down Right Up Right Down...""). Crossovers are the first of the more sophisticated stances.

, It's rather like skipping forward. These are technically 1/16th notes grouped 2 at a time. (Think, ""ONE, ah TWO, ah THREE, ah FOUR."" You only have to step on the beat and the ""ah"", like ""RIGHT - - Right LEFT - - Left RIGHT ..."") #*You jump in the air and once you land one foot, you land the other on the opposite arrow immediately afterward. TSUGARU APPLE MIX (DDR Extreme US, DDR MAX 2 and DDR EXTREME arcade) and also COWGIRL (DDR MAX, MAX2, Extreme arcade) are great songs to master this. Japan on heavy is great to learn Galloping because it often has long rows of gallops using only 2 arrows and in some parts more advanced galloping with the arrows going all over the place. However it doesn't have any forced crossover gallops or forced spinning gallops so it should be all good.

, Using speed mods will make them easier to read, as will changing the note-skin to solo. The home version also has an option to use different colored note-skins, called Type2. These different colors making picking out gallops trivial.

, For example, Burning Heat, and the end of Afronova. If you don't know triplets, search YouTube for those songs, and it should be fairly clear which notes they are. Practice them.
Other songs, such as Healing Vision (Angelic Mix), sometimes use a fermata. This means that the arrows pause for a beat.They literally stop on the screen for a half second or so.
If that wasn't tough enough, some songs change speed in the middle. Sometimes you might see arrows closer together or farther apart and learn to ignore it, it's the same tempo, the arrows just change speed on the screen.

"

Progress to even harder songs.,
On really hard songs, using the bar behind you to balance can help a lot.,
For your final song, try a hard song that you might not normally be able to finish.,
Try to learn some of the most complicated step patterns that you can do while ""walking"" or always switching feet.,
Learn to use your heel as well as the ball of your foot.,
Try not to think too hard while playing!,
Use practice mode.,
Stamina is key.,
Skill level and stamina level are equally important.",How to Master Dance Dance Revolution4," Once you are comfortable with a lot of Standard difficulty songs, start doing some 6-foot Heavy songs. As you master the new moves that are required, you'll be able to move your way up to 8 footers, to 9, and then 10.

, Although its necessity is debated and frowned upon by some players, it could be useful. For Beginner, Light, and Standard, the bar really isn't required.

, If you keep doing that, you will eventually be able to finish a new song, and increase your repertoire.

, The song Rhythm and Police (4th mix) is an excellent one to learn slowly and work up - it contains most of the complicated step patterns that require no more than crossovers. The song Afronova (3rd Mix) is good for teaching more complicated stances, such as having to turn 90 degrees to the left to be able to hit ""Left Up Right Left Down Right Left Up Right Left Down Right...""

, This technique is sometimes called playing flat footed. For instance, have the ball of your right foot on up, and the heel of your right foot on right. Now, assume you have the step pattern Up-Left-Right. Hit up with the ball of your right foot, left with whatever part of your left foot is easiest, and right with the heel of your foot. Since you move your feet a shorter distance, you expend less energy and move more quickly.

, This may sound counter-intuitive, but it may be much easier to play when you're not thinking about playing! Your body will go for the notes more naturally if you don't think too much! It may sound crazy, but it could work for you.

, If you have DDR for a home console, slowing down a song by a few percent can really help you learn especially tricky sequences in songs.

, For those that get technical, if you find yourself stuck on a certain foot level, like 7 feet (2.1 m), then try the following. Set the song list to difficulty(arcade machine), which will categorize the songs according to the number of feet. Find the level your on, and start abusing that list. By the time your able to pass every song on B or higher for that level(mainly for 7 feet and below), you should be able to start playing on a higher difficulty. Note that after you start playing 8 feet (2.4 m) or higher, you should be able to pass all the songs with an A before you move to the next level.

, Generally speaking, it's one thing to have the skill to play songs that are above your level and pass (even if barely), but if your legs give out before the song is even over, then focus on stamina. It won't matter how many advanced techniques you know unless you get a good balance between both in the higher levels.

Make sure that you have eaten one hour before.,
Listen to songs that you want to play repeatedly.,

Rest after at least two rounds.,
Finished.

",How to Maintain Stamina While Playing Dance Dance Revolution," This is to make sure that you have enough energy to play Dance Dance Revolution. Eat at least one hour before to prevent you from vomit because playing DDR means that you are going to jump and turn you body and hips more than usual.;
, This is good to adapt to the beat of the songs. Some songs have several parts that can indicate a stop or a slowdown, so repeat the songs over and over to get the beat. This way, you can predict what kind of chart will it be, and you can adjust your body position, control and speed.

, Start the warm-up by doing a round or two rounds consisting of easy songs. This is to get your muscles ready or adapt them if you haven't play Dance Dance Revolution for a long time.

, Increase the difficulty a little as you proceed. This way, your muscles can adapt with the increasing difficulty that you can be always ready for higher difficulty.

, Play more songs can be a way to learn new patterns, new beats and new gimmicks. Some charts have patterns or gimmicks that are similar to other charts, so practice them to know how you should move your body if you find similar patterns or gimmicks.

, If you are panic because of seeing a killer part of the chart or the killer chart itself, you cannot focus and you won't be able to adjust your body's reaction to the chart. Think positive and maintain a clear mind so you can react as fast as you can.

, Bars are useful to maintain your body balance on the correct position. But, use it wisely (on how to use bars properly, see Tips section).

, Try finding a way to control your speed and step necessarily. There are some patterns that require double-stepping, and some must use body turns to avoid unnecessary waste of energy. Also, watch your stomping method.

, It cannot be to rigid or too flexible. Getting to be too rigid limits your body movement too much that it is difficult to get along with the beat. Getting to be too flexible usually cause your body to make unnecessary moves unconsciously.

, After two rounds, don't push yourself over because your body's endurance and concentration will not last long. Drink a little bit and take a breath.

Upgrade the Jackdaw's hull.,
Upgrade your chain shot.,
Upgrade your other weapons.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag1," Legendary Ships hit hard, so you'll want to ensure that your ship is up to the challenge. To survive longer in battle, you need to upgrade your ship to take on any damage.You can defeat the Legendary Ships without upgrading everything to the Elite level, but it is highly recommended that you have the Elite Hull upgrade. This can be found in the San Ignacio Wreck.;
, The chain shot has a major role in defeating the Legendary Ships. The cannons fire from both sides of the bowsprit, and the chains demolish the opposing ship's mast and slow the vessel's speed. Upgrade your chain shot as much as possible to keep the enemy vessel from running circles around you.


It is an ideal weapon for the initial phase of the battle. The chain shot is predominantly used during pursuits or while approaching the enemy ship.
The number of shots you have is heavily limited. To increase the limit, you need to buy the appropriate upgrades.

, Besides the chain shot, you're also going to want Elite Swivel Guns, the Elite Ram, Elite Heavy Shot and Elite Broadside Cannons. Having these upgrades will make the fights a bit easier to handle."

Destroy Fort Serranilla.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag2," You will need to defeat this fort to unlock the El Impoluto. You can find the fort in the upper-left corner of the map. After you successfully take over the fort, a red ship will appear at the map.

, In the northeast corner of the map, you will find Fort Eleuthera. Once destroyed, this will unlock the location of the legendary ships HMS Fearless and Royal Sovereign. You will be fighting both of these ships in one battle.

, At the southeast corner of the map, you will find Fort Navassa. This will unlock the legendary ship HMS Prince.

, Lastly, at the southwest corner of the map, you will find Fort Serranilla. Once the fort is destroyed, the location of La Dama Negra will be revealed.

Find the HMS Prince.,
Find the best position for your ship.,
Hit it with chain shots and try to ram it.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag3," This ship is hidden in the fog at the southeast corner of the map, but despite the intimidating feeling around it, this is the easiest of the Legendary Ships to defeat.

, This is usually behind HMS Prince, since it has a devastating broadside attack with cannons.

, Do so once you successfully position your ship behind it.


Once the health of HMS Prince reaches 25% and it is flaming, it will start attacking with its rear cannons. If you have gotten up behind the ship quick enough, you should have plenty of life to endure the rear cannons until you are able to sink it.
The reward for defeating the HMS Prince is 20,000R.

Locate the ship.,
Slow it down.,
Keep moving, avoid the mortars and, at the same time, don't slow down at all during the fight.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag4," Found in the southwest corner of the map, La Dama Negra has extreme firepower and mostly attacks with its mortars. This is also one of the tougher Legendary Ship you'll come across due to the heavy weather and choppy sea.


It's pointless to use ram La Dama Negra since ship is heavily armored.

, Use chain shots to slow it when you're behind the La Dama Negra, fire your mortar, and then turn and hit it with heavy shot on its rear cabin.

, Having the Elite hull is very important, as you will be taking a lot of mortar fire. Just keep on approaching behind end of the ship, cause damage, dodge the mortar, and repeat until the ship sinks. Be patient and retreat when necessary and then speed up to get behind the ship again to launch more attacks.You will receive 20,000R for defeating La Dama Negra.

After you unlock its location, approach the ship and brace yourself.,
Keep out of its path.,
Stay behind the El Impoluto and use your chain shots.,
Defend yourself against a charge.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag5," El Impoluto likes to take its path directly with high speed and then ram at your ship. When it does, it will inflict devastating damage.

, Try to stay away from its side cannons as well.

, This will decrease the speed of the enemy ship. Chain shots are most effective against El Impoluto since it won't be able to ram at you while you're at the rear.



El Impoluto fires an enormous barrage of cannonballs at once.

, When the ship begins to charge you, turn away from it in the opposite direction that you are traveling, instead of trying to outrun it and let it pass. If you ever let the ship pass you, it will swing to the side and attack you. If you turn away from it, you will be able to fire a volley into its side and then continue forward to come up behind it.


Halving its HP with your cannons and ramming it from behind will sink El Impoluto soon enough.
You will get 20,000R as reward for defeating El Impoluto.

Avoid getting trapped.,
Damage the ships.,
Focus on the other ship.",How to Kill Ghost Ships in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag6," To defeat the twin ships, do everything you can to avoid getting caught between the two ships. The HMS Fearless and Royal Sovereign will try to surround you and then unleash their broadside cannons. Getting caught in this barrage will put a quick end to your fight., Keep a distance from the two and use your mortars to damage their ships from afar. Use your side cannons whenever you get a chance to hit them.

Keep on using your mortar and cannons whenever you have a clear shot, and then repeat until one of the ships is down to very low health.

, Have his health halved to low as well before sinking one of them, and run. As soon as one of the twin ships sinks, the other will pick up ridiculous speed and try to ram you. At this point, launching mortars and fire barrels is a good strategy. Make sure to hit it before it gets too close. If you can hit the lone ship with your cannons while it's charging you, you should be able to sink it due to the ship's low health.

The reward will be 10,000R for each ship sunk. Because they each give a separate reward, you can actually repeatedly battle to keep earning 10,000R. Just destroy one of the ships and then leave the area. After a little while the destroyed ship will reappear and you can repeat the process.

Get on a dance pad.,
Pick a song that you know has a part you can't beat, and be prepared.,
Know when the hard parts come.,
Diagnose the problem.,
Make sure you're in the right position.",How to Pass Complicated Parts of DDR Songs," It doesn't matter if it's at an arcade or at home. Try a soft pad for beginners, because the arrows connect easier.;
, Usually, songs don't start with a hard section. Some, like Delta 32, do. Be ready for those. If it's easy, just keep going.

, Listen for the words, or when the background changes. Look at the arrows. Some parts can be tricky, such as U, D, U, R, D, U, D, L, U, D, U, R. Don't worry, everyone misses those sometimes.


You can use Training Mode to isolate just a few bars of a song and practice that.

,


If you're missing it because it's going too fast, open the Options menu when you're choosing a song (how to do this will depend on your game: hold down Select, choose it from the difficulty menu or hold down X/O), and make it go slower. It should be much easier.
If you're missing it because you're falling, try standing in a different position.
If the steps seem too complicated for you to read, use a speed mod. This will spread the arrows apart and make reading easier. You would be surprised how much easier this can make some songs.
If the arrows seem to have nothing to do with the song, play with your eyes instead. Keep the music ON, but watch carefully for the arrows. You will quickly figure out exactly what beats the song arrows are following. This happens often with trance songs that have complex synth parts in the background. The answer is not always obvious.
If you still can't hear what rhythm you're supposed to be stepping to, check to make sure you have the right sound settings. If your TV is older you might have to set your game to Mono sound to hear the entire song.

, If you have your right foot on the Right arrow, and the left foot on the Down arrow, you'll probably not be ready. Try to keep facing the screen, and don't worry about having your feet on the pads the whole time. Stepping off of them sometimes helps.

, Doctors are represented by ""cross"" icons, which can be found in several locations within and surrounding most cities.


You can select a specific doctor as your target travel destination by selecting his corresponding icon on the map. This places a guiding arrow on the mini-map, pointing you to his location.

Approach a doctor and speak to him.,
Select ""Heal"" to allow the doctor to heal you.,
Select ""Medicine"" to buy medicine from the doctor.",How to Heal in Assassin's Creed II2," This will bring up a menu with options such as ""Heal"" and ""Medicine.""

Doctor locations are not always convenient when you are in need of healing, which is usually when you are on a mission being pursued by enemies. Thus, while medicine pouches cost more and heal less, they allow the player to cure themselves mid-battle.

First of all, turn on the game.,
Select Practice Mode (also Training Mode) or Game Mode (also Free Play Mode, Dance Mode) or maybe even a mission mode, where you have to go forward.,
Select a song and make the difficulty correspond to your skill level, let it be Beginner (Novice) (7th mix and up), Light (Basic), Standard (Difficult), Heavy (Maniac), or Challenge (Expert).

,
Before we go on, we need to discuss DDR Vocabulary.,
Play through the entire song if you can.,
NEVER GIVE UP!,
Always challenge yourself, and there is this great thing called the Options Menu.,
Have fun!",How to Be Good at DDR," If you want to learn how to be good at this game, you need to know how to turn the PS2 or whatever on, which hopefully you can do. Just find the switch, usually at the back of the console, and turn it on, and press that red light at the front (for PS2 users);
, If you select Mission Mode, you will definitely get better in a not-so-long period of time. But Dance Mode will give you the songs and steps you need and fast. Practice Mode can really help, adding things to songs in Dance Mode such as a Metronome (going ""tick, tick, tick"" to the 1/4-note beat), an Assist Tick (going ""tick"" every time a note passes by the judgment screen), and it can slow down songs, as well as you being able to choose any little part of the song to practice over and over and over and over again. Choose your mode.

,, If you already know it, go on.

Song Name:* The song you are currently selecting or previewing.
Preview Music:* The 12-second bit of the song you hear when you go to choose the song.
Judgment Window:* The white arrows at the top of the screen that mark when you press that arrow coming up.
Beginner:* Novice and Very Easy Difficulty.
Light:* Easy or Basic Difficulty.
Standard:* The Normal or Difficult Difficulty.
Heavy:* The Hard and Maniac Difficulty.
Challenge:* The Expertly Hard Difficulty.
1/4 Beat:* The arrows that come up that are 1/4 of the measure.
1/8 Beat:* The arrows are blue in Noteskin and are 1/8 of measure.
1/12 Beat:* The arrows are green in Noteskin and are 1/12 of measure.
1/16 Beat:* The arrows are yellow in Noteskin and are 1/16 of measure.

, Make sure that you didn't choose a song that is WAY-over-your-head-too-hard hard or baby-easy easy. Make it challenging so you might not pass it at first or second, just don't go over the top.

, The point of the game is to be fun, not a frustrating pit of anger and crying and pain. Trust me, people who are good don't just play a song and instantly become a professional. They play and play and play for years, some play ten or twelve years to get where they're at, and they're GOOD. If this ten-year thing discouraged you, ask yourself if you really are committed to get good at this game.

, You can access it by choosing a song then pressing that selecting button twice and you will go to options. Choose handicaps or added challenges to your songs. Learn what all of them do, and choose the best combo for you. Like a Noteskin called Note, the arrows go red, blue, green (sometimes purple), or yellow corresponding to their color.

They normally carry a good amount of resources that can be used for upgrading your ship, as well as rum and sugar which you can sell in any city or port for a good sum of money. If possible, attack higher level brigs as they normally offer more resources and rum/sugar.;
, As with other Assassin's Creed games, chests are a great source of money. A recommendation is to climb up to vantage points and synchronize. This reveals the locations of chests, which leads to money.

, There are usually around 8 in major cities and they give a good amount of money. This is recommended early on in the game to the middle part of the game as this allows you to get money quickly and efficiently.

, They usually reveal the location of a treasure convoy, marked with an R, on your map. It's a risk to attack these convoys head on because they are usually escorted and are heavily armored. The best strategy for convoys is to swim up to them and climb on board, killing every enemy on there. After doing so, just attack the ships as you would any other. These convoys carry a good sum of money, and they vary. Usually its around 7,000 reales.

, Though its not a reliable source of money (usually around 50 Reales), it is a great way to find ammo for your weapons as well as supplies, such as smoke bombs.

For example, Venetian Falchion and Old Syrian Sword appear on the second rack on the left, while the Common Sword appears on the first rack on the left.

Armor is broken down into different pieces and types, allowing players to purchase new sets piece by piece.
Armor adds a certain number of health squares to your life bar and comes with a set number of hit points that indicate how much damage you can take before needing repairs.

,

Follow the Creed at all costs.,
Only use your skills as an Assassin to defend yourself if you're being attacked.,
If possible, bring along a friend on your missions.,
Lastly, remember that this entire thing is for fun, and for a good cosplay or Live Action Role Play ideas.",How to Act Like an Assassin (Assassin's Creed)," It isn't required, but it can help you feel more like your favorite assassins. Assassins are usually able to perform physical activity for long periods of time. You should try to learn parkour, since assassins usually free run over buildings.

If you do decide to be athletic, try doing push ups and, if possible, pull-ups everyday. Run for fitness.;
, There are many assassin outfits you cam buy, but many will draw attention to you. It's best to wear a white or black hoodie and pants that allow you free movement but don't make too much noise. Preferably go for a zipper hoodie, that has a hood that can somewhat come over your eyes.

, Find somewhere you can practice your moves like a playground or old house. Make sure you have permission if you're going to practice on another property.


Learning free-running (parkour) is not always required. You have Assassins such as Shaun and Rebecca who do not know how/need to do free-running. Sure, it does help to know it to make you feel more like Desmond, Altair, Ezio, or Connor, but there are positions that do not require it, such as Shaun's position as a historical aide and researcher, or Rebecca's position as Lucy's team's tech specialist. This step probably will take the longest to accomplish, if you decide to learn it. And lastly, be careful if you decide to learn free-running! No leg-breaking here!
When doing parkour/ free-running, make sure to know what your surroundings are. Also make sure you have a good grip on the surface that you doing this on.

, It's a good idea to do this, considering it has many things about the Assassin's Creed Universe that you may not have known. It also might be a good idea to get your hands on the Assassin's Creed Encyclopedia when it comes out.

, Also, it might be good if you went to real-life events such as Comic-Con, and got involved with cosplaying communities. This allows you to connect with like-minded individuals.

,, It's not recommended to get a hidden blade, but if you must have one, you can buy one from Museum Replicas or you can create your own. Remember, a true Assassin does not murder innocents. And by the way, murder is illegal in most parts of the world, with the sentence often being either life in prison or the death penalty, so please, just use your hidden blade for ceremonial reasons.

, For reminder reasons, the Creed is as follows:


1. Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent. (In other words, do not kill innocent people.)
2. Hide in plain sight. (Don't draw attention to yourself. Use the crowds and environment to your advantage.)
3. Never compromise the Brotherhood. (Don't create a bad name for the Assassins and get Assassin's Creed banned from being played).

, Try to spare whoever is attacking you, and try to inflict the least amount of pain as you can. Use your mind as your primary weapon, and your fists as a secondary, and by no means should you use your hidden blade for any other reasons but ceremonial reasons.

, It's best to not go rogue, because if you are injured, caught, or killed, you're in trouble.

, Do not attempt to jump off of the tops of cathedrals or stab people with a knife. Either way, you could die.

, Keep walking until you see the inn.

, You'll see a clock that needs to be reset. Since you don't know the time you'll have to head back out the city and ask around.

, Talk to the man behind the bar, and he'll tell you that there definitely isn't a girl at the rooftop of the building.

, You'll see a line of men walking toward the next room; talk to each and everyone of them and take note of the times that they tell you.

, You'll be able to enter another house with a man standing behind a bar; talk to him, and he'll say that his clock has no minute hands and it's always pointing the wrong way.

, Your character will comment that it's pointing at two.

, You'll see a man - talk to him. He'll say that the seconds are all divisible by 20—take note of this.

, Talk to the owner, and he'll say that the second hand is at 30.

, Head back to the Inn and look at the clock. Now that you have all the clues needed for the puzzle, it's time to open the door and access the clock.

, Previously you asked a bunch of men what time it was, and they answered ""2:00,"" ""12:00,"" ""4:00,"" ""8:00,"" and ""10:00."" The pattern of numbers given is based on a two hour time difference. With that in mind, it's noticeable that there is a number in that pattern missing - ""6:00."" Enter the number into the clock.

, The man behind the tower told you that his clock doesn't have a minute hand and that it always points to the wrong time. Since he was lying, it's safe to assume that the clock pointing at 2 is correct; since 2 means 10 minutes on a clock, the answer is 10:00.

, This one is a bit tough; you already know that it isn't divisible by 20 because of the man on the tower, which eliminates 20, 40, and 60.


Another man informed you that it's 30, but since he was lying, it's not 30. Now you're left with 10 or 50.
Try both 10 and 50 and see which one works. In this case, 50 will be correct.
Entering ""6:10:50"" into the clock will open a portion of the wall on the right side of the room. Climb up the stairs and open the chest to receive Edgar's chainsaw weapon.

, Have two sets of gear, one for a chi blast, which you would use as much mind+ as you can get, plus the artifact hand piece, Temple Gloves, for boosting. and the other for dealing as much damage as possible.

, He will be equal in level to you, so accuracy won't be a major issue, no matter what race you are Counter and evasion plus is also a good idea. Some examples:


Cross Counters
Emperor Hairpin Head
Peacock Charm Neck
Spike Earrings Ears
Scorpion Harness+1 Body
Ochiudo's Kote Hands
Sun Rings Ring
Amemet Mantle+1 Back
Brown Belt Belt
Akido Koshita Legs
Fuma Khyans Feet
Sole Sushi + 1
Opo Opo Necklace Neck
12 Sleep Potions
Icherus Wing

, Start a whole new line of macros just for this, to prevent confusion and to eliminate you having to delete your normal macros. Your macros should look like this- one for boosting before chi blast (/ja ""Boost <me> /wait 15 /echo boost) one for equipping the gear you brought for melee, one for a quick use of all your abilities, (dodge, focus, counter stance, most likely in that order.) Finally, one to equip the artifact body, Temple cyclas, use Chara, then to equip back in the body you are normally using.

,


First go talk to Maat, in Ru'lude Gardens, near the archdukes bedroom. He will tell you that you must collect a testimony.
Testimonies for monk can be gotten in the following places; Castle Ostroja, in the area right outside the throne room where the high priest spawns, fight monk type mobs (the same place you went to get the artifact piece, Temple Hose) in Davoi, either in Monastic Caverns, or in the center area with that house that you can only access by going through the monastic caverns.
Fight orcish champions, and finally, in Sea Serpent Grotto, off the monk type mobs behind the gold door. Make sure to bring a gold beastcoin, as you will need it to open the door. No matter where you go, it would be a good idea to bring a couple of friends, as these mobs are quite tough. A thief is a good idea, because their Treasure Hunter ability will make your search faster.
Go talk to Maat again. After a short conversation, he will tell you that it is time for the final test, a fight with him, then offer to teleport you to the battlefield where the fight will take place. Before accepting this, make sure you have everything you need on you, including a reraise scroll, and a warp scroll or cudgel.
Now you will be in a Burning Circle area. Before entering the battlefield, strip all of your equipment. It's been theorized, though not proven, that Maat wears what you wear upon entering. This might not be true, but better safe than sorry.
After entering, equip your chi blasting gear, use your sole sushi, then equip your opo opo necklace. This necklace allows you to raise TP while you are asleep. With it equipped, use a sleep potion until you have enough TP, then advance towards the fight.
Stand as far from him as you can while still being able to target him, then start boosting. at your 10- 11th boost, hit him with a chi blast. this should take a good chunk out of his health.
Avoid him and macro in your melee equipment, then your abilities. With all your abilities on, turn and punch the crap out of him. Use a weapon skill, then use an Icherus wing, giving you 100% more TP then another weapon skill (raging fists is the best, but dragon kick is nice too.) If at this point he still lives, use hundred fists and watch the sparks fly. If you get a little low, use the Chara macro. Now with a little luck, you should take him out quite easily.

To begin, Quick Hit Neslug either seven or eight times with characters capable of hitting for 99999.;
,
Then, use Attack Reels.,
Entrust to Wakka and use another 12-hit Attack Reels.,
Entrust one more overdrive to Wakka and 12-hit again, this will finish Neslug off for sure.",How to Defeat Neslug in the Monster Arena in Final Fantasy X,", This reduces Neslug to, with eight Quick Hits, 2000020 HP, which is just 20HP above the point at which he retreats into his shell.

, This reduces Neslug to 800032 HP, which is 199968HP past the point at which the shell breaks. Therefore, you've broken the shell without it ever being activated. (If you only did seven Quick Hits, then it will be 900031 HP left, which is still below the shell's break point)

, (Or alternatively, just quick hit him to death)

Know how to handle the damage a monster inflicts efficiently and deal as much damage as possible.,
Have a ""healer"" and a ""tank"" in the party to take care of the damage received.,
Gather up damage dealers and support jobs.,
To have an effective party, a good balance of damage dealers, and support jobs is essential.",How to Form a Good Party in Final Fantasy XI,";
,


A healer is a job that can heal the hit points (HP) of a party member and remove status ailments, such as poison. The healer will primarily be healing the tank, since the tank will be receiving the most damage. The healer is almost always required in a party because of its job requirements and needs in the game, so therefore, you'll need a secure member for it.
A tank is a party member whom has a high defense and other attributes that lower the amount of damage they receive during battle. Effective tanks also generate ""hate"" to make the monster focus its attack on them. the warrior job gets the ability to ""provoke"" the monster to hit them at level 5, making them decent tanks.

, Damage dealers are jobs that excel in dishing out the damage. support jobs are jobs that help the other jobs or (support them) in achieving their goals with a variety of spells and/or abilities.

, Too many support jobs in the party, and survivability may increase in the short term but the fights will likely last longer than expected. Too many damage dealers will make for a longer rest in between fights to regain lost magic points/hit points.


Also the damage dealers may not be able to effectively hit the target or tank effectively without the help of a support job.

Prepare and save.,
Blind him.,
Give him a dose of his own Demi-cine.,
Watch out for his pattern.",How to Defeat Diablos in Final Fantasy VIII," Heal your party. Make sure everyone has Draw ability. Save your game before using the Magic Lamp (just like what the item description says).;
, This sounds like a sneaky move but Diablos was made vulnerable to Blind magic for a reason. Considering that Diablos' magic can't reduce your characters' HP to zero (Demi takes 25%, Gravija takes 75%), blinding him effectively disables his only way of killing anyone in your party.


You can stock up on Blind from Granaldo, the bug creature at the training center during the Ellone rescue. If you are out of Blind, you may still win, but you may need Protect to endure Diablos' physical attacks.

, Diablos is the first opponent you can draw Demi from so you may stock up on that for junctioning, but mainly use Draw to cast it back on him. Your Draws will fail frequently at this point in the game because Diablos' magic will be significantly higher. Let your strongest magicians (high Mag) do the Demi-casting and let your strongest warriors (high Str) attack (especially using Limit Breaks).

, Right after casting his Gravija, Diablos always uses his physical attack on the character with the lowest HP. Without Blind, you can get killed so heal up.

"
"
Max out your characters.,
Max out all the materia listed above.,
Prepare for the actual fight.,
Start the fight by casting Wall and Regen on everyone.,
The key to doing massive damage is limit breaks and mime.,
Mime also duplicates items at no cost.,
Ensure the party member with Final Attack > Phoenix equipped has sufficient MP.,
If Cloud dies but other party members remain, use their limits and Mime them in the same manner.,
Understand that winning is not always a guarantee.,
Don't bother with conventional attacks.If you do not have a Limit attack charged and ready, try to heal the HP/MP of party members rather than perform an essentially ineffective attack.",How to Defeat Emerald Weapon in Final Fantasy 7," Furthermore, it's always good to obtain the best weapons and armor. Some materia you will need include: Mime, Final Attack, the Phoenix summon, and x2 Attack. Ensure everyone has their final limit breaks too, especially Cloud's Omnislash, probably the most powerful of them all.;
, This phase takes a lot of time and patience. It's best to get the Apocalypse Sword for Cloud in that jungle area with the frogs as it boasts triple exp for any materia equipped in it. You need to max out all the materia listed above not only to have them at full power, but so they duplicate and can be used by other characters. Just grind until all the material you choose is maxed, duplicated, and maxed again. The more the better.

, Ensure every character's Limit gauge is full before encountering Emerald. Make sure Cloud and another party member has the Mime materia equipped as well as someone else in your party. Also, equip the Final Attack materia in a linked slot with the Phoenix summon; with this combination, the death of that character will trigger Phoenix, resurrecting your entire party. This is key for when Emerald weapon does his random evil 'kill everyone' attack.

, Don't use any limit breaks until this is done--when finished, use Cloud's Omnislash limit. Don't allow the other party members to use their own limits; instead, pass their turns until Cloud's comes up, and have him use the Mime ability. Repeat this as many times as possible before you die. Omni slash hits 15 times, if your maxed out doing 9999 every hit, that almost 15000 damage.

, Some favour the summon Knights of the Round, but if you don't have a Gold Chocobo and the materia for breathing underwater, the fight has a strict 20-minute timer. Extreme damage in a short time is essential, and the long animation of Knights of the Round works against your time limit.

, That is, you can use a mega-elixir to fully heal your party then mime the item to use it again.

, If he/she has none upon their death, they cannot resurrect the party and your efforts will have been wasted. Remember Emerald Weapon's MP draining attacks and use appropriate items.

, Emerald will KO your characters many times over the course of the battle, and your turns will be better spent attacking/buffing than resurrecting. Wait for the Final Attack > Phoenix combo to take effect.

, Emerald Weapon is an unrelenting and powerful boss and won't always let you use one last item. You might have to take him on a number of times before seeing some degree of success. A little luck goes a long way.

, Burst damage is the key. Emerald Weapon's attacks are strong, so your Limit Gauges will fill up quickly. It's better to be at full strength when your limits are ready rather than being forced to spend one more turn healing your party.

Grind your party.,
Get Celestial Everything.,
Use quick hit.,
Use your Aeons as your shield.,
Bribe your way through it.",How to Defeat Dark Aeons," Dark Aeons have extremely high stats. You might even get shocked the first time you face one as you miss every single shot and he or she just finishes your party with one flick. With this, you need to max at least all your most important stats (HP, MP, Strength, Defense, Agility, Accuracy). You may not need to upgrade your other skills (Magic, Evasion, etc.) because all Dark Aeons absorb elemental attacks, are still strong even against Ultima, and almost never miss physical attacks.


It is recommended to choose your favorite three characters and focus on maxing them up. This will make the process easier and lessen the spheres you'll be needing
You need EXP for traversing your Sphere grid. A good grinding place would be Omega Ruins, especially the shadowy areas where huge monsters also give huge experiences.
You need +4, +300 HP, and +40 MP spheres. You can get all kinds of spheres at the Monster Arena where special types of monster drop a measly one (or two for overkills) sphere(s) each fight. This takes a lot of patience and strategy since every monster is a boss battle all on his own.
You need all the space on the Sphere grid. There's no space for blank spots on your grid to max your stats. This sounds tedious, but you need to clear out all less nodes, including +1 to +3, +100 to +200 spots). Strictly speaking, you can customise 775 out of 860 nodes (Standard Grid) or 707 out of 792 nodes (Expert Grid).;
, Of course, you can't defeat any Dark Aeon without Break Damage Limit so you need to do the specific tasks to earn each of your party's Celestial Weapons and power them up with crests and sigils.


It's not really recommended to attain BDL by customising since Dark Matter is too rare. You might wanna save them for Ribbon.
Celestial Armors isn't really a thing but most gamers would agree they include the following: Auto-Haste, Auto-Protect, Break HP Limit, and Ribbon.
You can get weapons with automatic BHL or Ribbon from Dark Aeons themselves. A preferred Dark Aeon to drop these is Yojimbo, whom you have to fight five times to finish off. Engage him four times and if you haven't got your desired armor yet, leave and chase him all over again.
Since Ribbon does not protect your party from Death and Breaks, some gamers also prefer Auto-Phoenix to be part of the Armors' abilities. One possible flaw of this is that Phoenix only gives a quarter of a character's total HP, leaving your character alive but weak, and able to induce damage less than the preferred 99,999.

, This is why maxing your MP levels is important. Dark Aeons have really high Agility (especially Dark Shiva) which you must counter by cutting the opponent's turn as much as possible (Haste is just not enough).

, Most Dark Aeons' overdrives kill the entire party (especially Yojimbo) so whenever his or her overdrive fires up in the next turn, summon Yuna to sacrifice one of your Aeons for you. It's for a good cause.

, Yojimbo's Zanmato is one summon (and a lot of gil) away, especially if you treat Yojimbo right (increased compatibility). This works on all Dark Aeons.

Remember that you can use Yuna, Rikku and Paine above level 55.,
Know that as soon as you enter battle, have everyone change into their ultimate dresspheres; in particular, Rikku.

,
Have Rikku go into Machina Maw.,
Keep this up, along with healing magic and supporting magic.

,
Switch to Yuna immediately when Rikku is killed.

,
Activate shield and barrier on Yuna.,
Use all life when they use Petridon's flame and Yuna doesn't get hit.,
Use Paine as your character when Yuna's shield and Barrier go away.,
Keep healing Paine and preparing to resurrect her and you should kill The Angra Mainyu.

",How to Defeat Angra Mainyu in Final Fantasy X 21," If not, train until they are. You will also need to learn to break HP and Damage limits with ultimate dresspheres.;
,, This is a really hot dressphere simply because the Vajra attack isn't cancelled out by any of Angra Mainyu, Zarik, or Tarik.

,,, With the right pistil, keep healing your floral fallal. The left stigma will branch out nonstop attacks on the guy only hit by physical damage. Yuna uses great whirl.

, This is to revive them back to life.

, In Paine's dressphere, it's very strong. Unfortunately, Zarich's chances are high since Paine's ultimate attacks render useless against Zarich. But don't worry about it, just focus on Angra Mainyu.

,"
"
Use MP draining abilities on Angra Mainyu after taking out Tawrich and Zarich (or while taking out Tawrich and Zarich, depending on your preference and level).,
Once Angra Mainyu's MP is down to single digits, keep its MP low.,
Heal when needed and cast Auto-life (just in case).

,
Lay waste to Angra Mainyu with your choice of high-damaging abilities.",How to Defeat Angra Mainyu in Final Fantasy X 22," Note: normally if you can survive past this step, you should be fine for the rest of the battle. This means it might be possible to defeat this boss at around level 50.

, This will cause Angra Mainyu to mainly use Osmose, instead of its other, more powerful abilities.

,, Darkness from Dark Knight and Annihilator from Gun Mage are some very good choices.

Equip one girl in the Songstress dressphere and the other two in the Gunner dressphere.,
Immediately have the Songstress use Magical Masque.,
Have the Gunners use the ability Tableturner on Black Elemental.,
Keep doing the following and you should beat Black Elemental.",How to Defeat Black Elemental in Final Fantasy X 2," Equip accessories bearing the Berserkproof ability. Start the battle.;
, This move will make Black Elemental's magic attacks completely harmless for as long as the girl is dancing. Make sure to use it again when it wears off.

, It has a very high Defense and Magic Defense, so normal physical and magical attacks won't do much damage. Tableturner ignores Defense and does more damage on high defense enemies so use that.

, He only has 9,999 HP. (If he's oversouled he has a little over 10,000 HP.)

"
"
Start with one girl in the Songstress dressphere and the other two in the Dark Knight or Berserker dresspheres.,
Immediately use a Light Curtain to cast Protect on all the girls.,
Have the songstress use Magical Masque -- it will help you later.

,
Hit Azi Dahaka with all you've got with your Dark Knights or Berserkers while the Songstress is dancing.

,
After you reduce Azi's HP down, he will start using an attack called Damoceles Photon.,
Continue to use Magical Masque and hit Azi with all you got.,
After a long battle, you will see him fall for the count.",How to Defeat Azi Dahaka in Final Fantasy X 2," Equip accessories and/or garment grids that raise your attributes. Start the battle.;
, This will reduce the damage from his physical attacks. His physical attack appears to have a draining effect, so be sure to do more damage than he can heal at all times.

,,, This attack is very, very devastating. It does fractional damage based on your Maximum HP. You don't want to be caught off-guard by this attack. This is what Magical Masque is for. Since Damoceles Photon is a magic attack, Magical Masque will completely protect you from it. Make sure the Songstress is dancing at all times, since he can pull this attack out anytime he wishes. If you are hit and the Songstress is not dancing, heal up immediately.

, Darkness by a Dark Knight and a few of the Berserker's attacks work well on him.

, He has 146,200 HP (153,510 HP if oversouled) so it will take a while. Congratulations! You beat him!

Hit level 30 as a Arcanist and level 15 as a Conjurer.,
Go see the Arcanist guild in Limsa Lominsa and accept the next class quest.,
Go into your inventory.,
Get to know your skills and the effects that they have.,
Know your cross-class skills.,
Mainly pump stats into the Mind stat to ensure maximum healing.,
Know your pets.,
Use the pet skills!,
Use Macros to your advantage.",How to Be a Scholar in Final Fantasy XIV,";
, At the end of the quest, you will receive a Soul Crystal.

, Click on the bottom-right slot, and equip the Soul of a Scholar to switch to the Scholar job; you must be an Arcanist when you try to equip it.

, Below are several skills that you will definitely be using throughout your time as a Scholar (this list will also include several of the Arcanist class skills, for maximum understanding).


Physick: Your basic healing skill, obtained at level 4 and the the most efficient in basic healing. It has a potency of 400 (the same as the White Mages/Conjurer's Cure I). It costs minimal MP, and is used whenever the tank is starting to lose HP.
Summon I: Obtained at level 4, this skill is used to summon the Arcanist's, Scholar's, and Summoner's first pet. For a Scholar, this pet is Eos. This spell should always be cast AS SOON as you enter any dungeon, or even out in the field! Without your pet, as a Scholar, you're healing will be noticeably less effective!
Aetherflow: Obtained at level 6. It restores 20% of your MP. Also, at level 8, 20, and 40, you obtain a Trait to give you stacks of Aetherdam, which is required to cast certain spells. (One cast gives max stacks of Aetherflow.)
Energy Drain: Level 8 skill that drains deals damage to the enemy with a potency of 150, along with giving you 50% of the damage dealt as HP, and a small amount of MP. Usually used when you're running low on MP during intense fights.
Summon II: Obtained from the level 15 Arcanist quest, this will summon the Arcanist's, Scholar's, and Summoner's second pet. For a Scholar, this pet is Selene. The same rules as with Summon I apply here.
Resurrection: Level 22 skill. Revives the target in a weakened state (Stats reduced for several minutes).
Eye for an Eye: Level 34 Arcanist skill. Puts a barrier around the target with an effect of ""20% chance that when barrier is struck, the striker will deal 10% less damage for 20s.""
Adloquium: Level 30 Scholar skill, used for healing. It has a potency of 300, but also gives a status effect on the target when casted. It will absorb up to the amount of damage you healed. Ex: If you were to heal someone for 100 HP, the next 100 HP damage they would take would be negated. Also, if the heal is a critical, it will absorb up to double the damage the target would take.
Succor: Level 35 Scholar healing skill. It has a healing potency of 150 and is an AoE spell. It has the same effect as Adloquium, except without the critical effect. Useful if the party is taking minor damage.
Leeches: Level 40 Scholar healing skill. It removes one harmful status effect from the target. Ex: Burn, poison, Windburn.
Sacred Soil: Level 45 Scholar AoE damage prevention spell. It reduces all damage within the effective area by 10%. It also has a 20% chance of making the next Succor cost no MP. Requires a stack of Aetherflow to cast.
Lustrate: Level 50 Scholar healing skill. It restores 25% of the targets maximum HP. Very helpful for whenever the (main) tank is running extremely low on HP, due to its instant cast time and fast cool-down time (1.0 seconds). Requires a single stack of Aetherflow to cast it (meaning it can be cast three times within the span of several seconds!). It should only be used sparingly, in emergency situations, due to the 1 minute reload time of Aetherflow.

, These are the more important cross-class skills for when you're running dungeons:


Protect: Level 8 Conjurer skill. Decreases physical damage taken. An essential to help reduce the damage taken in a dungeon. (If there is a White Mage, allow them to cast it instead, due to their added Shell effect.)
Swiftcast: Level 26 Thaumaturge skill. Another essential skill for when you need to cast resurrection, due to it's long cast time. This skill makes the next spell cast instantly, basically negating the cast time.

, If needed, put a few into Piety for extra MP.

, The second most important thing to being a Scholar is your pets, and making sure you know how they work. First comes the pets themselves, then the skills.


Eos - Summoned using the Summon I skill. She provides more healing then the other pet, and her buffs are revolved around that. She is helpful for when you need extra healing with you (Note: Both pets do have the Embrace healing skill).
Selene - Summoned using the Summon II skill. She has support skills to boost certain aspects of your party (namely, Skill & Spell speed).

, Please note, before you can order your pet to use skills, you must use the ""Obey"" command (Look in your skills if it isn't set to your hotbar, or press R1 if on PS3/4 to switch to the pet hotbar when it is summoned).


Eos

Embrace - Healing skill with a potency of 300. It's like psychic, but for your pet. And somewhat weaker.
Whispering Dawn - Restores the HP of all allies in range (15y) for 21 seconds, with a potency of 100.
Fey Covenant - Increases the Magic Defense of all allies in range (15y) by 20% for 20 seconds.
Fey Illumination - Increases the amount of HP everyone heals (when they cast a healing spell.) Within range of the spell (15y) by 20% for 20 seconds.


Selene

Embrace - Healing skill with a potency of 300. The exact same skill as what Eos has.
Silent Dawn - Silences (prevents a target from casting spells) for 1 second.
Fey Glow - Increases the spell speed for all nearby allies (15y) by 30% for 30 seconds.
Fey Light - Increases the skill speed for all nearby allies (15y) by 30% for 30 seconds.

Fey Glow and Fey Light cannot be active at the same time.

Admit you have a problem.,
Consider the following: Imagine the day that you first bought the game.,
Find out what has caused your addiction.,
Make it a joint effort.,
Set up parental controls for yourself.,
Schedule other activities with your free time, so you won't have time to play FFXI.,
When all else fails,there is only one thing to do left.",How to Break a Final Fantasy XI Addiction," This may be hard, but accepting that FFXI has taken over your life is the initial step into overcoming your addiction.;
, If you knew everything you did now, would you still have bought it? Now the follow up question: Imagine yourself in two years, still playing FFXI, looking back on today when you are making the decision to quit or keep playing. How do you feel about your decision to continue?

, What makes Final Fantasy XI so appealing to you? Is it the fact that it has different continents that you will never go to? Is it the fighting? Whatever it is, try to minimize this happiness in FFXI, and make it a pleasure that you could also get in every day life.



Take a martial arts class. Many gamers are very interested in the martial arts, but never study it. Take up some sort of martial art that is similar to your character in FFXI. For example, if you use a sword in the game, then take up fencing, Kendo, or SCA fighting.






Try Reading. Novels have just as much excitement and adventure as FFXI, but you can expand other skills -- such as critical thinking and vocabulary -- in addition to those that interactive storytelling and game play will build.






Play a different videogame. Sure, you might just find yourself in another addiction, but at least you're not paying every month.







, Believe it or not, many people play FFXI simply because their friends play it, and they find it enjoyable to spend time with them in FFXI. If this is the case, then convince your friends to stop playing (with these steps, if needed), or even better, find another game to play. Otherwise, explain to your friends and family what you're doing, and ask them to help you stay on track. When you can't trust yourself to keep away from FFXI, you have to trust someone else to stop you.

, Make it so your play-time is limited, and use a complicated password that you are sure to quickly forget. Or, ask a friend or family member to set the parental controls with a password you don't know.

, One of the most effective way is to get a part time job and book every free time you have to work. Hang out with your friends, play basketball, engage in extra curricular activities at school (such as clubs or sport teams) or volunteer. The important thing is that they keep you outside of your home, away from your computer. You can find that there are many things that are just as exciting as playing FFXI. Remember, your ""guild"" online is no substitute for the company of real friends.

, The ultimate answer, the end-- beat the game. Because when it's all said and done, a dead man's possessions isn't important, it's the memories. So go out and make your own, now-- in the real world.

Understand your abilities.,
Organize your spells.,
Learn the MP cost and cast times.,
Assess the situation.,
Experiment with new strategies.",How to Be a Black Mage on Final Fantasy XIV," A Black Mage has two buffs that must be understood well to do well. Umbral Ice and Astral Fire are buffs both gained from spells that have two different primary goals. Fire spells give Astral Fire buffs, which increases damage and stops MP regeneration. Blizzard spells give Umbral Ice Buffs which speeds up MP regeneration, but do not do much damage in comparison. Switching between the two buffs is the key characteristic of any BLM strategy.;
, Your spells should be organized in a way that when you switch spells, it leaves no room for error and yet deliver what you want. The idea is to organize such that your Fire spells are together, and the Blizzard spells are together. Some spells like Blizzard 3 and Fire 3 are normally used in sequence, so having them both near each other for quick access is very helpful.

, Learning both can be a huge lifesaver on many situations, especially more so in boss fights. For example, knowing that Fire spells have half the cast time as normal if you have am Umbral Ice III buff up and vice versa.

, As a BLM, you have access to both hard hitting AoE and harder hitting single target. You generally want to use AoE only in certain situations as it costs much more MP and generates a lot of threat for you. Most of these situations will be when there are 3 or more enemies near each other.

, Try out new combination of spells together or in certain orders and find your own strategy. Doing this would give you a better understanding of how your spells play out, and would leave more room to change if an ability was added or changed.

Create a new character or import one from Version 1.,
Select race and gender.,
Customize your appearance.,
Select a Guardian.,
Choose a Class.",How to Play Final Fantasy XIV1," When playing FFXIV, you have a few options in terms of character creation. If you played the first version of the game, released in 2010, you can import your characters from that game. This gives you the bonus of being able to retain the inventory and skills you had, while still allowing you to change everything about your character's race, appearance, name, etc. If you did not play the original version of the game, you can create a new character.;
, Gender does not have any effect on your abilities or stats, so choose whatever you like! You can choose from a variety of races, each with their own unique look. The races do impact your stats. However, the impact is so minimal and only impacts the initial stats, so you should still choose whatever you like best.


The available races include the Hyur (humans), Elezen (elves), Lalafell (token tiny race), Miqo’te (cat people), Roegadyn (big brutes).
You can also choose a clan, which will further impact your stats. However, similar to the overall race, the impact of the choice in the long term is not enough to take into consideration.

, After choosing your race and gender, you may want to adjust your appearance as well. You can choose a random or default appearance, or you can change everything from eye color (you can have two!) to your hair style.

, Your guardian will determine your elemental resistances, which are shown on-screen for each guardian. This can be especially useful for those who rely on magic.

, Your class will determine a lot about how your game will start out. Class affects what weapon you use, what role you play in battles, and the abilities you will have. It even plays a role in what clothing or armor you will have access to as the game progresses. The classes that you will immediately have access to are the warrior and mage classes. As you reach higher levels, more classes will become available, as will jobs (available at level 30, allow access to more abilities, limit access to cross-class abilities).


Disciples of War (physical attack) classes include Gladiators (who later become Paladins), Pugilists (who later become Monks), Marauders (who later become Warriors), Lancers (who later become Dragoons), and Archers (who later become Bards).
Disciples of Magic (magical attack) classes include Conjurers (who later become White Mages), Thaumaturges (later Black Mages), and Arcanists (who later become Summoners or Scholars).
Once you reach level 10, you will be given your class quest. After this point, you will have the ability to switch to a Disciples of the Hand or Disciples of the Land class, stay with your current class, or switch to one of the other starting classes. Disciples of the Hand and Land are the crafting classes and can give you and your friends access to useful, high-level items.
It is important to note that your class determines which city you start the game in. Though you will eventually have access to the rest of the world, your starting city will be where you become acquainted with the game.

After completing each level, consider running through it again on free play so that you can earn more studs by killing and destroying everything.
Run a few pod races in Mos Espa, or complete any other challenges that are quick and easy for you.
Use multipliers with care. They are expensive and might not be worth it in the long run.

, Some events can cause you to lose studs; this means that you will need to go find more in order to replace them, which can take up time. Consider turning on invincibility to prevent any losses. Here are two ways you can lose studs:


If you die by falling down a pit, you will lose 1,000 studs.
If you die by getting hit by a blaster, you will loose 2,000 studs.

, Darth Vader will not unlock if you are in free play. You can, however, use free play in order to earn studs.

Play through story mode.,
Play for points.,
Collect the Minikits.,
Collect gold bricks.,
Collect blue canisters.",How to Play Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga," Story mode is essentially a series of rooms through which you must advance. Some rooms include some sort of puzzle that must be worked out in order to enter the next room. Many gamers derive a great deal of satisfaction from figuring out how to get through a level with as little guidance as possible, but if you are completely frustrated and you just want to know how to get past a particular obstacle, then there are many detailed walkthrough available elsewhere on the Internet; for example, A FAQ/Walkthrough by Scott ""CyricZ"" Zdankiewicz, published at Game FAQs, Access date: 2008 Jun 15. Upon completion of each chapter, you will be awarded one gold brick; you will unlock freeplay for that chapter, and you will unlock the characters featured in that chapter.

, Points are awarded in the form of Lego studs. Silver studs are worth 10 points, gold studs are worth 100 points, blue studs are worth 1000 points and purple studs are worth 10,000 points. Studs are generally awarded when you destroy some piece of the scenery, but they can also be found laying on the ground like bread crumbs leading to the next challenge. Each chapter has a set number of points which must be obtained in order to achieve the status of True Jedi. A gold brick will be awarded if you achieve True Jedi and complete the mission. See below for a handy reference table of how many points are required at each level. If you are having trouble winning as many points as you would like, try these strategies.


Blow up everything you see. Take the time to wander around each area destroying everything.
Stay alive. You lose studs when your character dies. Avoid dying by taking care to collect red heart charms to restore your health or by activating the invincibility extra. You can also decrease the effect of your death by turning off the extra called adaptive difficulty. See How to use power bricks for more information regarding extras.

Turn on the stud multipliers. Stud multipliers are extras available to buy after you find the associated power bricks.

Access the menus.,
Interact with NPCs.,
Interact with your friends.,
Make use of Aetherytes and other transportation methods.,
Exit the game properly.",How to Play Final Fantasy XIV2," There are a variety of menus which can be accessed using the buttons at the bottom of the screen. The system menu, for example, will allow you to access to many of the settings. You can also access the settings menu by clicking Esc. Some of the other menus include:


The Map. You can use a variety of maps while playing the game. You can bring up the larger map (press M if playing on a PC), look at a map when viewing your quests, or use the mini-map in the corner of your screen. The map will tell you where to go for quest objectives, as well as the location of important characters, objects, or buildings.
Your journal. Your journal will have important information about your quests and quest progress. You will also be able to see maps for each quest, as well as rewards. The journal can be brought up most easily by pressing J (on a PC).
Your item menus. You can access your general inventory either through the main inventory menu or by selecting the colorful squares above your main buttons. The colorful squares indicate slots in your inventory occupied by items. You can access weapons and armor through your armory menu. You can have 25 of each type of weapon. Right-click (on the PC) to get a few of the item options.

, You can interact with NPCs to get quests and rewards. When buttons appear above an NPCs head, this means you can interact with them. A tan button will appear when you can talk with an NPC to get a quest. When you’ve completed a quest, a green button above the NPCs head will need to be selected in order to get your reward.


When talking with any NPC, you will need to right-click on the text screens to progress through them.

, There are lots of ways you can interact with your friends in the game. Aside from the usual joining of guilds and friending people you know or joining their characters in the world, you can also use the Moogle Delivery Service to send messages, items, and money to other characters. Find a Moogle to receive items you are sent.


You can also set up or join a Linkshell, which will allow you access to a closed chat with only the people attached to the Linkshell. This is a great way to interact with your friends or guildmates.
When you are at the very beginning of the game, you will not be able to see or play with other people in the world. However, once you make it through the beginning tutorial, you will be able to join your friends.

, There are many ways, within the game, to travel between the cities, within the cities, and even to smaller settlements. Aetherytes, for example, are a great mode of transportation. These large crystals, seen throughout the world, will instantly transport you between any place you have visited before. All you have to do is attune yourself to each crystal you come across by interacting with it.


You can also use airships, ferries, and Chocobos (either that you own or hire) to travel between areas.
The smaller Aetherytes are for travel within your current city.

, The game autosaves, so you won’t need to constantly save your progress. However, to make sure that your most recent progress saves correctly before you quit the game, make sure that you exit the game through the menu (rather than just turning it off).

Play through the tutorial.,
Become acquainted with the adventurer’s area.,
Play through the starting quests and visit your class guild.,
Complete the main quests.",How to Play Final Fantasy XIV3," The tutorial will have a lot of vital information and will help you get to know the complex world much better. You should pay attention and not try to skip through all of the information which appears on the screen. Even if you played the first version, it is important to remember that this game is very different.


When you first begin the tutorial, you will also have the ability to set your peripherals (if playing on a PC). This will allow you to pair a game controller with PC play, if you wish to.

, Though it will be different for each city, there is a main Adventurer’s area, encountered at the end of the main tutorial, where you will be able to get information, acquire quests, and meet all sorts of characters.

, It is important not to try to skip the initial quests or a visit to your class guild. Doing these things not only gives you important information and introduces you to how the game works, it also will give you experience (XP) which will help your character level and become strong enough to defend yourself out in the world.

, The quests which are part of the main story of the game will be marked in much the same way as other quests (with a button hovering over characters’ heads). However, these quests are easy to distinguish because the button will have a different shape (like they’re on fire).


These quests are an important way to level your first class, since the side quests are not repeatable and should be saved for leveling up second classes or general later leveling.

Learn your skills for your class.,
Avoid enemy attacks.,
Use combos.,
Work with your teammates.",How to Play Final Fantasy XIV4," Learn your skills, or abilities, for your class. These abilities will let you fight better and more skillfully by giving you powerful moves and defenses. Learn your skills by leveling your character: the higher your level, the more powerful a fighter you will be.


Actions are activated skills. These can be assigned to particular buttons for use in battles. Learn new actions as you progress between the different levels. View and assign these abilities through the Actions menu, nested in the main menu.
Traits are similar to actions, except that they are passive abilities, rather than active ones. This means that they are always in effect.

, When battling enemies, you will want to stay out of the way of their attacks if possible. If you are a ranged fighter, make sure you stay ranged. If you do have a reason to fight up close with an enemy, look out for glowing shapes on the ground around you. This is their area of attack and will show up right before they execute an attack. If the shape is red, that means it will hurt you and you need to get out of the way!


As you gain levels and fight harder enemies, the amount of time you have to get out of the way will be less and less. Don’t worry, they give you plenty of time in the beginning to get used to the system.

, Combos are actions used in a particular order to execute powerful moves which can really help turn a battle. You will probably not have access to any combos until you’ve gained several levels, however, as you’ll need many abilities to use in combination!

, With games like this one, it is very important to work with other people to beat enemies. Each class has it’s own strengths and weaknesses and when players from a variety of classes play in balanced teams, dispatching enemies will come with ease! Consider joining a free company (player guild) or forming your own team with your friends.


You can even use features of the game to make fighting with your teammates even easier. For example, enemies can be marked, which will allow you and your teammates to coordinate attacks.
Use limit breaks. If you fight in a party of four or more, you’ll get to use the limit gauge. As you deal damage and heal allies, you’ll fill the gauge until a special move is unlocked. What the move will be will depend on the class of the player activating it, but these moves are very useful and should be taken advantage of.

Do lots of quests.,
Participate in Fates.,
Fight creatures out in the world.,
Complete items from your logs to gain extra XP.,
Get XP buffs when you can.",How to Play Final Fantasy XIV5," Quests are the best way to level your character, so do whatever quests you can find. If you plan on leveling more than one class, you may need to plan out what quests you do when, but you will want to be sure that you are generally doing quests.


Guild Levels are a good way to get XP and level your character. These are time-limited quests which are received from the Adventurer’s Guild. The tasks can be battle oriented or simply be a request to fetch items or craft items.

, Fates are randomly generated battles which occur as you travel around the world. Any players in the area can participate and the XP and rewards are determined only by how much you contribute to the battle. These are a great way to get XP, so make sure to get out on the road every now and again!


It doesn’t matter if someone else is fighting a creature: you can join in to help! Players will not lose anything by getting help in a battle. The first person to engage an enemy will always receive 100% of the associated XP.

, You can level grind by fighting the small, minor creatures you encounter out in the world. These will yield small XP gains, but come in an unlimited supply, so they’re still a great way to level your character.

, You will have a variety of logs, where you are tasked with finding X number of a particular item. Complete the collection and you will be given an XP and monetary reward. Certain logs are individualized to your class, and can be worked on at any point (in other words, don’t save them for leveling later classes).


You crafting and gathering logs will give you experience rewards, generally for crafting or gathering an item for the first time.
Work on your hunting log. Your hunting log will give you XP and money for killing a certain number of particular monsters. This is individualized to class, so you should feel free to go ahead and work on your hunting log at any time. This makes them a great way to level a second class.

, Certain items and situations can help you gain XP faster. Some foods and drinks will provide a small XP buff. You will also receive an XP buff as apart of free company activities, so consider joining one.

, In creating a new game, you’ll have the option to modify your server.


Game Mode – You have three options to choose from: Survival, where you get to explore Navezgane  County, Arizona to uncover the truth behind the apocalypse; Deathmatch, where you get to compete with other players to get most kill scores. You can gain loot from around or from air-dropped supplies. Lastly, Zombie Horde, wherein a lot of zombies appear at night and supplies are air-dropped each morning.
Game World – This provides a selection of the different maps in each Game Mode. (i.e. Forest Map, Wasteland and Navezgane).
Game Name – Type in your desired name for the server.
Difficulty – The 5 difficulty levels of this game are: Scavenger (the lowest and the best level for beginners), Adventurer, Nomad, Warrior, and Survivalist (the highest level).
24 Hour Cycle – This is where you adjust the pace of 24 hours in the game.
Friendly Fire – Turning this ON allows players in the server to damage or kill other players.
Enemy Spawning – Enables spawning of zombies in the world.
Zombie Run – Gives zombies the ability to run or not. It is best to leave it as Default.
Show Players Icon – You’ll be able to see player's icons in your map. Make sure to switch this off in Deathmatch mode.
Public/Private – If you choose Public, your game will appear in the master server which allows players to join your game.
Max Players – The number of player you want your server to hold (minimum of 2 and maximum of 16).
Game Password – Make your game Public, and then add a game password for your friends to access the server.
Game Port – The Port number which players use to connect to your game; there's no need to change this.
Cheat Mode – Enabling this will give you access to all resources by pressing “Z”. Switch this off in a multiplayer server.

, Once the server is set up, you can press START to build the world and start playing with other players.

, If you want to join an existing game, choose Connect to Server. A list of Servers will appear on your screen including the name of the server, Game Host, World Name, Game Mode, country, etc.

, If joining a particular server, type the Game Name in the Game Filter box using proper caps. Click the name and then press START.

, Another way to join a server is by typing the IP manually; use this to join a private game.


Ask for the IP address of the Host and then type it in the “Connect To Server IP” box below. There are no spaces and the period is included. (e.g.: 127.0.0.1).
The port number default is 25000. Now, press START.

, Remember to keep your character in top shape. A life gauge is located at the bottom left of the screen.


Hunger (Green) - Regenerate your hunger by eating canned foods, berries and cooked meat.
Health (Red) - Health can be replenished over time by using medical supplies such as painkillers and bandages. It also regenerates if Hunger is appeased, though not as good as what medical supplies do.
Thirst (Aqua Blue) - Your Thirst lowers quickly as you move around. Refill your thirst; drink bottled water or juice. If you don't have water with you, equip an empty bottle. At a nearest lake, right click on the water; this will refill your bottle.

, Time is important. Zombies run and move faster as soon as the sun sets in.


Daytime (7:30AM - 8:30PM) – Strengthen your shelter and find loot. Zombies are slow, but they run in dark places.
Nighttime (9:00PM - 6:00AM) – Zombies at night are more active and aggressive; they deal more damage and can even break blocks. They can also spawn at your shelter if you're not around so use torches to light up your home.

, Gather as much food, water, and weapons as you can, from cars, junks and even dead corpses by pressing “E”.


Save your bullets for emergency; you can kill zombies with a stick, and aim at the head.
Once you have killed them, you can loot their items as well.

, Search for a good shelter to keep you safe from horde attacks. The best shelter for beginners is a house with a basement.


With enough supplies, begin digging the ground at your basement. This is a great hideout for aggressive zombies.
Block up the door and windows with a stone block for added protection. Block up the entryway as well to prevent the zombies from entering the hole.
Put torches around the cave to slow them down and to prevent them from spawning.

, After having supplies and shelter, you can start crafting items.


Press “I” to open up your inventory; your crafting box is located at the upper part.
At the right side of the box is a list of craftable items you can do with your materials. Click the item you wanted to make and then a pattern will appear.
Put the materials at the highlighted blocks to have your crafted item appear at the single empty box. Click the crafted item to bring it into your inventory.

, While waiting for sunrise (7:30AM), you can continue digging deeper to look for iron or other minerals for you to use in crafting (e.g. gunpowder for dynamites).


Remember to keep your Hunger and Thirst high.
Avoid making huge rooms underground to prevent caving in.
At sunrise, crawl out from your cave to explore and gather materials again. But be careful, sometimes zombies have gathered right at the exit. Multiple exits are more useful but make sure to securely block it up.
Strengthen your shelter and crafts; install traps as well. The longer you survive in this game, the stronger you get. But equally, the zombies grow in number and become smarter as days pass.

Know your server.,
Know the kits.,
Another good kit is Special Forces, and using C4 packs to pre-load a departing plane (1 pack) or helicopter (2 packs).,
Of course, talk lots of smack.,
Eventually, your teammates will become sufficiently annoyed at you to come after you.,
They will, eventually, catch onto where you are.,
Speaking of which, another helpful step is to become the commander, where you can use supplies to refit yourself with more missiles/C4, and call in artillery strikes on your own forces (if Friendly Fire is enabled).,
Finally, be even-handed.",How to Teamkill in Battlefield 2," Most servers will kick you for having a certain negative score, sometimes it's when you reach -20, sometimes -30, or -40. If you know the breaking point, you can go kill some enemy for a while, then come back to TK your team without being kicked.;
, Best kit for aircraft T-King is anti-tank. Generally, one AT missile will destroy a waiting aircraft. If you can, destroy the aircraft when your teammate is running towards it, but not close enough to be killed by the explosion, so you won't get as many negative points. The annoyance factor to him is, of course, the same, perhaps better if he can see that Su-34 blow up before his eyes.

, Give them a little time to get away, then hit the detonator for that ""WTF??"" factor.

, Ask your teammate how they feel about not getting the jet or being about to take the enemy base when you let the C4 off. After all, this is all for the fun of it, right?

, Ideally, find a map location where it is hard for them to reach you (for Gulf of Oman, use the helicopter to get atop the oil tank for MEC base, or get in the superstructure for the carrier). The same strategy, of course, is useful when you are camping the enemy base.

, But you need to die eventually, or you'll run out of missiles, right? (Using a tank or APC to continue your reign of chaos is OK, but you become an easier target for both team mates and the enemy).

, Make sure to fire off the UAV in the middle of the ocean for additional annoyance.

, Once you annoy your team sufficiently, switch teams and give the other guys a little headache time. They won't see it coming, and it balances out the game.

Learn the controls.,

Choose a kit.,

Choose a game mode.,

Know your role.,
Be mindful of the environment.,
Re-spawn wisely.,
Know the point system.",How to Play Battlefield 4 Multiplayer," If you have played previous Battlefield games before, you are pretty much in good shape since most of the controls were kept the same.


Some changes in the controls include team play functions. They are now assigned to bumper buttons (for consoles). Melee attacks are also repositioned and there are vehicle driving improvements, too. So better familiarize yourself with these changes.
Remember that you can adjust the controls settings to your liking. Whether you play the game via Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PC – this option is always available.;
, There’s nothing more than practical in terms of prepping up for multiplayer matches than actually playing the Battlefield campaign mode.


Depending on your level of know how when it comes to Battlefield, you can choose whether you want to start your campaign under easy, normal, or hard mode. Dice prefers experienced players to play hard.
Take this chance to get familiar with the game’s weapons and gadgets. You will eventually discover which type of class you are comfortable with.
If you are in a hurry then play, at least the first mission.

, This feature enables you to customize your soldier to your liking. This depends on the play style you are planning to execute during the online match.


You have to actually be in an online game for you to fully customize your soldier. You can customize your loadout, classes, and some other details.
The My Soldier option in the main menu just actually shows your soldier’s progression, awards, and other information. The real customization really happens in an online match.

, The four kits in Battlefield 4 are Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Each has distinct functions in a team so choose your kit wisely!


The assault kit is definitely the most popular among all the Battlefield 4 classes. The assault kit carries assault rifles, medic kits, and defibrillators. Use your medic kit to heal your team whenever needed. Perfect kit for newbies and players not looking into a specific role.
The engineer kit is for vehicle and anti-vehicle jobs. They can repair friendly tanks, jets ect. They can also use their rocket launchers to destroy enemy vehicles. If you use vehicles a lot, the engineer will be the best for you.
The support kit can supply and attack. They carry LMGs, ammo packs, and other explosives. Supply your team with ammo and be a heavy gunner!
The recon kit is the long-ranged sniper. It will take time to learn to snipe. Learn to be stealth and to headshot. Only choose this class if you can use it successfully.

, After a few rounds of online matches, sure enough, you will be a bit familiar with the maps in Battlefield 4. Well, it’s not enough just to get familiar with it – you have to master them!

, After choosing Multiplayer on the menu, you will then have access to quick matches that you can join in.


Conquest. This game mode has been present in in the Battlefield franchise since its humble beginnings. In this mode, 2 teams compete for capture points (flags) on a map.
Rush. This mode essentially gives a team the task of defending certain points in the map (M-COM stations).
Team Death match. This mode is pretty straight forward and seems to be popular among online players. Simple rule of this game mode – kill many enemies as you can. In Team Death match, working together as a team really matters since teamwork affects the tide of the battle.
Squad Death match. This mode puts 4 squads against each other where the squad with most kills at the end of the match wins the 4-way battle.
Obliteration. In this newly added mode, one team is tasked to defend high-value targets while the other team tries to destroy them - thus the name, Obliteration.
Elimination. Another new mode which is a more strict Team Death match. Stricter in the sense that once a soldier is killed – it won’t re-spawn. In short, it is permanently eliminated.
Defuse. The last newcomer in the game mode category. Again, this is a non-re-spawn mode where a team defends a spot while the other attacks it. Pretty much like Rush’s mechanics.
Domination. Another favorite. This game mode revolves around teams trying to capture flags across the map as they battle for territorial supremacy.
Air Superiority. Speaking of supremacy, this mode is all about air supremacy. This is for those who can maneuver air vehicles and eliminate enemies with it.
Capture the Flag. This game tasks a team to get hold of an enemy flag and bring it back to their own home base. The team with the most flag capture wins.

, Battlefield 4 really encourages teamwork when it comes to their game modes. From Team Death match to Rush – it is obvious that working together is a key ingredient in winning online matches.


Chatting with your teammates will surely help communicating strategies to beat the other team. Just be mindful of what you’re saying and avoid offensive words.

, In a team, members have specific functions. Better know what your role is in your squad is so your team’s offense (or defense) will be effective.


If you are an Engineer, make sure you focus on making yourself useful via vehicles. Engineers are most effective when they eliminate enemies inside vehicles.
For Recons, make sure you find a good spot for sniping. After a few kills, you can change location so you won’t giveaway your where about.
For Support, as the name suggests, make sure you support your teammates. Be on the lookout for ambushes and always be there for support firepower for your Assault class.
Assault kit pretty much has a straightforward role. Attack the enemies! Bring them down and if ever you get yourself killed, re-spawn and kill some more.

, Some structures in Battlefield 4 can be destroyed. This can be a good thing for you if you know how to use this to your advantage.


Engineer’s rocket launchers become useful in collapsing these said structures. Of course, using vehicles can be effective, too.

, In case you were killed, choose the best position for your re-spawn. Sometimes respawning at the right spot can give you an upper hand in combat.

, Knowing which tactics will give you more points will really help you boost up your leveling. Like head shots, killing in this manner surely give you more points compared to a simple frontal kill.


In Battlefield 4, once you reach above 75 points, even an assist kill will award you a full kill point!

Beat arcade mode a few times, this will hopefully unlock the Monk's garb, Usurpers suit, Executioner's boots, Leather gloves, Death's cloak or Hermit's Hood ,Hannya Mask, and Zasalamei Fighting style (The one with the scythe);
,
After unlocking these items, go into Create a Soul and start a new character, set the following for beginning: Male: Zasalamei

,
For the further things, use the following: Equipment trait|None (Light works too)| Battle Trait: Attack focus | Alignment: None | From there, select ""Start editing this character"" and take off all clothes/Start from scrap.

,
First of all, go to the ""Model Information"" tab and go to skin color.,
Now your character is probably going to look retarded, but that will come to an end soon, Go back to your characters attire and select ""Death's Cloak"" or ""Hermit's Hood"" for face equipment, leave the color as it is, we'll come to that later.

,
Go onto the face and select ""Hannya Mask"", as with the head equipment, leave the color as it is.

,
Shoulders are optional If you want to make the shoulders look broader, but not completely necessary.,
As for undergarments, get the ""Usurper's Suit"", it makes the body look better because of the opening in it.

,
For the body select the ""Monk's Garb"".,
For arms select ""Leather Gloves"".

,
the lower body armor can't be selected, but lucky for you, the ""Usurper's Suit"" covers that, so its all good!

,
For the feet, ""Executioner's Boots"" are the best.

,
Now that you've got all the equipment, and your character is looking pretty crappy, go to the colors and select the first option (Change all colors) and set it to ""9.02.15"" just as the eyes were.

,
He's probably looking a bit better, am I right?,
To finish him to look how he should, make the leather gloves yellow, same color as the horns preferably.

,
Now, up close he won't look much like him, but hey, it only zooms in on his face when you: Select him, Defeat an opponent, Edit him, Lose to an opponent, and do a critical finish, So no big deal, from far away it'll look like he has no face (Which he doesn't on the album) and like he has horns from his hood.

,
Lastly, there Is the weapons and System (Information).",How to Make the Wraith in Soul Calibur IV,",,, Select ""9.15.14"" for skin color (First digit is adjusted by the bumpers for those who can't figure it out), ""Male Voice 5 Pitch: -50"" for voice (Hair and face don't matter much, as head armor is very difficult to remove during battle), And ""9.02.15"" for eye color. Remember the eye color, as that matters for later wardrobe

,,, Pick some spaulders and leave them as is.

,, I'll tell you now, leave everything as it is on all equipment.

,,,,, well to make him look a WHOLE lot better, edit the mask and make the whole mask white and make the first part black (for the shadow or leave it red to blend in with the hood, Though I prefer black), and the horns yellow, choose whatever shade of yellow you desire. This will make the Wraith start to look better.

,,, for the name, its obviously going to be the Wraith, Wraith, etc.

Go to Start/Run and type 'defrag.exe' (minus the quotation marks) or if you can't get that to work do a search for 'Defrag' and click on the disk defragmenter tool.

, Unless you have a powerful system that can handle these two features (your video card is crucial here) they should be turned off. The decrease in image quality will be outweighed by the increase in frame rate on most systems.

, This will help you to drop lag, which can sometimes resemble slowing frame rates. If you cannot get access to wired Internet then update your wireless drivers.

, This is for more advanced users, as you run the risk of permanently damaging your computer if this is done incorrectly. However, a good overclock can wring a lot of extra power out of your computer. See the sources for more on how to do this.

SPOT.",How to Play Battlefield Bad Company 2 Online," Here they are (and some details):

Rush: Players must defend or destroy pairs of M-COM stations(bases) for as long as the attacking reinforcements (respawns) run out. An M-COM station can be destroyed by planting a charge, using conventional weapons or when a building is collapsed down on it.






Conquest: Players must capture and hold flags for as long as the enemy reinforcements hold out. Every kill makes the enemy lose one ticket, and enemy reinforcements decrease when a team controls more than half of the flags on the map. Vehicles unlock as control points are held.






Squad Rush: Rush mode played with only two opposing squads and two a M-COM station.






Squad Deathmatch: Four squads and one Infantry Fighting Vehicle (light tanks) roam the map. First squad to fifty kills wins.

, This class is the default infantry, it excels for fighting other infantry at medium to long range and comes with several attachments such as the grenade, smoke and under-barrel shotgun, as well as the capability to refill ammo.

Engineer. This class is your vehicle support/anti vehicle. This class comes equipped with silenced SMG's, a drill for healing vehicles, and rocket launchers or anti-tank mines for destroying them.

Medic fills the roll of this games support class, you get a LMG (light machine gun) used for providing covering and suppressing fire, healing kits used to heal friendlies and defibrillators that can revive your down teammates. When using this class it's best to stay a little back of the front lines, and be smart about picking people up.

Recon this class is based around reconnaissance. Use your spotting scope and motion sensor grenades to spot enemies near your vicinity and keep an eye on enemies that are advancing on the objective.

, If you do not work with your squad, you will not last very long, as this is what the games based around - Teamwork.;
, Teamwork is absolutely crucial to your success, so you should stay together with your team.

, Press the Back or Select buttons when looking down at an enemy. This will instantly reveal his position to your teammates and you get a +20Spot Assist for doing so.

Oh what is he on about?,
· Keep Moving.",How to Play Military or Army Style Games," This is the most important aspect of combat - period. You will get no-where if you just run around firing blind bullets, sure, it may get you a few kills (mostly because your opposition will not have foreseen such a stupid move), but it doesn't take a lot for the enemy to just step aside, be the calmer man and pop you with a shot to the chest. They will win, because they are more aware of their surroundings than you are. Use what devices you have available, radar (especially on Halo games!) maps showing enemy bases and above all your own eyes and the eyes of your teammates. Learn the army lingo, if someone gives you a heads-up saying '1 o'clock, AT soldier, 200’, you won't have enough time to figure out on the spot that he is talking about a soldier carrying an AT (anti-tank weapon) approaching at 1 o'clock to your current position and is currently 200 meters (656.2 ft) away. This would be pretty vital information if you were in a tank! So firstly, Be aware, constantly ask yourself: where is the enemy, why am i not under fire, why are my team-mates not advancing and what would be the best way out of this (bad) situation. With practice ('practice' is army-talk for 'a couple shots up your ass') this will happen automatically. Be aware of your surroundings. There are no nice surprises in war.;
, It is no good watching a guy walk up behind you and skull you with a .38 and then saying ' i may be dead, but i was aware of him...’ This point should go hand in hand with the first, in games like Operation Flashpoint always reload your weapon when there is a natural pause in the fighting, that preparation could give you the edge in a fire-fight as you will be able to keep firing longer than your opponent without reloading. Think ahead, expect worst. It is alright to top up your half- empty magazine, you may be able to survive the next minute with just 16 bullets, you may not, but are you willing to take that risk? Equip yourself with a variety of weapons, short-range (shotguns, knives, sub-machine guns etc), long-range (sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers etc) and other, ranged weapons, such as grenades, smoke shells, flash grenades etc. You may not always use all of the weapons, but it pays to be prepared.

, It is no good wielding a weapon if you don’t know what it’s for and why it would be advantageous in some situations rather than others. Rifles, for example, would be useless in long-range situations because of their instability when firing; they are mostly used for providing cover fire (a tactic used to get the enemy to hit the dirt by firing bullets at them but not with the intention of killing them, rather to get them to hold their fire long enough for team members to escape). This is because of their rapid-fire rate. Grenades are used to disperse enemy forces moving in groups, the fragmentation produced will wound soldiers within a certain radius. Take trial runs, experiment with weapons, and put in time in the training modes. Or just simply pick a target (a lamppost, street sign or any other stationary object) in play mode and practice hitting it while moving backwards, forwards, sideways and when doing other actions (sprinting, jumping, crouching, diving etc). Remember, a bad workman blames his tools, the same is true for soldiers, it is your choice of weapon and your skill that matters, not how ‘good’ the weapon is. That particular weapon you may find yourself cursing when you see the “game over” screen was made for a specific purpose, which is why it exists, find out what that purpose is. If a LAW launcher can take out an M60 tank in one shot, and an AT launcher needs two, it would be pretty obvious which one you would favour, but only if you knew that rocket launchers in general take a long time to reload and thus only then would you know to look for one that reloads quickest. Of course, more than one weapon is available in combat for any given purpose, you have to judge for yourself which one is more suitable.

, In every mission you are given an objective, and maybe a secondary objective, make sure you have fully completed your first objective before moving onto the second objective, even then, assess the situation, if you ARE AWARE, then you will already know which members of your platoon are injured, how much ammunition you have left and how likely it is that the secondary objective will be achieved without significant loss of lives. Always go through this checklist and you will never fail:


What is my situation? Am I injured from a previous mission? Where is the nearest enemy base from my current (insertion) position and where is the nearest friendly base (in that order)? Am I part of a team? If so, what position am I in the team? A number 2 soldier has more responsibilities than a number 8 soldier, the main one being taking command of the group when number 1 goes down. What type of soldier am I? AT? LAW? Machine gunner? Rifleman? Sniper? What position should I take up in a combat situation? What should be my primary target in a combat situation – for an AT soldier it would be any tanks, for a sniper it will be any particularly well-armed soldiers, like a soldier mounting a turret, for example. What are my objective(s)?
What advantages do I have over the enemy before I start? Examples are the cover of dark i.e. the element of surprise, superior numbers, a greater supply of ammunition, an extra type of soldier (e.g. AT, sniper, machine gunner, grenadier) and having vehicles (tanks, trucks, jeeps, helicopters) to hand. Of course, you will not always know so much about your enemy for you to make comparisons with yourself, war is not that easy. But it is better to ask a question and not have the answer rather than finding yourself asking the question as you stare down a gun barrel.
Which of these advantages is most important to my objective and thus, which can I afford to lose should it come to sacrificing one? For example, the element of surprise would not be as important to a search and destroy mission as it would be to an ambush mission and thus the loss of surprise would be affordable in a search and destroy mission, however, the loss of the advantage of having a superior supply of ammunition, for example, would not be affordable.
What will be my path to the main objective? What obstacles will I encounter on the way? Is it better if I keep a low profile and avoid any confrontations or is time too short to be sneaking out of my way? What formation will my team take (only when in command of a team, of course)? How can I use the relief (shape or lie) of the land to my advantage (cover of trees, buildings, hills etc)?
What will be my objective when I encounter resistance? Destroy? RRA (Retreat, Regroup, Avoid)? Or will I decide that based upon the situation and whether or not I have achieved my objectives? If so, can I afford to decide there and then based upon the situation? These are called ROEs, Rules of Engagement, which any soldier has to know how to follow and which any commander has to know how to implement.
What are my EVPs (Evasion Plan of Actions)? If you are well prepared, then you should anticipate failure. Of course, certain things cannot be foreseen, and in those situations, the men will be separated from the boys, the seasoned veterans from the happy fairy cake newbies. If you encounter resistance and are beaten back, what will be your IEP (Initial Evasion Point)? An IEP is a location where members of your group will meet if the group has to scramble or is dispersed, from there, the EVP will be mounted. As a rule of thumb, it is always best to have 2 IEPs and EVPs.

, This may seem a very odd requirement for a smart, independent soldier who wants to survive, surely thinking is the first thing he will do. Wrong. Orders are given to be followed, superiors are superiors because they have enough experience to give suitable orders. What they don’t need is puny scum soldiers trying to feed their ego by answering back or questioning. Ever wondered why discipline and respect is emphasized so much at boot camp? Because the whole point of such organisations and the drills they do is to get you to submit wholly to the order, to get you to forget your opinions, your thoughts, your fear, your emotion, such things are irrelevant, your name is irrelevant, after a few weeks in the field, no-one has a name. Having said this, the soldier is free to use his individual store of reason and judgement to ensure he survives so he can obey the order.

, Since when was playing a stupid little game so complicated, why go through all this? What the hell do ROEs and IEPs and EVPs have to do with good ol’ fashioned lead trading? Well they have everything to do with war and nothing to do with war. This is the way war is supposed to be fought (yes, there are no rules in war, but, as I said, it is better to have rules to fall back upon rather than figuring out what to do there and then). All of the above is what you should do, but swallow that damn ego and go in prepared to change your plans, to crawl out, to surrender, to fight dirty, whatever it takes, prepared to retrace your steps and admit you’re wrong, if you can do that honestly, then failure becomes non-existent to you. The most important thing is that a soldier should know what he SHOULD do in any given situation, he must then judge whether it is what he WILL do, the quality of that judgement is what combat is all about.

, A moving target is ALWAYS harder to hit, and particularly in close quarters, it shouldn't affect your aiming too much. If you have to stop to shoot, do so, but take your shots and move on. Don't sit there, crouched, aiming into space. Someone will turn the corner and spray you down and you won't have time to react or take cover. If you ever get killed by someone who's on top of the score list you'll notice that when they kill you, they're generally still moving.

Do some Recon.",How to Play Battlefield 3," The most important part of this game is being a team player. Work together and be strategic. This will help you almost more than anything else. If you want to play like a real pro, each player on a team should have a specific role. See the section below for more information on roles.;
, The purpose of ground-vehicles is to destroy everything in sight. MBT (Main Battle Tanks), should be used aggressively, you should always push towards the objective and makes sure the path is clear for your team-mates. LAV (Light Armoured Vehicles) and IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicles) should be used primarily to disperse of enemy infantry and blow up the occasional building. Transport Vehicles, as the name suggests, should be used to drop off troops to certain destinations. This is also the case for the RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat), although being easy to destroy, they are the fastest thing for water travel.

, Your main purpose is to help the troops on the ground. Unless you are in a Jet, your main priority is to clear the air, and once that is done you must focus on helping your team on the ground. Attack Heli's, are capable of destroying nearly everything (With a Gunner). It is vital to make use of it. Scout Helis have 4 seats, and only the pilot gets to use the turret. Then you have the 5 seat Transport Helis, which the pilot can only fly, there are 2 gunner seats and 3 extra seats for passengers.

, Don't forget that you have the option to use your enemy's weapons after you've killed them. This can be very important, strategically, if your weapons are inadequate or your enemy just had something really awesome. Stand over their bodies and press the activation button, whatever that is for your system, to take their weapon.

, You will not be good with every gun. It's all about finding the right gun for you. There is so much variation in Battlefield, there is definitely a gun that is right for you. You will just have to vary up the guns that you use to find the perfect one. Even if you find the right gun, you may not be comfortable with the sights. You should consider using different sights/scopes to see what you are most comfortable with.

, Kill Death Ratio (K/D) means nothing in Battlefield, this is a team-orientated game. You should be worried about Score Per Minute (SPM) and Win Loss ratio W/L. Although Win/Loss is sometimes determined on how good your team are, you aren't always fortunate to get into a good team.

, The best thing to do when you come under enemy fire is to find cover as soon as possible, judge where the fire is coming from and get to the closest object to you. Crouch or go prone, also working in teams with microphones helps a lot as you can ask for support if needed.

, You will always start off Bad. Personally, I had just come from playing Halo: Reach, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. And with the changes to the Battlefield engine (Frostbite 1.5 to Frostbite 2.0) The game was a lot harder to play for me at start. But with time, you will get better and you will learn how to play the game.

, If you are playing Assault, make sure you have a perfect set-up for what you are good at. For instance, some people are better at killing so they should equip the M320 to break through enemy lines giving the team the opportunity to push towards the objective.


Some are better at supporting the team's needs, so the better choice would be to use Health/M320 Smoke: health, obviously, to heal wounded team-mates and M320 smoke, to prevent the enemies see you running over to revive a fallen team-mate or get closer to the objective.

, If you are playing Engineer, your only purpose is to repair friendly vehicles and destroy enemy vehicles. It seems quite simple, but can be very difficult if the enemies are more alert with their vehicle.


Mines, can be very useful, but again, a clever opponent will always check the floor for mines. Your best chances are, to flank the vehicle.
Tanks and LAVs are weakest at the back, only 2 rockets are required to destroy them.
Air vehicles can be destroyed if one of your team-mates plays recon with a Soflam, designates the target for you and you then use a Javelin to destroy it.

, Main duty: suppressing fire and give a ton of ammo to friendlies in need. This should generally be played by someone who won't run in guns blazing and attract attention. The Support role is very much behind the scenes. They are often a target for enemies, so be careful.


You can use Supporter to strap C4 to friendly cars, drive up to enemy vehicles jump out and detonate the C4, killing the vehicle and destroying the car. You can simply plant it on an enemy vehicle, or blow up buildings where enemies are hiding.
Claymores are most effective when you are trying to hold off a position you can't always be at. For instance, protecting Site A with claymores, whilst you are protecting Site B.
Mortars are very rarely useful unless the enemy team are camping in close-quarters areas.

, This role should always spot enemies, even if you can't kill them (This will be handy for friendlies approaching their position). Give covering fire for your friendlies as you can see a lot more than they can.


Do NOT use the MAV unless you will be targeting enemies. Using the MAV to get kills is becoming increasingly frowned upon, not to mention it lacks skill.
Soflam should be used if your team are trying to take down vehicles (A lock from a SOFLAM does not last long, but it increases the damage of the heat-seeking rocket that is fired towards the locked vehicle).
The TUG-S is useful when you first start using recon, just to make you aware of your surroundings.

Always alternate different attacks.,
Sidestep to block instead of actually blocking.,
Become good at guard impacts.,
Become good with most or all characters.,
Be able to react quickly.,
Learn a character.,
Read and learn frame data.,
If your playing online try to figure out your opponent's pattern most of your adversaries will have a pattern on order of attacks(Common strategy: while getting up most players will try to strike your low to get you back in the ground.),
When starting a new character do some button mashing.",How to Become Good at Soul Calibur," Using the same attacks over and over again will let your opponent figure out your strategy.;
, If you Sidestep attacks, you can attack your opponent from behind or while he or she is in the middle of an attack.

, Guard impacts will always throw your opponent off guard and give you a perfect chance to attack.

, If you're only good with one character, then your opponent will know how to beat that character and it will not be much of a challenge for him or her.

, If you are able to change your position quickly during a fight, then your opponent will never have the upper hand. The faster you are, the more likely you'll be able to counter attacks.

, Find out a few power moves, some quick ones, and maybe a couple of long range. Knowing what your attacks are is a huge advantage.

, Frame data will help you find moves that are slow and can be punished as well as find moves that can easily break combos. Using frame data is the first step to playing like a pro.

,

, But remember what you pressed vs what you see on the screen. If you see an attack that is either Quick, or Powerful or Guard-Break then try it again. Keep mashing until you find another move. Repeat it. Learn it."

Play the Tashgar chapter.,
Play the Suez chapter.",How to Play Battlefield 4 Campaign," The first chapter begins in an underwater vehicle with your team. Without spoiling anything major, let’s just say that it is a perfect setting the tone for whole campaign - suspense. After the short flashback, then comes the flashback.


After moving out the school, your next destination will be 2 extraction sites. First extraction site combat will take place in an open space with an aid of an ally helicopter support. When going to the second site – don’t forget to load up and collect gadgets from crates.
You will need to fire down an enemy chopper upon reaching the second extraction site.
Second half of the mission begins inside a van driven by Irish. Your mission is to rescue 3 VIPs in a hotel. The action begins when your vehicle crashes. Luckily, you still managed to reach the hotel in one piece.
Make your way up to the rooftop of the building. There will be enemies that will stop you so be sure to work with your men to eliminate the Chinese soldiers. Stairs are perfect for cover and never wander too far from your team mates. Soon you will reach the rooftop.
When an enemy chopper arrives, slide through the collapsing building. Make sure to shoot enemies on your way down. There will be a cutscene after that.
Eventually, you will find yourselves in a car. The enemy chopper will be back so just keep on your track. Irish will be able to destroy the chopper via grenade soon enough. Last scene will be a crash and you need to work your way out of the car.;
, The story continues as your team gets out of the crashed car. Now, navigate your way inside the hotel lobby.


Accessing the lobby will not be possible at the moment so you will need to go to the elevator shaft as an alternative entrance. You will receive a weapon here that will surely be handy when the door opens. Enemies are expecting you outside!
Waves of enemies will come right at you so be sure to keep your ammo in constant supply. When the coast becomes clear, head straight to the VIP room. After an explosion, talk with the VIP and Kovic then head straight to the roof. Get ready for another confrontation here.
After clearing the roof, go straight to the chopper. Unfortunately, you will he shot and then Kovic leaves the scene with the VIP with your team left behind. Enemies will then again spawn so quickly take cover behind the yellow railings. Try to get hold of a sniper rifle too since it will make eliminating enemies easier.
The battle continues on the street. This time you will be up against – a TANK.
Watch out for two scared civilians amidst the fallen bodies. Approach the civilians and follow them until you reach the safehouse. Follow the markers to get outside the waterfront. Tanks will appear and you’ll then need to use C4 and M2 slam mines to destroy them.
Beat the tanks while on top of a building. Don’t let them get too close for they could actually crumble down the structure you are standing on! After you defeat the enemies, you can now escape Shanghai.

, You finally reach home base! Tension is still in the air and the fleet is far from safety. Find Garrison and Kovic to discuss the plan. You then go to the boat to head straight to the USS Titan.


Enter USS Titan through its hull breach while underwater. It is located in the back left corner. Find the hatch and interact with the white circle. Now pull yourself out of the water. Look for the white circle on the computer terminals on the left.
Get ready before you open the next door. The room behind this door is filled with enemies! Use your tactical visor to easily spot enemies despite the lack of sufficient lighting. Combat will eventually move outside the destroyed ship.
Combat outside the ship will be really heavy! Watch when explosives go rolling down on you. But once you survive that – you can now drop down to board an enemy patrol boat. Your destination is at the back of the Valkyrie.
Keep on the engine and never pause even for a bit. Enemies will come at you on every direction so getting past them will save you some bullets. After reaching the Valkyrie, exchange of bullets will continue on its lower decks.
After you wipe out the enemies, go through the door on the right. Your will now be up against choppers so you better equip yourself with a rocket launcher and a stinger to bring down these flying vehicles. Watch out for a helicopter full of enemy reinforcement. Upstairs you will meet Hannah and she will assist you fending off the enemies.
More choppers will come your way. Kovic will eventually fall during this sequence of combat. Again, if you have enough ammo for stingers – you should be fine. Keep shooting those choppers down. Rescue Garrison to complete the mission.

, You immediately board a boat and need to navigate your way to land amidst the furious weather. The minimap will be your best friend in completing this task. Remember to exit the vehicle quickly after it crashes to the land.


Action starts at this point. Use your tactical visor to have a better look on where your enemies are. Watch out for a turret on the left side and a bunch of enemies just behind the rocks. Take cover behind the tank.
This sequence of combat will be too difficult for you to be handled by yourself. Make sure to include your team and all the help you can get in clearing off the highway of enemies. More enemies will come your way when you reach the bridge.
Eventually your allied tank will be shaken up with an explosion leaving its driver out. Now it is your time to take control of the tank – on your own! Make the most of it to destroy enemy tanks and destroy structures, too. Remember to exit the tank when it’s about to explode. Your destination is an underground parking garage.
After leaving the parking area, hop back in to another tank. Watch out for enemies with AT rockets and large enemy tanks. You can temporarily use a hill for cover and take down the tanks one at a time. Don’t even think about battling these tanks on foot because that will be really dangerous.
When your tank gets destroyed, you will now need to fight your way up a restaurant and go to the airport. You will then meet with Irish which will be with you when you find yourself in an encounter. You will be pinned then a cutscene will take place.
Next scene, you will be back with your squad on the beach. The action starts when you reach the hangar. Better reach the storage room first before you make any move solely for you to have cover when fire exchange begins. Again, use your tactical visor to help you finish off enemies easier.
Reach the end of the hangar and your squad will then be in a car. You are in charge of the gunner’s seat. When an enemy truck appears, hold you fire until actual enemy troops appear. Things will get ugly after rockets fall down from the sky. This will eventually lead to your capture.

, While in captivity, you will undergo torture and you main goal from here on is to escape. You will have your chance to escape with your cellmate Dima leading the way.


Just follow Dima and you’ll be fine. You will need to be stealthy not be spotted by guards. You will have your chance to grab a shotgun by successfully eliminating guards silently then getting their weapon. Head to the tower to grab an SMG and then pull the switches to free the other prisoners. Get ready for the arriving guards!
Exit through the green door after the commotion. Rescue Irish and take two ore prisoners with you as you make your escape. Prepare for another cross fire. Make your way to the storage warehouse to bump into more guards.
On the elevator exit, don’t forget to equip yourself with your preferred weapon. Head to the security room and let Dima hack the system. Now go to the computer room and grab mines and a grenade launcher.
When the smoke of battle clears, the gate will finally be open! You will soon be reunited with your team with Hannah. More fighting happens up the hill. Make sure to grab the sniper rifle on the left building for it will really be useful on the battle ahead.
More reinforcements will arrive including a batch of enemies at the bridge to the tram. Get rid of these enemies by simply using your grenade launcher then ride the tram to end this chapter.

, Welcome to the most challenging chapter of this campaign. Your squad will immediately be dealt with hordes of enemies guarding the commanding officer’s headquarters.


Among the obstacles ahead, the tank will prove to be the most dangerous of all. The best way to destroy it is by planting mines on where it patrols. When you finally get rid of the tank, it will make your confrontation with the enemies much easier.
You can use an anti-aircraft tank and drive your way through gates across the fields. Watch out for those rocket emplacements. When you reach the bridge, get ready for another encounter.
There will be enemy tanks on the main road. Destroy them by using launchers while you are tactically positioned on top of the roof. While you are at it, also target the two buildings full of enemy soldiers just across the street. You will eventually reach Old Town.
Go straight to the command headquarters to get your next objective which is to blow up a dam! Now ride the car and drive towards the dam entrance.
From here on, it is best to use your sniper rifle to take down enemies from long range. This will prevent them from alerting more enemies to arrive. Once you reach a white building, use your grenade launcher to create an entry for your team to infiltrate the dam. Save a few rockets.
Find the elevator to reach the dam interior. Soldiers will now come your way so better be alert. Once you clear the wave of enemies, it’s time to plant your charge. After doing so, it’s time to get out of this place!
Outside the dam, here’s where the battle really escalated. Enemy soldiers are harder to hit but eventually, with some tactics, you will push through. Activate the C4 and watch the dam crumble down.

, Your immediate mission on the last chapter is clear: Save the VIP and survive the Valkyrie while it’s under attack. Escape the cargo plane and you’re back in action at the very edge of the ship. Make sure to get all the resources that you’ll need upon landing.


Positioning plays a crucial role in surviving this chapter. Make your way on top of a destroyed helicopter and start doing damage to the enemy troops. Use stingers to destroy their aircraft, too! There will be lots of enemy air support at this point.
Head to the catwalk that leads down to the right. You will be reunited with Pac again and your squad should go to the Medbay to find the VIP. You will receive your final objective after a dramatic cutscene.
Tombstone will lead the charge while aboard his battleship to face the Admiral. Join the charge and drive towards the ship. The charge will then be planted.
You will now have to choose if you wish to go down with Irish or Hannah, since the detonator suddenly malfunctioned. Remember, whoever you pick dies in the story.
There is a third choice which gives you the option to not choose between Hannah and Irish – thus, doing nothing. This might not be a good idea since waiting too long will eventually destroy Valkyrie, killing the VIP in the process.
Regardless of who you choose to go with you, you will then complete the final mission of the campaign. Congratulations and enjoy the final cutscenes.

Assault are equipped with powerful weapons, grenade launchers and can give ammo to their team mates.
Recon is an effective class if you wish to snipe. They can hide in scenery unnoticed, plant C4s on enemy Tanks and have one shot kill snipers at their disposal.
Medics can revive fallen team mates, heal themselves and their team.
Engineer can repair vehicles and they have a RPG.


Pick a suitable for you class and stick with it.;
, A smart solider would not act alone, unlike other shooters like Call of Duty or kill zone. Battlefield is much more realistic and is all about teamwork. Use your classes special abilities to assist each other and try to assist in kills. You'll get points for just shooting the enemy once before your teammate kills them., Vehicles are not found in Squad deathmatch (only 1 tank per squad deathmatch map). Otherwise, vehicles can be found easily and used effectively. In one team versus one team battles, you will find vehicles docked at your base, or if you are an engineer, you can repair broken vehicles. With vehicles you can use them in first person or you can adjust it to third person, multiple people can use a vehicle, and the additional players control a turret on the vehicle (if there is one) or they need to get transported quickly.

Whilst using a tank, try to keep your reflexes high as when fired from behind you get damaged more, try destroying enemies cover and using Destruction 2.0. sea vehicles are uncommon and should be used as defensive and not offensive.
Use air vehicles to bomb the enemy and destroy their air vehicles.
Light vehicles like motorcycles can be used to quickly carry you and your team mates somewhere.

, In squad deathmatch you and your squad will often camp in a building. However don't stay there too long as DICE programmed something called Destruction 2.0 allowing almost everything to be destroyed., If your playing squad deathmatch its 4 vs 4 vs 4 vs 4 players (16 in total) The objective here is to be the first squad to reach the kill limit. In conquest its 12 vs 12, you need to capture the control points and hold them as long as you can. In rush its 4 vs 4 players in battle for exploding devices, you need to detonate them before they explode or set them up. One team will be on offensive and the other on defensive. Squad rush is 12 vs 12 players in a tighter version of Rush. All modes can be played in a hardcore mode which is very hard., You can get XP in a lot of ways, collecting enemy dog tags, getting kills, giving ammo or Medical kits, reviving, fixing vehicles, getting control points, destroying enemy vehicles, detonating bombs, etc. The more XP you get the closer you are to the next rank, even if you lose you still get XP. But if you win you get more XP. You can also get medals per match which increase XP, Medals such as Knife efficiency (Getting 7 kills with the combat knife) or capturing a certain amount of control points., Follow these steps again and again to level up, who knows you might end up at Rank 50.,,,,,, Instead, take the long way around and base camp and wait for the enemy to respawn.

,, You have two options. Go into the artillery, or the heli. 'Now, just wreak havoc, but remember to destroy the AA gun ASAP!!

,, Choose either Recon or Demolitions from the kit menu.

, Or you could go to the enemy base and base camp. If at the enemy base camp, crouch and cut some trees down for cover. It is a good idea to kill the artillery guy and blow up the tanks with the laser designator.

Keep your weapon loaded.",How to Play Battlefield 2 Well1," Take cover behind things, jump off buildings to get away from an enemy who has climbed up, climb up buildings so you will have the jump on approaching enemies. Know the maps well so you won't get lost.

, Speed is a big part of this game so always be moving in the direction of your goal. Avoid walking straight, be sure to strafe some and move around. If someone is trying to snipe you this makes it really, really hard to get a head shot.

, But be sure not to stay too long once they have spotted you.

, When traveling around the maps, don't use up all your sprint; try to keep some in reserve for when you are in combat.

, You can reload your weapon while you are moving, and, if you start reloading first, then you can sprint and reload at the same time.

Lay down.,
Change your weapon to single shot.,
Use your weapon's iron-sights or scope, depending on what your weapon is equipped with.,
Start shooting.",How to Play Battlefield 2 Well2," Laying down gives you a huge accuracy bonus, makes you harder to spot and, once spotted, makes you a lot harder to hit.;
, This will increase your accuracy due to the recoil that will cause your aim to jump after each shot. After each shot you will want to wait for a moment until your sights are back where they were. To change your shot mode you reselect your gun. Basically try to switch to your rifle when you are already wielding it and it will change your shot mode. You can see what shot mode you are on by looking at the very bottom right hand of your screen.

, The default key for this is the Right-mouse button, click it once. Aim your reticle towards the enemy player. Try to get it onto his chest or head depending on the range.

, When using an automatic weapon you will want to fire in bursts at your target, no more than 5 shots at a time. This really depends on your range though, you don't want to just hold down the trigger because the recoil of the gun will bounce your aim up and off of your target.

Draw a bead on him.,
Take appropriate action based on your equipped weapon:


Heavy machine guns or automatic shotguns.",How to Play Battlefield 2 Well3," Pretty simple, point your gun at him.

, Aim at his head or chest. Now simply lay down down, scope in/use the iron-sights and fire. If the enemy is really close, as in about 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m), don't even bother with the iron sights as he should be dead within 2 seconds if you are hitting him.
Light machine guns, or weapons that don't have automatic. Start shooting in his direction. If he is 30 feet (9.1 m) or more away, lay down, scope in and then just try to get as many head shots as possible, or chest shots, while using full automatic. If he is really close like 3–10 feet (0.9–3.0 m), start firing, be sure to have the gun pointed at him, then lay down while strafing. It doesn't matter what direction you strafe, just don't strafe into a wall. While strafing you can lay down, get back up and basically do whatever you can to avoid being shot back. The common strategy for the opposing player will probably to lay down, so it should be fairly easy to keep your aim on them.
For a pistol you really got to focus on getting head shots, you only have 15 shots so you really got to make them count.
For a sub machine gun you can just point and shoot. Strafe around your target and keep firing.

, Vehicles are best used for transportation, as when left stationary, they are easy kills for the opposition.

, Find a style that you can play well and easily, don't be caught off-guard trying to go solo.

, If you think someone is dead, but could be hiding nearby, throw some grenades, force him out.

, Learn where to snipe, where to run, where to drive, find out all the alleys and secret paths, this will give you a huge advantage.

, As much fun as it is to go all out shooting, remember, if their numbers are more, they will probably kill you before you kill them.

, If there are already several snipers on a map, with no-one else nearby, stick around, any soldiers who get too close will have escaped the sniper. Help him out.

, If the rest of your team rushes in, hang back and wait to see what the first skirmish results in. If you win it, run in and pick off the rest, if you lose, head back, regroup and develop a plan.

, Campers just kill someone and then that player comes back and kills them. In essence, KEEP MOVING!! This also makes it harder for snipers to hit you.

Capture points to win.",How to Play Battlefield 2 Online2," When you start a game, you are taken to the Spawn screen. This is where you choose where to appear on the map, and where you choose your loadout, or ""kit"". Your kit determines what weapons and equipment you have, and will have a large effect on your playstyle.Special Forces - Special Forces are equipped with a good mid-range carbine and C4 which can do lots of damage to vehicles and infantry.
Support - Support kits feature heavy machine guns which work best for defending positions. Support kits can also provide resupply packs which help out your teammates and earn you points.
Medic - The Medic has a decent weapon, but the primary focus is on healing and reviving teammates. Because of the number of points this can earn you, and the relative ease-of-use of the Medic's primary weapon, this is a great starter-class.
Sniper - The Sniper kit is designed for long range engagements with a powerful anti-infantry rifle. Sniper's can also lay Claymore mines to protect defensive locations or sniping nests. Snipers will usually die in close-quarters combat, so move often.
Engineer - Engineers have a shotgun for close-combat, but have no means of engaging enemies at range. Instead, they can repair vehicles and lay anti-vehicle mines.
Anti-Tank - Anti-Tank soldiers are equipped with a shoulder-mounted anti-tank rocket. This powerful rocket can disable most vehicles, but you'll want to hit them from behind to do the most damage.
Assault - Assault soldiers don't have any specific skill that they can use in battle, but they are equipped with the best rifles and armor, making them perfect for direct engagements with other infantry and for taking Capture Points.

, Battlefield 2 is a very team-focused game, and the team that plays well together will come out on top nearly every time. Working with a team will be much more effective than going out on your own, as you'll be able to rely on other players for support, healing, and revives.


Join a squad from the Spawn menu. This will allow you to spawn directly on your squad leader, and you will be able to track each other's movements on the map much easier.
Use your microphone if you have one. You don't have to talk all the time, but having a microphone can make it easier to call out targets and acknowledge orders and information from your teammates.

, The maps in Battlefield 2 are huge. Staggeringly huge in some cases. While you won't be able to learn all the maps immediately, or even ever, you should work on remembering landmarks and important areas. Since games revolve around capturing specific points, it will be very helpful to know the general layout of each Capture Point.


Map knowledge comes with time. As you play, you'll subconsciously learn the maps and become more familiar with the flow of the game. Don't get discouraged at the beginning because you can't tell where you're getting shot from.
As you learn how the maps work, you can start using advanced tactics such as flanking to catch your enemy from the rear by surprise.

, You won't last long running out in the open. If you need to stop to plan your next move, make sure that you are well-hidden so that a sniper across the map can't take you out. Going prone (crawling) will make you move slower, but you will be a much smaller target and can often slip past enemy positions unseen.


When you are prone, your weapons are much more accurate.

, If you hold down the trigger of your automatic weapon, you will soon find your bullets hitting everything except your target. Accuracy is incredibly important in Battlefield 2, and firing in short, controlled bursts can help improve your accuracy tremendously.


Many automatic weapons let you change the fire mode to single shot, which will greatly improve your accuracy. You can toggle the fire mode by pressing the weapon selection number key (for example, to change the fire mode on your primary weapon, press 3 after you've selected it).

, Headshots with any weapon are much more devastating than body shots. Practice lining your shots up so that you hit your opponent's head. You are much more likely to drop them in one or two shots this way.


Press the right mouse button to aim down your sites and make your gun more accurate.

, Reload your weapon any time you are not actively in combat. You always want to have as many shots available as possible in case things go south and you need to unload your clip.


Avoid reloading in the middle of a fight. Instead, switch to your pistol and continue firing. It is much faster to switch to your pistol than it is to reload your weapon.

, Vehicles are one of the primary features of Battlefield, and are crucial to a successful match. Vehicles are complex machines and can take a while to get used to, making them intimidating for newcomers. This is especially true for aircraft.


Join an empty server if you want to practice flying aircraft or driving tanks. This will let you fly around the map without having to worry about killing your own teammates or wasting a vehicle.

, The main mode for Battlefield 2 is Conquest mode. In this mode, each team will attempt to capture and hold various points on the map. Each team is given a limited number of reinforcements, and if a team controls more than half of the points the opposing reinforcements drain quicker.


You can capture points by standing within the capture radius of the flag. As long as there are more of your teammates nearby than there are enemies, you will capture the flag.

convoys and populated areas are good targets as you can get 5+ kills in one bombing run.
If you are in a server where you can attack the enemy's uncap then this will bring in lots of kills although this is very unfair for the opposition and they will probably want to kick you.

, enemy jets are a big threat to you.

, the worst thing about flying jets is trying to get into them. there is usually a mob of noobs that exist for the sole purpose of jumping in front of you forcing a tk, not to mention all the enemy vehicles/snipers that see a person waiting for a jet as an easy kill.

Teamwork.",How to Play As Defenders in Squad Rush," It is important to choose weapons that will sabotage the attackers. Rapid-fire guns, heavy machine guns and explosives are great choices for this situation. Perks are also key for helping your squad members. Make sure each player on your team uses different SQUAD SPECIALIZATIONS to strengthen your entire team. If any of your team members don't have any SQUAD SPECIALIZATIONS, that's okay as well.;
, Unlike attackers in ""SQUAD RUSH"", defender's do not have to worry about the amount of tickets they have. They don't have any at all! Choose classes that will easily sabotage incoming attackers, such as the ""SUPPORT"" class. They provide ammunition for your team and great suppressive fire on the attackers. But don't forget about the other classes. They each serve their purposes as well, so use them depending on how the game is going.

, As a defender, it is important to know areas in your map where attackers can come from to arm the M-COM. Study the maps of BATTLEFIELD 3 and pay attention to the HUD once in a while to recall where you are and locate enemies. Remember, attackers can come from any direction, so keep your eyes peeled.

, If the M-COM is within a building or an enclosed area, don't let the attackers blow it up. It's harder for the defenders to predict where attackers will be coming from instead of having only one entrance to the M-COM. If the attackers has armed the M-COM, clear them out and guard whoever is defusing. It's also possible to shoot and throw grenades while defusing and arming an M-COM, so keep this in mind as well.

, Do a reconnaissance of the attackers and find out their strategy and common routes they use for getting to the M-COM. Using this information and changing your own strategy based off this information can give your squad the upper-hand.

Many players choose to play assault but have no interest in healing their squad; there are other classes for this.
Unless there is more than one assault on your team you should always have medical bags and the defibrillator. In other words, be a hero!;
, There will be buildings exploding, road ways being destroyed, and entire towns being leveled.


Look out for your teammates that may have gotten trapped and killed in the debris, or teammates that are taking fire and need medical back up and an extra gun.

, This actually applies to all classes, but people do not take is seriously. If you are with a squad of 4 others, stick with your squad; you guys can help each other and get an even higher score.

, While you may be busy healing your teammates, be sure to spot enemies while you are playing doctor. Spotting an enemy might not seem like much, but in actuality, you are not only marking them so your team can see and kill them, but you also get spot kill points!

, This is the most important thing to remember. Something as simple as communication can save the game.


If you are not playing with friends, stay in the game chat and communicate what you are doing, where you are, and where enemies are that you tried to spot and when they go away.
If you follow these simple tips, you will find yourself getting progressively better with the assault class, and before you know it, you will be putting the whole entire team on your back to win

Variety: You have 4 people in your squad.,
Support: Having one support in your squad can really boost your assault or defense.,
Squad Types: Having a certain squad type can be really important in order to have a successful victory.,
Remember to communicate with all your squad members.

",How to Make a Great Squad in Battlefield: Bad Company," Use them wisely and make a great variety with each class.;
, You can talk to the support guy and tell him you need health or repairs. You don't need go to someone outside of your squad(which is very frustrating). If you go in a vehicle with some squad members and you see a tank shooting at you, tell the support to get out and repair while your vehicle is taking damage. It will give you a lot of points and is very essential to keeping you and your vehicle alive.

,


One support: Which is what I explained in step 2.
Sabotage: This is mainly for attackers. This squad contains all specialists with C4's. This is the most successful squad type for attackers in my opinion. All specialists rush in and plant C4 on the gold crates and then destroy all gold crates in a matter of seconds. While some squad members plant the C4's, someone has to protect them if someone comes in the room or gold site.
Sharpshooter-Planter Combo: This contains a recon sniper to get in a position where they can see the gold crate and around it, and another squad member to plant the bomb. While it is armed, the sniper can snipe anyone who tries to defuse it.
Cheat: This squad has to have someone hide or camouflage behind there base while other squad members spawn on the person behind the base. The person hiding behind the base should probably be a sniper if the map is on Oasis, End of the Line, or Harvest Day.
Demolitionists: All squad members go demo with shotguns and defend/assault the base. If you are defending the crates, hide in an area where you can get a good shot on them as they come in to plant a bomb. If you attack, get in an area where you can keep on shooting the crates with rockets. Look out for snipers and don't go out in the open as a demo because demos don't have long range. Try to run along alleys and walls of buildings.

Silenced weapons and explosives are great choices for this situation. Perks are also key for helping your squad members. Make sure each player on your team uses different SQUAD SPECIALIZATIONS to strengthen your entire team. If any of your team members don't have any SQUAD SPECIALIZATIONS, that's okay as well.;
, Attackers in ""SQUAD RUSH"" have a set amount of tickets that total the amount of lives your team can spare until the game is over. If you are an ""ASSAULT"" soldier, you can revive your team-mates and re-gain tickets for your team while receiving XP points for yourself. This is why the ""ASSAULT"" class is the most popular class used by players in ""SQUAD RUSH"". However, it is not wise to have all your team-members be ""ASSAULT"" soldiers. But don't forget about the other classes. They each serve their purposes as well, so use them depending on how the game is going.

, As an attacker, it is important to know areas in your map where defenders can camp, and to locate routes for getting to the M-COM. Study the maps of BATTLEFIELD 3 and pay attention to the HUD once in a while to recall where you are and locate enemies. Remember, the defenders can be anywhere, so keep your eyes peeled.

, If the M-COM is within a building or an enclosed area, blow it up. It's harder for the defenders to predict where you'll be coming from instead of having only one entrance. A common strategy used by defenders is to surround the M-COM area with explosives so the attackers can't arm it. So again, blow it up. If your team has armed the M-COM, and the defenders are starting to spawn, don't just wait for them to come, find their spawn point and take them out. It's better to lower their changes of defusing the M-COM than having them come to you, risking your victory.

, Big mistakes defenders make in ""SQUAD RUSH"" is to camp in the same area over and over again, or to camp near the M-COM. Make sure the area is clear prior to arming an M-COM by taking-out any defenders around you. It is also possible to shoot while arming and defusing an M-COM, so keep this in mind as well.

, One of the highest advantages for attackers in ""SQUAD RUSH"" is the ability to spawn on your team-mates. If you just died and are ready to go back on the battlefield, it's key to choose the best spawn point.

, Do a reconnaissance of the defenders and find out their style of playing. Using this information and changing your tactics based off the enemy's strategy can give your squad the upper-hand.

, Take some physics into consideration as well... it might sound funny since it is a video game, but it still applies! Especially get to be familiar with the art of dogfight, since dogfights play a key role to victory in the game if you do not manage to take out your enemy by surprise.

, You should be concentrating on your targets and threats while in the air. Flying into the side of a mountain at 800 mph (1,300 km/h) while typing isn't something to brag about.

, Fly more often on servers running air maps. Have dogfights with friends for fun and practice. If you get the chance to be on the same side as a better pilot, spectate his ways of flight.

""Warning for Next Gen Newbies"".",How to Get Better at Battlefield 4," If you like to run and gun, then pick the assault class. If you want to use vehicles all the time, then you're certainly going to want to be an engineer. Like to cause utter mayhem? Then the support class is for you, but maybe you like staying in the back, fighting from the distance, then the recon class is for you! It's important to pick a class and familiarize yourself with it, otherwise your skill will never grow.;
, This game mode is much more casual and fast-paced than any of the other game modes, so you can really hone your firing skill here and take them to the other game modes.

, Some people have a lot of trouble with Battlefield, or shooters in general, because it seems like you're turning too slow, and can't react fast enough. This is less prevalent on PC though. So press start, options, or the menu button depending on which console you're on, and select options. From there you should see the option for sensitivity adjustment. Play around with it a bit and find which setting suits you the best.

, Yes, Battlefield can be a very infuriating game at times, but the more you play the better you will get, so don't get discouraged just because you had a few bad games, you'll get better.

, Aiming around corners allows you to see the enemy before you round a corner. Otherwise you would barrel through the turn, only to crash into an enemy soldier who is ready for the confrontation.

, Running In Battlefield 4 allows you to get from point A to point B much faster, but every upside comes with a downside. This downside is not aiming fast enough. When you are running, you may see an enemy. In the time that it takes for you to stop running, aim, and fire, the walking enemy would only have to aim, and fire. This half a second that it takes for you to stop running might mean the difference between life and death.

, In Battlefield 4, aiming at an enemy that is already in your crosshairs automatically sets your sights on the enemy. Some servers have this option disabled, but all DICE servers will have this enabled.

, Normally, this would waste bullets when using an AR, or a weapon that limits you to how accurate you can be, but since Light Machine Guns have a surplus of ammo ready for use, and a .25 second longer aim time, it is much more beneficial to start firing long before you aim.

, Sometimes, an enemy might be too close for you to aim at him in a gunfight. Since aiming causes your gun to move back and forth slower, hip firing is ideal for a close-encounter situation.

, In shooters, it is a bad gamer habit to reload after every encounter. This is good when you have too little ammo to kill anyone with, but if you only shot off 2-6 bullets, it is not really necessary to reload. Only reload if you have less than 15 bullets in a 30 round clip, and so forth.

, Instead, switch to your secondary, or pull out some of your gadgets to help you out in an encounter. In retaliation, if you see an enemy reloading during an encounter, this would be a good time to pop out your side arm and pump him full of bullets.

, Like all modern shooters, headshots cause twice the damage. Although you might have a difficult time setting your sights on this small target, it usually only takes 2-3 shots to drop someone if you get consecutive headshots.

, Guns like the G18 have an extremely high recoil. This could be useful in the hands of a skilled player. The recoil kicks your gun up, and if you have it aimed directly in the center of the chest, could prove deadly.

, Habit would have you turn your character's entire body if you need to look at something in your line of sight, but using your eyes allows you to take in double the information from your surroundings.

, Sometimes, it is better to leave a gun without a muzzle attachment, or use the iron sights, rather than using a handle that lowers your accuracy or stability.

, Use any attachments you can to bring these two traits up as high as possible.

, With attachments that bring up those two traits, this gun is the most stable assault rifle in the game, with virtually 0 recoil.

, Hardcore leaves you with only a couple of seconds response time if you are shot at. With no health regen, and almost no health, a high rate of fire weapon like the FAMAS, F2000, or MTAR-21 (DLC) will drain your opponents health the quickest.

, Picking up the assault class, equipping defibs, and setting your Squad Upgrade to the Medic (via Loadout Screen), can easily pump your points up exponentially, and you will almost always see yourself in the top 5 of the leaderboards if you make reviving everyone a priority. This also saves tickets. As a bonus, teammates might take up your example, and start reviving alongside you, saving your team massive amounts of tickets.

, Sometimes, an enemy might downright slaughter you in the cheapest way possible, or it might be tempting to rush a corridor full of enemies, chasing down that tempting kill, but this will no doubt get you killed. Slowing down means checking your corners, seeing what paths you can take that would offer the least resistance, taking a couple of seconds in the respawn menu to survey what spawn would be safest and most beneficial to your gameplay. And you might say to yourself ""I slow down, yet I still find myself dying,"" but remember: You would have died 5 times more if you hadn't peeked that corner, or carefully chosen your route.

, Habit would have you spam the X or A button everytime you reach that dreaded respawn screen, but this can easily kill you. Take your time to check the spawn camera, see if your squad spawn point is in imminent danger. And if in doubt, do not hesitate to spawn in on a control point. It might take you a lot longer to reach your objective, but this can easily increase your K/D.

, Don't be one of those guys that spam the A or X button in the final countdown to try and get into that tasty tank or chopper. Chances are, a much more experienced pilot/driver, and about a dozen engineers are waiting on the enemy team for their chance to shoot you down. Don't hesitate to walk from point to point, capping objectives on foot. This can save you from being prioritized on the enemies kill list.

, Don't be one of those guys rushing to get into the chopper, only to be shot down, or crash into a building. You will definitely cause unnecessary deaths on your team, while allowing the enemy team to take over the tank routes and skies.

, The first few shots usually do the most damage and are the most accurate so make it a habit to spam the Fire button when aimed on an enemy, regardless of what gun you are using. That's why many players invest in hairpin triggers, or seem to kill you in twice as fast as you do any of them: Burst firing increases the damage you inflict, and the rate at which you inflict it.

, Usually people move when firing the shotguns, and this only helps to dampen the damage, and reduce accuracy. Standing still allows the shotgun to work at full power.

, Kill the distracted and unaware enemy, or his buddy that has already got his sights on you?

, It would not be wise to try and fly a chopper for the first time in the middle of a 64 player frenzy, on Golmud Railway. You will be killed, many times, or you might crash the chopper for not knowing how to pilot it. Go to the test range, get in one of the choppers, and learn how to fly it there. Tweak your control scheme there. You also get an unlimited amount of time to practice. Doing it in the middle of the match might only give you a few minutes, tops.

, Be aware that the people you are competing against have probably been playing years longer than you have. Do not be fooled by low rank, as this means nothing on next gen consoles. There are hundreds of players who have devoted hundreds more hours into this game than you, and you will be killed, ""a lot"". If you ever catch yourself wondering why the last gen players are much more casual than next gen players: This is because the players PAY to play online. This payment system filters out a lot of casual, younger players you might see on last gen. The casual gamers will most likely stay on last gen, opting for free gameplay rather than paying for the online subscription they might not use, due to work or school. And lets face it, the kids parents probably won't be too happy to cough up the money required for a monthly PSN or XBOX Live subscription, when they could be doing it for free.

Place emphasis on conducting the task repeatedly to standard if you are weak at a specific task. This process develops your “muscle memory” to the point where focused conscience thought is not required. The action becomes a reflex or habit.;
, If you want to learn how to use a vehicle, in particular, helicopters and jets, you should practice off-line. Both types of aircraft can be difficult to master. Don’t degrade other peoples’ on-line gaming experience, handicap your team by using a piece of valuable equipment, or lower your own global stats by practicing on a 64/64 ranked server. Instead, start a ""local"" server, and join the game. The game won't start because there is only 1 player, but you can use all the equipment you want without fear of another player (in multi-player) or a bot (in single-player) getting to it first. Another option is to find empty servers, or servers where the game hasn't started due to insufficient players.

, You can learn a lot by watching other players. Take note of successful actions and put it into your kit bag.

, Know where you should and should not go when moving across the map or assaulting a position. This is invaluable information to preserve your soldier’s life and to terminate the lives of enemy soldiers.

, When you are prone, you accomplish two very important things. First, you are a smaller, more difficult target to hit. Second, your weapon has greater stability and therefore is more accurate (a tighter shot group). You will survive longer and get more kills by going prone. You can also go prone when going down a steep hill, and you will slide down the hill instead of falling and getting injured.

, Never under-estimate the benefits of crawling in the prone. Sure, it takes longer, but it can keep you from getting killed. The enemy can’t kill you if he is not able to detect your presence.

, Using crouch can provide concealment behind some vegetation and cover behind some walls. Crouch will also improve your accuracy versus firing standing (off-hand).

, Use cover and concealment to mask your movement and position. Don't just stop in the middle of a street and start firing. You won’t last long. Take into consideration the enemy commander’s scan and overhead satellite viewing ability. When the enemy commander scans, he may or may not have the time to check-out your position. If he does check out your position, the concealment of a tree may place doubt as to your exact location. Another consideration is artillery. Concrete buildings and corrugated steel hangers and shelters will provide cover (protection) from artillery.

, When you double-tap your move “forward"" key (default is W), or hit the ""sprint"" key (default is SHIFT) you will move at a much faster pace. On the lower left corner of your screen, you will see a sprint meter that indicates your endurance level to maintain a sprint. Different units have different levels of endurance. Kits with body armor are Assault and Anti-armor and have less endurance compared with Special Ops and Medics. Use your sprint power wisely. Identify your route and next position before you depart your current covered and concealed position. Once identified, sprint across open areas to your next covered and concealed position. Ensure you wait for your sprint meter to replenish fully, then sprint again. This way, you will be set-up for success in case you have to sprint farther than you thought, or have to sprint back to cover.

, Ensure you are always looking around. Be familiar with your surroundings. Identify your next target or prevent being the next KIA (Killed In Action).

, Are you almost out of ammo or health? Switch Kits. Stand close to a kit and press the pick up equipment key (Default X). This works for friend and foe kits. And you can switch back, if you like your original kit better. Did the medic player next to you just go down? Grab his kit and revive him.

, If you select again a weapon you have already selected, you can toggle between single-shot or full automatic mode (usually key “3”). The firing mode indicator is in the bottom right corner near your ammo meter. The selector mode indicator will display single, burst, or auto depending on the weapon type. Most players leave their weapons in full auto mode. However, there is an accuracy penalty when in full auto. In single shot mode, you are more accurate with each shot. At very close range, it won't make much difference. At more than 10 yrs, consider going to the prone, using single shot mode, using your sights, and going for the head.

, Even if you prefer being in full auto all the time, use short, controlled bursts rather than just holding down the fire key. You'll be more accurate and it will give you time to re-orient your crosshairs or iron sights. If you hold down the fire key, the weapon will climb higher and higher as you continue to fire. Vehicle and stationary machine guns have an overheat meter. Scanning, burst your fire, and reorienting will prevent overheating. If your enemy is prone, shoot a yard in front of him so the rise of your weapon will get him right in the head.

, When you right-click, you look through the gun sights or scope, which makes you more accurate, especially at longer range. Caution – using your sights also degrades your speed of movement.

, Even if you aren't a sniper, fire at someone's head rather than at their body. Some players are wearing body armor, depending on the unit class of the enemy. The body armor will take several rounds to penetrate.

, Shoot only if you have a chance of actually taking down your target. Don't just fire at distant enemy personnel because you can see them. If you do fire and miss, now they can see you. Wait until they are within a range of actually getting a kill before you fire.

, If your enemy has good cover, or you can't tell exactly where he is, toss a grenade his way to flush him out or soften him up for a rush attack.

, Don't wait for the automatic reload if you are running low on ammo. Get to a stopping point with some cover, and reload so that you won't get stuck in the middle of a firefight with no bullets (rounds).

, If you find yourself out of ammo in your main weapon, and your enemy is still not down, it is faster to pull out your pistol and use it than to wait on reloading.

, If you are at very close range, try switching to knife. It will take out your enemy quicker than firing at them. One hit and he is dead.

, You’re wasting ammo and, more importantly, you are giving away your position. Your bullets won’t penetrate an armored vehicle’s armor. Spot the vehicle for others with more capable weapon systems to engage and destroy. Use your grenades as a last resort.

, Let your teammates know where the enemy is by spotting them. Go to your commo rose feature (default Q key). Look and select the center option. If the Heads Up Display (HUD) (top right corner) is presenting ""?"" question marks on your enemy spottings, you are not putting the cross hairs on the target when spotting. Sometimes the enemy is behind a building or moving really fast and you will not be able to get a good spot. Put the cross hairs close to the target, right click the spot option on the commo rose, a drop down menu will appear with enemy types like tank, sniper, and helicopter, and select the desired type of enemy. Using the right click feature will communicate your sighting to all of your teammates.

, Sometimes players get so focused they forget to look around and see what else is around. Slow down and be deliberate in your movement. See who can get you before they can score an easy kill.

, Different situations require different kits. For example, if you are in a street-fight map and your team has access to very little armor, therefore, you aren’t going to get much use out of an engineer. By the same token, if there is lots of enemy armor, your going to be invaluable with the anti-tank kit. Be flexible and willing to change your duty position to address the situation.

, There are multiple ways to communicate with your teammates. The integrated methods are: text messaging, voice (VoIP), commo roses, orders from your squad leader on your HUD, and identifying enemy on your HUD from UAV and individual player ""spots"".

, Surprisingly, there are a lot of people who do not have a microphone and still choose to use text messaging. So watch your screen. Your teammates or Squad Leader may be talking to you!

, You and your teammates will have a better gaming experience by using VoIP. Talking in a concise professional manner is much faster than typing and it can be a lot of fun sharing chatter of just having launched an enemy soldier 15 feet (4.6 m) into the air by the effective use of a sabot round from your tank's main gun.

, There is the ever-present blue, green, or red tag hovering over a soldier or vehicle that just won’t go away. It tells you if he is a good guy or a bad guy. Blue is good and on your team, green is good and in your squad, red is bad and begs to be exterminated. Put the red tagged devils out of their misery promptly. Use your cross hairs to interrogate the target and the tag should show up. The tag also tells you the screen name, both friend and foe. It is also important to watch for the uniform color. The Chinese/MEC uniforms are dark, while the US uniforms are light.

,
Now, this is where i tell you how to evade enemy pilots, and engage them back:

,
When your lock on light starts to blink, immediately gain altitude and switch to the rear view, as soon as his missile are Fox-Two, deploy your flares and take evasive action.,
Now, engaging AIR targets.,Engaging ground targets next, fly high (around 150), use your bombing mode to find targets, give yourself a long run to your target, fire your MG into him up until the point when you need to drop bombs, if you need to (bombing accuracy comes with time)

,
When the time comes for you to bail, try to aim your jet where you intend to land, the explosion will take out any enemy down there, jump out and chute down.,
Landing and taking off: Taking off is easy, everybody can do it, but to do it fast, just use afterburners until you lift off..Landing, reduce speed (different jets have different times), level off and land

",How to Fly Jets Effectively in Battlefield 2," This means you can easily look behind you, know when your being followed and engaged, and switch back to cockpit view to evade the enemy and avoid going face first into the dust. If you have a gaming keyboard, you should have extra keys for this, if not, use keys that are not used in the game, but are still readily available.;
, Bear in mind, that if you take a few hits and have to bail out, your going to be facing the ground troops, so you will need a weapon that packs a punch, i suggest either medic or assault, that way you have medic packs or a nice rifle to help you escape

, Depending on the map, team and role you want to be playing (more on this in the tips section)

, With this you can also co-ordinate the ground pounders with your efforts, and if you have to ditch, have some backup when you para down

,,, Everybody has their own evasive maneuvers, basically you twist, turn dive and climb very quickly. Use the afterburners to make your loops, dives and turns faster and tighter..If you have the skill, fly very dangerous paths, going under bridges, between trees, flying close to the ground, this makes his missiles less likely to kill you because there are more obstacles in their way, and the enemy pilot may make a mistake and fly into a wall or something.

, Use your bombing mode, get in close, this way there is less distance the missiles must travel, then when your ready switch to missiles, his lock on tone will sound, spot him with your common rose, when you have lock wait for him to deploy flares, and engage, 2 missiles at a time, if he evades you, follow, he will be on your map so you can find him

,, With practice, you can aim a damaged jet into a tank or the like

Holding the line and extraction.",How to Become an Effective Sniper in Battlefield 2,", The most effective rifles for sniping are closed bolt action rifles, such as the .50cal M95 Barret unlock (this gun can penetrate armored glass, which no other rifle can do).


The damage effectiveness for each sniper rifle varies per weapon. The strongest weapon is the M95 sniper rifle. A single body shot from this gun will reduce the enemy's health to 5%. The M24 and L96A1's body shots will only reduce an enemy to 10% health.







, The target range for the Barret m95 is 200 meters (656.2 ft), after that you must use the drop scope, and offset your crosshair ahead of your target. However, the price for the rifles power is accuracy, the U.S. sniper rifle(the M24) and the sniper unlock for the expansion, Special Forces, are extremely accurate. and have much thinner crosshairs than the M95, making longer shots easier to line up.

, If anti-snipers are after you, claymores will provide a kill, early warning, and more opportunity.

,, Never send more than three shots at a single target. Rotate fire. Take some time between shots to make it harder for them to pinpoint your position. When going for moving targets, shoot in front of them.

, tank gunner positions,fixed AA,AT,machine gun posts.These are also very easy because the enemy is fixed in place. An enemy killed whilst inside a vehicle cannot be revived either, so it's a guaranteed kill.

, If you do not have a good position on your enemy it can cost you your life and can cost your team points and possibly a loss.When moving to a position try to be as inconspicuous as possible. The best positions are usually going to be out in the open where the enemy will not expect you. Most of the time though you can only take one or two shots from out in the open before you are found. Another good position is on the corner a building this will give you cover from enemy fire. Here are the pros and cons of some other positions:


Roof tops while being good for viewing the battle can be detrimental to your ability to snipe. If you must go on a rooftop do not stay long and make sure that if you know you are going to stay for a few shots make sure you stay behind something on the roof and place a CLAYMORE on the top of the ladder so that an enemy soldier that come up the ladder has a nice welcoming present and this will give you time to exit this location. Roof tops are generally safer further away from active areas. Try to choose one where you still have a good view but is away from the main combat areas.






Cranes are extremely effective places to snipe from, as they are high up, and some people falsely believe they are bad, so people don't always look there. They have some cons, as they take time to climb. Claymore the ladders, and check them often. If spotted, jump(don't forget to use your parachute)!






Hill positions can be very effective especially for long range sniping.try to use trees,bushes,rocks and other items in the terrain to mask your position.






Sniping from vehicles can be done from most transport vehicles where your personal weapon is your defense. Most enemies will not expect a sniper in the back of a Hummer, so if you are in a squad and everyone exits stay in the rear and use it.






Short-range sniping shots are best when standing or kneeling in the game because you will need to quickly take the shot and then move because the enemy will probably hear you and then see your position.







,

Make sure you take the enemy down with only one bullet. The best way to ensure this is to aim for your enemies forehead or scalp, if you shoot your enemy in either spot you will get a one shot one kill.






If you cannot get a head shot on your enemy, shoot at whatever part of your enemy is exposed usually one shot from a sniper rifle on the body of most units in the game will cause 3/4 damaged to be assessed to your enemy thus making your second shot very simple and a body shot will assure his demise.






Make sure you can quickly switch to your pistol and use the claymores to defend your position, grenades can be used to allow you to escape a fire fight.







,

Over 100 meters (328.1 ft) the game tries to calculate for bullet drop. The game does not do an effective job of doing so but you will need to adjust for a slight bit of drop due to enemy movement.






Go into the prone position when setting up for a long range shot. Spend a second or two to settle in.






Make sure that you watch your enemy for a few seconds to determine his movement patterns. Remember not to take too long, or your target just might disappear behind an obstacle.






Look for the enemies that are lying down or just standing around. Try to avoid moving targets, they are usually more difficult and you may expose your position. However, don't avoid every moving target, otherwise you will never gain valuable experience. In fact, every time you make a successful shot on a moving target, try a little bit harder to find moving targets, eventually you will be good enough to take almost anyone down, moving or not.






Position the reticle for the long range shot on your enemies head right at the scalp. It will seem like you are adjusting for drop but it is really just because the enemy is so much farther away.







, jumping around running in circles or zig zagging. These are pointless shots and will waste ammo and expose your position.

, Sniping takes a lot of RDR (rounds down range). Practicing against bots may be kind of boring and easy but try to turn it into a fun game rather than just sniping them. Bots are good targets and they move erratically and are dependable when you begin sniping.

, Know that your pistol,claymore and grenades are your only CQB weapons.

Pistol: Aim for the head with your pistol otherwise a decent enemy will finish you off very quickly.






Claymores: Place them in areas that are highly-trafficked by the enemy and use them to protect your rooftop positions.






Grenades:Throw grenades to get your enemy to back off of your position or give you enough time to get back to your friendlies.







,, It's an under appreciated weapon. Target their torso, and strafe as you fire.

,, If you hear footsteps, and can't see an ally on the HUD then get up and pull out your knife or your pistol.

, so if you get a kill and there is no enemies or little enemies then change your position.

, Get a kill and then switch position.

, when they get into a copter or a jet then shoot them as there engine is warming up.

,,, If they are running aim an eighth in front of them.

, Essentially, a sniper is useless against enemy armor. So when a tank decides to run you over for laughs, you can't really do much except make the most of your grenades and claymores. This of course, encourages him to shoot you instead. The spotter steps in to assist the sniper in tight fixes. Or at least provide warning when something dangerous is nearby.


Special forces: They are possibly the best spotters for infiltration. Cover his back against enemy infantry while he plants the all-important C4 charge. If he knows what he's doing, the enemy can be pinned down for over 5 minutes while you pick off infantry and he sabotages vehicles, artillery, etc.






Assault: Not preferred due to the lack of more effective explosives. Still, they are quite good decoys. Just don't stick to them since they just aren't meant for being willingly trapped behind enemy lines.






Support: This is also not preferred. Support units will keep you well stocked on ammo, but they won't be able to do much else. And unlike Assault kits, they have a harder time against medium and heavy vehicles.






Medic: This is ok, but don't stick to him. He'll provide cover in close quarters and patch you up when you get too injured. Just be sure you take a lot of infantry out, as he can't revive you when someone's guarding your corpse.






Sniper: NO. This just increases the number of targets to hit. A good sniper knows that the more spread out they are, the more area their scopes can cover. So two snipers in the same place is useless.






Engineer: They usually have big close quarter guns. And they can sabotage vehicles by putting mines right next to their treads. And when you decide to finally escape, get in a vehicle with him. You're more survivable that way.






Anti-Tank: The second best spotter. Not as efficient in sabotage, but they can save you when confronted with armor. Three cheers for SRAW and ERYX!





;
, The best way to infiltrate an enemy outpost is by flying in a plane and paradropping before you're shot down. The downside is that this wastes the time it takes to spawn 1 plane. And air support is crucial in the overall scheme. Also, if the pilot decides not to jump out, you're stuck without a spotter, making the entire operation useless. Another way is by using a fast, light vehicle like a buggy and sidestepping the entire combat zone. Ditch the vehicle 300 meters (984.3 ft) from the chosen position. It makes it harder to pinpoint where the sniper team is. A black hawk transport also a good way to get behind, but watch yourself. Fighter pilots see a flying black hawk as a sitting duck.

, Just choose one. Read the guidelines above.

, Are you just going to kill a few troops and get out? Paralyze enemy movement? Pin down enemy armor? Maybe take down artillery batteries and UAV trailers? Choose one that suits your spotter.

, This requires the support of your commander. As long as you're holding the line, you'll need a supply drop to keep stocked on ammo, and so will your spotter. God willing, the commander won't drop the crate in plain sight and mark you for dead. Do not stick too close to your spotter throughout the operation, as they aren't wearing camo outfits, and you might get hit by collateral damage. Never go to the crate at the same time. This takes time, but should some creep come up to where he thinks you are and you're both facing away, kiss the op goodbye. When it's time to leave, play to your spotter's strengths. Is he a good pilot? Get a plane. Does he maneuver well? Try a tank. Does he need you to kill anti-tanks while he speeds away? Get in the back of a hummer. Do you have a light vehicle you used to sidestep the map when you got in? Use it then.

Practice - just keep practicing.

",How to Be a Good Assault Soldier for Battlefield 2142," The Krylov is a more powerful version of the Voss and it has a better reputation. The SCAR is known as the BS gun. It is the default cousin to the Baur. Many people believe it can't kill, but it is quite powerful if you know how to use it (Semi-automatic).;
, The heavy assault has the Baur, the Herzog shotgun, Airburst rockets, and the Netbat helmet. The medics have the advanced medical hub, smoke grenades, the defibrillator, and the Voss (although everyone's first unlock should be the fragmentation grenades or the defibrillator).

When the glowing white arrows appear, press the required keys W/S/A/D (I have only played on PC, but the rule goes for all gaming systems) depending on where the arrow is pointing.;
, (Note: The Tyrannosaurus' rage bar at the top right of your screen) it will increase the more you shoot at the Tyrannosaurus. The Tyrannosaurs battles by advancing on you, chomping, and slashing with his tail. He's slow, so he's easy to avoid.

, If you have time, move to stand in front of a spiked bar. Once the screen turns blurry, use the Adrenaline Dodge (going either left or right) while locked on the Tyrannosaur. The moment it strikes red, shoot at him. The Tyrannosaur will fumble, and ram into the spiked bar (if Lara is standing in front of one) causing extreme damage to the Tyrannosaur. You can also defeat the Tyrannosaur without the use of the spiked bars in case you can't get to one in time; however, it takes longer time to defeat the Tyrannosaur.

Starting Out Try not to play as a recon class online if you are starting out; instead, play as an assault to get enough unlocks for your recon class.,

Use an APM effectively The first unlock in the recon class should be the APM.,
Practice and keep practicing Repetition is the mother of skill.

,
Controversy over Zeller-H Advanced Sniper Rifle This sniper rifle is really cool looking and have a really high damage on paper.",How to Be a Master Bf2142 Sniper," First things to get are (in this order) grenades and defibrillator.;
, This is the sharpshooter ladder for the recon class. Keep playing as other classes until you get the DysTeK Hi-Scope X4. Now that you have a zoom scope, medium ranged targets should be easy. The next unlock is obviously the Gruber 5 Stabilizer, as this will freeze your scope from bobbing for 3 seconds or so. Warning: Do not unlock the Zeller-H Advanced Sniper Rifle, as this rifle is no more effective as a sniper rifle than your basic rifle. See Step 8.

, Rule of thumb: aim for the head. Since every sniper rifle has a long recover time, make every bullet count with a single fatal shot to the head. Repeat this line: One shot, one kill. For now, do not attempt at a moving target. Get your basics down then try for a moving target. The same principle of ""one shot, one kill"" should apply here as well. Follow your target until it stops or shoot 1/8"" in the direction its going. Twice that if the target is sprinting. If you are determined to fire at a moving target, fire promptly before it goes behind cover. As rule, never spend more than 10 seconds on scope and check your surroundings before scope in again.

, However, a good sniper does not need it to be undetected, at least not by another soldier. (UAVs are a different story) Since a clip on the standard rifle has 5 rounds, this is a good indicator to move once you exhaust your clip. Do not stay in one spot because even APMs can't stop a good player once he/she knows where you are. If you exhaust your clip and fail to kill an enemy, do not try to reload and shoot again. You will be better off finding another vantage point and try again. Even if you don't find the target again, at least you will score a kill assist if you did damage. Staying alive is definitely the best bet as a sniper.

, Since you are playing a recon class, intelligence is your best friend. The more you play, the more vantage (and possible enemy nests) points you will discover. Stay as sedimentary as possible because movement will expose your position easier than if you were still. This is where PAC has a slight edge since the uniform is completely black where the EU uniform is white/orange. The muzzle flash is still going to be a problem, but that's why you should move after a clip. As you move, stay out of open, high traffic areas to avoid detection from stalkers collecting your dog tag. Use cover often especially when fired upon; don't freeze and shoot back in the open. *If you have the IT-33 Active Camo, go to a cover and camouflage your way to another cover before shooting back. *On Titan mode: Once your titan shield is down, follow your maindeck to the outskirts of the titan where you will find a nice prone position that you can snipe from if the commander is smart enough to place the titan close enough. Do this when the titan guns are occupied to score some points and an infiltrator pin.

, Since you should be on the move a lot, APMs are best used offensively rather than protecting your temporary position. Place APMs on the flanks of high traffic areas near silos and flags. Do not place them where a soldier can see it head on, but hide it on the side. APMs are directional so place them outward as close to a wall as possible. An APM can be easily avoided by crouching or proning past them, but that would require prior knowledge of where it is. So, keep APMs hidden!

,, How does it perform on the field? This rifle has 9 clips/3 rounds each (compared to 6 clips/5 rounds originally), but you can instantly kill a light armored soldier with 1 hit to anywhere. The problem is that you will rarely find a light armored soldier on the field, and it still takes 2 shots to the body of a heavy armored soldier. Since the regular rifle will let you get a headshot as well, there is no advantage to having 2 fewer rounds on the Zeller-H. The Zeller's slightly faster recovery rate is not as useful since you have fewer rounds. In most cases, save the unlock for something else, such as the RDX demopack. One thing to note that the Zeller can disable motion mines and other explosives while the the regular sniper won't. This is again ineffective since there is an engineer class that will do this quicker and often there is multiple mines present. *If you have the Northern Strike Booster pack, this unlock might be worthwhile since you can proceed to the next unlock, which is the Recon decoy. The Recon decoy casts a false signal to the enemy's mini-map as long you are with 60 feet (18.3 m) of the device. This can create a trap and/or save you from an ambush, which can be extremely useful if used effectively. It's fun to see enemies circling around your decoy confused while you take them out. (One thing to try is to place a decoy at your feet and take your shots. Once you have exhausted your clip, move to another vantage point where you can view the area around your decoy. Snipe the unsuspecting stalkers who wants your dog tag.)

Follow the monkey, there is a monkey in front of you but don't shoot him, follow him, and he will lead you to an opening of a river, but it came from the lagoon and its safe to swim, go onto the log, and you may jut through it, or you can go underwater, and swim through the hole.,
Get out of the water, pull the ledge of a walkway, and then, pull the 2 levers, side-to-side, and then each gate will open.,
Go to the high wall, and then make a jump and reach the ledge of another, and then, after pulling up the ledge, and you see a wall, take a left, and then pull the lever, and it will open a gate under the largest pillar.,
Get out of the water but this is difficult..., there is a tiger near you, and once you pull out of the passage, the tiger will try to bite you and put you back in the passage, and you may move slow in the water, so draw your guns, and shoot him until he's dead, after he's dead, go through the two corner tunnels with 2 flares each.,
Get the Indra Key before the monkey, once you got off the ladder, there is in the indra key in front of you, and pick it up before the monkey does, and the monkey will try to run to it and to pick it up.,Head toward the switch, and press CTRL at the switch and open the item inventory, and select the Indra key, and Lara will put it in, and opens the gate, now wade through the quicksand to the level exit.,Watch the cutscene and enjoy!",How to Beat the Jungle Level on Tomb Raider III,",, Do this simple tweaking process: Click ""Start"", and go to Control Panel. And then click ""Add or Remove Programs"", and click ""Add Programs"", and then ""CD or Floppy"", and then type this in instead of D:\SETUP.EXE, put in ""D:\TOMB3.EXE"", and it will bypass the installation, and then don't change any of the settings, and click ""OK"", once the Tomb Raider III box appears.,,, It is harmless and will not kill you. However, you can shoot it but its not recommended, because if you shoot once at the monkey. He will be not harmless anymore and tries to kill you. If you don't know where the secret is, jump back onto the mudslide, but not front, but downflip (ALT+Down cursor key), Just jump there, and then you are off the slide for a bit., They may not work if you are farther away from the flares. And then, head to the medipak, and the earth will rumble. Do not leave the spot once you picked up the medipak until the boulder is behind where the spot you are standing at. And then go back and slide back on the mudslide.,, Yes, CTRL key first once you are back jumping toward the ledge., And Sorry If I forgot about Secret #2, and head back where you got down from the mudslide., And then, another monkey picks up the medipak, DO NOT KILL HIM, instead, follow him into a passage, and then he will drop the medipak, and then came back the way he came. And then pull the lever, and a passage door will open., And then, pick up a small medipak, just press ""CTRL"" when in water. And then, go through the water passage, its right in the spot where the current made you. And then swim, you won't drown, but don't stay there or you WILL drown. And then after that, just climb up the ledge, once your out of the water from the water passage, and then go to your left., This is the tricky part. There is a spiked wall right in the left, but don't move until you pull the lever, head to the lever and pull it down, and then the encroaching spike wall will get you. After pulling the lever, immediately roll (Up and Down cursor key at the same time), and then, head to the passage, and press CTRL and GET UP QUICKLY! You may lose or may not lose some blood. And after the encroaching spike wall comes to an end, get down, and head to the top passage. And get up on the ledge., And then once you release the key once not over the water anymore. Climb up onto the branch, and then take a running jump to the other passage., And then, a tiger will be approaching you from the rock trying to bite you. Jump on the rock if you want to shoot the tiger safely. To avoid tiger bites, you can do a left-flip (ALT+left cursor key), and press CTRL after pressing the left flip, and shoot the tiger, you may lose some health in process, and do the rest for it, ALT+Right cursor key for right flip, after taking care of the tiger, run towards to the trees, and then look for some monkeys..., So go to the tunnel, and pull the lever, and the boulder will approach you, DO NOT STAY or a highly chance of being rolled on and getting killed, so do 2 left flips (You remember, ALT+Left cursor key), and then, the boulder will end at the steps, go to the shelf, just onto your left, once you reach a wall, and pick up a pack of flares. And a monkey will drop a small medipak once you got the flares before him, and pick up the small medipak. And retrace your steps, but don't turn right after going through the tunnel, instead, go straight, and once you reach the boulder spot, take a left., And then, after you got outside. A tiger will approach you and try to bite you. But you can shoot from the inside, since the tiger won't try to enter there. And shoot him till' he's dead. And then, head to the T-intersection, but before you are a few feet away, another tiger charges you. So draw your guns once you hear his footsteps, and then down flip, and try to shoot the tiger, and if the down flips doesn't help you. Left flip or right flip, and try to shoot him as possible, Lara will automatically lock on an enemy. So don't worry about pressing on a ""LOCK-ON"" key, there is no lock-on key, and lock-on is automatic. After the other tiger is dead, go ahead, and take a right, taking a left goes to a DEAD-END., If you press the look button and see a pair of spikes, don't go down there, instead, go to the fallen tree branch, and there is a friendly monkey that shows you the way, and remember DO NOT SHOOT THE MONKEY!, instead, just follow him, and after he U-turns, turn right, and you will be by the fallen tree branch., And once he charges close enough, side flip! Either left-flip or right flip, even though I recommend left-flipping, before the tiger either comes to push you. And shoot continuously until he's dead, and run toward to the tunnel, and go through it., Instead, take a running jump once you reach the edge, and you will go over a shape. And then, another friendly monkey will take you to the left grated passage. Go into the left grated, and another pair of spikes will come on., And you may even die before you get out, and must take a ledge medipak. It's your choice... And then, take a right, and there is a little gap, jump and then hold on to the ledge, and pull up. And pick up a small medipak.,, And enter the tunnel, You may shoot it if he's trying to annoy you. But just ignore it, and instead, after pulling the lever, the boulder won't drop until you re-enter the sloped tunnel. So get secret #5, sorry to miss Secret #4, but Secret #5 is two harpoons, and a rocket launcher (a weapon, not like you see at Kennedy Space Center). And then, drop down, and then once you re-enter the sloped tunnel, press ""/"", to dash, and the boulder will start rolling towards, you, before that, make another flare, and then DASH!, But prepare to draw your guns again, and safe drop (CTRL+Down arrow), and then after going safety drop, shoot the tiger and kill him, then enter the gate, and then look for the shelf in a tree, and pick up a pack of Flares., Go up to the boulder trap, and you will trigger the third and last boulder trap. And its in the middle, so sideflip if you are in the middle before it crushes you. And after all the boulders go down, go inside the boulder trap, and you will find a hole, but safety drop, since there are another pair of spikes, and after you carefully safety drop. Walk, and jump onto the ledge, and pull up. And then crawl towards Secret #6, another pair of harpoons. And then, get out, and try to get out of the hole as you can. And then walk out of the boulder trap., It's a shortcut so its recommended., And then go underwater, and go through another gate, and then pull up in the middle, and then get a pack of flares. And now, jump to where a gate with no torches, and pull another lever. And it will flood the pillars. And then head towards the gate with the torches, and then go into the passage, and come out to the pool with the pillars. And then, go into a passage that is with a waterfall. Just after all the pillars, and climb onto the ladder, and then, go to the right, with the water pouring., And then, you may jump into the water from this spot. Because you won't die, and then go through the newly passage with the new gate you opened., And then pick up some stuff. And then, climb up the ladder., And if you feel like shooting, go ahead, and then, Head to the stone stairs, and then there's a tiger, so, safety drop, draw your guns, and shoot at the final enemy till he's dead.,,"

Protocol is the language computers use to communicate, in our case, Red Alert 2 uses to communicate with other Red Alert 2s.",How to Play Red Alert 2 over the Internet3,"

Red Alert 2 uses the IPX protocol. Which is currently outdated, what this means is that there is little if not no support for it. Furthermore, Windows Vista does not support the IPX protocol.
This problem can be solved by using a patch to change Red Alert 2's IPX protocol into a UDP protocol. UDP is currently widely supported. And should present itself as the de facto way to play Red Alert 2 on the LAN.

Armed with your complete ability to shoot portals and new-found understand of the physics behind them, finish the game.",How to Understand the Physics of Portal," From this, you should be able to grasp the following basic rules of portals:


There can only be one blue and one orange portal active at any given time.
If you have both portals active, and you then shoot another one (a blue one, perhaps), it will replace the blue one that previously existed. The orange one will remain unaffected until you shoot another orange one.;
, When you begin the game, you will be in the relaxation vault. After listening to GLaDOS (the computer voice that talks to you throughout the game) talk for a minute or so, an orange portal will open in the wall of the room you are in. If you look through the glass wall to your right, you'll see a blue portal.

, You will be able to see a female character in an orange jumpsuit. That's your character, Chell. Yes, you can see yourself through portals that face each other or you. The developers placed the first portals like this on purpose, to help you understand that portals do not take you into alternate dimensions. They simply allow you to move between flat surfaces, such as two walls.

, You will come out through the blue portal that you saw earlier. If you walked through the blue portal again, you would find yourself in the relaxation vault with the orange portal again.

, The room you enter after walking through that first set of portals introduces you to weighted storage cubes which become increasingly more important throughout the game, and test chamber 01 helps you become more comfortable with the idea of walking through portals.

, Once you have managed to do that, you will be able to shoot your own blue portals (the orange portal will still be placed for you) by left-clicking the mouse. With this new power comes an awareness of a couple more rules of portals:


It doesn't matter which portal you enter and which one you exit. If you haven't figured this out yet, you can go either way through either color.
You can't shoot a portal through another portal. For instance, if you are looking through the orange portal (into the area where you shot the blue portal), you can't shoot another blue portal through the orange portal. It simply can't happen.
You can only shoot portals on certain surfaces. As a general rule, you can shoot portals in the gray walls, ceilings, and floors that make up most of the earlier test chambers, but you can't shoot on the bronze-colored metal. If you are unsure if you can shoot a portal somewhere, look at the indicator in the middle of your screen. If it is only an outline, you can't shoot a portal where it is pointing. However, if it is filled in with color, you can shoot a portal.

, Here, you will be introduced to the way portals affect forward momentum, and a technique known as ""flinging"". There are two techniques for flinging, but only one will be used to get through this test chamber.


Look for the portal that is already placed. It will either be on a section of movable wall above you, or on the ground in front of you (possibly below you, requiring jumping or falling to reach it).
Once you determine the location of the orange portal, place a blue portal in the other location.
Jump through the portal on the floor. This may be as simple as shooting one right below or in front of you and walking through it, or you may have to jump off a ledge and aim to fall through the one below you. If the blue one is the one you're jumping to, you may find it easier to shoot the blue portal below you as you're falling.
If you have done this correctly, you should find that you have landed a level above where you previously were.

, You are now fully in control of both portals.

, Here, you become familiar with two new concepts: three-portal flinging, and a new rule of portals that you may not have realized. You will see a lot of those particle fields like the ones that have been in front of all of the elevators so far. Be aware that if you shoot a portal somewhere and then walk or fling through the particle field, the portals on the other side will disappear. As for flinging...


Set up the way you would for two-portal flinging: One portal above you, the other below you. For explanation purposes, we'll say you shot the orange one above you and plan to jump through the blue one.
Jump through the blue one. You will realize as you are falling back down that you did not reach the other side of the gap you are trying to bridge because you haven't achieved enough momentum yet. The only way to remedy this is to jump through another blue portal.
As you are falling, shoot another blue portal in midair to fall through (or, if possible, fall through the one you fell through the first time). Assuming you don't hit the sides of the blue portal on the way in (or miss it all together), this time, you should reach your destination.

, Rumor has it that there will be cake. Good luck!

, They must be back on the station before they are permitted to throw again. (Even then they must be told to do so by the plant leader.)

, Zombies appear on a map in a pattern. If you’re having trouble clearing a stage, observe how zombies appear on a map. Knowing the pattern means you’ll be able to deploy the right plants on the right spots and at the perfect time.

, It’s necessary to complete every mission to beat the game. Some players tend to exit the map once they get its rewards—Do NOT do this. Battle through the entire game time of the map and acquire the stars as much as you can.

, Sunflower plants give off sunlight, which you need to buy other plants. Plant as many Sunflower as the map allows to quickly raise your sunlight and buy heavy-hitter plants like Repeaters.


On the other hand, don’t plant too much Sunflower that there’s no more room for other plants.

, If your sunlight is limited, buy plants that do the most damage.


Snapdragons can cover three lanes when they attack and costs only 150 suns.

, Jalapenos and Cherry Bombs do major damage and can take down several zombies at once—but only when used at the right moment. Time it perfectly, and deploy these angry plants on congested spots to clear out massive hordes instantly.

, Plant food will give your plants special powers.


Potato Mines will instantly deploy and Coconut Cannons will reload immediately once you put plant food on them. When these plants are about to be eaten by zombies, place plant food on them to save them and have them fight back right away.

, Power-Ups are a new addition to the Plant vs. Zombies game play that will let you wipe out massive numbers of zombies in an instant. These are perfect for getting through tight spots. Take advantage of these items whenever you get your hands on it, but only use it when absolutely needed.


Power-Ups, however, aren’t cheap and can only be bought using coins.

, You should already know by now that zombies don’t just walk, they fly too. When zombies carried by balloons or birds show up, plants that can only attack horizontally will just be sitting ducks. To avoid getting caught unexpectedly by these zombies, place plants that can attack both air and ground units.


Cabbage and Kernel Pult plants work best in fending off zombies flying above head.

All characters have different Fatalities and move lists. You can access move lists and Fatality information about the character you are currently using by pressing “Start” on the Xbox One, pressing “Options” on the PlayStation 4 or by pressing “Esc” on the PC.


Navigate to the “Move List” option and press A for Xbox One, X for PS4, or Enter/right mouse click on PC.
Go to the “Finishing Moves” listing to the far right by using your joystick, D-pad, or arrow keys.
Pick out a finishing move on this page, and memorize the combo listed for the finishing move you have picked or write it down for later reference. You will need to repeat this combo with your controller, keyboard, or gamepad after you have defeated your enemy to use a Fatality. Think of it like an old-school cheat code combination.;

You can go through the menu again to find any other combos to initiate on your opponent at any time during a fight too, but they cannot be Fatalities if your opponent is still alive.

, Once your opponent’s health has been brought down to zero and their health bar is displayed as empty, they will stand there in a dazed state. At this point, you can initiate your Fatality. Refer to the combo you wrote down earlier and input this combo with your controller, keyboard, or gamepad.Sometimes completing a Fatality combo can be quite difficult due to the wide combination of buttons that must be pressed in quick succession. You can practice initiating a Fatality every time you beat an opponent, but it will take a good few hours of play before a new player will feel confident enough to successfully complete a Fatality each time.

, Alternative to entering a Fatality combo, which can be long and difficult to remember, you can purchase Easy Fatalities from the Xbox Games Store, the PlayStation Store, or from the Steam store. You can also earn Easy Fatalities by playing through the single-player modes in Mortal Kombat.


Easy Fatalities are much easier to initiate, but they still do require a user to input a set combo. You can find Easy Fatalities in the Finishing Moves section in the Move List option under the pause menu, alongside the other Fatalities found earlier.

, Fatality Training is one of the available training modes that allows you to practice the inputs required to perform the fatality. You can use this mode to continuously practice without having to fight through whole matches.

, Now we start the game flow of the Mario Party series. The famous first dice roll! This dice roll will determine the turn order of all 4 players.


When the numbers are the dice get going, just simply press the ""A"" button to hit the dice to see what number you got. If your lucky you will get to go first.
After determining the turn order everyone will get 10 coins to start off (I will explain the use of coins later) and the location of the star will be revealed on the map.

, Before going any further you will need to know about these four main items in the game. By mastering these concepts you will get you will step closer to dominating this game.


Stars are the main goal of the Mario Party Series. The player that has the most stars after the game ends wins the game! (After the game end players will be awarded bonus stars for completing certain unknown goals that could tip the scales).
Coins are the currency of the Mario Party Series. You use coins to buy items, hexes, and most importantly stars.
Items are bought in the various shops around the game board. These items have various awesome abilities that can help gain the advantage over your opponents!
Hexes can also be bought from shops but you can get hexes for free by passing certain areas of the game board.

, Once your turn arrives (or you were lucky enough to get first turn) you can hit the dice block and the number that appears will determine the amount of spaces you get to move. The flow of Mario Party works like this.


Roll Dice to move forward the number you landed.
Wait for everyone's turn to end.
At the end of everyone's turn a mini game will be selected for everyone to play. The best part is that the winner gets 10 coins as the prize for winning.
These basic steps are repeated until the game amount is reached and the player with the most stars in the end will be the winner! (Depending on your setting from earlier the game might last from either 10-25 turns.

, After the turn, depending on the spaces, a Mini game may be picked to play. Each one has its different set of rules so practice them by pressing the ""X"" Button. You will get 10 coins for winning the Mini game which will give you the money to purchase a star next turn! Also many people do not realize this but the space color the player lands on determines the mini game that will be played. It works like this:


If all the players landed on a Blue Space then the mini game will be a free for all 4 player Mini game.
If one person landed on a Red Space and the others landed on Blue Spaces then the Mini game will be a 1vs3 Mini game.
If two people landed on a Red Space while the other two players landed on a Blue Space then the Mini game will be a 2 vs 2 Mini game.
Different Colored Spaced such as the Mystery Space will randomly change color at the end of the turn to determine the mini game played.

, If you won the mini game then you will be able to purchase the star. Depending on how far away you may be from the star you will need to determine how many spaces you will need to get to it. This could take this turn or possibly more! It really depends on the number you hit:


Blue Space: Land on this space to get 3 coins!
Red Space: Land on this space and you will lose 3 coins!
Green (Mystery) Space: Land on this space to trigger a mystery event! It will be a mystery until its triggered and it could be a good or bad event to be careful!
Duel Space: Land on this space to challenge another player to a duel! The winner gets a prize from the other player ranging from coins to a star!
Friend Space: If you land on this space then  you get to pick an opponent as a friend and you both get 5 coins!
Star Space: Depending on the game board, you will have to get to this space to get a star for 20 coins!
Bowser Space: Do NOT land on this space! Landing on it will summon Bowser who will cause trouble! He will take away something from you such as coins or stars; so do not land on this space unless you like pain!

, Even if you can't get to the star in time you can make sure your opponents will have a hard time. As stated earlier you can buy items and get hexes to create favorable advantages and create disaster for your foes in the following ways!


Buy items! Using this items will help you gain back some momentum. On this map the shop will be shown by the mole icon. Get to that icon to buy an item for an amount a coins.
Collect Hexes! Hexes can be used to cause misfortune to your foes. Just place a hex on a nearby space and it will show your character's likeness to show its your space now. These hexes can steal coins and more! Just give your opponents a bad time.
Use Mystery Spaces! Mystery spaces can be very fortunate or unfortunate landings. They can give coins or even take some away. It really depends on where you land but sometimes it can be a dead giveaway! On Wigger's Garden the best space to land on is the three flower Mystery Space. It can give you up to 30 coins if you pick the right one!

, When there are 5 turns remaining until the game ends then a special event begins; The Final 5 Frenzy! Bowser in all his glory will give the current place standings in the game to show what place every player is in. The person in last place will be summoned to Bowser himself who will pity the loser and grant them a bonus of some sort. If you are in last place this bonus can help turn the tide of the game! The bonuses are the following:


Get 20 coins!
Get 30 coins!
Get 1 star!
Get 10 coins from the other players.
Stars for 5 coins! (Depends on the map)
Get 100 stars!
Get 300 stars!
The last two will never happen, Bowser teases you with this but it will ultimately land on another choice.

, Even if you are in last place you can still make a comeback! Keep trying to get to the star space and if you can not them buy items and hexes. Try to keep a high amount of coins it will help. Use these last 5 turns to gain absolute momentum. There may also come an opportunity to play a Battle Mini game. Use these opportunities to make the comeback that you need to win!


In a Battle Mini game (each player pays a certain amount to add to the winning pot, each player placing will get a certain in the following order, winner gets most of the pot, second place winner gets a good amount while the 3rd and 4th place gets scraps (ouch)).
So if each player paid 6 coins the pot would be 24 coins would be rewarded in this manner.
1st gets 15 coins, 2nd gets 7 coins and 3rd and 4th gets only 1 coin

, After the game ends you will get the results and the winner will be declared. Wait! Here is where things get interesting!. Now players will be rewarded bonus stars! Bonus stars are stars rewarded to players for completing a hidden objective. If you complete this goal you will be rewarded 1 star! This can single handily  give someone unexpected the win or make you lose. This can be very annoying to some players which is why this part can actually be turned off when you are setting the settings of the game. These are the hidden objectives that can net you a free star!


Mini game Star: Rewarded to the player that has the most wins in all the Mini games during the game.
Green Star: Rewarded to the player that landed on the Mystery Space the most during the game.
Running Star: Rewarded to the player that traveled the most space distance during the game.

You will initially notice that the pacing of animations, especially superstars, has been increased. The sped up animation helps players experience a more realistic and fast paced matches just like what we watch on TV.
Superstars will now have random generated starting up animation when you make them run just to add up more realism to their movements.
Small actions such as fixing a wrestler’s hair or wristband has been added as well. These movements such as taunts might not be that impacting to an actual match but it surely adds depth to a wrestler’s looks. These small things, again, lessen the repetitiveness of a wrestler’s movements.;
, Since attacks are now faster, reversals are not as effective as before. This means that also on your end, you can get spammed with punches from your opponent so learn to dodge, guard, and apply reversal.


When a reversal is successful – the wrestler will execute a signature move of his own! This eliminates the chain reversals that was present on previous WWE 2K games.
When facing two opponents at once, you can execute special moves such as the Double Attitude Adjuster and the Double Chokeslam.

, Nothing is more than satisfying that bring forth finishers or smackdowns on your opponent. Finishers can be executed with different triggers depending on the wrestler you are controlling. Some needs to put their enemy first on the floor for them to execute a finisher, some needs to put their opponent to the ropes. So be sure to know how your player executes his finisher.


A new trigger for finishers is by throwing your opponent in the air and applying your finisher on him on his way down.
The 2 player mode is one of the most effective mode to practice yagersaur basketball prowess. Simply start a quick game and you are off to the old exhibition mode between you and a friend. An AI team opponent can also be arranged.
You might want to work on your outside shooting mostly since NBA 2K14 made it harder now for players to hit those nasty three pointers. Also, the AI of the opposing players are now tweaked to make it harder for you to drive and simply shoot that ball into the basket.

, You can use your surroundings to your advantage while fighting an opponent. Your match does is not limited inside the boundaries of the ring. You can use the ring post, tables, chairs, and other stuff that you can use as a weapon.


Be careful not be disqualified by using prohibited items in the ring. You can get away with it especially when the referee is not looking.
There are special moves that are incorporated with damages dealt with the environment such as the DDT on Apron and Boot-to-head on outside ring post.
In hardcore matches or TLC’s, make sure you equip yourself with ‘weapons” because these modes encourages using environmental weapons to beat your opponent.

, There’s a lot of modes available for you to explore in WWE 2k14. The developers see to it that all the bases are covered when it comes to wrestling modes.

I quit, Iron man, Submission, Last man standing, and Inferno match just have one on one option.
King of the ring, Gold rush, and Tag team has several variations including singles, one on one backstage brawl, iron man, TLC, extreme rules, and others.
Ladder match mode includes one on one, triple threat, fatal 4 way, and 6 man. Another variation of this mode is Money in the bank.
Steel cage and TLC mode includes one on one, fatal 4 way, 6 man, and triple threat. Table mode’s variations just like the Steel cage with just an addition of elimination tag.
Royal rumble of course offers the most number of wrestlers in one match. It can be a 10 man Royal rumble up to 40.
Title match can be any mode with the championship belt at stake!

, Each match has a set of rules. Fortunately, these rules can be adjusted to your preference. From winning conditions to ring designs – you can adjust these to your liking.

Look for the FBI Rancher.,
Lose your wanted level.,
Save the car in your garage at one of your safehouses.",How to Find an FBI Rancher in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City," To get your Rancher, you'll need to raise your wanted level quite high, which means you'll need to be able to cause widespread mayhem and death as quickly as possible. Basic hand guns and melee weapons won't cut it. Instead, you'll want rifles, machine guns, and, if possible, heavy weapons like rocket launchers and miniguns. Visit Ammu-Nation to buy most standard guns.


Don't forget to stock up on ammo, too!;
, Once you start racking up wanted stars, you'll start to be pursued and attacked with increasing violence by law enforcement forces. Body armor can help you survive long enough to make it to five wanted stars.


Full health is also a must-have.

, Start spreading destruction. Kill people, steal cars, and blow up the cars you don't steal. Killing police officers rather than random pedestrians will help raise your wanted level faster, but the police will fight back. As you raise your wanted level, law enforcement will pursue you more and more ruthlessly. Once you bump it up to five stars, the FBI will start to pursue. This is your chance to grab an FBI Rancher!

, The FBI Rancher is a black four-door SUV. If you're on the run, you'll encounter FBI Ranchers pursuing you as well as in road blocks as they attempt to block your path. When you encounter one, wait for the agents inside to exit the car, then quickly kill them. Be careful - the FBI Rancher comes with four agents inside, each armed with an MP5 machine gun, who can easily waste you if you're not quick. Once they're dead, take the Rancher. Try to make sure that there are no police officers around when you enter the vehicle, or they may be able to bust you as you try to leave the scene.

, There are several ways to do this. You can use a cheat (see Tips), drive to a Pay 'n Spray, switch cars, and drive your new car into the Pay 'n Spray, or collect police bribes.


You can't drive the Rancher directly into the Pay 'n Spray - it's too ""hot"" to repaint. Just leave it right outside the Pay 'n Spray, quickly steal a nearby car, then drive that car into the Pay 'n Spray. Note that when you get back into the FBI Rancher, you'll automatically get a one-star wanted level.

, Make sure you save the game itself as well. When you load the game later, you'll have the car stored in your garage damage-free.

Pick up your pups by using the space bar.,
Protect them.,
Keep them well fed.,
Cross in the right spot.,
Before you grab a pup, find a shallow spot in the river.,
Grab a pup and go across the shallow spot.,
Reach the end.",How to Survive to the Summer Den Site on WolfQuest," There should be an eagle nearby waiting to attack one of your pups, so chase it off when it comes near the ground to ensure it leaves. Make sure all of your pups are well fed, (you can tell by how red the paws are) if the paws are pink, feed them. Eat some carcasses and get the red bar high for extra food on the way.
, Slowly carry them away. After you get a short distance away from your den, either wait for your mate to bring all the pups to you or go and get them yourself. Although this can cause your mate to bring the pup you carried back to you. Continue this until a predator comes or your pups are hungry., These steps are continued for the rest of the journey to make sure your pups survive. This is what to do when a predator comes.

Bear: Chase after it at fast as you can. When you catch up to it, bite it. If your mate is near it will come and help you. Make sure to bite it three times and it will run off. If you don't, it will bother your for the rest of the way, making it dangerous to keep your pups safe and if you become weak you or your pups may die.
Coyote: If you see any signs of a coyote at all, follow the scent trail or chase after it and kill it. 
Eagles can kill your pups even when they're in your mouth. The only way to make sure an eagle leaves is when it reaches the ground to grab your pup, run towards it and bite it. It's impossible to kill an eagle, so it will just fly away.

, When your pups gets hungry, you can either feed them with the extra food you saved or hunt yourself. If your pups' bars get too low, your mate will run off to hunt. Do not join her or him, because if a predator comes when you are away, it will probably kill your pup even if you run as soon as you get the warning. Just let your mate come to feed them.

If however, you want to hunt yourself, it is dangerous to hunt elk, because this can take a long time. The best chance you have is to hunt a bunny or eat off of carcasses to feed your pups. If you ever find a carcass, feed your pups then come back to eat some more. This will help when there is no food nearby and your pups are hungry.

, Even if it looks like you won't have to cross a river on the map, you still will, no matter what. If you decide to get a den close to the U shape in the river, it is much easier, though., This can take a long time, but you will know when you don't have to swim, where the shallow spot is. Some can run across the water without finding a shallow spot, but that is a risk. The glitch could stop halfway through and your pup could drown. So instead of having that risk, you'll need to find the shallow spot, and fast. Sometimes your mate will bring the pup to you while you're in the water. If this happens, run to it as quick as you can and take it out before it dies. Feed it and continue., If it gets in the water, pick it up and run to the next side and feed it. Don't go to grab your other pups. Wait for your mate to bring them to you, because if you go to grab another pup he or she might bring the pup back to you., Continue feeding and defending the pups, eating extra meat and carrying pups until you reach the end. Bring your pups to an area in the clearing, waiting for your mate to join. When you finish, there will be a screen of you and your pack howling."

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, download the 64-bit client for best performance.
You will need to download and install the client even if you are setting up a TeamSpeak server.;

Finish the setup.",How to Use Teamspeak2," After setup is complete, launch TeamSpeak for the first time. Before you connect to a server, you will need to configure TeamSpeak to get the optimal quality from your headphones and speakers.

, If you haven't started TeamSpeak before, the Setup Wizard will begin when you start the program for the first time. If TeamSpeak has been used before, you can start the Setup Wizard by clicking Settings → Setup Wizard.

, This will be the name displayed to other users and the admins of the TeamSpeak server you connect to. Your nickname is not a username, and has no impact on user accounts or security. Your nickname is simply your display name. Enter the name and click Next > to continue.


You should make your nickname the same or similar to your in-game username. This will help your teammates recognize you and makes communication easier for everyone on the team.

, There are two different ways to activate your microphone so that you can talk: Voice Activation Detection (VAD) and Push-to-Talk (PTT). VAD automatically activates your microphone when it detects sound. PTT requires you to set a hotkey which will activate the microphone while it is being held down.


Most TeamSpeak servers prefer that people use PTT to prevent accidental broadcast of background noise. Using PTT will result in a better experience for both you and your teammates, though it requires remembering to push a button.

, When you select PTT, click on the ""No Hotkey Assigned"" field. The next key or button your press will become your PTT button. You can use any key on your keyboard or any button on your mouse. Make sure that the key doesn't conflict with a key you use during the game.

, If you select VAD, you will need to set the sensitivity of your microphone. This creates a threshold that volume will have to surpass before the microphone starts broadcasting. Click the Begin Test button to begin the calibration process. Move the slider as you talk to set the level that the microphone will activate.

, These keys will allow you to mute either your microphone or speakers on command. Microphone mute is especially useful if you are using VAD, as you can toggle your microphone off if your room is too loud.


Click each button and then press the desired key combination that you want to assign to the function. Click Next > when you are satisfied with your choices.

, TeamSpeak will say when users join or leave the channel, as well as notify you when you have been ""poked"". You can choose between a male or female voice for the notifications. You can hear the example for each notification by pressing the Play button.

, On this page, you have the option of adding a few features to your TeamSpeak program. The Overlay allows you to access the TeamSpeak interface on top of your current program, which can allow you to see who is speaking. This is particularly useful in large groups. Volume Control will automatically lower the volume of your game while a teammate is speaking, which can be useful for loud games or music players.


The Overlay requires a few extra resources, and may not be a viable option if you are already struggling to run the game.

, On the final page of the Setup Wizard, you will have the option to open the public server list, the bookmarks manager, and rent your own server. At this point, setup is complete and you're ready to connect to a TeamSpeak server. See the next section for connecting to your team's server, or the final section for running your own server.

You can usually find the TeamSpeak server information on your group's website or forum. Ask another member if you can't find it.

, TeamSpeak will attempt to connect to the server, and you will see the main window start to fill with information. You can check the status of the connection in the status frame at the bottom of the window.

, On the left side of the window, you will see a list of channels on the server. Channels can be password protected, and you may need to be granted access by an admin. A list of users will be displayed beneath each channel.


Most larger gaming groups will have the server broken into channels for different games that the group plays, along with an Senior-only section if the group is particularly large. Server setups will vary wildly from group to group.
Double-click on a channel to join it. You will only be able to talk with users in the same channel as you.

, Besides being able to voice chat, there is a basic text chat for each channel. This can be accessed by clicking on the tab at the bottom of the window. Avoid putting important, time-sensitive information or commands in the text chat, as many players will not see it in-game.

You can run the server software on your own machine or hosted server for up to 32 people, or you can run it on a dedicated hosted server for up to 512 people. If you need a server larger than this, you will need to rent one from TeamSpeak.


You can find the server software on the Downloads page of the TeamSpeak website. Make sure to download the correct version for the operating system you are installing the server on. The files will be downloaded as an archive.
You will need to accept the license agreement before you can proceed with the download.

, The file that you downloaded is an archive that contains multiple files. Extract the archive so that you can use the files contained within. Extract it somewhere that is easy to access, such as your desktop.

, Run the application in the extracted folder. You will see several files and folders get created, and then a window will appear with several important pieces of information. You will see your server admin username, password, and privilege key.


Copy each of these values to a blank Notepad document. You can click the button next to each one to copy to the clipboard.
At this point, the server is already running. You will need to connect to the server in order to configure it.

, Open up your TeamSpeak client. Open the Connect menu and enter localhost into the address bar. Change your nickname to whatever you'd like, and make sure the server password field is empty. Click the Connect button.

, When you first connect to your server, you will be prompted for the privilege key that you copied into Notepad. This will allow you to change the configuration of the server and grant permissions to other users. After entering the key, a server administrator icon will appear next to your name on the users list.

, Right-click on the server name at the top of the channel list. Select ""Edit Virtual Server"" from the menu that appears. A window will open, allowing you to customize your server. You have a variety of options to help make your server feel more like ""yours"".


In the Server Name field, enter in the name for your server. Usually this will be based off of your gaming group's name.
Set a password for your server in the Password field. This can help make sure that only people you permit can access your server. Use your forums or private messages to distribute the password to people whom you you want connecting.
In the Welcome Message field, you can write a short message that will be displayed to users every time they connect. Use it to link to your team's latest news post or important forum thread.

, Click the ▼ More button at the bottom of the ""Manage Virtual Server"" window to see a variety of deeper configuration options. These will allow you to fine tune how your server works. The most important is the Hosts tab.


In the Host tab, you can set a banner image for your server that all of your users will see. You can also create a Host button that will appear in the upper-right corner. Many servers use this button to direct users to the team's website.

, If your group has a variety of interests, you may want to create multiple channels to help keep people on topic for the game at hand. For example, if your group primarily plays two games, you can create a channel for each game, as well as a general ""lounge"" channel. When people are playing, they can move to the appropriate channel, and when they're relaxing between games, they can use the lounge and not bother people who are playing.


To create channels, right-click on the server name in the channel tree and click ""Create Channel"". You can set a channel name, a description, a password, as well as how permanent the channel is and where it should be sorted.
You can create sub-channels within channels, which can be especially useful for large groups.
The Permissions tab allows you to set what level permissions people need in order to perform various actions.

, While most clients should be able to connect to your server, opening a few ports can make sure the most people possible can connect without issue. Access your router settings, and open the following ports: UDP 9987 & TCP 30033. UDP 9987 helps allow incoming connections, while TCP 30033 allows for easier file transferring between users., You can give your teammates your server's IP address so that they can connect, but this IP address is liable to change sometime in the future. It's also not very easy to remember. You can use services such as DynDNS to assign a hostname to your IP address, which will automatically forward people even when your IP address changes."

Find a suitable base to destroy.,
Activate your strike force to your tarmacs.,
Scout and observe the base.,
Use your A10 airstrike to start.,
Use the Orbital Strike to destroy damaged defenses or just a regular defense.,
Use a Hellfire Missile to destroy and/or weaken the strongest of defenses.,
Leave behind at least 5 command points.,
Deploy your troops.,
Manage your command points as you go.,
Retreat only if you have to.,
Be aware of the time limit.,
Celebrate your victory!",How to Win at Empires and Allies1," You can do this by looking through people's bases who attacked you earlier on in your battle log, do the ""Quick Match"" method, or finding a player's base on the GRA map. The base should be at a level so that your commanded attacks (A10s, Hellfire Missiles and Orbital Strike) are able to destroy them.;
, Your strike force increases the damage and health of about 60% and this is very good for every base. Preferably activate it to your rangers, as they will burn defenses down more quickly and can speed up the process. Use the Strike Force before it runs out - you won't be able to use it on a tarmac for 1 hour after the first use of it is finished.

, Don't just dive into a base that looks like a walk in the park and hope for the best. Take the time to work out the areas of possible dangers and possible safety. Tap/Click on a defense or structure of the base, as this will give you information of it's health and level. If the base looks undefeatable, such as, your up-to-date Level 14 HQ base getting put up against a very strong Level 20 HQ base, then it is probably not worth losing some of your medals over. If the base looks easy enough to defeat and you may not lose a sufficient amount of troops, then feel free to turn it to rubble.

, Go in and destroy or weaken as many defenses as you can with the radius of the airstrike. Don't just use it to kill commandos at a rally flag, or oil derricks and supply stockpiles holding loads of loot. Use it carefully, especially for when it is more than capable of destroying something.

, You can use the Orbital Strike to take down what may not have got fully destroyed in the A10 airstrike and focus it on a rally flag of commandos that are at an inconvenient location.

, This has a smaller radius than the A10 and should only be used to destroy a single target rather than multiple. Also use it carefully and see if it can weaken or destroy other structures around it.

, When the base is destroyed at a level that you can attack it, leave behind enough command points that will get you enough for a Medpack. These are vital to prevent any sudden ambushes or damage to your troops as soon as they are deployed.

, A combination of rangers and Tomahawks are a good combination that is one of the best out there. Deploy your rangers first, and then deploy your Tomahawks at a safe distance so they are not ambushed, as Tomahawks are very weak.

, As you keep destroying the base, keep feeding command points to your troops as well as managing them carefully or saving up for another approach with an A10 or Hellfire or Orbital Strike.

, Use whatever command points you have to use on defenses or your troops to speed along the process. Be careful though, you will lose medals if you don't achieve any stars!

, Once you place a commanded attack or as soon as you deploy your troops, you have 3 minutes to destroy it completely. Don't be in any rush to get it done. Use the time wisely and the music to the attacking process can even keep you in time!

, If the base is giving away loot, the loot may be increased by 10% or 20% depending on how many stars you achieve. You will also receive medals depending on how much you were able to destroy. Rush back though to call back all your troops before the time of your strike force runs out on your tarmac!

Be a team player.,
Learn how to use tactical aids.,
Have fun!

",How to Win at World in Conflict," Know the strengths of each role, its weaknesses, and how to avoid units you cannot handle by yourself. If your teammates have repair units, ask for repairs, most players will comply as they are rewarded with TA (tactical aid) points for repairing your vehicles.;
,,, This will significantly increase your productivity during crucial moments. Hot keys are also very useful when you need to quickly make use of your secondary offensive/defensive tools, such as flares for air units.

,, This game really forces you to play as a part of a team. The game mechanics are designed for team play by enforcing interaction between different roles for a successful battle.

, Share your spare points from time to time when you don't need them. Ask for points if you are only a few off from a powerful tactical aid, such as the nuke or carpet bomb.

Scout and observe the base.,
Build a good army.,
Use your commanded attacks to start with.,
Watch the battle as it goes.,
Don't ever be afraid to retreat.,
Celebrate your win!",How to Win at Empires and Allies2," Some GRA bases are easier then you think, whilst others require you to really put the time in and crack at it. Because you do not earn or lose medals from attacking these bases, you can attack them as many times as you like.

, Unlike player bases, GRA bases can have a totally different formation that could be totally disorganized, such as having no Patriots or no Artillery. For example, if you see no Patriots around the base, then an attack with Apaches or Attack Drones could be wise.

, Once you work up the bravery to go in and attack the base, make a strategy as to how you are going to beat the base. Some things you should consider are:


Dropping different types of troops at different times.
Targeting defenses that can take out multiple targets at once, instead of one that can target one-target at a time.
Keep destroying defenses as you go and collect command points. Use Medpacks when your troops are at a critically low level of health.

, Don't just walk off to get a drink while you are in battle. The GRA can deploy any sort of troop onto the battlefield depending on where your troops are moving to and can engage instantly. Watch things as they go, while constantly looking after what your troops are doing.

, You won't lose any medals from retreating from a GRA attack, however, your loss will be displayed when other players around the world visit your base.

, If you win a battle, claim the territory proudly and continue these attacks for as long as it takes! You will be rewarded with some loot.

Build a firewall.,
Once the firewall is built, make words using the lesser value green and yellow tiles if they can be replaced by higher value sapphire or diamond ones.",How to Win at Bookworm and Play Forever," Those evil red 'fire' tiles are the death to this game; if any hit the bottom row it's game over. The key to stopping them is to build a ""firewall"". A firewall is three to four rows of colored tiles (green, yellow, sapphire and diamond) that slow down the burning red tiles and gives you time to make a word. As you start the game, make words that move the colored tiles to the bottom. Don't just choose any letter, pick useful ones like vowels and common consonants. Keep doing this until the bottom row is full of colored tiles. Continue until you have at least four rows of colored tiles. Keep this as your prime objective and don't get side tracked with making bonus words and words in the library-that can be done later. Longer words are better but your main goal is to first build a strong defense, even if it means using short words.;
, The key is to now play the game above the wall, using the colored tiles only when needed.

Establish a strong flow of resource.,

Attack on two fronts.,
Know what they can take on and what they can't, as once they're revealed they're minced meat against infantry.",How to Use Tau Efficiently in Dow," Tau are very expensive in terms of both power and requisition (an 8-man fire-warrior squad costs nearly 1000 req.!!!) A good starting point on a 4-player map is about 4 SPs captured by 3 stealth-teams, which should be built and dispatched immediately. keep these teams moving and capture as many points as you can before the enemy starts crusading around the map.;
, A good commander doesn't lose a man, avoids fighting and causes minimal destruction. I personal build a nice big, balanced force on the fringes of my base's nearest SPs, and send an expeditionary force of about 5-6 beefed-up Stealth-teams buzzing around the map and into the enemy base. some Devilfish transports are an excellent distraction to your main sneaky assault, as some players think they're getting swamped when all those burst cannon tracers start hammering their guys and they can't see what the hell is shooting at them.

, Capture the enemies source of economy and stop them from reinforcing their front lines. whether you're using the proposed stealth-tactic above or an augmented version of your own, it always pays to have the player breaking out in sweat when he sees the second, bigger force rock up behind his troops and start killing off his dreadnoughts.

, Don't forget to use their jet packs, and don't be afraid to venture into the middle of the map as all the other players are usually too scared to go there. but, NEVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR OPPONENT!!

Create a new game.,
Focus on your resources.,
Control your population.,
Prepare for winter.,
Gather logs and firewood.,
Build a Market and a Trading Post.,
Build roads and bridges.,
Build a Town Hall.,
Build a Boarding House.",How to Survive in Banished," At this point, the game is pretty straightforward. To create a fresh game to start your adventure, you must first decide on a town name, create a random map seed by clicking the paper icon to the right side of the bar, and then select through the rest of the options you deem suited to your gaming level.



Terrain Type. Choose between two terrain types, namely Valleys and Mountains.

Valleys are great for beginners as they have more flat land and forests which make for great building spaces and resources respectively.
Mountains have a lot of uneven ground which makes constructing buildings difficult. Also, getting through one side of a mountain to the other requires tunnels that demand a lot of resources.



Terrain Size. Choose the size of your map, from Small, Medium, and Large. Any will do, but most players prefer Medium.

Climate. Climate determines the level of climate change in your game. Mild has shorter winters; Harsh has longer, earlier cold days; and Fair is somewhere in between. Choosing Harsh may mean starvation as farming becomes impossible. Fair is a good choice for starting gamers.

Disasters. This activates the possibility of disasters in your village, such as tornadoes sweeping across town and fire spreading to nearby buildings.

There will be starvation, or possible death even, when food is scarce.
Freezing occurs when there isn't enough firewood or coal to heat homes.
If you have crop fields, pasture, and orchards, infestation is a possibility. During a breakout, you can also infect nearby fields growing the same crops or raising the same animals.
Citizens in poor health are in higher danger of sickness, and Traders and Nomads increase the risk of diseases.
This option is preferably left ON for challenges.



Starting Conditions. This option determines the conditions and resources you hold at the start of your game.

“Easy” begins with six families with a large amount of clothing, food, firewood, building materials, and tools provided. Homes and storage areas have already been built, and seeds for fields and orchards are available as well as herds of livestock.
“Medium” begins with five families with clothing, food, firewood, tools, and construction materials provided. A Storage Barn has also already been built, and you’re given some seeds for fields and orchards.
“Hard” begins with four families with only a small amount of clothing, food, firewood, and tools. No seeds for farming are available either.
For new players, it's best to choose Medium to give you a feel of the game, and experience the importance of resources and food.

;
, As you start the game, especially on medium or hard mode, keep a watchful eye on your resources. Low on food means your people will starve and die, decreasing the population of your town and leading to days of struggle. Fewer workers means gathering food and building homes slow down. To avoid this situation, establish a source of food such as the Fishing Dock, Gatherer’s Hut, Hunting Cabin, Crop Field, Orchard, and Pasture.



Logs. Produced by cutting down trees, logs are use for buildings, tools, and firewood. Foresters help maintain the forest trees, and cut adult ones.

Stone. One of the most important construction materials, it’s produced by harvesting stone piles around the map or by building a quarry.

Iron. Used for the construction and making of tools, it is found around the map and can be harvested, or you can build a mine for constant supply.

Firewood. Used to heat homes during cold or winter months, chop logs into firewood with a Woodcutter.

Coal. Gained through mining or by trade, a Blacksmith can make steel tools out of it. It can also be an alternate heat source to firewood.

Leather. Gained from operating a Hunting Cabin or by slaughtering cattle in pasture, use it to make clothes to help your people work and stay outside longer during winter.

Wool. Gained from pasturing sheep, use it to make clothing.

Food. It is produced by Gatherers, Fishermen, Hunters, Crop Fields, Pastures, and Orchards.

Herbs. Collected by an Herbalist, they are your people's source of medicine to keep them healthy when their diet is poor.

Tools. Made by a Blacksmith, they’re needed by all workers to perform their jobs more quickly.

Clothing. Crafted by a Tailor, it is particularly important to keep citizens warm in winter.

Alcohol. Produced by a Tavern, drinking ale can make your citizens happier.

, At the age of 10, citizens can start working. Just like in real life, people grow old and die because of sickness, disasters, accidents, or just old age. To keep your town going, steadily increase your population while keeping in mind that a sudden population boom may lead to food shortage.


To grow your town, you need to build homes for your citizens to move in and start their families.
Citizens become adults at the age of 10, and can start a family.

, Now that you know the function of resources, start playing and plan ahead for survival. Surviving the winters and keeping your citizens from starving will be among the greatest challenges. During the cold months when you can't farm crops, gathering food is a good alternative, but remember to build your Gatherer’s Hut in the forest where edible plants grow.


Gatherer’s Hut can be found under the Food Production tab and requires 30 logs and 12 stones to build. The maximum number of citizens working as Gatherers is 4, and it’s best to keep the number as high as possible since Gatherers, despite the bad climate, will keep on gathering food.
If you're playing in hard mode, Gatherers are the best food source in any season, so build as many Gatherer’s Huts as you can, but keep them at a distance from each other. For maximum productivity, don’t let the range circles overlap. Don't forget to build a Storage Barn nearby for the use of Gatherers.
If you click on a Gatherer’s Hut, details will show. You can see the Food Limit number, and once the limit is reached, no more food will be produced. Keep the food limit as high as possible, for as much food as the Storage Barn can hold.
Gatherers produce food such as berries, mushrooms, onions, and roots.
If you're playing in fair or mild climate, you can build a Fishing Port or a Farm to have fish and crops as your alternative food sources.
You can build a Hunting Cabin as well for hunting deer for meat and leather. However, cutting down trees will decrease the wild-animal population so make sure to have Foresters plant saplings. As wild animals avoid areas of civilization, build Hunting Cabins away from towns.
Pasturing is advisable as well, but animals such as chicken, sheep, and cows can only be gained from trade unless you're playing on normal or easy mode.

, A Forester Lodge defines an area where Foresters plant and later chop down mature trees for logs. A Forester Lodge should be built right next to a Gatherer’s Hut since Foresters maintain the growth of the forest. This means more root crops and forest food will be gathered.


For areas with few trees and not maintained by Foresters, trees will naturally grow. This process, however, takes more time than when forests are maintained by Foresters.
To build a Forester Lodge, you need 32 logs and 12 stones. The maximum Forester per Forester Lodge is 4. If you click on the building, details will appear.
Clicking on the “Cut” button will disable or enable the cutting of mature trees. When trees are cut, Foresters will place the logs on top of the nearest stockpile.
Clicking on the “Plant” button will disable or enable the planting of saplings. Details will also show the Log Limit, and once the limit is reached, no more logs will be produced.
To survive the winter, your citizens need firewood to keep from freezing to death. To make firewood, you need logs, and firewood is produced by a Woodcutter.
Found under the Resource Production, a Woodcutter requires 24 logs and 8 stones, and with 1 worker maximum. Once they produce firewood, Wood Cutters will store the firewood on top of the nearest stockpile.

, If you have steady resources, food production, and population, make sure to build a Market and a Trading Post.


A Market is used as a centralized location for all goods a town produces. Your assigned vendors will visit stockpiles and Storage Barns to collect a variety of resources for the Market.
Build the Market at the center of your town or that part of town where you build most of your houses.
Citizens living nearby can then just collect goods at the Market rather than go to stockpiles or storage barns.
Since all resources are inside the Market, citizens can enjoy a large variety of food and supplies to keep them happy and healthy.
A Trading Post is used to buy items that the town needs. It is where you can exchange resources for livestock, crop seeds, orchard seeds, meat, wool, and more.
Since Merchants arrive by boat, Trading Posts are built by a lake. Note that lakes without access to the main river that flows through the town won't ever receive merchants.
Merchants normally bring random goods to the Trading Post, but if you want them to bring a specific item, you can order it using the “Orders” tab.
Make sure you have enough resources stored in your Trading Post to meet the equivalent trade amount of the item you want to purchase.

, Roads make travel easier and productivity higher. Bridges across rivers, streams, and lakes give your citizens access to neighboring flat lands. The more access there is to the other side of the water, the more resources can be gathered.

, Build the Town Hall as soon as soon as you can as this can mean more record data overviews of the population, education, health, workers, happiness, clothing, resource limits, workplaces, acquired seeds, livestock, and many others.


If you need more people in your town, the Town Hall allows you to invite or deny citizenship to Nomads who wish to join your town.
Be warned that accepting Nomads will increase the risk of diseases. To avoid this, build a Hospital.

, If you're planning to invite Nomads, make sure you build temporary housing for these homeless citizens until you're able to build houses for them. Especially useful after a disaster, a Boarding House can prevent people from freezing to death waiting for their new home to be built or repaired.


Boarding Houses require 100 logs and 45 stones each to build, and by clicking the ""Boarding House"" button, you will see all the occupants and inventory.

Craft tools necessary for rendering the quarry unconscious.,
Feed the unconscious dinosaur its intended food required for taming.,
Saddle the tame once the process finishes.",How to Tame in ARK: Survival Evolved1," In order to initiate the taming process, one must render the intended animal asleep. Although many weapons are available to accomplish this, the grind of early game only presents two practical options: the bow and tranq arrows or the wooden club.


The bow and tranq arrows are ideal for ranged knock-out, and almost mandatory for taming larger starter dinos such as the trike and stego. To attain tranq arrows, see this page.
The wooden club is a melee weapon dealing more torpor damage than attack damage. Using this on smaller starter dinos, such as the dilo or the dodo, saves many resources and achieves the intended effect.;
, Dinosaurs are categorized into two basic categories: carnivores and herbivores (although certain animals require other types of consumables).


To keep the taming quarry asleep, one may need to feed the animal narcoberries or narcotics.
A taming bar, effectiveness, and unconscious meter are present on a dashboard near the unconscious tame. The taming bar becomes completely green upon a successful tame.

, Most dinos and animals require a saddle to ride, yet some do not. Although some are more expensive than others, a saddle provides armor for the tame.

The only exception to this line of sight rule is the Ichthy.

, Passive tames do not require the owner to render the animal or dino unconscious. Once again the tame requires a certain food, depending on whether it is a herbivore or a carnivore. Wait until the option reappears, for the food bar of the tame requires a drop before the animal can consume again. In other words, the tame needs to become ""hungry"" again., Once again, some will not require a saddle to ride the dino or animal."

Blue stop signs, kid.,
Encounter Papyrus.,
Choose one of four options, act, item, spare, or fight.,
Stay completely still during the attack.,
Congratulations!",How to Survive a Blue Attack in Undertale (Pacifist or Neutral Route)," The basics follow:


While the soul is red, it is in normal mode and behaves normally. It can move in any direction at a constant speed and can slow down by holding x or shift.
When blue, the soul is in jump mode and affected by gravity. It's resting position is in the center of the horizontal axis at the bottom of the screen. Use the left and right arrows to move in their corresponding directions and the up arrow to jump. The down arrow does nothing.
Whilst green, your soul can not move. It is positioned in the center of the fighting box. There is a circle around the soul in which a spear moves (up, down, left, and right) depending on which arrow key you press. You must move this spear to shield yourself from attacks.
While purple, your soul is trapped on three lines that it can move horizontally across and switch between.
Lastly, When you are in soul mode yellow your soul is upside down. It can also shoot things similar to Flowey's ""friendliness pellets"", little bullets with a deadly sting. They are used in soul mode yellow to shoot and destroy the attacks coming at you.;
, Listen to Sans when he tells you that Papyrus is not dangerous and a clue on how to survive the blue attack. Check Sans whenever you see him. He will most likely say a stupid/awesome joke depending on your opinion. However, he sometimes actually has some useful advice.


Be warned, San's information is a bit misleading. He basically says that you will be totally okay if you don't move during the attack, and to imagine a blue stop sign. However, what he doesn't mention is that the blue attack changes your soul mode to blue.

, This is basically when he tries to capture you.

, Doing an action or an attempt to spare Papyrus leads him to use his blue attack on you.

, Doing so means that all of the blue bones will not hurt you. However, it also means that your soul mode will turn blue.

, You survived the blue attack.


Know that now your soul is blue, it is affected by gravity. You will not have the use of the down arrow. You will mainly have to jump upwards, but as the fight progresses you will need to jump up and to either the left or the right, therefore using two arrows at once.

,, This will happen soon after you go into the arena. Your soul mode will be red.


Soul mode red is the default soul mode. It allows you to move along the fighting box with the arrow keys without any restraint.
Undyne will turn your soul to the green mode with a spear.

, To do this you move the arrow keys to move your spear. The top arrow shields the top of your soul, etc. You must block six attacks.


After six attacks, she will turn your soul to the red soul mode again. Take this advantage to flee. When you escape, run as fast and far away from Undyne as you can.

, You will enter another fight. Luckily, for this fight, you must only block four attacks before you can flee.

, Block eight attacks and flee. While you are running, you will get a call from Papyrus.


Undyne will not move during this call. After that, keep running until you reach Hotland and then you will have successfully spared Undyne.

Wear headphones.,
Familiarize yourself with the controls.,

Actively ward off threats.",How to Survive Night 1 in Five Nights at Freddy's 4," Sound is a crucial aspect of the game as it will let the player know when and where an attack is coming from.


Over-ear headphones that cancel out ambient noise would be ideal, but any headphones will suffice as the game heavily relies on surround sound, which can be lost through normal speakers.
Make sure you have the volume turned up properly, as breathing can be heard right before an attack and is essential to making sure you close the door, warding off Bonnie or Chica.;
, At times there can be a lot going on, and the difference between life and death could be the difference of a second. The Shift button is used to close and open doors, the Ctrl button is to turn the flashlight on and off, and the mouse is used to focus attention and run to locations. Holding Shift or Ctrl down before running to a location will allow that action to be performed instantly upon arriving after clicking.


The Android experience is exactly the same gameplay with slight variations in the controls. Instead of clicking to run to locations, you double-tap to run. The bottom left side of the screen acts as the control button for the flashlight, and the bottom right side of the screen acts as the shift button to close the door. Tapping the bottom middle of the screen in between the flashlight and door close will turn you around so you can run back.

, There are five areas to be aware of in the room, and each of them has their own set of dangers. The foot of the bed is the hub of the room where you can either turn around to face towards the bed or run to other locations in the room. The left door, closet, and right door can all be closed to keep any animatronics out, and the flashlight can be used to see scare away anything lurking in the darkness.

, Bonnie will only attack through the left door and can be heard shuffling down the hallway, advancing towards the door and breathing at the door. Holding the door shut, Bonnie can be heard walking away from the door. Alternatively, through the right door, Chica be found making nearly exactly the same sounds. Little Freddys will collect on the bed and will make a screeching, screaming noise that will need to be scared off with the flashlight every so often throughout the night.


If three Little Freddys are left unchecked on the bed, Freddy will be summoned to kill.
That’s not Mom in the kitchen; Chica likes to rummage around for snacks at night, so if dishes are heard banging into each other, be aware of an attack from Chica on the right side of the room soon!

, Pay attention to all the sounds in the room as they will give insight on what is about to happen. It is a lot to listen to, and the sounds can be quiet, but they are there. Looking towards a door will amplify any footsteps, so pan around the room and listen carefully. Run towards the door suspect of attack, stop and listen for a few seconds, and if there is no breathing heard, shine the flashlight down the hall to ward off threats. If there is breathing at the door, close it and listen for footsteps walking away and return to the foot of the bed. You need to make it to 6AM .


Do not forget to turn around at the foot of the bed and shine the flashlight at it to ward off any Little Freddys gathering on the bed.
You do not need to worry about the closet on the first night.

Pick up anything you can.",How to Solve a Nancy Drew Pc Game," There are many websites which include walkthroughs, hints, and cheats. If you ever want to become a master detective, your first step is severe self-discipline. You'll never be good if you keep linking to these websites, spoiling the thrill of discovering it yourself.;
, When you're stuck at a certain point of the game, you probably missed a puzzle you forgot to do or pick up a certain magazine, picture, or book you're supposed to examine. Travel through the world until you discover the source of the stall. Calling one of your friends (Bess, George, Ned, or sometimes an alternate source for hints) might put you one step ahead.

, The puzzles are the game. Trying to dodge them only causes the stalls.

, This is a vital part of the mystery. Often the suspects are hiding a certain secret or embarrassment; like going out with another suspect only to be dumped.

, If you're playing Junior Detective, you have a checklist in the form of a blue notebook on the bottom left off the playing screen. This checklist only shows up in games from the Secret of Shadow Ranch+. If the mystery you're playing in is lower, then you'll have to find other ways to keep track of errands you have to do.

, The way to solve a mystery is to really consider all of the details on the screen. Sometimes the simplest motive can lead to the culprit. It is often the least likely person you suspect, or all of them could be involved in some way.

, This is mandatory for any detective, junior or senior, young or old. Be patient with yourself and with how long it might take to solve a puzzle; it could take an hour, or you could get it on the first try.

, The best way to do this is with practice.


Some objects, like the diamond ring, have many locations in which they can spawn. Others, like the bicycle, have only one location.

, In the room between the kitchen and the garage, there is a box with three wires. Severing the blue wire turns off the alarm for the safe upstairs.


The green wire is for electricity in the house. Cutting it turns off the electricity. This is optional.
The red wire activates the alarm. It should not be cut unless the blue wire has been severed.

, The office key has many spawn points, including the end table in the family room, the couch in the living room, the end table in the master bedroom, the dining room table and more.

, Once you have the code, you can open the safe and get the gold bar as well as the many stacks of money.


The code changes every time, so be wary of this.

, The owner comes home four minutes into each round (or earlier if the alarm is set off). The clock will chime at about two minutes in, allowing you to judge what you can and should do in the remaining time.


Holding an item in front of you and/or crouching will sometimes hide you from the owner, and he will go away.

, Once you have all the items you need, or the owner has arrived at home, you can leave the house. There are two exits - the front door and the garage door. Once you leave, you will be told your ranking and the worth in dollars of the items you stole.

Strategy: This puzzle takes more thinking as you get more levels completed. Be warned, as new blocks rise after every move you make. The good thing is you can take as long as you want to make a move.
Traditional: This game is timed. New blocks rise after a certain period of time. The blocks come up at a faster rate of speed each level, and if they touch the top, they will crack, which means ""Game Over"".
Relapse: This game is similar to Traditional, except blocks come from both top and bottom, and if they touch each other, they will crack, meaning ""Game Over"".
Puzzle: This is a puzzle for your mind. You can take as long as you want to correctly complete the puzzle. But you have to get rid of all the blocks in order to proceed to the next level.

Pick a scenario where you have to build your theme park from scratch.,
Click the money amount on the bottom left and increase your loan as much as needed to build enough rides.,
Click the build icon.,
When your entrance area looks full, build something bigger.,
Now that you have the entrance filled up, it's time to move to the big area of the park.,
Now, again, pick ""Gentle Rides"" and build a car ride not too far from the roller coaster.,
If it is past April in your game, click the build icon, choose ""Water Rides,"" and build whatever ride they have.,
Now it's time to move on to the pathways.,
Now that you have a basic sketch of your park, it's time to move on to even bigger rides.,
Add the other attractions that keep your guests going.,
Now, click on ""landscaping/decorations"" icon and choose ""path decorations"".,
Now that your park looks more like an actual park, it's time to go into business.,
Now just sit back and watch your park population grow.,
Click the money again and choose the very last tab.,
Now relax for a minute and look at the amount of money.",How to Be Successful in Rollercoaster Tycoon Games," For example, choose Forest Frontiers in RCT 1, Roller Coaster Heaven in RCT 2,and Cosmic Craggs in RCT3. The park doesn't have to be closed. In RCT1 and 2, you cannot build while paused, but in RCT3, the game can be played whether or not you are paused.;
, You can always pay it off later. (Note: Sandbox Mode has unlimited money)

, Choose ""Gentle Rides"" and pick something small, like a ferris wheel or a carousel. Place the ride near the entrance of the park, but not too close to the road. Face the entrance and exit toward the main path. Now, click path icon and build a queue line path from the entrance to the pathway. Keep in mind that your ride may require a long line. Repeat this step with another gentle ride.

, Click the build icon and choose ""Thrill Rides"". Try to pick something small, like a swinging ship, or a spinning twist. Place it next to the gentle rides. Don't build the queue lines yet because you do not have a pathway leading to the ride yet. You can repeat this step if necessary.

, Click the build icon and choose ""Roller Coasters"". Pick ""Wooden Roller Coaster"" and build something fairly large, but not oversized. Place it by the edge of the park, so you still have space in the middle to install pathways. Put the entrance as close to the station as possible. Also, keep in mind that you have to build pathways that connect all the rides. Do not repeat this step.

, Try to keep it small, but not as small as ferris wheel, or merry-go-round.

, Position it close to the edge of the park, but also close to the entrance. If you build the boat ride, you must dig a lake and fill it with water.

, Build a path from the entrance to the water ride. Try to make the path as straight as possible, and yet reaching all the rides easily. Now, build queue line paths from entrances. If you need a queue line to be longer for more popular rides such as roller coasters, turn it like a maze. When you have the queue lines down, build exit paths. Building the paths in that order will prevent queue lines from accidentally attaching to a path you might not want it on. Exit paths can't be queue paths, or your guests will think they are in line for another ride and get confused. This keeps your park rating up.

, Click build icon and roller coasters again. Pick anything you want - anything really big - and build it in near the water ride and the first roller coaster. Don't put it close to the entrance and be sure to keep the pathways in mind. Do not build on the far side of the park until the entrance, both edges, and the middle is filled up, because guests don't like walking far. That's it for the rides!

, Click on the Build icon and choose ""Food"". Build Burger Bar, or Pizza Stall. Position it in the center of the attractions. Build a drink stall right next to the food stall, and finally, add a bathroom.

, Click on trash can and place it around the paths. Put it near food stalls and on the exits of the rides. That's going to sound little gross, but people throw up sometimes when they get off rides. Repeat, but choose benches instead of trash cans. Sometimes when people get sick, they just want to sit down. You can also add in some decorations, like fountains.

, Make sure all of the rides are open individually. Open the park. To do that, just click the park entrance and change the red sign to green.

, Be sure to check on specific rides and see what people think. Make a few adjustments if necessary. Pay attention to the announcements. A month in, hire a handyman or two to empty trash cans and clean up vomit. If a ride breaks down, hire a mechanic. If there are complaints about vandalism, hire a security guard. Also, be sure to increase park admission price after about a month, but don't make the price change too dramatic or no one will come.

, You will see all the advertisement options there. Advertise your park for two to three weeks - a lot more guests will come. Also, observe all the rides. If a particular ride does not get as many people as you want it to get, go back to the advertisements, but this time pick ""advertise particular ride"".

, See how much it's increasing. After you have gained enough money, open up the money control again and decrease the loan as much as you can. Your goal is not to have any loans at all.

Assuming that you have a code-name and a character, check out the primary weapons.,
Enter a game and start playing.,
This paragraph is for sprayers.,
For snipers and an enemy is far away, snipe them.,
If all above fails and you are on red team or in a dual battle, try switching to knife and run to where you have to go by jumping, rush to the bomb and plant it or seize the sample and run where you need to go.

",How to Play Soldier Front," These will be our main weapons until you get a higher rank so be careful on your weapon of choice. If you have just started I suggest a gun with low recoil, accuracy and o.k. power such as the K2 (better for mid - long range but has slow rate of fire), P90 (better for close combat but has low accuracy) or the M4A1 (M16A2 has a weird spray pattern. M4A1 has pretty much average everything except for extremely fast rate of fire). For snipers, the PSG1, often regarded as the best sniper and used by most of the experts, is available. The PSG1 has 5 bullets so if u miss u can try again.;
, To kill snipers who are hiding behind objects either take cover and snipe them if you are a sniper. NEVER TRY TO SNIPE A SNIPER BEHIND COVER IN THE OPEN - IT IS SUICIDE. For sprayers, put your cross hairs on them and click about 2-3 times (called bursting) before crouching behind the object of choice again. This makes it harder for snipers to attack you and makes you more accurate because it gives a chance for the cross-hairs to go back to normal.

, If you are a sniper go to the next paragraph. For enemies who are far away, DO NOT RUSH THEM. They can here your footsteps and they will attack you. Instead try to predict where they are going to go, switch to M9(knife) and run to where they are going on a detour route and wait for them there. If there is no detour follow them by walking (press shift). Although this is slower, they cannot hear you. When you are close to them, just rush them and shoot them. For those that are close to you but haven't seen you rush them as well. For those who have seen you and are close to you, try to back away and get behind cover while jumping in zig-zag formation. This is harder for them to aim. Try to take cover but if there is no cover, shoot them while jumping around the in circles (called bunny hopping) until they die.

, And do the same for everyone else. If they are close and see you, jump and scope with PSG1 or just shoot with FRF2.If sprayers start to get close, if you are confident in your skills, u can go ahead and try to shoot them. If not, take out your secondary pistol, stay behind cover and shoot at the upper torso.#

The game will still animate while paused, which can be a bit confusing. While paused, the Play button will not be flashing.

, The Agriculture window is the Window that starts open by default. Click one of the empty pastures and select the ""Soy"" option. Repeat this until you have three.

, Click each of the fields you just made and click the DNA button, which will enable genetic modification for the field.

You'll likely lose some money at first, but after making a few tweaks outlined below you'll be pretty much on autopilot.

, Your income be negative at first, but you'll soon start to see money trickling in.

, Before you do anything else, wait until your soy is harvested twice. This should happen in April 2002.

, Click one of your soy fields and then click the DNA button. This will remove genetic modification from the field.

, This will give you some money back, but more importantly it will make space.

, You'll have already had one cow harvest while waiting for your soy to finish. Your second cow harvest should happen in July 2003.

, After your second cow harvest, you're ready to fully-stock your restaurant with workers. Add workers to the other empty cash registers and assembly lines.


You'll want your restaurant fully staffed, which means you'll be adding two more cashiers and two more assembly workers.

, This will display your marketing options.

, These are the only marketing options you'll need for the rest of the game.

, When this degrades, you'll stop producing beef on that square. Swapping out your cow pastures will help keep your business running smoothly. You can tell fertility has degraded when there are large blank spots on the ground.

, When a cow pasture is no longer fertile, you'll want to sell it off so that it is blank again. Since you built all of your pastures at the same time, they will all degrade at the same time.


Pause your game immediately after a cow harvest, then sell all of the pastures.

, You'll need this official corrupted before you can destroy the rainforest squares that you need for your farmland.

, You'll need this space for your new cow pastures. These are the only two occupied squares you'll need to destroy.

, Use the two new squares plus the two original squares that weren't being used.

, After destroying the rainforests, you can deactivate the climatologist. Check the ""Detractors"" menu from the board room to see when it's safe to turn it off.

, Switch back and forth between the two sets of four open squares to build your pastures on.

, As your workers start to become unhappy, you can give them badges to make them happy again. This will only work for a little while.


Avoid discipline, as this rarely works.

, If rewards aren't working, just fire the crew member and hire a new one. This is more efficient than trying to save them.


When firing crew members, corrupt a politician from the front desk of the corporate screen. This will prevent backlash from angry employees.

, You generally don't need to listen to any of your advisors, even if they're angry about something. You'll be making too much money to care.

, After playing for a while, you may start to have a surplus of soy or a shortage of beef. Either get rid of a soy pasture for a while or add a beef pasture until everything balances back out, then you can switch back to your regular routine."

Get the immediate problems resolved immediately.,
Resolve the vandalism and fix the park's amenities.,
Deal with the park's other two problems involving their coasters.,
Move forward.",How to Beat the Ivory Towers Scenario in Roller Coaster Tycoon," Once you start this scenario, you'll find that this park has reached its breaking point. There's lots of vandalism of every park object, lots of vomit and litter all over the park and there are no bathrooms. Your first step is to hire lots of handymen and some security guards, placing them throughout the park.
, As your handymen and your security guards deal with the mess, you should then rebuild your park's benches, trash cans, lights, etc.

You can also elect to demolish the footpaths and redo the area all over again. In addition, you should also get food stalls, drink stalls, bathrooms, etc built right away.

,  Make ""Tree Topper"", the Steel Mini Roller Coaster, have only one train as it can break down with Station Brakes Failure (or then set a safety mechanic patrolling the exit and add brakes before the station).

You should consider removing Force 9/Hurricane; the park's suspended coaster as this is fairly intense. With the money you get from removing this ride in the game, you can build a new coaster in its place easily.
Your second option is you can also change the trains on Force 9/Hurricane to two cars; which theoretically should make the ride less intense due to reduced velocity, and if you elect this method, it should be a popular and profitable coaster. In the event of a Safety Cut-Out, however, you may run across stalled trains at the end of the track. In one way or another, if you remove it or not, it shouldn't become a problem.

, Once you're absolutely sure all of the park's problems are taken care of, you can then move onto the rides. Begin by building some gentle and thrill rides around the park.

If your hired staff are taking too much out of your pocket, go ahead and sack a few of them, but leave enough around to keep things in check. Be sure to hire a few mechanics as well.
After you recover mostly from the problems, you might build another coaster, preferably a cheap one. This will bring in more guests and increase your park rating.

They will then be forced to get negative points by hurting themselves to dig out. Try to use these weapons near your 8th to 9th volley.

Left clicking uncovers the contents of a given tile. Right clicking or holding alt while clicking marks a tile as a suspected bomb.


, As you uncover tiles, you will see numbers revealed. A number means that there are that number of bombs touching that tile (both sides, top/bottom, and diagonally). If you see a 1 on the board, it means that square is touching exactly 1 mine.


, Eliminate squares that can't possibly contain mines by left clicking. Say you found a 1, and you're pretty sure where the mine for that 1 is. You can click all the other squares around that 1 to open them, because the 1 can only be in contact with a single mine.


Use all of the numbers in a given area to figure out where the mines are.


, When you're reasonably certain you've found a mine, identify it by right-clicking or holding alt and clicking on the square. This will put a flag on the mine, and prevent you from clicking on it.


, As you go around the board, flag potential mines. If you find that you've flagged more mines than the game allows, go back and re-evaluate them.

Try to ensure that everyone has the games you intend to play installed before they come over, so you can get up and running without waiting for people to install things.Some of the most popular multiplayer PC games still support LAN. Minecraft, DOTA 2, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and more have LAN support, though some require an internet connection to function. Note that recent Blizzard games like Diablo 3 and Overwatch do not support LAN.;
, Running a LAN party doesn't require much, but there are some things you'll absolutely need:You'll need enough Ethernet cables to connect each computer to your switch, as well as a cable to connect your switch to your router. You can ask your guests to bring their own Ethernet cables, but you'll probably want to have a few spare cables handy.
You'll need surge protectors and extension cables to ensure that you don't trip circuits.
If you don't have the table space, you'll need a few folding tables and chairs depending on how many people are coming.

, It doesn't take many computers on a single circuit to trip it and bring your LAN party to an early end. Knowing how your circuits are configured in your house or apartment can help you determine where to plug in all the computers.Most houses have separate circuits for different rooms (living room, kitchen, utility room, etc.). Keep in mind that most circuits have multiple outlets, so just spreading your computers between outlets in the same room won't help.
You'll want to limit each circuit to about four computers. This means you'll likely need some heavy-duty extension cables and surge protectors to plug the computers into.

, If you're connecting more computers to the LAN than there are ports on your router, you'll need a network switch to connect them all. You can find 5-port switches at most computer retailers for around $20 USD.

Do not get another router, as this will make things needlessly complex and expensive. A simple switch is all you need to connect many more computers to your existing router.
Make sure your new switch uses auto-sensing ports. This will allow you to connect everything with standard Ethernet cables instead of having to buy, or make, a special crossover cable. Most all modern switches have auto-sensing ports.
While you can have everyone connect to your wireless network, this is not recommended for most multiplayer games. Once everyone is playing together, you'll likely notice serious lag.

, Switches need to be powered in order to work., This will essentially extend the number of ports on your router, allowing you to connect more Ethernet devices to it. Any computers you connect to the switch will be connected to the router and the internet.

If you don't need to have internet access during your LAN party, you can just use a switch and no router. You may want to have internet access, however, so that other players can download any necessary updates or games that they don't have installed. Routers will also handle assigning everyone a unique IP address, which makes getting connected much easier.

, Use Ethernet cables to connect each computer's network adapter to an empty port on the switch. If a computer doesn't have an Ethernet adapter, you can connect it wirelessly or use a USB Ethernet adapter.

It doesn't matter which computers go into which ports on the switch.
If you're using multiple switches to connect a lot of computers, don't connect all the switches to the router. Instead, connect the first switch to the router and the second switch to the first switch.

, If any of the connected computers are running a firewall program, it may hamper their ability to connect to the other computers. Make sure all firewall programs, including Windows Firewall, are disabled.

If you're using an antivirus program, it may have firewall software built-in. Open the program's interface and check for an option to disable the firewall.
See Turn off Firewall for details on turning off the firewalls for Windows and Mac computers.

, Besides playing games, one of the common functions of a LAN party is massive file sharing. D-LAN is a program that makes setting up shared folders easy so that your guests don't have to fumble with Windows sharing settings.

You can download D-LAN for free from www.d-lan.net. After installing it, you'll be able to see everyone else on the network who has it installed, and you can quickly create and access shared folders.
Make sure your guests aren't transferring files while others are trying to play, as this will drag down the connection speed.

, When you're creating a LAN game, one computer typically acts as the ""host."" The other computers will essentially connect to this computer to get the game data. If your strongest computer is the host, you'll have the best connection for the game.

You may want to consider setting up a computer as a dedicated server. This will allow for the best performance, but that computer will be unavailable to play on. The process for setting up a dedicated server varies depending on the game, and not all games support them.

The jumping community consists of jumpers and mapmakers. You'll need to create an account to download maps from the website, but you may be able to download them directly from other sites by searching for a map name.

If you click on About Jump Maps, you can see the most popular maps. However, many of these will be very advanced and difficult for a beginner to complete.
To find easy to complete maps, click on Download. The default sort is alphabetical. To sort by level (ascending), click the level column label once. As you scroll down, you'll see maps with an increasing difficulty rating. To save time, download as many maps as you want all at once.
For an absolute beginner, Happy Jump Tutorial is a must. It contains tips and explanations for the most common types of jumps.
Once you already know the basics, Uber Jumps is a good second map because of its escalating jump difficulty. This'll help you get used to the concept of repeating jumps until you get them right.;
, This will make it a lot easier to keep retrying jumps since you just have to press a key to return to your saved position. This works on any server (or your computer) that has enabled position saving/loading. You can use any key binding you like.

For example, to bind ""g"" to load your position you would type /bind g load
To bind h to save your position you would type /bind g save

, If you play by yourself, you will not suffer the effects of lag, you can control certain game variables, and you can take as much time as you need without worrying about the server changing the map on you when you're not ready. If you play online, you can seek the assistance of other players and immerse yourself in the jumping community., Although you can play jump maps in FFA (Free for All) mode, it's not ideal as you won't be able to enable jumper-friendly features like stamina regeneration and position saving/loading. Run each of the commands below in the console while at the main menu to prepare your game. You can access the console by pressing tilde (~).


/g_gametype 9 - This will set the jump mode gametype for your local system.

/g_stamina 1 - This will turn on stamina regeneration. You can set it to 2 for infinite stamina, but this is not recommended because it makes some jumps easier than intended and may form bad jumping habits if you use it regularly.

/g_allowPosSaving 1 - this will allow you to save/load your position which will save you time and allow you to return to your saved location on the map at anytime.

, In the example below, we will load Happy Jump Tutorial, a good beginner map. Remember, you can use tab complete - type just a few letters and then press tab to autocomplete. If it doesn't complete, a list of possible matches will show and you'll need to type a few more letters before it can know exactly what you want

/map ut4_happyjumptutorial_beta3.pk3
Or, alternatively, /devmap ut4_happyjumptutorial_beta3.pk3 to enable cheats like noclip if you think you might like to use that for exploration.

, If you haven't quiet mastered the skill of jumping and sprinting, then you'll want to load a big wide open map like ut4_riyadh (which is not a jump map) just to have some space to try it out. If you think you've got the hang of it, you can try completing the jump tutorial map., The variable set earlier just turned on the feature. To actually toggle it for your player, you need to type /regainstamina in the console., Look in the gametype column for ""JUMP"" that indicates jump mode. Most jump servers will use this mode since it's the best for jumping, but if one doesn't, it should have ""Jump"" written in its name somewhere., A lot of maps may be below or above your current skill level. That's okay. Compare that to the difficulty rating table referred to earlier and see if it's something you think you'd like to try. If you don't already have the map, it should be automatically downloaded as long as the server is configured correctly., If you'd like, open the console and turn on stamina regeneration (/regainstamina), If there's no one else playing and you don't like the map, it might be a good idea to call a vote to cycle the map (or vote for the next map first, then cyclemap) so you can play the map you want., To sprint, press W and E at the same time. Most jump maps will require you to be sprinting to successfully complete the jumps., Jumping is easy, press SPACE. Do this several times while sprinting. After doing this for a while, you may notice that you can go faster by making a slight curve than by jumping in a straight line. This is an important technique you'll learn and use for future jumps. A powerslide can be achieved by holding crouch before landing after your last jump.,

If there are walls, chances are you need to walljump off of them. If there are platforms, you'll generally need to jump on them. To do a walljump, press jump (space by default) as soon as you hit the wall. You must be moving for this to work. If you're having trouble getting enough distance to a platform for example, try using prejumps. This means jumping several more times in advance to achieve the desired velocity. Note that not all walls can be jumped on. This is set by the mapmaker and may be used on more advanced maps.
See ice? Ice can be a bit tricky, but in general you want to move in a curve to build up speed (you do not usually need to jump on ice, just sprint).
Jump map ladders are a bit different from normal ladders. The rungs are spaced slightly farther apart, so you have to hold ""W"" longer in order to reach and grab the next ledge.

, You can learn a lot by watching more skilled players jump. Take note of where they walljump, jump off platforms, crouch, and how they flick their mouse during some jumps. These are all techniques that are learned through trial and error., Failing jumps is a necessary and unavoidable part of learning how to master the skill. Sometimes, you'll want to quit. If you feel like you're doing something wrong, try doing it in a different way. Look up a demo of someone doing it. Ask for help from veteran players on the server. It may take time, but eventually you will pass the jump."

Don't go crazy on the Lightmap Scale.,
If your map has water, place a ""water_lod_control"" entity in the map.",How to Optimize a Map in Hammer Editor," This is a must. If there are ANY leaks in the map, the compiler won't be able to determine the boundaries of the map, and will attempt to render everything within the map all at once. Worse yet, any area portals, hint brushes and occluders in the map will not work, making them useless. Also, water won't render correctly if there are any leaks in the map.


In Fig. 1a, the room is obviously not sealed. If you compile this map with that leak, vvis (the portion of the compile that determines visibility data) won't be able to determine the boundaries of the map, since the visleaves  will just ""leak"" out into the black void outside our map.
In Fig. 1b, the room is sealed and will be compiled correctly.
To check for leaks, first make sure there is at least one entity in the map (such as an ""info_player_start""), otherwise this will not work. Save and compile the BSP by pressing F9 or going to File -> Run Map. Select ""Normal"" for Run BSP, and select ""No"" for both Run VIS and Run RAD (also be sure to check the ""Don't run the game after compiling"" box). Once it's done compiling, close the compile log and go to Map -> Load Point File. If there are any leaks, it'll ask you to confirm the operation (ex. ""Load default pointfile? ) Select ""Yes"", and you'll see a red line protruding from the nearest entity* out through the area of the leak. (*This is why you need an entity, either brush or point, in your map. It doesn't work with world or detail brushes.) Seal the leak, recompile the BSP, and load the pointfile. If all is sealed, it should just go to an empty folder in the Steam\steamapps\GAMERTAG\GAME\mapsrc folder. Always check for leaks before the map is released to the public.;
, Make sure you always create brushes with the tools/toolsnodraw texture first and then texture only what the player can see from the player's point-of-view. If you are only going to see one side of a wall, then texture that visible side only.

, Whenever possible, stick to creating geometry with a few large brushes rather than a thousand small ones. More brushes equals more faces, and more faces equals slower performance and compile time. Bottom line: if you can create complex geometry with one or two brushes, why use any more than that?


In Fig. 3a, there are two brushes: the one on the left was created using the Arch Tool which created an 8-sided brush with 40 faces, and the one on the right was made from a single clipped brush with only 11 faces. The latter was achieved by utilizing the Clipping Tool (Shift + X). To achieve the latter, it is recommended to first create the desired geometric shape out of the Arch Tool first for reference. Then, create a brush with the same length, width, and height as the reference arch and place it slightly above the reference. Select the brush and clip the angles. (you may need to change the grid size (""-"" to decrease, ""+"" to increase) and/or manually move the vertices (Shift + V) of the reference arch to snap to the nearest grid point.) Now you have a geometrically identical brush, but only with fewer faces!

, World brushes block visibility, seal the map, and split the BSP into ""leaves"", which are basically the compiler's way of determining what can and can't be seen at any given time and place. Detail brushes were designed to essentially be ""invisible"" to the compiler. The only brushes that should be world brushes are the walls, floor and ceiling of a room. Pretty much everything else in the room that isn't a working entity and doesn't significantly block the player's vision should be tied to a func_detail brush (tie using Ctrl + T). Since detail brushes don't block visibility, they won't be compiled in vvis calculations and won't split the map into more visleaves (which is good in most cases). Be warned though that it won't seal the map either. Just make sure that all the world brushes seal the map and there shouldn't be any problems.

, Area-portals and hint brushes are great ways to limit visibility and increase performance if done correctly. However, you should not place these in every corridor and window, as the amount to calculate what's supposed to be rendered and when could very well surpass that of just rendering the entire room all at once. Instead, you should only separate rooms with lots of details. This will spare your computer having to render many unnecessary objects, and help increase performance without putting a major strain on visibility calculations.

, Occluders are similar to a closed area portal, as it doesn't render what is behind it. However, it is different than a closed area-portal in that it doesn't need to seal a room (it can be free-standing and not touch world brushes) and it only blocks 3D models (aka props). This tool is very costly in terms of memory usage, so you should only use occluders when there is an expensive 3D model behind a free-standing wall that cannot be sealed by areaportals.

, Not totally necessary, but it'll help make the map look much larger without drastically slowing down FPS (frames per second). 3D skyboxes are usually made for ""large"" outdoor maps, but it is possible to make it for an indoor map if you can see an exterior through a window or something. 3D skyboxes are very cheap to render and can make a small map appear up to 16x larger since 3D skyboxes are set to a 1/16 scale in Hammer and then scaled up during compile.

, On large outdoor maps, fog can limit the amount of detail being rendered, and it can make your map look more realistic in the process. Simply add an env_fog_controller entity in your map. On the ""Enable Fog"" option in the Object Properties tab, select ""Yes"". Next, edit the Far Z Clip Plane to your liking, which will remove all brushes after that distance, eliminating the engine rendering unnecessary objects (The Far Z Clip Plane value should be greater than the Fog End value).

, The lightmap scale essentially determines how sharp or blurry shadows are rendered on geometry. Larger numbers degrade the shadow quality, but can increase performance. Contrariwise, a lower lightmap scale increases the visuals of the shadows, but can severely lower performance. Either too large or too small of a lightmap scale could produce an unrealistic lighting effect that is either too dull or too sharp, respectively. The default lightmap scale for all brushes is 16, which is a balanced area between visuals and performance.

, This entity determines how far away you have to be from ""expensive"" water in order for it to transition to ""cheap"" water. Expensive water looks much more realistic than cheap water, and therefore costs more in terms of memory usage and calculations on the computer. A shorter transitional distance will produce cheaper water at a shorter distance, and therefore will lose a lot of visual quality when at a distance, but will also increase performance.

Play as a Breton.",How to Play a Nightblade in Elder Scrolls Online1," The Khajit are a natural choice for a Nightblade as they have a race-based bonus to their stealth radius. However, their other race bonuses make them better as a more combat-based Nightblade (they also have bonuses to medium armor and melee attacks). Lean towards a dual wield, instead of a bow, to take advantage of the bonus. Khajit are available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion. , Bosmer are another natural choice for a Nightblade. They have a bonus to stealth as well, plus a bonus to bow use. Accordingly lean towards a bow if playing with this race. Bosmer are available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion.

, Argonians have natural healing abilities, which can seriously come in handy since Nightblades will have to put many of their points into magicka and stamina, rather than health. Their natural weapon bonus is for a Restoration Staff (not the most useful weapon for a Nightblade) so you can choose any weapon you want (bows and dual-wield are best for Nightblades). Argonians are not the best Nightblades but they are the most qualified race available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.

, Bretons are great at protecting themselves and have a hefty magicka pool from which to draw (magicka is used when executing class-based abilities). Since their emphasis is on magicka, you will need to choose abilities which help them attack effectively, since their abilities to use weapons may be decreased. Bretons are not the best Nightblades but they are the most qualified race available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.

You will be passing out the hurt like candy on Halloween with this skill tree. These abilities will make for a great offensive character, making you a useful damage dealer for your group. , This tree is mainly about getting you out of sight, so that you can attack from range and stay out of the way. Many of the skills are about turning invisible, but this isn't as great a boon as it sounds. While invisible, you'll be unable to regenerate magicka. The higher level abilities in this tree do let you deal more damage, though. , This tree is about taking health, speed and power from your enemy and giving it to yourself.

"
Get in the fights.,
Avoid direct combat.,
Take advantage of your sneak skills.,
Use medium armor.,
Level your magicka.",How to Play a Nightblade in Elder Scrolls Online3," There are two styles of gameplay for Nightblades. The first is a more combat-based style, where your Nightblade will be getting all up in the action and dealing damage to your enemies.


If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Assassination tree (and to a lesser extent, the Siphoning tree).






Leaning towards dual-wield is also a good idea, as that does more damage than a bow and is intended for more face-to-face combat.






If taking this route, it might be a good idea to distribute some points to health, though the majority should still go towards magicka and stamina.







, The other style of gameplay is more stealth-based, where your Nightblade will avoid the bulk of the action in favor of distanced attacks and staying out of sight.


If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Shadow tree (and to a lesser extent, the Siphoning tree).






Leaning towards bow use is also a good idea, since you'll want to be attacking from a distance and not up close.






If taking this route, it might be a good idea to distribute more points towards stamina than magicka, as magicka points do not regenerate while using your class abilities (which are mainly related to turning invisible, if you took our suggestion of the Shadow skill tree).







, Even if you're playing a melee-based Nightblade, you should still take advantage of your sneak skills when you can. You aren't a tank, so avoid conflict if possible, especially if you're by yourself. Don't neglect your dodge-roll, a helpful way of getting past traps and out of an enemy's line of fire.

, The medium armor skill trees include several bonuses that are useful for Nightblades, including increase chance to critical strike and dodge. The more medium armor you wear, the faster you will level this skill and the more bonuses you will have available to you.

, Overall, a healthy magicka level or cache of potions is a good idea for Nightblades. They are heavily reliant on their class abilities, all of which use magicka. There is also an emphasis on stamina, since your Nightblade will use weapons, but to what degree is somewhat dependent on your play style.

Choose Clothing.,

As you are playing a Nightblade, who usually wear medium armour, this will be a good profession to pick up., If you are using a bow or staff, wood-working is suited to you. This is because you can upgrade your bow or staff faster. Do not worry about going out into the land for just crafting items as you will find many when just questing and can spawn in or next to towns anyway., For any profession that you choose, invest a skill point in Keen-Eye as this will make items have a particle effect and so easier to see when out and about., As you should already know, exploring is a good thing to do, and one of the things you can find are special crafting stations for specific items that have special bonuses."

Avoid low-level monsters.",How to Level Fast in Aura Kingdom," This is the easiest and most straight-forward way to level up in the game. Completing all of the main story quests will easily get you to level 40. The main quests will also reward you with gold, equipment, and Eidolons.;
, Open your map by pressing M or clicking the enlarge button near your minimap. You will be able to see the golden-colored quest ""!"" icon, indicating that the NPC has a quest for you.


Most main quests are connected, and the NPCs will direct you to the next step once you're done. This makes leveling up easier, as you can easily proceed from one quest to the next.
Main quests may include monster-slaying, which gives you an added experience on top of the quest reward.
Main quests also includes dungeon-raiding in both solo and normal mode. Every dungeon raid gives a decent amount of EXP once you're able to complete it. Aside from equipment drops and gaining crystal fragments, you will also be rewarded with gold. These are useful when upgrading weapons, purchasing potions, and performing many other tasks.

, These quests can be seen in any city or by just simply opening the map and finding the blue-colored quest ""!"" icons. These quests reset every day for players to take and complete. Aside from decent experience, these quest also rewards players with crafting materials, gold, and Eidolon fragments, which can be exchanged for key fragments.


You can also check your Aura Kingdom Journal tab at the bottom right of your screen; this will show the location of the NPC and what kind of quest they hold. Each map typically has three daily quests: one monster-slaying quest, one item-collection quest and one dungeon quest. Make sure that the quest is within ten levels of your current level.
There are also fame quests that you can take from bulletin boards in every map. These bulletin boards hold special quests for players to take. Once accepted, you will be teleported to a certain place where you will be given a task to complete. This is a fun way to level up and will also reward you with fragments and mystery boxes.
Do all of your daily quests before moving on with available story quests. The levels you gain from the daily quests will make the main quests much easier.
Many higher-level players in Aura Kingdom prefer to do daily quest than grinding out fights with random enemies. The fragments they gather will help them unlock new Eidolons.

, If you have finished doing your daily quests and have no main quest to continue, you can focus on dungeon raiding instead. Dungeons, just like repeatable quests, reset every three hours or less.


You can enter dungeons with your friends in Hell Mode, which gives huge experience and a chance of dropping valuable weapons and equipment. Hell Mode may be difficult to clear, but with a decent Bard and Tank, one round will only take five minutes or less.
Many players prefer raiding dungeons because of the quick EXP, especially when you run with your friends in the game.

, Choosing EXP boost for your Envoy's Path skill tree will significantly increase the amount of EXP you gain throughout the entire game. Not only does it give you more EXP for defeating monsters, it also increases the EXP rewards you get for completing dungeons and quests.


Getting all the available boosts will increase the EXP you earn by 8%. This may not sound like much, but it is a significant boost over the course of the game.
You can reset your Envoy Path skill tree later once you no longer need your EXP bonus skills.

, Along with the EXP Envoy's Path, many power-leveling characters use EXP-boosting gear. These are blue relics that can increase the amount of EXP you gain. EXP gear can also be crafted gear with EXP bonus stats.


Place EXP-boosting gear in every piece of armor. If you can max out the gear you have equipped, you can get a 50% EXP bonus. Combined with the Envoy's Path bonus of 8% EXP, you will end up earning 58% more EXP.

, Now that you have a good 58% EXP using Envoy's Path and EXP gears, you can also make use of EXP cards and boost items. You can purchase EXP boosting items from the Item Mall with real money to help you with your grinding. EXP cards and boosts have time limits, and you typically can only stack a limited number of them before the boosts no longer increase.This is optional, if you have spare money. EXP cards and related items can help you level up faster.
A lot of players these days now sell Item Mall items for in-game gold; if you know a friend or anyone you can trust, you can buy these items from them. Be warned: purchasing Item Mall items from other players is not allowed in the game but is not totally prohibited, so if you get scammed, GMs or Admins will not honor your request for help.

, These books can be obtained from some quests, or can also be purchased with real money. These books will grant you an instant EXP boost depending on your level. The higher level you are, the more EXP you obtain. This means that it is best to save these to use on later levels.

, Whenever you join a party, you will obtain an EXP bonus with every monster you kill. The EXP boost is in effect when you are on the same server channel and the same map as your party-mates.


You do not have to be fighting the same monsters as the rest of your party to earn the boost. The best way to take advantage of this is to form a party and then split up. AS long as you are on the same map, you will earn the boost.
Be warned: if you're about to enter the Temple of Eidolon, make sure to leave the party you're in because being in a party may or may not kick you out from the dungeon before you can complete your task inside.

, As you grow stronger and gain more levels, the amount of EXP you earn from weak monsters drops off dramatically. Make sure that you are no more than ten levels higher than the monster you are fighting, otherwise it won't be worth the time investment.


Always check the amount of EXP you earned to make sure that the grinding you did was worthwhile.

Follow the beginner's instruction to level up your toon. You can get equipment from beginner's quests that you can use.


First off, its always best to NOT upgrade your equipment to its max when you're a low level. This is because levels increase rapidly at the beginning and low level equipments will be thrown right away along with the gold you spent for the upgrade. Start upgrading to max stats when you reach level 30 and up.;
, Gather synthetic materials from multi-player dungeons. Click the blacksmith icon and click ""synthesize"" in the blacksmith options located above the window. Choose the item and then finally synthesize. The whole set will give you extra stat boosts that will increase your BR dramatically.


A complete set will also build your rage twice faster than an incomplete or mixed equipments. Thus, giving you more chance to use better skills that requires a lot of rage.

, It is a good source of extra exp, gems, luck stones, and most especially, crypt tokens. All of these are essential in upgrading your equipments. You need a lot of crypt tokens to get rings and jewels and synthetic materials for legendary equipments so make sure to complete its max level as early and as often as you can to get the most out of it.


Go to your city and click ""forgotten catacombs"". You have one attempt each day to enter and complete each level as high as you can. If you have completed several levels previously, you may do blitz to save your effort. And then continue to higher levels.

, Once you reach level 13, it is best if you join a guild so that you can join Guild Battles to get Insignias and Honour.

Click the guild icon in the lower part of your screen or simply press ""G"". This will give you a list of existing guilds in your server. It will give you an option whether to apply in an existing guild or create a new one. If you are a beginner, it is best to just join an existing guild. Building a guild is never an easy job and you need to learn the game first before you can succeed in running a guild.

, Ask help from your guild or any friends in your server and create a party. Nightmare mode is a best option for daily dungeons since you can loot synthetic materials both for rare and legendary equipments.

, The must have gems for a mage are MAtk, MDef and PDef. Then add up either a crit or hp gem for a legendary.


Socket higher level gems as possible.
If you have gems that are useless, synthesize them first and then convert it to a gem that you can use. Synthesis before conversion will save you 50% of gold than conversion before synthesis.

, Maximum enchantments mostly give the primary stat of an item an additional value that's incredibly higher than the original.


Ex. A lorekeeper staff that initially gives +239 MAtk will get and additional +346 MAtk when fully enchanted which gives you a total 585 MAtk (Special and bonus stats not included).

, Try your best to acquire as much gold as you can and use them to capture astrals. Main astrals for mages are MAtk, MAtk + penetration, PDef, MDef, will destroyer, goddess blessing, HP, and crit accordingly.

, Contribute your gold to your guild more often and buy first the skills that will help you immensely. Start off with the gold boost to raise your gold production. Followed by intellect boost, defense boost, endurance and charisma. If you have extra gold to spare, you can buy strength boost to get a little amount of PDef that can help you survive a little longer.
, The Brutality and Healing rune are helpful in BG, GB and Arenas to deal more damage and instantly restore a percentage of your hp. If you think you are lucky all the time, Amnesia and Chaos runes are quite amazing when brought to higher level for its chances to make your opponents loose turns and attack their own team mates!

, Gather mount training whips and train your mount in bulk (advanced training) as this will give you more chance to get a higher (+) exp buff. Remember that the mount skills that you train will add up to your own stats so take the mounts intellect higher before upgrading other mount skills.


It is best to to train your mount during mount training events for the amazing rewards that you can get.

, Passive mage skills helps in boosting magic attack and rage build up that will allow you to use AOE skills. Since mages have more AOE skills than knights and archers who have low magical defense, they are more useful in PVP party., Bring up your academy level, research technology skills and bring them to a higher level using kyanites. Plunder other players' cities for kyanites or finish quests that gives kyanite as a reward. There are also event boxes that randomly gives kyanites.

, As you may have noticed, in almost all attempt in upgrading your battle rating requires gold. Check the regular world boss event schedules and be online 5 minutes earlier. It is best to use high potions and/or scrolls to enhance your MAtk. The higher your damage dealt to the boss, the higher the gold and daru you get."

Identify the aliens.",How to Know the Different Cows and Aliens in Cows vs Aliens," Look for the game app on your device. It has an app icon with a cow on it. Tap on it. On the welcome screen, tap the “Play!” button, and the game will start.;
, The game always starts with a handful of basic cows. They’re all plain white-and-brown and white-and-black cows. Each basic cow you get to the barn earns you 1 milk point.

, Every now and then, a golden cow will mix with the cows. When you see it, get it to the barn quickly to earn some bonus milk points. A Golden Calf earns you 10 milk points.

, You may also see a blue cow with a big star on it. This is the Magic Cow. When you get it to the barn, it pulls all the cows on the field to the barn. Maximize the opportunity by waiting for more cows to come into the field so you can pull more of them in.


Aliens will be left on the field.

, You may also see a brown cow. Do not confuse this as a plain cow. The brown cow is the Dynamite Bull. Get it to the barn and all the aliens on your screen will explode.

, There may be times when you see an extra-large cow on the field. When you get this to the barn, it won’t go in right away. It will block the entrance, preventing other cows and aliens from entering it. Double-tap on the bloated cow to push it into the barn.

, All the aliens come in its own spaceship. They come in different colors, but all act the same. When you see an alien on the field, push them off the cliff right away. Never let them near or inside the barn. When one does, the game is over.

Brainstorm.,
Create the Airport.,
Add the scenery.,
Add Detail.,
Make the files.,
Test, Tweak, Test.,
Upload it.",How to Create and Upload Addon Scenery for Flight Simulator," It's probably a good idea to brainstorm ideas of what you want so you'll have a rough idea of where to start. This can usually be broken down into 5 categories: The type of the airport (General Aviation, Bush, Commercial/International, etc.), the location, (it might be a good idea for a bush airport in the mountains of Alaska, but virtually useless on the prairies of the UK where you have room for much larger facilities), the size (this can usually be somewhat dictated by the type), the features (again, usually some are givens as a result as the type, but there are some generics such as hangars), and the final stage, actually drawing a diagram yourself of all your ideas. When the time comes to actually build everything, you probably won't follow your plans exactly. This is OK and probably the best method. Also, make it unique! Don't do the average airport; look at some other people's downloads for ideas, then put a creative twist on them. This is also a good way to get lots of downloads.;
, Open up whatever program you are going to use for the designing (there are several freeware programs available on the web) and start a new airport. With most airport design programs, if you have both Flight Sim and and the program open at the same time, the program will display your aircraft with a red cross-hair or something so you know where you are. The first and most obvious step is to add runways. When numbering runways, it is best to know that runways are numbered to the nearest number of their headings. For example, a runway with a true heading of 79 would become Runway 8. If creating 2 or more parallel runways, use the designators L, C, and R. They stand for Left, Center, and Right. If you have four parallel runways, then the fourth runway would be numbered the next highest number (e.g. Runway 8 would become Runway 9). After this, create the parking. This can range from Ramp GA Small spots for tiny airports to Gate Heavys at large international airports. Finish that up by adding apron surfaces, then add taxiways.

, As with any airports in the world, they have buildings! Hangars, terminals, FBO's, fire stations, virtually anything. You can also create your own scenery objects by using 3D modeling program and some other sophisticated programs, but this is a more in-depth topic and for the purposes of this article we will use ""library objects"" which are objects that come with the Sim and can be called up for use as many times as needed. There are also many good programs (free) available on the web that place these objects that require no knowledge of computer programming. As with the airport design programs, these will usually somehow represent your aircraft on-screen. All you have to do is find out the coordinates for the object you want to place and BAM! it's there. For smaller airports, a smaller FBO and one or two hangars are usually the minimum, but don't overdo it either. Maybe look at pics of real airports for ideas. For larger airports, terminals, gates, and control towers may be the norm.

, As with real-world places, small details like cars and houses also adorn the area. Consider adding unrelated objects, like neighborhoods and business, for added detail. Light and telephone poles are small things that go a long way. Power plants, water towers, and hospitals are also nice to add. If your airport is near a body of water, add a marina with boats, or port with cranes and all. Whatever you want to do! Also, something I would HIGHLY suggest doing is adding AI traffic.

, Now you need to compile the bgl files. This can usually be done by pressing some buttons in the program. Follow the directions that come with the program downloads.

, Put the bgl files in your add-on scenery folder and start the Sim. If all goes well, you should be able to select your airport from the airport selection screen and should be able to see your scenery. If something isn't the way you want it, move it, delete it, or modify it. Once you are satisfied with what you have, you are ready to move onto the last step.

, Put all the needed files in one folder and write a read-me file. This a text file that fully explains your file. There are usually guidelines for this on the site you are uploading to. The upload process should be a snap too, just follow the on-screen directions. Then, once it's posted, on most sites you can check the number of downloads your file has. It should be noted that while your file is usually immediately available for download, it may not appear on the site's main page until one or two days afterward. Just be patient.

, When the download completes, more than likely the zip file program will open the file automatically. You should, after possibly opening the file that appears, see a couple of files such as: A model file, maybe a panel file, a texture file, possibly a sound file, a .cfg file named 'aircraft', and a .air file.

, Place the main file, holding the files mentioned above, if using FS2004, in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Aircraft. If using FSX, place it in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Simobjects\Airplanes. If there is no main file containing all the files of the aircraft, make one and place the aircraft files there.

Distance from runway / your speed = answer x 60 = time in minutes to reach the runway.",How to Calculate Correct Descent Rate in Flight Simulator X (FSX),";
,, It is best to pause the simulation at this point as the calculation may take some time to complete.


Your altitude (5000 to 3000 ft)
your speed (your speed will be in knots, convert to KM/H)
your distance (your distance will be in nautical miles, convert to KM) from the runway (which can be found on the GPS)

,
Your answer will give you the time in minutes to reach the runway.
With that answer complete the following sum.
Your altitude / time to reach runway = answer
Your answer for this sum will be a positive number, turn the answer to a negative number EG- if your answer was 1000 change it to -1000.
That negative number is the descent rate that you need to follow to get to the runway EG- if your answer was -1000, you need to descend at -1000 feet per minute to get to the runway.

Know when a dragon is about.,
Find cover.,
Identify the type of dragon you are facing.,
Kite dragons with ranged attacks.,
Stagger dragons to disable their breath attack.,
Build your elemental and magic resistances.,
Bring along a follower that cannot be killed.,
Use shouts to give you a tactical edge.",How to Kill Dragons in Skyrim," As soon as you hear a loud roar in the distance, one that echoes around your surrounding area, stop what you’re doing and look up at the sky. Scan it for dragons. Some of them will continue flying around and ignore you no matter how close you get, but most will start attacking you the moment they spot you. You will know a dragon has chosen to attack you when a distinct soundtrack reserved for dragon fights starts up, giving you a few extra seconds to prepare yourself for combat.;
, As soon as you find yourself under attack by a dragon, run to the nearest solid cover you can find. Look for solid pillars, boulders, walls, or structures to hide behind. Trees can provide some cover if they are thick enough, but they are generally unreliable at completely stopping a dragon’s breath from damaging you.


If you want to engage the dragon from afar, find an area that is thick with cover where the dragon can’t land to engage you in close quarters combat. If you want to engage the dragon in melee combat though, then find cover near a wide-open space. This will give the dragon a spot to land so you can get up close and personal with it.

, Take note of the dragon’s color, its physical features, and the element of its breath attacks. This is another reason for finding cover as soon as possible, as it gives you more time to safely study your opponent before charging in. If you identify the type of dragon you are fighting against, you can take advantage of that dragon’s weaknesses while preparing your own potions and enchantments to protect yourself against their attacks.Basic Dragons are the first dragons you will encounter at random. Bronze and white dragons spit fire attacks and are both vulnerable to frost damage. Brown dragons can spit fire and ice attacks. Fire-breathing dragons take bonus damage from frost attacks, while Frost-breathing dragons take bonus damage from fire attacks.

Blood Dragons are green, have large sails on their backs, and start appearing when you hit level 18. They can spit either fire or ice attacks and are vulnerable to the element opposite the one they breathe. Fire-breathing Blood Dragons can also knock you around with an Unrelenting Force attack, causing your character to ragdoll and spend a few extra seconds slowly getting up. The other advanced dragons from this point on will be able to Shout Unrelenting Force as well.

Frost Dragons are grayish-white, have large black spikes on their back, and start appearing at level 27. They breathe frost, can knock you around with Unrelenting Force, and can cast slow-moving but extremely painful Ice Storm spells. They are resistant to frost attacks but will take bonus damage from fire attacks.

Elder Dragons have are large bronze dragons, have wings with two-toned colors, and start appearing at level 36. You have fire and frost variants, with each being resistant to their own element while being vulnerable to the element opposite theirs. Fire variants spew out Fireballs that can hurt you from behind cover if they land beside you, while frost variants toss out Ice Storms that can quickly cut you down if you get in their way.
""Ancient Dragons are copper-colored dragons with black-and-red scales, have barely no ridges on their backs, and start appearing at level 45. They are identical to their Elder counterparts in terms of function (from elemental strengths, elemental weaknesses), except they do much more damage with all their attacks.


Serpentine Dragons appear if you have the Dragonborn expansion installed and have reached at least level 55. They are blue with large lower jaws, and can be found on Solstheim. They are functionally similar to Ancient Dragons except that they have a bit more health for you to chip away.

Revered Dragons come with the Dawnguard expansion and start appearing once you reach level 59. They are bright orange have broad, flat bodies with an equally long and flat tail. They only breathe fire and are thus weak to frost attacks, but they have the Drain Vitality shout, which drains your health, your magicka, and your stamina for 20 seconds. Make sure to pack a lot of potions to compensate for this; otherwise, you could find yourself in serious trouble if they manage to corner you while you’re being drained.

Legendary Dragons come with the Dawnguard expansion and start appearing once you hit level 78. Their black and purple scales along with the prominently curved horns on their hide make them easy to spot. They are also the hardest randomly-encountered dragons to deal with, as they not only come in frost and fire variants but can also unleash a Drain Vitality shout that hits harder than their revered counterparts.

, Dragons can be very dangerous if you charge them head-on. Dragons also have an annoying habit of hovering in the air or landing on top of tall structures where you can’t engage them in melee combat. It is for this reason that it is always handy to pack a bow or prepare some offensive magic to help damage the dragons from afar. You can also “kite” the dragons by hiding behind cover when the dragon spits out a breath attack against you then popping back out after the dragon is finished with its attack.


It is worth noting that you can poison your arrows to give them a little extra punch for dealing with dragons. Just make sure you land these poisoned arrows, as the poison effect will disappear after loosing them.
Remember to cast spells of an element opposite the dragon’s breath. If you see it breathing fire, slam it with frost spells. If you see it breathing frost, blast it apart with fire spells.

, There will be windows of opportunity where a timely bash, power attack, or Impact-talented dual-cast spells will cause the dragon to recoil and cancel its breath attack. The most notable is when the dragon is rearing its head to unleash a breath attack. Once it starts this animation, quickly slap the dragon with a staggering blow. The window for successfully doing this is very short, so you’ll need to act fast to ensure that you don’t get your face melted off. If you do enough damage with an Impact-talented dual-cast spell, you can also knock down a hovering dragon and cause it to land for a few seconds.

, The usual health, magicka, and stamina potions will come in very handy when fighting dragons. You will, however, find potions that increase your fire, frost, and magical resistances. These potions significantly reduce the damage of breath attacks, giving you enough survivability to go toe-to-toe with dragons. Using enchanted equipment to protect you against fire, frost, and magic will also stack with these potions. Get enough resistance, and you could virtually laugh off the elemental shouts that the dragons will toss at you.


Do note that Skyrim caps elemental resistances at 85% and magic resistances at 85%. This will ensure that you will always take damage from spells and dragon breath attacks. If you do manage to get maximum magic and elemental resistance though, you will negate 97.5% of the total incoming damage., Most followers in the world of Skyrim can be killed if they take too much damage—a serious problem when facing dragons that spit a stream of hard-hitting breath attacks. You will thus want to bring along followers that are marked by the game as “essential” and cannot be killed. Cicero, Farkas, Serana, Derkeethus, Mjoll the Lioness, and Dark Brotherhood Initiates all cannot be killed. They will simply fall on their knees when their health drops below a certain level, and they will survive subsequent damage that would have normally killed other followers., Having the ability to Shout is an extremely useful thing when fighting dragons. They can help you kill dragons faster, survive what would have been a fatal ordeal, force dragons to the ground, and even shift the weather to make it easier to track dragons as they soar through the sky.Dragonrend—A must-have for melee characters who need to force dragons to the ground. You will get this shout by finishing the quest “Alduin’s Bane,” a part of the main quest, and will force dragons to the ground by experiencing mortality. Wait until the dragon hovers in the air or is perched atop a tall structure before unleashing Dragonrend. This will cause the dragon to land in the nearest available clearing, opening the way for you to chop it up as you please.

Marked for Death—A very useful shout for characters that use weapons. Even the first word of the shout will drain a hefty amount of armor per second for 60 seconds, making your physical attacks hit that much harder against the thick hide of dragons.

Become Ethereal—This skill is extremely useful for archers and mages that have a low health pool. Even warriors can find it useful if they have trouble with particularly hard-hitting dragons. Shouting the first word will cause you to become impervious to damage for 8 seconds with a 20-second cooldown. This can save you when you are out of cover and a dragon blasts you with a breath attack. Do note that most potions won’t work while you’re ethereal, but your stamina and magicka will regenerate as usual.Elemental Fury—Dual-wielding berserkers can absolutely demolish a dragon with this shout. The enhanced attack speeds coupled with dual-wield power attacks and lots of stamina potions have the potential to end a dragon in a matter of seconds.

Battle Fury—This shout is very useful if you are attracting the attention of a dragon and have a particularly powerful, well-equipped companion. Its relatively short cooldown makes it useful to combine with other low-cooldown shouts.

Clear Skies—This utility shout, gained after completing the quest “Throat of the World,” and is extremely useful if you find yourself being attacked by a dragon during a blizzard or thunderstorm. The fair weather will make it a lot easier to spot the dragon and to properly aim your shots. The best part is that the shout has a pretty low cooldown, allowing you to use and better aim other low-cooldown shouts.

This will allow you to do the most spins in your shot, therefore making them better. However, if you cannot seem to keep control of where your shots end up, lowering it a few notches is better than not coming close to hitting.
, Holding your controller ""Claw"" style is the most efficient for trickshotting, as it allows your index finger to control more than one button. To do this, curl your right index finger on the ""B"", ""Y"", and ""X"" buttons on the controller. Put your left index finger on the LB button. Your middle fingers should be on the controllers, and the rest of your fingers resting behind the controller, with the exception of your thumbs to move the joysticks., This one is a toss-up for you to decide. Tactical and normal are both good setups to use, with tactical allowing you to knife a bit faster, but costing you your crouch button to get out of a sticky situation. Whatever one you feel most comfortable with, go for it., Shortened from cancel swaps, this is where you delay the pulling out mechanism of the game until you want to use it. To do this, find a gun lying on the floor. Start to hold ""X"" to pick up the gun, and right as you are about to pick it up, knife and press ""Y"" if done correctly, you should never see the gun you pick up, only your sniper. You can then switch to the weapon as you trickshot, and it will look like you just picked it up. Note all weapons do not have an animation like this., After you shoot, use any type of equipment. You will know you did this correctly if your equipment recoils up like your sniper would. This makes the shot in the killcam make no sound. It is possible to do this while reloading, however, it is a frame-perfect shot., These are both essentially the same thing, where you can switch from a shotgun to your sniper rifle faster than normal. However, they are different with separate cods:

Modern Warfare games. Chose a pump shotgun, such as the SPAS-12. Shoot, reload, then wait a quarter of a second. Now you can either press ""Y"" or hit ""Y"" three times. Pressing it three times will give you the over the shoulder effect.
Black ops/WAW. Aim down sights with your shotgun. Shoot, and press ""Y"" and ""X"" at the same time. If done right you will see your sights for a fraction of a second.

, This can be done in any COD with an RPG as a weapon. With the RPG in hand, hold down fire, and right before you fire, switch weapons., Perhaps the easiest to hit, simply run while falling in mid-air, and stop running to be able to shoot again., Before going for your shot, shoot the sniper you will be trickshotting with. When you switch back to shoot, reload enough so you can shoot again, either press ""Y"" twice or do a running man, and shoot., With your sniper out, hold down ""X"". Then press ""Y"" repeatedly while also holding down your firing button. This will make it look and sound like you are firing your gun without actually doing so. To fire, simply release ""X"". Note this is very hard to fluently do while playing ""claw"" style., Do a 180 in one direction, then do a 180 in the other direction. Is also possible with 360's but it takes quite a bit of time., Also know as an ""Around the world"", when jumping off, look straight up in the air, then look back down before firing on your target., After going for your shot, scope in with your sniper rifle., Run towards a window. While continuing to hold run, hold down the crouch button and jump. This will make you jump right out of the window instead of being stuck on the ledge., This one is up to luck. If a host migration happens when you are in the air, it will keep you suspended until the migration is over. You can use this to your advantage if you are in the air by shooting as soon as the migration is over., You are going to want a class with very high damage, as it is possible to hit someone and not kill them. It is recommended that you either use Intervention or the Barrett 50 cal. with FMJ as an attachment to increase damage, Stopping Power as perk 2 to increase damage, and Commando Pro for perk 3 so you don't take damage from falling.





, Find a lobby and start playing. Kill people until you get to the final person. Then, get to a high point in the map, some maps are better for trickshotting than others. Some popular trickshotting maps include:

Favela






Terminal






Rust







, Use either stun or flash grenades to make it hard for your target to move and give you time to set up for the shot, it is easier to hit a stationary target than it is one moving.





, Now start doing things in the air. Some things to do are:, Fire off a bullet from your left pistol in akimbo pistols. Run and reload at the same time. If done correctly, your right gun will do the running animation, while your left will reload., Have your secondary out. Sprint, and press Y, and when your gun appears, stop running and hit ""Y"" again. This should give your sniper the same appearance as swapping, but you are able to shoot much faster, Use a pistol with a tactical knife. Have a sniper out, then run and press ""Y"" at the same time. Stop running and immediately press ""Y"" twice. If done correctly, your knife will do a flip., When in the air, blackscope with your sniper, and quickly press ""Y"" twice., Throw your care package near the edge of where you want to jump off. If it lands in a place accessible from the air, press ""X"" and access it, then cancel it with ""Y"" to continue trickshotting., Have a blast shield as your lethal. As you go for your shot, put it on, and optionally take it off. This will make your killcam have a black border around it, and possibly then removed., Have a SPAS-12, M1014, or striker as your secondary. Sprint and press ""Y"" or triangle. When your shotgun is no longer visible on the screen, stop sprinting and press ""Y"" twice quickly. Your gun will appear to twist in your hands., Start with a class that has One Man Army. Switch to your trickshotting class, and when you are about three fourths the way done switching, jump off and shoot when your gun pulls out., Have a pistol with a tactical knife as your attachment. Tap sprint and quickly press ""Y"" twice., Shoot your right gun at least once. Sprint and press reload at the same time. Now walk backwards. This effect is similar to the wrist twist, but you do not need to keep running for it to stay., Have a Righty Tighty, then lay down. Hold the shoot button, the reload button, and wiggle the left stick at the same time. This will make your right pistol appear to be fully automatic., Sprint and spin the right. As you finish sprinting, black scope and then reload. This looks the best if done with a heartbeat sensor., Lightly stun yourself, and preferably your target for best results. You won't notice a difference when you go for a shot, but when the killcam shows, your gun will twist in impossible ways., This is extremely hard to do, even if your crosshairs are right on the person, there is no guarantee you will hit them., There is a lot of room for customization here. The only thing that you really need is the L96A1 or the PSG1 as a sniper. The rest is up to you., Some of the better maps for this are

WMD






Nuketown






Launch






Firing range
Array
summit

, Have the China Lake as your secondary. This gun is unique as it does an animation for every time you pull it out. Pull this out before you do your trickshot and then switch back to do the animation., Have a pistol, preferably the Python or ASP. Simply pull it out, shoot it, and then switch back., Have a stakeout then press shoot, switch weapon, reload., Press triangle/y just before the clip goes into gun.(different timings), Pull out your tactical insertion, start to use it and then cancel, switching to your primary., Silent shot with your weapon, then switch weapons 3 times in rapid succession. Immediately afterword dolphin dive while holding the shoot button, and your gun should be stuck in the diving animation, Either use the L8A1 or the MSR with impact and either heartbeat or extended magazines on them. You want Dead Silence Pro so you don't take damage when falling and Sleight of Hand Pro to switch weapons faster., Some of the better maps are

Terminal






Dome






Mission

, If you want to go for something a bit harder, this Call of Duty opens up a whole new trick, ladder stalls. Simply jump off somewhere with a ladder, grab on to the ladder and jump off again., This is the same as in MW2, simply get any akimbo pistol, and shoot a few bullets from the left gun. Then, reload and run at the same time. This will cause your character to appear to run with your right pistol and reload with your left one., You must have claymore as your lethal. Before jumping, press your lethal button then quickly press ""Y"". If done correctly, this will make the claymore jump up on the screen, and then immediately go for your shot., Throw down your ballistic vests where you want to jump off of. Press ""X"" to access it and cancel with ""Y""., Lightweight and Fast Hands are a must for trickshotting, and Dexterity is definitely a plus, although not entirely needed. Your secondary weapon will be included with the individual shots., These maps include:

Nuketown 2025






Carrier






Standoff
Vertigo
Studio

, This is where you quickly swap to a weapon by cancelling a tactical, often used in conjunction with other shots. Press ""Y"" and then use a tactical. Cancel this by quickly pressing ""Y"" and your next gun will be out. You can do this twice in a row to go back to your sniper too., Put a submachine gun or assault rifle with select fire as your secondary with overkill for this one. Have your submachine gun or assault rifle on automatic with the select fire attachment. As you are jumping, chance the fire rate to burst fire, and press the ""Y"" button quickly. This does not work if you start it on burst fire, as it will not show in the killcam.

Constrict's Variant. Do a canc swap with your gun that has a select fire on it. As soon as you pull out the gun, press select fire and switch. Immediately after this, insta-swap back to your other gun. This should cause the weapon to appear to be pulled out for the first time.

, Have either the KSG or the Remington shotguns. Shoot them and then switch to your sniper. When you are ready to go for the shot, switch to your shotgun and it will pump back, then switch back to your sniper., Take an assault rifle with a grenade launcher on it. Press over on the D-pad to pull it out. Shoot out the grenade and when your guy is putting the grenade back in, switch to your gun and then your sniper., Have a Ballista as your secondary. Fire off one bullet and switch to your primary. When you switch to your Ballista, the animation will play as if you were pulling back the mag. Zoom in with the Ballista and switch for maximum effect., Fire off a bullet in your sniper. Knife the air, and when your gun comes back up, reload and zoom in at the same time. This should make your sniper look like it is both reloading, and zooming in at the same time. Note that this does not appear in a killcam, only in your perspective., Plant your assault shield and don't switch to your secondary. When you go for your shot, your knife will flip in the air., Have a killstreak of either the Hunter Killer Drone or the care package. While in air, press the fire button to start activating your killstreak, but press ""Y"" when you are about to release it., Have an assault rifle with a hybrid sight on it.

, Have the M1216 as your secondary. Shot off four rounds, and as you are twisting the barrel, quickly switch to your next gun. When going for the shot, switch to that, and it will show you twisting it., When switching back to your sniper, press ""y"" and then pull out a killstreak. The sniper should appear to ""bounce"" in your hands. This will not appear on your screen but will show in killcam. This only works with certain animations, such as a weapon swap, c4, or select fire. This will not work with things like shock charges., The L115 has the highest damage in the game, so using it will probably benefit you the most, however the USR and the Lynx are both close runners-up, so either of those are viable options as well. You may want to consider using armor piercing and chrome lined attachments as they increase damage. You are going to most likely want akimbo M9A1 pistols, as this shot is the most commonly gone for, however more shots will be explained later in the steps. You need Reflex, Steady Aim, and Resilience as your perks, as they greatly help., Commonly rooty-tooty point-n-shooty maps include

Stormfront
Octane
Warhawk

When you go for the shot, hold ""X"" and access the item. Right before you take the item, press ""Y""., Have a MORS, preferably with a prefix such as the Pummeler, Silver bullet, or Doctor. Use the Exo Shield, Fast Hands, and spike drones. If you do not have spike drones unlocked, explosive drones also work.

Then cancel that and your sniper should be out., Executed exactly like the shield swap, pull it out after shooting and quickly cancel it., Swap out your exo shield for the hover ability.

Become a more attentive player.,
Watch live streams or videos of skilled players.,
Complete in-game challenges.,
Play the game a lot.,
Reach the maximum level.,
Decide if you really want to Prestige.,
Enter Prestige Mode.,
Go for the “Grand Master Prestige” title (Advanced Warfare).",How to Successfully Prestige in Call of Duty," The better you are at the game, the faster you will be able to attain experience, so that you have the option of entering Prestige Mode. Paying attention to all of the game’s indicators is extremely important.


Learn to use your UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) radar effectively. UAV radar is a visual aid that will assist you in both finding enemies on the map as well as knowing the position of your allies, which is equally important. It’s located at the top right of your game interface.
The most popular game mode in Call of Duty is Team Deathmatch. In this mode players are constantly respawning after being killed. The game always tries to spawn players as far away from enemies as possible. Paying close attention to the UAV radar will help you to deduce where your enemies are spawning.
In other game modes such as “Search and Destroy,” players only spawn once per round, rendering the UAV radar less effective.;
, By studying players who have mastered the game, you will be able to better understand how you can improve your own skills.


You can watch live streams on Twitch TV or videos that have been uploaded to YouTube.

, In Call of Duty, there are both static and daily challenges that you can complete for extra experience. Doing these challenges will allow you to level up faster. Some such challenges include:


Obtaining and using killstreaks/pointstreaks. You obtain these special abilities by getting several kills in a row without being killed yourself.
Using specific equipment and getting kills with them. There are many different choices for personal equipment ranging from mines, to claymores, to a throwing knife.
Maintain a good kill/death ratio. If you end the game having a kill/death ratio of 5:1+ or 3:1+, you will gain extra experience.
You can peruse a challenge list in-game from within the Barracks menu, which is located right under the Create a Class/Find a Game menus.

, The old adage holds true - practice really does make perfect. If you want to be able to Prestige and Prestige often, you’re going to have to put a lot of effort into the game.


Play with friends. Time will really fly by if you team up with buddies.
Play all of the different game modes available to you until you find which one you enjoy the most.
Make sure not to overdo it. Sometimes you will get into a rut and won’t be able to get many kills or you’ll make silly mistakes. Take a break and then return fresh. That downtime might actually lead to a faster leveling process overall.

, To be able to Prestige you must always finish leveling. After you’ve hit the maximum level, you will have the choice if you want to Prestige or not. If you choose not to Prestige immediately, you can always do so at any time in the future.


In Modern Warfare 3, you will need to reach Level 80, which amounts to 1,746,200 XP (experience points).
In Black Ops II, you will need to reach Level 55, which amounts to 1,249,100 XP.
In Ghosts, you will need to reach Level 60 plus an additional 60,000 XP, which amounts to 1,229,500 XP.
In Advanced Warfare, you will need to reach Level 50, which amounts to 1,002,100 XP.

, Choosing to enter Prestige Mode has both its benefits and its disadvantages, so it is important to understand what you’re committing to before you Prestige. You cannot undo Prestiging.


Each time you Prestige, you will lose all of your weapons and unlocks, which will make the game more difficult for you in the short-term.
You will gain a “Create a Class” slot which allows you to customize an extra equipment loadout.
You will gain the ability to unlock extra goodies such as titles and emblems. These are cosmetic benefits, but do show other players that you aren’t to be messed with.

, You can enter Prestige Mode easily by accessing the “Barracks” in game. It is a menu just below Create a Class / Find a Game.


You will be issued a final warning telling you what you will lose when you Prestige and that your decision is final.
Once you confirm your Prestige, your player icon will change immediately to represent your newfound awesomeness and you will be lowered to Level 1.

, In Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, upon reaching max level on your 15th Prestige, you will have the ability to enter “Master Prestige” mode. In this mode, each level will grant you a new weapon that was previously not unlockable.

Understand how the weapon works.,
Track moving targets.,
Avoid using continuous fire.,
Never underestimate the range of the Primary Strike.,
Become acclimated with aiming the pointer at crucial places on different maps.",How to Use the Hammer of Dawn in Gears of War 2," The hammer of dawn is an orbital laser which decimates anything which it hits instantly. Used well, it is very easy to rack up multi-kills on enemies, particularly when you have the element of surprise. However, the laser has a rather slow charge up time and an even slower re-charge time. If you fire the laser and miss, it will take about 6 'beeps' for the laser to re-charge and for you to use it again. keep that in mind and make every shot count.;
, This means that you should keep the weapon trained on your hapless victim constantly while you are charging it up. Do not try to anticipate where they WILL be once the weapon is charged. The opponent will see the pointer on the ground in front of them and dart into cover.

, This only serves to waste the laser ammunition and is not very lethal compared to the devastating primary strike, where the laser first hits the ground. It is much better to only fire the laser for a millisecond then release the fire button. This maximizes your lethality and the amount of shots you will have.

, The enemy does not have to be directly below the laser when it hits the ground to score a kill; in fact, the laser is lethal for a range of about 4 meters (13.1 ft) around the initial strike. You can use this very useful property of the hammer of dawn to kill people inside buildings or beneath cover, albeit only if they are not very deep within buildings or cover(see step 5). Also, understand that you do not have to aim at a floor in order to fire the laser. the pointer can also be used on walls and is particularly useful on parts of a wall that 'jut out' because this allows the user to fire the laser in places where a horizontal plane is not available and hence hit smug enemies who think they are safe from the hammer's mighty blow!

, Two maps where the hammer of dawn has a large impact on gameplay are Day One and Jacinto. On Day One, enemies will usually hide under the neon strips on the walkway, sniper-side. Normally the hammer of dawn cannot reach them there as the neon strips form an overhang on top of the players, giving them the illusion of protection. However, when aimed at one of the two 'jutting out' bits on the left and right side of this overhang, the Hammer will obliterate anyone hiding under the strips. It is useful to play private matches to identify these 'jutting out' parts of the overhang. On Jacinto, popular camping places for both teams are the grenade rooms on opposite sides of the map, and normally it can be very hard to kill anyone holed up in the rooms, as veterans of the gametype Guardian will tell you! However the cowards in the rooms are not completely safe from the Hammer of Dawn, which, when fired at the area just outside the room, will usually kill anyone inside, unless they are pushed far back into the wall. While it is possible to aim at the floor outside the room, it is much easier for Novice players to aim at the tiny triangular overhang right above the doorway . Fire the laser there and you'll soon be reaping the rewards!

However, it may be advisable to view this Easter egg while playing in a player or local match, rather in a ranked multiplayer game, as other players may get annoyed if you are not trying to play and win.;
, On side of Rooftops is far darker than the other; this is the side you want to be on.

, You should be facing away from the centre of the map, towards a damaged, multi-level building on the outside of the level.

, There will be one undamaged window, with two broken windows on either side; the Toilet Easter Egg is behind the unbroken window.

, Using the Smoke grenade is far easier than viewing the Easter egg with the Hammer of Dawn, although it won't light up the area as much for you to see.

, Or alternatively, aim and fire the Hammer of Dawn at the middle window until it lights the room inside up.

, There will be a giant dead body sitting on the toilet by the middle window. This is the Toilet Easter Egg.

Revive your teammate if they're dead!,
Know the levels that you are playing.",How to Play Gears of War Multiplayer," The last thing you want is a sniper hitting you in the face. Always have cover available within a few feet in case someone begins unloading in your direction. It's a good idea to blind fire from cover when someone is rushing you. This should kill them without exposing yourself. However, it is important to know which cover offers you the most protection, as many of the sandbags do not protect you from getting shot in most cases.;
, Go as fast as you can to the big guns on the map. Getting them is a huge advantage in most cases. Watch out for the opposite team. They could have the same idea.

, Talk with your teammates. Tell them where you are going and try to come up with a plan. Always designate one person to watch the rear. Try to outmaneuver your opponent with pincer moves and flanking.

, This is a great way not to end up with a cap in your back. Roll away and to the sides of incoming fire. A strategy that the best players employ is wall bouncing, in which you try to use the cover system to your advantage by jumping on and off cover objects, while shooting your opponent. This makes it extremely difficult for your opponent to get a good shot on you, especially if you have taken any damage and need to recuperate.

,, Only use it if you are surprising someone.

, Sometimes if you shoot your enemy in the stomach, it will down them, but don't depend on that. Most of the time if you hit anywhere other then the head your target will just roll into cover and regenerate their health. A good tip for sniping heads, especially if your target is moving, is to aim the reticule where you think your opponents' head will be, then waiting for the reticule to turn red and remove the players' dome. Also remember that there is bullet lag so in this case shoot your sniper and see how much time it takes for the bullet to the wall and then when you see an enemy you shoot ahead of them also in the area of where the head is going to be and shoot then the target should run right into the bullet.

, Melee with an equipped frag to ""tag"" someone. They will then blow up. Don't forget to dive out of the way so you don't die with them! In terms of throwing the grenades, they can be very effective if the proper tactics are used. For example, if your enemy is taking cover behind a truck, throw a grenade on either side so the only option for him is to roll forward, right into the arms of your loving shotgun. Grenades that are thrown, but not close enough to your enemy for them to explode, will sometimes stun them, giving you an ample opportunity for the kill.

, Better bullets give you an advantage over other people if they do not have the active reload.

, Aim at the head, and you can get a headshot. But when things get up close, it is a very effective melee weapon! Melee someone twice and they will drop to their knees. Don't forget that after you melee someone, there's a split second that they won't be able to shoot. Usually the pistol is most effective at mid to close range.

, Just stop what you are doing and help your teammate. Not only will they be very thankful, but they also might return the favor in a later round.

, It may seem obvious, but knowing where every single weapon is definitely gives you an advantage over those who don't.

, If you are not good, and rush in first, you will probably clash with about three enemies and probably die.

,


Once everything's up close, whip out your shotgun. Instead of holding LB to aim, quickly tap it before each shot to increase your accuracy. If you are close enough to melee someone you can also blow them up.
Use your chainsaw to take your enemy by surprise. Don't do it if there are 2 enemies, only do it to 1.
If you want to kill people fast and easy, use the grenade tag; just press B near someone while holding one, try to flank them or do it, and if 1 or more enemies are coming at once, roll a frag at them.
Use the Snub pistol. It is a very effective melee weapon and it is also more powerful than the Lancer. When using it, remember to quickly tap the right trigger to shoot faster.
The boomshot can be a very effective weapon, but sometimes rubbish, you must have a little practise with it first before you start blowing people to bits, When everybody is grouped up killing each other with shotguns, fire in the boomshot, you can rack up many kills doing this.
Sniping can be hard, but also very effective, if you are the last person on the team and you are facing the enemies last person, active reload, and if you get it perfect, you can down your enemies in 1 shot.Aim for the head, you will blow them away if you get it perfect and be chuffed with yourself.

,,(when weapons are swapped you won't know where to go for certain weapons so get good with all the weapons)

, Move your team to all the other weapons to prepare for the next Annex Switch and gain the upper hand.


Never trade your shotgun for another weapon. Your shotgun is vital for close range kills. Never try to shotgun someone from far away. Also, never try to chainsaw someone from far away. Things like this are laughed upon.

, Try to run away, because you will easily get away as a meatshield makes you walk very slowly. He will eventually drop it and chase after you. Remember most pistols on Gears are very powerful and effective, Most chances are that when you get close to the meatshield you will have been punched and shot to death.

Aiming with the shotgun is sometimes good.Sometimes firing from the hip is better. This way, you can move and turn whilst fighting your opponent. If they come too close hold (yes, HOLD) B button to hit them twice. If you don't hold down B, the second melee will not hit. Active reloads are your best friend with this weapon. Beware, against the host you are likely to lose unless you are extremely skilled, as the host can shoot you before you could shoot him. It IS possible to head shot with the shotgun.;
, The lancer is the main weapon of the game learning to utilise it efficiently is important. With the latest update, the Lancers power was increased, in order to make Gears of War a more tactical based game instead of a shotgun party. It takes precisely 15 shots to the body to down with a lancer, 10 to the head. with active, it becomes 8 shots to the body and 6 shots to the head. Chainsawing is an easy instant kill if you know how to use it. If someone is coming towards you, tap B, not rapidly but don't hold it down for too long, this way you're less likely to get stunned and killed. Pressing the right trigger whilst holding B will give your chainsaw priority over anyone else's, and if you moving towards your target you're more likely to chainsaw them than they are you. Obviously getting shot whilst revving is a bad situation, so use chainsaw sparingly.

, The snub pistol can be a last-resort weapon or it could be a preferred weapon, depending on your skill with it. 7 shots to the head will be a headshot, 4 with active. The pistol will shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger. 2 Shots and 1 melee will down; or 2 melees will down. If you're feeling lucky, go for the shot-melee-shot and maybe, just maybe, you'll land a headshot.

, The long shot can take skill, or be exceedingly noobish depending on the way its used. Headshots take skill and practise. Get used to lag, it could spare you some ammo if you hit them first try. Active reloads with the sniper are SHAMEFULLY strong. one shot to the chest (or the legs if shooting a Theron guard/sentinel, or General RAAM, they appeared to be glitched in this way.) The longshot is a key weapon to master.

, The Torque bow is exceedingly powerful, with one hit kills, but off host landing a moving target is slightly more difficult than on host. An active reload will decrease the time it takes to tense the bow, meaning the arc will straighten much quicker, but the time allowed to take your shot is decreased greatly. The torque bow is the only weapon to have a downside with the active reload. The torque bow will not kill unless it hits, or is an active at someones feet. It is possible, but exceedingly difficult, to stick opponents without the arc being straight. Once the arrow has hit a wall, it can bounce and stick into an opponent as well as a fully straightened arc. This weapon can shoot round corner. The arrows power increases when it hits an enemy, and any enemies nearby will likely suffer the same fate as the target.

, The boom shot is seen as a ""noob"" weapon. Direct hits will increase power of the boom. Hitting the floor near an enemy may result in the enemy being downed, with an active the enemy could die. The boom shot is similar to a grenade launcher, in that without an active reload its line of fire is arced, making it possible to shoot over objects. With active, it turns into a sort of rocket launcher and shoots in a much more straight line. Active reload will also increase blast radius as well as damage.

, Grenades are possibly your best friend, again depending on your skill. Grenades can be bounced round corners, blind thrown in case of emergencies, aimed for a more accurate throw (and somewhat further). Meleeing with a grenade equipped is known as a tag, and will eliminate the enemy and any enemies (or anyone else) nearby. However, if the enemy gets downed just before the grenade goes off, he will not die and it is likely that the downer will die fro the explosion. Friendly fire is not advised when using grenades.

, Similar to the Snub pistol, only much more powerful and much slower to shoot. Off host it can be difficult to hit your target. 1 Shot and 1 melee will down, but a melee-shot is more likely to produce a headshot. 2 Shots to the body will down, and a Boltok kill will result in a nice, Gibby kill if not an execution. 2 Shots to the head will result in a headshot kill. Getting an active reload will not change this.

, The hammer-burst is a greatly underestimated weapon. When the fire button is held down, it is devastating if the shots hit. 1 Burst and 1 melee will down. You cannot headshot with the Hammerburst. With active reload is is almost impossible to stop. Be careful when facing a Hammerburst-adept user, they can kill very easily if you don't be careful.

, The HOD is a very, very powerful orbital beam cannon. Due to its strength, its melee has been toned down to 3 instead of 2 hits to down. The moment it hits the ground is the most powerful part, totally destroying anything nearby, and is nearly impossible to get away from. Staying under an HoD beam will kill you in less than a second. Be very careful using it at close range for obvious reason. Not a good choice if friendly fire is enabled. HoD users are vulnerable to snipers, as they have to expose themselves from cover to use.

, An effective visual blockade to aid you and your allies in getting power weapons. Blind snipers often miss. Smoke tagging is generally a bad idea, but funny if pulled off. On rooftops, people will often smoke out the torque bow. If this happens, get to the torque bow and chainsaw the enemy that picks it up before the animation if over.

, The troika on war machine is often unused, however it is extremely powerful and quick to kill. Be warned, however, a half decent sniper could headshot the troika user very easily. It can fire indefinitely and will not run out of ammunition.

Set up a game (Provided you actually have a copy of the game), preferably on Chieftain (the easiest level) if you are a beginner.,
Begin your game.,
Become familiar with your civilization's advisers.,
Explore with your scout (Presuming you have picked one of the above civilizations who have this feature).,
Focus on your capital.,
Discover new technologies by consulting your scientific adviser.,
Build Wonders.,
Keep the settler chain going.,
Be diplomatic to your rivals, as it would be disaster to set off a war so early in the game.,
Build workers, as they will really win you the game.,
Be careful about civil disorder!,
Progress forward.,
Enter into the Medieval Age.,
Begin waging war on your rivals.,
Continue to research and control your civilization.,
Gain stability with rivals.",How to Win at Civilization 3," This way you can work up to the harder levels as you progress over time. Set up the game with around 4-6 other nations to compete against; this way it is easier to have diplomatic victories, alliances and trading. In addition to this, the only other setting which you should be aware of is the set up of the world (Either Gondwanaland, Continents or Islands). Choosing Gondwanaland or Continents is preferable, because with the Islands you will have to master seafaring and ocean voyages, which is a lot harder than simple land movement. You will also have to choose which nation you want to play. Although all races can be played and should be able to win with this strategy, the Americans are the best. They have both the Industrious rule (Their workers work at double speed for half the game) and the Expansionist rule (A free scout at the beginning of the game). Other good nations are the English, Iroquois, Russians and Zulus, who all have similar features. The Germans are also good because they are scientific, so technology can be learned better. They are also industrious, and they have a good special unit to replace the tank.;
, Your first task will be to set up your capital. Usually this will be in a perfect spot, but occasionally moving a few squares over is better. Never use your settler to explore any tribal encampments, as they may contain barbarians and the settler will have no defence.

, They can be accessed in the top left corner of the screen and will give you information on your trade, military, diplomatic, scientific and cultural achievements and statistics. The game is turn based, so don't worry about spending lots of time looking through this feature (And possibly the Civilopedia, which gives help about all the game's terms, improvements and units). You should have around 50-60% of your income going towards science (You can boost this to 70% when you want to get a new technology quickly) and always have 0% luxury as city improvements coupled with Wonders take care of your people's happiness. At the moment, your government will be a Despotic state, but you'll change that shortly.

, He can be used to explore future territories, contact rivals and most importantly, explore encampments. This is very important - villages give you wealth, technology, warriors and maps. To win, you must have explored quite a few encampments. By the end of the opening stages of the game, you should have at least found a few extra warriors, some technology, maps and a bit of gold.

, The first thing you should do is focus on troops to defend your capital. After you've done this, you need to build a settler, as you'll have some major projects up ahead which you'll need your capital for. Once you've built your settler, get it to build a city nearby (You should have explored a bit already and know the good places to settle) and your capital is now free to build Wonders. This second city will in effect be a sister city and should build a couple of workers, maybe a couple of warriors and finally, another settler to send off and repeat the cycle so that it too will be able to focus on Wonders and building improvements.

, Make a bee-line for writing and literature; this gives you access to the Great Library which is great for further technology advances (See later). If you don't already have it, get Bronze Working. This gives you access to Spearmen, which are the best defenders in this early stage of the game; you only really need one per city unlike warriors who are better on the attack. Although not necessarily the most needed technologies, Iron Working and The Wheel make iron ore and horses appear on the map respectively, and this might be helpful when deciding where to build future cities (Iron is a major resource and should be acquired at whatever the cost). This is the start of a solid beginning; these technologies are key, although you can go for others if you like.

, By now, you should have the technology that allows you to build the Pyramids and possibly the Colossus. Don't worry about the Colossus just yet, as rivals don't build it until much later and you probably won't have a sea-side city yet. However, start building the Pyramids straight away! As soon as your capital has built its settler mentioned earlier, begin building the Pyramids. This Wonder is key because it gives you a granary in every city on the continent, saving you the time building one. In addition to this, the Pyramids are never made obsolete by any technology, so this feature will run through the whole game. If you build it, you may never even know that you could build granaries as they will be automatically built for you. After this Wonder, your capital should possibly build a city improvement and possibly another settler before undertaking another Wonder task. If you've played your cards right, you should have the technology to build the Great Library. This Wonder gives you a technology every time two other civilizations have discovered it. This means you'll always be technologically advanced and will keep up with your rivals (Although really you should be the one setting the pace). There's also the Oracle, which is great and the the Colossus. Usually, the Colussus will trigger off a Golden Age for your civilization because it has that effect on the nations listed above. After you've completed these opening Wonders, you can relax for a while and simply build one whenever it pops up.

, This means that every time you build a city, after you've built some troops to occupy it you should then build another settler. Then repeat the process. Build cities where ever there's a good resource or a key feature. Don't build a city too far away from the rest and never build close to your opponents unless you want to stop their cities advancing onto your territory. The ideal city should have access to irrigation, lots of open plains or grassland, possibly some source of shields (Either forests or hills), some resources such as wheat or cattle and have no flood plains or jungle, as this will spread disease throughout your city. Remember, number of cities really does affect your rating and how successful you are - if you have a chance to build a settler, do it.

, If you have enough cities, you should be able to get out of paying tribute to others as they will be too scared to declare war on you. Become firm friends with one rival leader; you will need them in the future during wars and to trade with. However, don't pick the largest nation to be your ally and definitely don't pick the weakest nation - pick a race in between the two and if you can't decide, pick the one closest to your own nation as it will act as a buffer zone when you both declare war on someone due to some alliance.

, American workers work at double speed for the earlier half of the game, so you'll be able to get your civilization set up quickly if you choose them. You will need at least one or two per city and a few roving around to connect roads. Make sure all cities are connected for trade purposes and sometimes automate them (Keep in mind that automated workers DO save you some time and will mostly do good things but don't trust them to make railroads for you) . When developing city areas with your workers, keep in mind that their improvements really do help the city's production. Every city terrain square should have a road for commerce, all plains or grassland squares should have irrigation if it can be accessed there and all hills or mountains should have a mine on it for shield production. If there is a lot of forest in the area, cut some of it down; around two or three forest squares is great if the majority is grassland.

, This can stump a cities growth, usually by overpopulation. If you can try to make settlers and workers to keep the anger low.

, Yes, you should be doing great by now and should have made it a bit further both technologically and culturally. Make a bee-line for Monarchy so that you can change your government from Despotism, as Monarchy is one of the best forms of government and provides a wide range of features and less hindrances. For city improvements, you should avoid building coliseums until much later, instead focusing on courthouses, temples, market places and libraries. It really helps to expand your territory by advancing your culture levels, so keep building those Wonders!

, Now here's where the fun begins. Immediately get your scientists to begin researching technologies such as Invention (Leonardo's Workshop really helps get your military up to scratch) and especially the technology of Chivalry. Chivalry is key to winning the game; it gives you access to knights which are hands down, the best unit for a while. As soon as you have access to knights, build as many of them as you can and feel free to declare war on a rival. Try not to pick one close to you if it has cities on numerous sides of your borders.

, Sometimes this can escalate into world wars with several alliances and treaties coming into play - this is good, and alliances like the one you have begun from earlier on should help. To begin a campaign with your troops into enemy territory, first you need to plan out an attack. You can choose from a number of options, but having a two or three-pronged attack works best, attacking from different places simultaneously with your knights. For a standard, two-prong attack, split your knights into three groups: The first group should comprise of at least 3 or more - these will be placed at various points around your vulnerable border areas to intercept a counter strike and will save your troops having to march back to save your cities. The second group should, say, go to the north and comprise of at least 10 or more knights while the second should go as far away as possible, to say, the south. Although around three knights can overcome a small city, having larger groups means some can stay behind and quell resistors and the rest can march on. All this while, back up knights should be coming from your cities. As soon as you capture a city, place a couple of knights in it and wait for the resistance to end. Then buy a spearman and move your knights along. Repeat this process until the enemy is gone and repeat again on another enemy. This tactic diminishes somewhat when your enemy discovers gunpowder, so although you can't control that, capture their supplies of saltpeter if they have any so that they cannot build musketmen.

, Learn technologies such as Economics, as it gives you access to the Smith's Trading Company Wonder which pays for all income related improvement upkeep, which is very handy. Smaller wonders such as Wall Street are good too as that gives you up to 50 gold in interest from your treasury. If you build these, you should have lots of money left over and can begin to build improvements such as Cathedrals and Colosseums which require a bit of upkeep costs. Lay off discovering Education, as this makes the Great Library obsolete, but by now you should be pretty advanced. Sanitation and Steam Power are great technologies; railroads are great for quickly deploying troops, but you'll need iron and coal. You must also make sure that you reach the future tech as this will give you a great advantage over your rivals.

, By now you should have eliminated a few rivals and the rest should be in awe of you. If you've built as many improvements and Wonders as explained, your cultural levels should make some enemy cities defect to your nation. You can now trade strategic resources with them, such as coal or iron and really ask for a high price. This will give you even more money and with this excess money, you can buy city improvements and advance your cities quite quickly. You don't even need to master building ships or flight, as by now you should be at the top of the leader's board. It is very difficult to reach the later technologies before the game makes you retire automatically, but you can continue playing afterward. This does not add to your final score however. Now you can do whatever you want. Congratulations, you've just won Civilization 3!

Select a civilization that reflects your playing style.,
Start the Game!

,
Move your settler to an optimal capital city starting position.,
Explore.,
If you manage to find an enemy capital before 2500BC, form an army (this is where multiple warriors comes in handy) and attack.,
Try to build a ship as fast as possible, to get an early advantage.,
it may be useful having two ships exploring different directions from your capital.,
in case of barbarian villages on islands.

,
Research with a strategy in mind.,
Use your settler.,
Build up as a Republic.,
Either build a library or a trading post in each city.,
After the library/trading post/market is built, take advantage of the surrounding tiles and build additional buildings to increase your cities overall food, production, science and or culture.

,
Switch strategies once you have a solid tech lead.,
Work towards victory.",How to Win Civilization Revolution," Ask yourself: Does this civil excel at the victory type I'm going for? Can I exploit my Civils in game bonuses?;
,, This should be a location with 4+ food, 4+ production (hammers), and 4+ trade. The good place to play should be a city surrounded by 2 grasslands, 3 forest, and 2 sea tiles.


Look for: Be on the lookout for rivers and resource tiles, these can provide a ton of extra food ,production, and trade. Any opposing civilization that attacks from across a river has it's attack power slashed by 50%.
Avoid: Likewise you should settling adjacent to mountains, and hills, unless the hill contains iron (with early technology iron-working this gives you a hefty production boost), or if the mountains contain gold, or gems(both of which give you, well, gold). However settling on a hill is very good, as it gives your city a much improved line of sight and adds a whooping +50% attack and defensive bonus to units stationed inside. However settling next to a hill gives the enemies a +50% attack bonus when attacking from that hill. An optimal city location would be a hill surrounded on multiple sides by rivers. This forces enemies to attack across a river and also up a hill! (-50% attack for them, +50% defense for you!)

, Now that you have your first city up and running, produce 2-3 warriors to explore the map, you may need more depending on the game mode and/or difficulty, and discover new landmarks, friendly villages, and of course destroying any barbarian village in your way. After a successful attack on a barbarian village, they may grant you with a number of useful bonuses such as gold, technology, units (getting a galley from a barbarian village is a huge boost to your civilization as you can now explore new lands and hunt for artifacts without taking the time from your city to produce one.)

, If you're successful than congrats, you now have another useful village to use and exploit, and you are one step closer to winning a domination victory!

, This allows you to search the islands in the ocean for artifacts and get them before the other civilizations find them. If you were lucky enough to obtain a ship from a friendly village or conquered barbarian village, you may skip this step, however,, This doubles your chances of being the first to discover any artifacts. It may also be helpful to bring a couple warriors,,, Many techs grant you a bonus for being the first to research them, this bonus may include gold, culture or science bonuses for your cities, even Great People! Being the first to discover a military oriented technology will always grant you one free unit of that technology. (ex: being the first to research gunpowder would grant you a rifleman unit in your capital city.) After a few turns a message will pop up asking you what to research next.

This will put you towards the front of the tech race and directly leads to mathematics (being able to make catapults-handy!). Additionally, Alphabet grants you the ability to build libraries (build this ASAP as it gives you x2 science in that city), Writing gives you a free spy, and the ability to build them, and reaching Literacy first gives you +1 science in each city.
Choose Bronze working>>Iron working, if you want to focus on a balanced military. Bronze working grants you archers and the great wonder Colossus of Rhodes which grants you double trade within the city turning your city into a scientific powerhouse, combined with a library you will far out tech other civilizations in the early and mid game. Bronze Working also grants you barracks (upgrades units to veterans with +50% attack and defense). A barracks plus a Great Leader grants them immediate Elite status, allowing you to build highly specialized armies. Ironworking gives you legions and the ability to work with the iron resource. Unless you see any iron lying around, you may want to skip this and research Alphabet instead.

, By now you should have around 100 gold, which gives you a free settler so decide what type of city you want and place it in the appropriate place.


If you want a Balanced city: Settle in a place with plenty of easy access to food, trade, and production and if possible next to resources and rivers. These cities are versatile and a good choice for any Civ player. Avoid building too close to your capital city, as in the latter stages of the game, close proximity causes them to compete for resources. It's best to build 5-7 tiles away from your capital, as once a courthouse is built, they won't have to compete for shared resources, and the distance is still small enough that a decent culture can close up the gap with a territory border, preventing unwanted foreign armies from marching through your lands.
If you want a Trade Oriented City: Settle your city near 4 or more sea tiles (giving you 8 or more trade) and next to 4 or more food. Then rush or build libraries or markets in the city to double your science or gold. With 8+ trade and a market or a library these cites give you a solid 16 gold or science, every turn. This increases to 24 if you have democracy. Be on the lookout for unique resources for your new city. Building next to a sulfur pool may seem counterproductive in the short run, but building beside it still utilizes the resource below the pool, and guarantees no other civilization will come along and build beside it in the meantime. Once gunpowder is researched, your city can start utilizing the sulfur, granting them +3 production, as well as whatever other buildings and bonuses are in play.
Hills/Production Cities: This type of city is not recommend to be built in the early game but effective in the mid to late game. After you have researched Bronze Working and Iron Working you want to select a location that has access to at least 2 grasslands (or 1 grassland and resource that provides food) and is adjacent to a couple of hills(keep it well guarded as enemies GAIN +50% attack from hills. Next research Construction to gain a free workshop(which provides +2 production to hills) and after that immediately start building a barracks to begin your offensive push to capture enemy cities.
Alternatively in the late game, when you have researched railroad in you can settle a city next to a mountain range and rush a mine, then build a factory. Now If you city has 3 mountain tiles (each at 1 production, 3 total) followed by an iron mine (now each at 5 production, 15 total) multiplied by a factory (15x2) gives you an amazing 30 production per turn, or 45 if your using the Americans or communism, or 67 if you're using both! Now you can unleash dozens of armies into the world or build wonder after wonder.

, After you have your second city up, research Code of Laws, switch to Republic and start building more cities and expanding your empire. A good strategy would be to immediately build a settler in your new city and use that settler to build another city.

, This is allows you to stay ahead in the tech race which awards you bonuses for being the first to research the tech. Notable tech bonuses are Irrigation(+1 pop to every city), Industrialization (+5 gold to every city), and Corporation (+5 gold to every city). Building markets allows you to have increased gold production (X2), which can be used to rush building and units, build roads, or can be saved up for an economic victory.

,, Start to focus on a research path that best allows you to begin capturing enemy cities.


Choose Masonry>>Writing>>Mathematics, to unlock catapults and begin an early game siege. Catapults have 4 attack and are useful against early game archer armies.
Choose Monarchy>>Feudalism>>Religion, to unlock knights and fundamentalism. Knights also have 4 attack but can move 2 spaces making them highly mobile units. Fundamentalism provides +1 attack to every unit causing you knight armies to have 15 attack, however it negates the science bonus from libraries and universities.
Choose Iron Working>>University>>Metallurgy>>Steam Power>>Combustion, to unlock cannons and tanks. Cannons (unlocked by Metallurgy) are a powerful mid to late game unit that has 6 whopping attack and Tanks are an extremely powerful late game unit that has 10 attack and 2 movement. These should comprise the majority of your modern army.

, After capturing the majority of enemy cities you should have enough resources to begin working towards your chosen victory type. Whether you choose the path of world domination, economic dominance, cultural victory, or bringing your people into the new world of alpha centauri the rest is up to you.

CPU: Intel Core i5 680 3.6GHz or AMD Equivalent Processor
RAM: 8 GB
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 4GB or AMD Radeon Equivalent Graphic Card

;
, The problem with playing in minimum system requirements is that sometimes you will still encounter errors as if your system does not reach the minimum requirements. Here is how you will solve these errors.


Try installing .Net Framework, Microsoft Visual C++, Direct X, and NVIDIA Physics
Check if you have the latest drivers in your system. If not, update the outdated ones.
Don’t overlock your system. Better yet, run your system at its factory settings.
While running CoD Ghosts, make sure it is the only application running in your system.
Make sure your BIOS is also updated.

, Sometimes due to lag, some audio or dialogues will be delayed. Worst, there are times there will be no sound at all. Here are things you can try to solve this problem.


Make sure you have Direct X installed. Also, make sure it’s updated.
Sometimes this problem happens due to outdated sound cards. Again, make sure you have updated sound card drivers.

, This a known issue where the screen seems to be blinking at times. It will be probably solved by an update patch but for now just try playing the game in low resolution.

, Mostly an issue for multiplayer matches, this is really one of the most hated problems in CoD Ghosts. Here are some workarounds to solve this problem.


Connect to your Internet connection directly to your modem. Using a router to connect lowers connectivity strength sometimes.
While playing, stop downloading or uploading files on your PC’s background. You will need all the bandwidth you can get.
Avoid recording your online gameplay for that also shares bandwidth.

, In times that the game just fails to launch, most likely this has something to do with your PC’s specs. You should check if you have .Net Framework, Microsoft Visual C++, Nvidia PhysX, and Direct X installed and updated. If these seem to be in order, check your OS if it is on its latest service pack.

, Again, a known issue for CoD Ghosts. In case you experience low FPS like freezing and stuttering, here are some tricks you can try to fix this issue.


Close all other programs and applications running in your background.
Run CoD Ghosts in normal priority.

, Mostly rampant on those players playing in Windows 8.1, mouse sensitivity/acceleration is really a real problem especially when playing online matches against other players. Here’s what you can do to fix this problem.


Disable the Enhance Pointer Precision option for your mouse in the Control Panel.

, Make sure no enemies are running near you. Usually the best spot to be is somewhere that is a corner. This is the best cause this away you don't have to watch two spots.

, You'll have to be a camper for parts of the match. This being is, if you're running around in the streets you'll have the best chance of getting killed, a 9 to 10 ratio to be specific.

, If you have a class that has a claymore device in it, then pick that one. C4 can also be used, but a claymore is more effective in the fact that it's trip-activated, which allows you to focus more on your view than listening to footsteps to detonate the C4.

, Grenade tosses are a players worst nightmare next to great snipers! So keep your eye out for the grenade indicator! If one is tossed to the point that the lifeline shows, get into prone position and scoot as far and fast as possible.

, The best option for this is to have a sniper on both guns, but if you don't have one, then you're not dead yet. If you see someone that is far off, then it would be wise to not fire at them (unless a silencer is in play). But if they're maybe 10–25 yards (9.1–22.9 m) off, then let them have it.

, Whenever you get a kill, be sure to pack your stuff and run! Chances are, that either the person you killed is on the hunt for you or their teammates are. One of the two, or both.

, Congrats, you'll have survived the match. If you don't survive the entire thing without dying then make sure you make some adjustments.

",How to Throw a Grenade on Call of Duty," In Modern Warfare, World at War, and Modern Warfare 2, there is a total difference in how the grenades throw. Some are lighter than others, and some have longer exploding times.;
, On Modern Warfare, you can throw the grenade the longest out of any of the three. The arc is also exceptionally accurate and length defining. So what you'll want to do with these grenades are to aim the crosshairs about midway up and cook it for about 3 seconds, and the exploding will follow a few seconds later.

, On World At War the grenades are pretty much the same, although they tend to fly for a little longer, making the distance further available. So for this ones you'll want to aim your guy's crosshairs a tad bit lower than you would on your guy's on Modern Warfare. But you will still want to cook it for the same 3 seconds.

, The grenades in Modern Warfare Two do not fly that far, and their arc is a tad more degreed. The grenades are the same type, but are heavier. So for this you'll want to aim exceptionally higher than regular, and optionally want to do a running start to get the maximum distance.

, Remember back when you were just starting the game and you got mad cause almost everyone killed you? That is the worst part about prestige is that you have to start all over again. But remember, this gains you skill. The number one player in the world didn't get there by not going prestige.

, Take all of the tricks and skillful moves you developed, and annex them onto your newer weapons. If you have an MP5 for example, then take what you've developed with the MP44 and use that with the MP5.

, If you are playing Call of Duty on PC, open the task manager by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete, and select the “Start Task Manager” option. End all the applications and processes that are nonessential to the game to reduce the splitting of network bandwidth.


When playing Call of Duty on a console, make sure that you are not downloading any new games or downloading new updates during the gameplay.

, Wireless connections may seem clutter-free, but they are not as reliable as a wired Ethernet connection.Wireless connections can be fairly irregular in terms of bandwidth and frequency, which can directly affect the latency of the connection, causing the game to lag.

Here's an example playing style: Set yourself up with a sniper class and try to keep out of too much action.",How to Play Call of Duty," If you are new to the Call of Duty series you most likely did not choose your playing style. For example, maybe you want to be good at medium to long ranges? You would start out with an assault rifle class (or if you're level 4, make one.) or maybe you'd like a short to medium range SMG to boot. There is also the medium to long range heavy machine guns, which are slightly slow but well, dangerous. Or would you like to play it close and deadly with a shotgun, or the opposite, a sniper for those long range well earned kills?;
, First thing you need to do is get the gun you want to get gold second, you will need to have shock charges and C4, Claymore, or a Bouncing Betty. If you stay in a corner or a house place these at the doors, and windows. When an enemy gets in fire away!

, How do you want your scores to end up like? Do you want to be defensive and have a positive kill death ratio? Or do you want to push the enemy back with a level to low kill death ratio by being aggressive? Or do you want to change it up now and then? (recommended you change it up)

, Now you're level four, a way to go using those preset guns. Maybe try the all purpose assault rifle. If you're not playing black ops, choose the gun that's best for you and use it. If you're playing black ops, well, you're going to waste money if you do not read up about the weapon you're using. Generally starting out, you're a low level, and you're new, use an accurate gun, and keep using guns that fit your needs. When you start to play better, use perks that make your gun better. When you unlock things, use them and use other varieties of those things and find what fits your need.

, Get an accurate weapon, any that suits you, and pick the perks that make it better, like as a sniper, stopping power and some claymores - that also works for camping tactics with the assault rifles. Always find the guns and perks that suit your needs and get in the field and kill.

For example, if a weapon's damage is 40-30, it will do 40 damage up to a certain range then it will drop to 30.), there will be a red bar. That bar indicates the factorization of the reduced range that the silencer is causing. However don't get it stuck into your mind that it's impossible to shoot long distance. It just takes a little practice and accuracy.;
, This away you're locked onto the thickest part of the player model, which means you've gotten a better chance at least hitting them.

, Whenever this opportunity rises, take a breath and fire away, but do not ""spray"" bullets. Single shots or short bursts are recommended. This goes for two reasons. One, you'll waste bullets and give him time to run away or shoot back. Two, because they'll figure out eventually where you are, or possibly one of their teammates, or even both. So be sure to be collective on bullets shot.

, If you don't get a kill off the first time, don't get frustrated, you'll always have next time. You'll eventually get at least one kill before it's all over.

, Don't go into the next room yet. When you can, switch your M14 with the Stakeout, which is up of the MP40 stairs and all the way right. This is an amazing shotgun that is a one shot kill for awhile. After awhile, it is still a one shot kill if you get a headshot.

, The power switch is straight pass the curtains, but DO NOT TURN THE POWER ON UNTIL ROUND 9.

, When you are surrounded, use the MP40. Buy Juggernog as soon as you can. Buy more ammo when you need to. Try using the mystery box if you can. For the mystery box, if you get any full auto gun, or ray gun if you are lucky, switch it with the MP40. If you are amazingly lucky and get a Thundergun, switch it with your stakeout. The only two guns you should switch with the stakeout are the Thundergun and the Python. If you get something that isn't a gun like, for example, monkey bombs, obviously take it. Don't take anything else, it's not worth getting.

, Step on the teleporter and link it. Go to the main room and link the teleporter with the link pad. When you use the teleporter, go to pack-a-punch in the back of the room. If you have a ray gun or other full-auto gun from the mystery box, pack-a-punch the steakout. If you still have an MP40 and a thundergun or python, pack-a-punch the MP40.

, It should be easy.

, You should pack-a-punch your stakeout, or python, if you have one of them. For rounds 12-20, Use the mystery box until you get a ray gun, and obviously don't switch a pack-a-punched gun with any mystery box gun, unless it's ray gun. You should have both of your guns pack-a-punched. Pack-a-punch your full-auto gun again. (Yes, the ray gun is full-auto). Then, when you can, pack a punch whatever other gun you have again. These second pack-a-punches are not mandatory, so you do not need to rush to get them done, however they will help you greatly. With these steps, and extreme caution, you should make it past round 20.

Other planned escapes include making mock enemy uniforms and brazenly walking out the main gate as part of an enemy group.,
Escapes can also be opportunistic e.g.",How to Escape from an Old Style POW Camp," It needs to be as close to the wire or perimeter as possible, but be in a dormitory or area where the tunnelers can work 24/7, in relays, with lookouts and distractions. Another thing to remember is a cover. If this is a real POW camp, then the guards will search under furniture. What is needed, is an area that they won't search. This could be anywhere, and to find the blind spot, you have to use your initiative.
, To do this, simply count in strides how far the wire, or a safe place, is. Then, mark a piece of string into sections of your pace, so when stretched out, you can read the number of paces from A to B., This is vitally important, or tunnelers will suffocate. A pair of bellows attached to a hose pipe will do, as long as the pipe ends next to the tunneler, and the bellows are constantly working to supply air. The more ventilation you have, the better and safer the tunnel., (You can use a pick, but they are loud, clumsy, and hard to make/find.) A simple shovel can be made from a tin can, cut diagonally from top corner to bottom corner, when viewed sideways. Then, take a strong bit of wood for a handle, and nail it onto the circular end of the tin. A Hammer can be just a large rock or brick, but if you attach the weight to a handle, you will find it much easier to use, speeding your escape. To make a chisel, simply roll some steel (from a disused food can, probably) around the stick that is your handle. Then, hammer down the end into a sharp point for a chisel. However, sturdy metals are more durable., To build a tunnel successfully, you will need supports to ensure there are no cave-ins.Supports have famously been made of bed-boards, but you could use wooden crates, or anything else made of wood, and obtainable easily. Place an arch made of supports every 30 centimeter (11.8 in) along the tunnel. Then, place more beams running parallel to the tunnel to ensue that there are no gaps in the coverage, and you have a nice wooden ceiling., At night or during a rainstorm will mean the disguise is less easily discovered., hiding in or under a garbage truck, joining an enemy or foreign working party."

Obviously you are going to need to install the game and finish the solo game.,
Presuming that you are relatively knowledgeable about this particular map I am going to plow right in and tell you that to get beyond level 10 is going to be extremely hard without a buddy to help you out.,
You start off in a room on the ground floor.,
Once you have the rifle, assign windows to each of your team members.,
Stay on the ground floor until either the zombies start overwhelming you or around level 6.,
Head into the room and immediately station 1 guy at the box on your left (as you enter the room).,
When the guy at the box runs out of cash or gets a Ray Gun he needs to swap out with another guy and then repeat the step above.

,
Once all your members have a ray gun or you are overwhelmed by zombies, head upstairs (in that same room) by going up to the couch/sofa and press E (again, the guy with the most cash does this).,
Great, now you are upstairs.,
If one of your members still doesn't have a Ray Gun at this point, all is not lost!",How to Own at Nacht Der Untoten (for PC)," There are ways of cheating the system so that you don't need to finish the campaign. These you can find if you search the net.;
, So make sure you have at least 1 wingman when you start your game, more ideally is having 3 guys to help you battle the undead.

, Go to the wall near you and buy a Kar98. Although it's a bolt-action rifle it does a whole lot more damage than the M1 Carbine.

, If you have 3 buddies playing with you there will be 1 spare window, so give the best player 2 windows to watch.

, Then head to the door at the back of the room and press E. Make sure the guy with the most amount of cash does this, as it is quite pricey.

, This guy will then continue to open up the box (costing him every time) and try to get what's called a ""Ray Gun"". If a gun that is better than your current 2 guns pops up, grab it! But make sure you have your worst gun equipped when you do this, because whatever gun you have have equipped will be replaced with the one hovering over the box. REMEMBER: There are other guns in that room that you can buy, such as the Thompson sub-machine gun, which are also pretty darn good against Nazis. So if you are still using a Kar98 or a carbine, trash it and get your hands on that Tommy gun!

,, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT head up the other stairwell in the 1st room you were in! You will see why in a moment.

, As you leave the stairs and turn into the room, you will see a doorway across from you, head into that room. Now all you have to do is cover 1 measly little window and a doorway (if you opened up the other stairwell you would be watching the stairwell as well)! Now your main aim is going to be staying alive in this room as long as possible. The doorway creates a funnel and all you need to do is keep up the fire! Bearing in mind that there is also a pump action shotgun on this floor and a BAR, both of which are enormously effective against the enemy!

, They can head downstairs in between rounds and try their luck at the box. But be very careful, as those zombies are sneaky mindless buggers and when the next round begins they will be streaming through the doors, windows and tunnels and might catch you out in the open.

Get tactical!,
Learn the maps.,
Examine your opponent carefully before attacking and know how to kill them depending on their position and weapon.,
Maintain the element of surprise.,
Be aware of your surroundings - if you are the last one left and you see an enemy, make sure there isn't another enemy nearby to kill you right after you have finished chain-sawing their friend.,
Attack!,
Retreat if you have to.,
Take advantage of situations, whether it be creeping up on an unsuspecting sniper or entering a shotgun fray where your enemy is only trying to kill an ally.,
Practice, practice, practice!",How to Chainsaw Effectively on Gears of War," You will get little to none kills with the chainsaw if you do not start strategy for you game. This may involve throwing smoke and hiding, waiting behind corners for your prey or looping around to attack enemies from behind - whatever it is, simply running straight into the action hoping to snag a kill will almost certainly end in your demise. More than with any other weapon, the chainsaw needs to be used with a plan in mind.;
, In every map there will be some area where enemies go where you can optimize your chain-sawing action. Corners or small corridors are perfect, but try to avoid wide open spaces or places with only low cover. You may find some maps are better than others to chainsaw on, while others can be good or bad, depending on who your opponents are.

, For example, if you've managed to loop around and they're in scope-mode with a sniper, they will probably be very easy to kill. In fact, most snipers are easy to cut down with the chainsaw. Or if they have grenades, be prepared to be tagged with one before you chainsaw, so that even if you do chainsaw that person, you will die afterwards - try to catch them from behind. However, of all the weapons you will come up against, the most common and difficult to overcome for a chainsaw-user is the shotgun. It is not impossible to kill them however, especially if you use a small zig-zag route when you are coming towards them - this will reduce their effectiveness against you. Understandably, if you attack them from behind they will be very easy to kill. If you get in quickly enough, they will only have time to get a glancing shot off which, if you are close enough, will not be enough to stop you killing them.

, More than anything the chainsaw is most effective when your opponent is not expecting it. Do not rev your chainsaw until the absolute last second and if you are following someone from behind, never run as it will alert them to your presence. If you are attacking them from behind or the sides, always try to attack from either behind or the left side of their body, since the third-person view crops that side more than the right.

, Entering a situation where you will be ambushed by several opponents is the bane of the chainsaw, so take the time to take note of who's where.

, If you've made sure it's safe, the enemy is unaware, that you have followed your plan and can successfully make the attack, simply walk up to the enemy and let your chainsaw rip! If your enemy does somehow become aware of you, rely on your skill to finish them off. Once your opponent knows you're there, it's no use trying to still be stealthy - use the terrain, roll around and try to get around them so you have a better chance. try to not get stunned, otherwise you will most likely get killed.

, If you still have your health, but several more enemies have come to your prey's aid, then simply run away. This can be useful for the ol' ""retreat/attack"" move, where you can hide behind a corner and wait for your pursuer to walk right into your chainsaw.

, If someone throws smoke, use it. If someone is about to pick up a weapon of friend, get them. Whatever the case, the general rule of thumb is: If you're not the point of focus, attack. If you can attack them without them having a chance to attack back, attack. If they are standing still, attack. You'll know a good situation when you see one.

, Use the chainsaw whenever you can. You'll find new ways to use maps and attack certain weapons and situations over time which will help you become better. Use nothing but the chainsaw if you feel comfortable - it will really help your development.

Sniper — Simply aim at the head and pull the trigger, unless you're the host, in which case you will need to aim in front of where they're going.,
Shotgun — The aim on the shotgun is almost like a rectangle.,
Pistol — I'm not sure because I haven't played in a while, but it's either six or seven shots to the head with the standard-issue pistol for a headshot.,
BoomShot — BoomShot headshots are possible — don't let anyone tell you they're not but the chance of one happening is about a million to one.

",How to Get a Headshot in Gears of War," If your host aims at the head the bullet will come out instantly. Also, if you ""no scope"" with the sniper (no scope meaning holding the left trigger WITHOUT clicking the right stick), then sniping is marginally easier, since lining up the head with the aimer like this seems to work better and faster.;
, The bottom line of the rectangle should be on the head. Basically, aim above the head as the shotgun has a spray effect.

, Honestly, the ""boltok"" is not useless but is better because in just one shot and one melee the opponent will be downed. Aim at the head and pull the trigger as quickly as possible.

Lose the cops.",How to Steal Boats in GTA2," Drive to edge of the city or to any bodies of water like rivers or lakes that run through the game map, and look for a boat you want to steal.

, Boats operated by non-playable civilians will move around the water in a certain pattern, usually in circles. Take a moment to watch how the boat sails around to get to know its course of direction.

, Jump on the water and swim towards the area on the water where you think the boat will pass.


Keep in mind though that only main characters from GTA San Andreas and later versions of the game can swim (GTA 4, GTA 4: Episodes of Liberty City, and GTA 5), limiting this method to these versions of GTA. If you’re playing GTA versions prior to San Andreas, your character will drown once you jump into the water.

, Once the boat passes by right beside you, press the Y (Xbox), Triangle (PlayStation), or F (PC) button, and your character will jump onto the boat and board it, throwing whoever’s driving it out on to the water.

, Once you have control of the vehicle, press the Right Trigger (Xbox), L2 (PlayStation), or W (PC) button to accelerate and sail away from the dock.

, Cops will chase after you if you stole a boat while an officer is around. To lose the police, look at the mini map on the lower left corner of the screen to check the range of the police, marked by a large flashing circle, that’s chasing you. Just sail straight out of their range, and they should give up on chasing you, making the boat yours."

Learn the capabilities of the smoke grenade.,
Experiment throwing the smoke grenade on different maps.,
Use smoke grenades as cover.,
Use smoke grenades as distractions.,
Throw smoke grenades to get your allies out of tricky situations.,
Annoy your enemy by ""smoke tagging"" them.,
Remember to practice using the smoke grenade whenever you can as a support weapon.",How to Use Smoke Grenades Effectively in Gears of War," To use smoke grenades effectively, you must first know how long the smoke will last, how large an area it will cover, and how dense it will be. Smoke grenades can be selected from your inventory when you first start a multiplayer match by pressing Up on the D-Pad of your Xbox 360 controller. Enlist the help of a friend if you have to to test the density and dispersal rates so you have better knowledge of how to use the smoke grenade when it comes to a real game.;
, Practice with a friend to see which areas of a map may be good to use a smoke grenade on. See if the smoke covers a particular staircase or doorway, or how high you need to throw it from one point to smoke-out another. Take note of your findings if necessary.

, If you're under heavy enemy fire, or if there's a sniper aiming at you, smoke grenades can be quite useful if you need to escape. They can be blindly thrown while in cover, but make sure that where you throw it covers enough area to shroud your escape. Remember however, that enemies' cross-hairs still turn red if you cross them in the smoke, even if the enemy themselves can't see you. Knowing the smoke's dispersal rate will help in judging how long you have to get out of an area before the smoke is gone.

, Nothing can distract an enemy more than by throwing a smoke grenade into one area while you loop around into another. If the enemy doesn't know exactly where you are, a well placed smoke grenade can occupy them long enough for you to sneak up behind them, find a better hiding spot, or to simply see where they are if they come looking for you. This works particularly well on snipers, who will often aim at the smoke waiting for you to appear, leaving them highly vulnerable. If you need to pick up a weapon, throwing a smoke grenade down first is advisable to mask your actions.

, In a large combat, a smoke grenade thrown in from the sidelines can help give your friends a chance to retreat and heal, or even trick enemies into thinking it is a frag grenade and running away, leaving them open to attack. If you see an ally pinned down by fire, once again, smoke grenades are highly useful.

, ""Smoke tagging"" is performed in the same way as tagging a frag grenade to an enemy: by pressing the B button on your controller when near an enemy and when you have a smoke grenade equipped. Unlike the frag grenade, which would explode and kill the enemy, the smoke grenade will give off smoke, exposing the target's movements and generally annoying them. Smoke tagging another player is usually taken as arrogant and demeaning, but can be useful if you want to make them run blindly into a trap or disorient them. This can lead to your death and possible negative feedback on your Xbox LIVE Gamertag, so use it sparingly.

, A lot of the time, people in a match will forget about the usefulness of the smoke grenade. Whether it's a player under fire, a weapon that needs collecting, a sniper which needs distracting, or a fight which needs breaking up, the smoke grenade has nearly endless uses. Once you begin to use it frequently, it will become as useful as frag grenades. Practice makes perfect.

Get a land vehicle.,
Look for stunt spots.,
Prepare to do the stunt.,
Stunt jump.,
Land safely.",How to Stunt Jump in GTA," Walk around town and find a car or a motorbike to use for a stunt jump. Fast vehicles like sports cars and superbikes are the most ideal units to use for these tricks.;
, There are neither signs nor visual representations to identify a stunt spot, making it hard to find one. One sure way to find a stunt spot is to look for oddly placed ramps throughout random areas of the city.


Look for oddly placed wooden planks leaning against low walls or ramps near the edges of a rooftop car park. These spots are most likely where you can perform some awesome stunts.

, When you do find a stunt spot, move away from the ramp and leave enough space so your car has time to accelerate before the jump.

, Drive towards the ramp at full acceleration, gaining as much speed as you can before the jump. Once your vehicle takes flight, the game camera will go on slow motion, a sign that you’re currently doing a stunt jump.

, If you took off the ramp correctly, you should be able to land right. If you managed to land safely, a “success” message will appear on the game screen, and you’ll be given reward money. If you fail to land correctly, a “failed” message will appear on the game screen instead, and you won’t be given any bonus money.

Before you go into the field, play a couple levels of gears 2 on insane, get a taste of what you're going up against.,
Get ready to get your butt kicked by the locust.,
Be warned, by wave four, the locust will be using lancers.,
On wave two, the butchers will come in, that's the best time to estimate the strength of what's to come.,
Shotgun locust are bad.,
Don't forget about the smaller locust too, they still can kill you, especially when you're distracted, always do a full 360 turn to see if any enemies are sneaking around you.,
By wave seven.,
Butchers, by now you've realized, the the shotgun makes short work of these cumbersome thugs.

,
Grinders.,
Maulers, one of the WORST enemies to face.,
Bolters are locust who's walk speed is much like the roadie run, and obviously received ninja training.,
Kantus are bad too.,
Beast riders/Bloodmounts appear at the end of your excursion.,
Practice active reloads, try to get nothing but perfects, it adds some more bang for your buck.

",How to Beat Horde Mode on Insane," I'd suggest a level that pits you up against a variety of enemies with minimal amounts of cover present.;
, The first wave of horde is nothing but drones who can't use cover effectively, and wretches. Lancer the wretches and make sure to score headshots on the drones.

, If you've played a level on insane, you'll know a few bullets directed at you, will kill you instantly. The best thing to do, is hold the trigger until they don't get up.

, when fighting the butchers lead them into planted grenades, or stay one step ahead of them, blasting them with the shotgun. Beware though, they have a good reach with that cleaver.

, First of all, if you come around the corner and one is standing right there, you're already dead, second. they also know how to use grenades, and they WILL use them. But during that brief moment, they are vulnerable, make headshots, use your snub pistol, you deal constant damage as they just stand there, the pistol has a zoom mode too, so you have accuracy.

, Watch out for wretches and tickers, wretches attacks are more devastating, and tickers have much more splash damage when they explode.

, all varieties of boomer is on the field (Boomer, Butcher, Grinder, Mauler) The boomers are deadly, kill them first, never stay in one spot, they'll just fire and the splash damage from the rocket will do you in. When you hear them say their catch phrase, the iconic ""BOOM"" dodge, or move away from the vicinity of where they are aiming. Although, the boomers are not too bright, so rig up some planted grenades, they'll walk past, and you'll deal some damage.

,, If you're caught in the path of their bullets for but a second, you're mulch. make some headshots, if you're lucky you can blast off their helmet, it's a little easier to rid the world of their existence if they have no noggin protection. What's more, they just stand there out in the open, towering above any and all forms of cover, firing until there gun overheats, then standing there until it cools down. Lob in some grenades to speed up the process. Be careful though, in horde they usually spawn 2 or 3 at a time. Making it harder to try to kill them. Their tactic is to intimidate you into hiding behind cover, which they will walk around. If you have played the first gears of war, and killed general RAAM on insane, use the same tactics against the Grinders.

, First of all, on insane they're practically invincible. Second, their helmets are obviously too small for their thick skulls, and therefore stuck. Third, they must be the smarter boomers, because when they feel the sting of a bullet, they duck down behind a shield that, amazingly, covers 98% of their hulking mass. Fourth, Most boomer classes say something before they start with the trigger-pulling, and it gives you about three seconds of time to get to some cover, maulers on the other hand say it as they do it, as soon as you hear the first letter of their catchphrase (CRUSH) You're dead. Their mace has some seriously powerful splash damage, and if it doesn't kill you, it just knocks you down, and the mauler will just stomp up to you and finish the job as soon as you stand up. Fifth: (And worst) They can run! And they can cover lots of ground really quickly. The best ways to get rid of them, is to use the torque bow, planted grenades, boomshot, and continuous lancer fire at any exposed part on their body.

, For their ability to get behind you and send .45 bullets into your physiology. They are more so like snipers because they have the gear to kill you in one shot, but are weak.

, They somehow know when an enemy is down but not out, and will revive them from anywhere on the battlefield, they throw ink grenades that kill you within two seconds of being near them. They carry the gorgon pistol and a burst does you in. They also, maliciously, summon tickers to end your life. But despite that, they are vulnerable, whenever they shriek, they just stand there, and when they are preparing to throw an ink, they are vulnerable. It's best to deal with them at long range.

, Try to kill the Beast rider first, (The one with the gun) the bloodmount is a formidable foe. (Understatement) They never stop moving, zig zagging their way towards you, and then stabbing their razor sharp feet into you. Buy yourself some time by shooting their helmet, it malfunctions and they try to claw it off, get in as many shots as possible, but now, without that helmet to protect their face, they are more vulnerable, be careful, they usually travel in groups of two. And on insane, they are a serious threat to getting a mega-high score on horde. They are a combination of ranged and close attacks. But like everything else they can be killed.

Look at the center of the screen to aim.,
Get comfortable with the ""cover radius"" of certain objects.,
Use the Roadie Run instead of trying to roll everywhere.,
Move in and out of cover frequently.,
Learn to ""Wallbounce"" to gain the edge in firefights.,
Perfect your active reload on the move.,
Practice against computers to gain fluid control of your character.",How to Be Good at Gears of War1," One of the most common problems for new Gears players is that they aim by staring at the end of the gun. While natural, this is actually not the most accurate way to plan your shots. When you're not holding the Left trigger to aim specifically, your shots will come from the dead center of your screen. The best way to prepare is to look slightly over your characters right shoulder, which is always in the center of the screen.


This is most important when using the Gnasher (shotgun) as shooting without aiming is a viable way to take down nearby enemies.
In Gears 1&2 the aim is lined up with the animation of the gun on screen. However, the center of the screen is still the best place to look for aiming consistency.;
, Gears of War is much more about effective movement than most other shooters, as the 3rd person perspective allows rolls, runs, quick turns, and speedy strafing. Your most-used button is your ""A"" button, and it allows you to hide, sprint, and roll. Press it near cover and you will be quickly ""sucked"" behind it, hiding you on walls, pillars, and sandbags. Spend some time getting used to this vital function:


What is the furthest distance from something you can press A to get into cover? Note how much faster your movement is when you move to cover -- this is an important tool to avoid enemies and get the upper hand.
Open up a private match and just run the course, finding all the weapons. This is the best way to practice movement effectively.

, Rolling (by double tapping A) is a bit slower than just holding A and running. Your movement is also easier to control when holding A, which begins your ""Roadie Run."" Save rolls for quick movements in a fight, or to quickly move laterally when a wall approaches, then resume running by holding A.


New players often try and move by rolling everywhere. Don't-- it is slower than just running., Once you're in cover and you character is pressed against a wall, you have a couple of options for your next move. Understanding these, and using them to your advantage, is vital to success:



Press A and forward to jump over the barrier and/or sprint to the next nearby cover. This is a risky move, as it is a set 1-second animation that you cannot move during. Good players will notice and take free shots.

Press the right trigger to blind fire. Without exposing your character, this fires your gun around or above the cover. Only useful with a shotgun, when an unsuspecting player is about to cross your cover.

Hold left trigger to pop out and shoot. Left trigger lets you pop out, aiming your gun and shooting while staying partially in cover. Once you left go of left trigger you'll automatically slide back into cover to reload or gain health.

Pull back on the stick to leave cover in place. Simply pull back on the control stick and you'll peel off cover without a big dramatic movement, letting you resume the fight in place. This is the most effective way to leave cover.

Roll out with a double-tapped A. This is good for a burst of movement in any direction. Simply point the way you want to move and hit A twice in rapid succession., Wallbouncing  uses the temporary burst of speed gained when entering cover to slip and slide around enemies in a close-range fight. To do it, you need to get good at entering and leaving cover rapidly-- pressing A, hitting the wall, then immediately pulling off or rolling away. You then use A again to enter new cover, effectively bouncing back and forth between covers in a split-second.Practice bouncing down the same wall. Come in, then leave cover. Aim your character diagonally, farther down the wall, and press A to rapidly ""bounce"" up the whole wall without having to run.
Learning to aim while wallbouncing  will make you invincible. Attach your shotgun and work on getting in close quickly, and squeezing off 1-2 shots, never stopping your feet the whole time.

, Gears of War has a great feature called ""Active Reload,"" where you can speed up a reload with proper timing. When you hit reload (usually right bumper), a small bar appears in the upper right corner. As the little marker moves to the right on the bar, it will cross an all white, highlighted area of the reload bar. If you click reload again as it does your gun will reload instantly, and make your bullets a little more effective. To make the most of it, you need to be able to reload the gun in the midst of any activity. Work on nailing your active reload while still moving and dodging for the best results.

, You can play the campaign mode and beat the enemy hordes, but the best way to practice is to start a private game (local multiplayer) and just play against computer controlled ""multiplayer."" From here you can memorize the maps, learn the best uses of cover, and practice moving your character rapidly across the battle without having to wait for multiplayer games or the next challenging campaign level.

Rain death from above with the Hammer of Dawn.",How to Be Good at Gears of War2," Every player in Gears starts out with the same weapons, putting you on an even playing field with everyone else around. These weapons, unlike the weapons you begin with in most shooters, are powerful and should be enough to contest almost any battle:



Lancer: Your standard assault rifle, it is used for mid-range fights and support fire.

Gnasher: The most commonly used weapon in the game, your shotgun is for up close and personal fights.

Pistol: Surprisingly powerful and accurate at mid and longer distances, the pistol is great to finish enemies while reloading or supporting far off teammates. It can get a head shot instant kill if it hits the enemies skull when they are at low health.

Smoke Grenades: In Gears 2, 3, and 4 this temporarily stuns enemies while providing a smoke screen. In later versions it only produces the smoke screen.

, Hands down, the most important weapon in Gears of War is the Gnasher shotgun. In tight quarters, the player with the best shotgun skills will always get the kill, and the extreme power of the gun in close-range means good players only need 1-2 shots to get the job done. Some tips for the shotgun include:


In very close combat, where you are rolling and moving right next to the enemy, don't worry about aiming with the left trigger. Once they hit the center of your screen, fire.
When in cover, use the left trigger to aim and then shoot simultaneously. You're a sitting duck in aiming mode, but your accuracy is much better. Aim as best you can before hitting Left trigger, then pull the left and right triggers simultaneously, shooting and returning to cover quickly.Keep moving between shots. You'll have a half-second after a shot while you re-cock the weapon. Use it to roll or wall bounce away, setting up the next shot., The Lancer is very situation. At a medium distance, it is deadly against an enemy in the open, slowing them down and dealing enough damage to down them after 2-3 seconds of constant fire. However, if your enemy has cover, or you're in close quarters, you'll likely fail to connect enough shots. Use the Lancer when you've got some space:


Pin down enemies from afar. While your Lancer may not kill someone in cover, it can be enough to keep them from poking their head out. Use this to protect objectives, teammates, or power weapons.
If you see a teammate in a shotgun battle, use your Lancer to assist. It will slow down the enemy and may deal enough damage to make a half-hit shotgun blast effective.

, The Longshot is one of the hardest weapons to use, but one of the most effective. This sniper rifle only has one shot before needing to reload, so you need to make it count. Luckily, one shot to the head will kill any player immediately, and only three shots to the body are needed to take someone down.


When using the Longshot, set up in cover in an area where you have high visibility. High places are often best since you can look down on the whole map.
Use the longshot on distracted enemies -- those fighting teammates, in cover, or picking up other weapons, to shoot on the moment they freeze to help someone or pick up a weapon., The Torque Bow is a crossbow that shoots grenades. You have to hold down the right trigger to pull the string back, then you release to shoot. If you hit a player with a tense bow the grenade arrow will stick to them, then blow up for an instant kill. But you can also shoot the ground or bounce the shot off of walls to deal massive grenade damage to multiple enemies.


You have a laser sight that tells you where the shot will go depending on how hard you're pulling back the bow. Shooting before you reach full tension can help you drop a grenade at a group's feet instead of trying to ""stick"" someone.
If you hold the bow back long enough it will eventually shoot, so don't try and save a shot for the right time -- you'll waste precious ammo.

, The grenade launcher can down any nearby enemies if it hits someone's feet, dealing a wide swath of massive damage. If you shoot someone directly with it they will die in one hit, but there is such limited ammo this can be risky. A shot to the feet is the most sure-fire way to get any nearby enemies down.


Boomshots have slow, arcing bullets, so be sure to lead your opponents slightly.

, This godly weapon takes some time to warm up but is deadly when it does. If the opponents are outside, a laser will come down on the spot you're aiming and instantly kill anything it touches. Once you've warmed it up, you can drag this laser around, instantly killing whole groups or enemies.


Make sure there are no roofs or nearby buildings protecting your target. They will hear a small noise alerting them that you're targeting them as you warm up the Hammer and escape it's wrath.
Aim at walls and the floor, not at the player. You need to hold the trigger down on a non-moving target to activate the weapon.
Stay back and use cover and height to accurately aim. The Hammer is great to clear out key spots (like bases or the flag) as well as protect other weapons."

Play Team Deathmatch to get used to the controls and feel of online play.,
Memorize the maps and power weapons before logging on.,
Prioritize staying alive over getting a kill.,
Focus on getting and holding power weapons.,
Stick close to at least one teammate at all times.",How to Be Good at Gears of War3," In Team Deathmatch you work with a team to get more kills than your opponents. There is no set number of lives and you don't have to worry about odd objectives or missions. This is the best mode for beginners since you don't have to sit and watch if you die and you get plenty of action in., Play a couple of private matches to learn the layout, weapon location, and spawn points (where dead players come back) of both teams. In the tight, chaotic games of Gears this knowledge is indispensable. You do not want to be under fire from your opponents at long range and have no idea where to find the sniper rifle, or accidentally hide out in the enemy base to recharge.

, Gears, unlike many shooters, has a higher premium on staying alive. There are only 5 people on your team, at most, so going down takes away 20% of your team's firing power. That can turn your death into the death of your whole team quickly if the opponent is well organized. While some risk is always necessary, you need to do everything to stay alive when possible.


Never run out into the open unless you've got someone covering with smoke grenades, Lancers, or both.
When moving in for a shotgun battle, ensure you have the element of surprise, better numbers, or both.
If you see that the other team has a power weapon, try and avoid them unless you've got a clear chance for the kill. Let them waste their ammo and put the fight back on an even playing field.

, The Boomshot, Longshot, Hammer of Dawn, and Torque Bow can and will turn the tide of the fight in your favor, and your goal as a team is to get and secure these weapons for as long as possible. Even if you don't get the weapon yourself, you want to defend the location and the teammate that has it. All four of these weapons can kill an enemy in one hit -- and that kind of power is the only way to win games.

, Teamwork is your first concern in any fight. You will be better as a team, and, without fail, the team that sticks together will win the majority of fights. While there are times when you need to venture out -- to pick up a weapon quickly or to deal with an enemy straggler -- you want to be communicating at all times with your team. Some important information to share is:


Enemy location, especially when enemies are in groups.
Your movement, especially regarding power weapons, important locations, and when you need cover.
When the enemy picks up or might win key weapons or locations.
When you need a revive or assistance, or when you see someone else who needs help and can get there.
When using explosives, like grenades."

This shows you your stats for the chapter (like your accuracy, clear time, and so on). After this, you'll have access to the Skill Settings menu, where you can spend your skill points (SP) and assign your different skills.;
, You can also access the Skill Settings menu without playing through the campaign. To do this:


On the main title screen, select ""Play"".

Select ""Skill Settings"" from the list of options.

, On the Skill Settings screen, you'll see a row of numbered icons on the left side of the screen that you can scroll through. These are your different skill presets. For each preset, you can assign up to three skills. Depending on the skills you want to use for the next chapter, you can pick whichever preset suits your needs best.


Select the first icon (labeled ""1""). Three slots will pop out to the right. Select any one of these slots, then browse through the list of skills you want on the right. Select a skill from the list to add it to your preset. You can assign the other two skills the same way.

, When you try to assign a skill, choices that you haven't bought yet will have a lock icon next to them. Their price (in SP) will be listed to the right. If you have enough SP to buy the skill, you can select it to purchase it.


After you've purchased the skill, you can assign it to any of your preset slots.
Note that when you highlight a skill, a description of what it does will pop up below. Use this to decide whether the skill is a good use of your SP. You can find a complete list of every skill in the game here., Some skills can be upgraded again for extra SP after you've already purchased them the first time. Each upgrade level makes the skill more powerful. However, each level costs more to upgrade than the one before it. Some skills have a maximum of two levels, some have a maximum of three, and some don't allow any upgrades.


For example, the first time you buy the ""Firearm"" skill for 12,000 SP, it will increase the damage your guns do by 10%. The second level, which costs 29,000 SP, increases the damage by 20%. The third and final level, which costs 75,000 SP, increases the damage by a whopping 50%., Eventually, you won't have any more SP to spend in the Skill Settings menu. To get more, you'll have to play the game. In the campaign, when you kill enemies, break boxes, and open chests, you'll sometimes get an item that looks like a chess piece. This item gives you SP when you pick it up. The better the chess piece, the more SP you'll get!


Chess piece drops range from the very common pawn (worth just 50 SP) to the ultra-rare gold king (worth 10,000 SP). Click here for a list of all the chess pieces., SP points aren't just for the main campaign. You can also earn them for the Mercenaries and Agent Hunt game modes in basically the same way — by picking them up after killing enemies, breaking boxes, and so on.



Note: Mercenaries and Agent Hunt modes have their own separate skills available for purchase. You can't use the campaign skills in either of these game mode. Click here for the Mercenaries and Agent Hunt skills (below the main skills)., A player that likes to use the sniper rifle and other long-range weapons should choose skills that maximize the ability to deal pinpoint damage at a great distance. With the right skills, you'll be able to deal with threats before they get anywhere near you.



Recommended Skills:Firearm Level 3 (+50% damage to guns)
Eagle Eye (extra zoom for sniper rifles)
Rifle Ammo Pickup Increase (more likely to find rifle ammo)

, If you find yourself dying often or you want to be able to take hits for an inexperienced partner, try a beefy ""tank"" build. These skills will toughen you up so that you can take a beating and keep on dishing out damage.



Recommended Skills:Defense Level 3 (-50% damage from all enemies)
Field Medic Level 2 (your partner gives you several health tablets when you get revived)
Breakout (makes it easier to get away from enemies that grab you(

, If you like to save ammo by getting up close and using powerful melee attacks, pick skills that increase your melee damage. You'll also want to improve your stamina bar so that you can use these melee attacks as much as possible. Defensive skills can help as well — you'll be getting hit more often in close-quarters combat.



Recommended Skills:Melee Level 3 (+50% damage to melee attacks)
Combat Gauge Boost Level 2 (five extra blocks for stamina bar)
Defense Level 3

, Shotguns are great for their high damage and their ability to hit multiple enemies at once. Max out shotgun damage and shorten your long reload times to make the most of these powerful weapons.



Recommended Skills:Firearm Level 3
Quick Reload (makes you reload faster)
Shotgun Shell Pickup Increase (more likely to find shotgun ammo)

, Looking to make an effective, two-person killing machine? Playing with a partner who needs a little extra help? Supportive skills can make your and your partner a more effective team.



Recommended Skills: (Have your partner choose these — you can pick whatever build you want)
Team-Up (your partner's attacks do more damage when you are near each other)
Field Medic Level 2
Recovery Level 2 (recover from ""dying"" status faster)

, Looking to put a fun, challenging twist on your game? Pick skills that make you deal lots of damage, but leave you vulnerable if you make a mistake. Item-increasing skills can give you an added incentive to play the odds!


Shooting Wild (removes the targeting reticule but increases your damage)
Last Shot (final bullet in each clip will do extra damage)
Item Drop Increase (enemies you kill will drop items more often)

, In this chapter, you can find 2,000 SP in a coffin near where you talk about Simmons and Ada. There are also 5,000 SP in a coffin near the spike trap. Kill the zombies you encounter for extra SP. When you fall into the next area after pulling the levers, let the game save, then quit the level and repeat as needed.


For extra SP, try shooting the zombies in the head to make them Bloodshots, which are worth more., These chapters have lots of enemies that drop high amounts of SP. Each Ogroman enemy (the giant-like creatures with red organs on their backs) drops 4,000 SP.There are two Ogroman enemies in 2-3 — avoid using the third AA gun to be able to get the SP from the second Ogroman. In 2-4, there are several Napad enemies (the ones with hard armor shells you need to break) worth 1,500 SP each and several Strelat enemies (the lizards that spit spines at you) worth 1,000 SP each.


Try using the grenade launcher to kill all the Napads in the foyer to get about 10,000 in a very short time., In this chapter, you're in a race against Chris. If you're quick, you can rack up tons of SP in a short amount of time. Beating Chris to the elevator nets you 2,000 SP. After, when you're hacking the locks, use the shotgun to take down the drones effectively. If you do well, you'll beat Chris and win 14,000 SP. After the Simmons cutscene, the game will save and you can repeat this process for more SP., A good deal of SP is scattered through the entire chapter. Napads are worth 1,500 SP each, while Whoppers (the enormous fat zombies) are worth 2,500 each and Shriekers (the zombies with the large red growth on their chests) are worth 1,000 each. There are also lots of SP drops distributed in the various boxes, including a 4,000 SP drop in the treasure chest after the first Napad.Level 2-3 is especially lucrative — killing the enemies in the underground lab can earn you about 25,000 SP in less than ten minutes., Jake has one of the easiest opportunities to farm SP in the entire game. The shopping district part of Chapter 4 has no enemies and two boxes containing a total of 7,000 SP. This section can be run through very quickly, so if you're willing to repeat it over and over again, you can earn tons of SP in a short time."

Make use of claymores and other tools.",How to Get Better on Call of Duty Multiplayer," You need to be familiar with the controls. Play through the story mode or otherwise practice until you are comfortable with how the controller works. Another great way to practise both movement and shooting is offline in a private match. You can test out guns and get familiar with the basics of the game. In some games in the Call of Duty franchise, you can set up bots, virtual humans who change their skill levels depending on how difficult you set them, recruit being lowest and veteran being highest.


You can even change the controller settings! Experiment and find something that works best for you.;
, Choose a class that you are either comfortable playing or that you feel you can learn to play. This may take some experimenting, but it's very important to getting really good at the game. Each class will have its own little quirks and tricks, and the more you play that class, the more you'll learn about how to do it well. Take advantage of the skills and abilities for the class you chose. Don't try to play outside of your class because you'll be weaker.

, If you're playing in a group, either with people that you know or random online people, make sure to make use of your teammates class and skills. You want to have your classes compliment each other and you want to play the role that you've chosen for your team, in order to reach peak performance. It's also important to communicate and help each other out. This will achieve the best results.

, Talk with your teammates to find a strategy for each game. This cuts down on ""Running around like a chicken with its head cut off"" time and increases the efficiency of your kills and reaching of the end goal. If no one else is taking the lead, it may be time to man up! The more you work with a set group of people, the easier this will be. But talking to each other is the real key.

, Choose perks that are best for your class and how you play. These perks should help you do your job best. You can choose general perks, which are useful across all classes, or ones which are a little more helpful for just your class. It can be useful to coordinate with teammates to make sure that your boosts cover all the team's needs.


For example, a good general perk in Call of Duty: Ghosts is Ping, which alerts you to other enemies in the area whenever you kill an enemy.
Quickdraw and Stalker are good examples of class specific perks, being best for if you plan to be sneaky rather that run in guns blazing.

, Choose the best variety of weapons for your class and playing style. Don't take a big ol' gun if you're a sneaky type guy, cause you're going to have a heck of a time meshing the two. Consider all of the situations you are likely to find yourself in and choose the best variety of weapons. If you want to play to the best of your ability, you're going to want to choose the right weapons for you and for the map you're playing.

, Different weapons work better in particular situations, so use them correctly. Shorter barrel guns are better up close kills, while a sniper rifle will be necessary for distance kills. Choose a gun which is best suited for the particular shot you are trying to make.

, One of the best things you can do, in order to play like a real pro, is to memorize the map and strategize based on your knowledge. Don't just think about where things are, think about how you can use them. Learn choke points, sniping spots, areas with no good escape route, escape routes, etc. Keep these in mind and make use of them during battles. This links to teamwork, as you can learn names for specific locations on each map, better known as call-outs. This is when you notify teammates on the current places your enemies are.


Keep in mind that other players may use the same strategies, so you can use this knowledge to do things like seek and take out troublesome snipers.
This will take time and practice, especially since you may have to learn many different maps.
Share your knowledge with your teammates but don't be a jerk about it.

, Avoid the centers of maps, as these areas tend to have the least amount of cover. Avoid open areas. Hug the perimeter and always keep cover nearby so that you can fall back if you get ambushed. However, if you are in a game of domination, a game mode with 3 flags you might just have to have a coordinated attack on the middle of the map, so sometimes, you will have to make exceptions.


In CoD: Ghosts, there is a distinct disadvantage to sprinting, so save sprinting only for getting from cover to cover.

, Players are often killed while reloading. To reduce the likelihood of being killed while reloading, don't immediately reload after getting a kill. Getting a kill or shooting your weapon alerts others to your presence (unless you use certain attachments and perks, and if you immediately reload you are making yourself vulnerable. Instead, wait. If you can, get to an area with more cover in order to reload. Only reload in an open area if you have no other choice. In the newest addition to the Call of Duty series, Advanced Warfare, you can speed reload by double tapping the reload button, however you do loose bullets in the mean-time. Also, you can get fast-mags, a perk which enables you to reload faster. You can also use extended-mags, another perk which make you have more bullets per magazine.

, Headshots do more damage and give you serious bragging rights (not to mention unlocking all sorts of in-game content), so this is a good skill to learn. Choose perks that increase your accuracy and reduce your flinching or movement, especially when you're being shot at. Also focus on being able to move fast. Reflex sights are also useful. Other than that, there's the obvious: aim. Good luck!


Headshots also count for more XP, which will allow you to rank up quickly in the game.

, When you snipe, make your shot and then sneak out of the area, so as not to become a target. Also, try to snipe in less obvious locations. Other players who occasionally do sniping may know all the good spots and using these areas can make you a target, because you won't really be hidden.

, There are lots of little extra tools in the game that you can use to get a real leg up. Strategize and use items wisely, or make sure that your teammates use them wisely if you don't have access to them.


For example, claymores can be placed behind you when you're being chased. These are available in almost every version of CoD.
I.E.D.s, available in Call of Duty: Ghosts, can be placed in an area you know where an enemy is about to enter. They can also be useful to cut off choke points and allow you to gain excellent map control. You can also stick them on flags in domination, making that flag almost impossible to access for the opposite team.

They don't have better perks.*However I tend to think they do. So don't worry about their rank or anything, do whatever you can to not be intimidated.;
, Look for those players, ignore all the other players. However don't go and get yourself killed by ignoring other players or getting less kills by just going after the higher ranked player.

, If you have a microphone headset, tell the level 55 that your coming after him.

, If your wanting to get the level 55 player then be sure to use an assault rifle(best to do with overkill where you can carry two weapons{ex. sniper rifle and M4}). Usually a sniper rifle isn't the best matching rifle to hunt someone of a level 55's stature. Reasoning behind this is because when you're in a game with a good 55, chances are you will not be seeing them a lot, so a sniper rifle is a no no.

, If you have the thought in the back of your mind that they are level 55 and that you're gonna get stomped; specially in cage matches then your most likely going to get beat, or it'll be close, unless they aren't as good as you might be. I always have confidence, cause I have beaten a level 55 that was way more experienced than me in a cage match before. So be sure to have confidence in yourself.

, Being scared of an opponent isn't a good thing. Just keep reminding yourself that you can do this, and that it's not that hard.

, Be sure that you don't just play abnormal. Remember what all you've learned through your online campaign. Instead of going through, guns blazing, revert to stealthiness and aim. It'll get you much, much, much further and a higher score.

, The main focus of Call of Duty is intimidation. A player who is intimidated, is in a 1/6700 chance to not playing their best. So make sure at the first games, your finishing at the top of the final scoreboard(preferably 1st of course).Basically you want to take Step 5 and have them not follow it. You want the opponent to have that nasty thought in the back of their head, on that you are too good for them.

, Headshots win the game for snipers. Aim for the head.

, Stealth is the key to the game. If a player can't see you or hear you, then they can't kill you.

, People might give you a hard time for it, but you'll have the advantage.

, Both of these kill streaks are underused, but can give you a massive advantage. It's recommended to use Jammer over UAV, because it will give you an advantage.

, Learning to use the iron sights can be a real pain, but it is most definitely worth it. Take an attachment like Dual Mag, Grip or Masterkey to really get the advantage. (Although using red dot can be useful if the weapon takes up quite a bit of screen space.)

, If you have a pair of gaming headphones, you'll realize what this means. You'll hear someone shooting at you and can react before they even hit you sometimes.

, Find out what you are good at. If you're quick on your feet it's recommended for a sub-machine gun class. If your more of a patient player, use an assault rifle or LMG. If you are good at camping, try to use bouncing bettys or claymores, and maybe a sniper rifle.

Make sure the spot you're pertaining to is covered (preferably where you can see but if you crouch you're hidden).,
Sight matters.,
If you manage to find a spot in a corner then you've got it made.,
Consider height.,
Width.",How to Find a Good Sniping Position on Call of Duty,";
, If you're behind a bunker, but you can not see through it however, then what's the point in it? So make sure your bunk has some sort of ""foxhole"" or where you can see over it.

, A covered corner is an ideal spot for sniping.

, This is a differentiation type problem. Some people like to be a ground sniper, while others prefer to stay inside building, while some off balconies, and some on top of vehicles. So if you're one who prefers to be in a higher position, make sure you go onto somewhere where there is a wall that you can keep safe behind, but be careful, sniper bullets can pierce coverage. Now, if you're more of a low level sniper then you'd want a spot that is covered where you could go prone, or a cornered position.

If you use a higher sensitivity, you will be able to turn faster, giving you an advantage, but your accuracy might go down as well.

, So many people do this without thinking. Take your time and go round the corner already aiming down sights. You'll gain a massive advantage. If in doubt, then chuck a flashbang or a concussion grenade.

, Practice one on one with a person of similar skill level, or higher if you want. Practice against them in a large map. Switch between this and normal play every couple game sessions. You will get much better at aiming.

, Good players will also anticipate them being built. Outside low-level games, they are very difficult to use effectively.

, They can be used to harass enemy bases, clear expansions/hooks and kill the un-upgraded Prophet. Flamethrowers are good against Covenant leaders. Towards the middle of the game you should shift towards Scorpions; as a general rule, once these are on the field, Warthogs are obsolete.

, Each map is different, and the best player in (for instance) Boarding Action could be horrible in Blood Gulch. Knowing where the sniper rifle or pistol are will become key once you are proficient with them.

, The sniper is by far the most dominant weapon in the game (at least, the original Halo). It can be used as a short or long range weapon, and can kill in mere seconds. It just takes a little practice and some aiming at the head. For those who play Halo PC on other servers and feel as if you are aiming right at the person but are not killing them, then here is your problem and solution. It is because your internet connection is slightly delayed. Therefore the host of the server has an advantage. In order to hit people effectively, you need to aim slightly ahead of the direction in which the enemy is walking. Based on the speed and direction that the person is walking is how far ahead of them you should aim. In order to kill hosts, you need to aim slightly farther ahead of them you would non-hosts. It takes a little while to figure out how far ahead to aim, but once you do, you will find that you play considerably better.

, Many players rely heavily on the rocket launcher and the shotgun when these weapons are crude at best. If you can keep a player at long range, their super weapons lose their effectiveness.In addition, stop using rocket launchers and Scorpion tanks (also, avoid using the banshee, fuel rod gun, rocket hog, and flamethrower in the PC version). These only make you more dependent on weapons which simply require less accuracy. If you force yourself to be precise, you'll develop better skills. The rocket launcher has its place, but it can't be your bread and butter. It should be used mainly against vehicles, also, develop a sense of timing with the rocket, its round will move at a constant, predictable rate so you can time it so that it will intercept vehicles. Also, while using the Sniper Rifle, also try to develop a good ""No-Scope"". No-Scopes are where you are able at aim the sniper rifle at an enemy's head and kill them within short-medium range.

, Use in close range combat. Melees to the back of an enemy and when you're near the peak of jump can be one hit kills.

,
Throw grenades before assaulting a room, before entering a room, before someone assaults you, or any other time during the game. In fact, before you do anything, it is mostly advisable to throw a grenade; especially right before dying.







, You can turn and dodge faster on foot than in a hog. You should learn to time grenades so that when an enemy hog is coming at you, you can throw a grenade at the ground and get out of the way. The enemies vehicle will be blown up in the process.

, For some reason, it takes a while before the bullet is on the spot you're aiming for. Every time you hear a *beep* you hit the enemy. This takes some practice.

, If you want to get good at sniping always have a sniper in your hand. Then you will get good at it.

, Strafing helps you dodge bullets and lengthen the time before you are killed. Don't jump, as other players know how to estimate where you will land fairly well. Strafe in two directions, making sure never to repeat a pattern. Walk a fine line between strafing in too small an area and strafing too far in one direction.

Before the Fight


Connection - Obviously before you play any game you need a descent connection.,
Learn the Basics You can skip this part if you want; this is optional.,
Learning how to Snipe


Snipers can be dangerous.",How to Use the Most Powerful of Weapons in Halo PC," Because during multi-player the game sends and receives packets of data of information of where player in the game are. So you will need a descent connection (Good download and upload ratio).
Lag or no lag? - Before you choose a game that you are going to play. Make sure you close all unnecessary programs in the background because majority of game are monsters when it comes to having RAM on their dinner plate.

Example: if you have a lot of programs running while you play the game, your computer will likely lag/slow down because it doesn't have enough RAM to support both tasks. Close the programs or get a better RAM.
Another thing is look at the ping. Usually the higher the number means higher ping, therefore more lag.
A suggestion when you choose servers, Stick to the servers with a ping around 0-250 these servers will usually be in your favor. Going to servers with 300 and higher ping is a big risk and boring. For the reason you can't aim and you die a lot more often.

;
,


Know your the field like the back of your hand - A sniper is only as good as his knowledge of the battlefield. Without knowledge of the field, an experienced player may have difficulty in using the weapons that he mainly uses. So get out there, make alias profiles and learn the field.
This can be considered as critical and very helpful as well. For the reason that if you go out and experience the field. You may come across a few hiding places where you can snipe from (usually called Camping- If you are going to camp, don't go camping near the enemy's base and spawn killing everyone you see. It will just cause frustration and will probably lead into the enemy flaming you on the server).
Location?! - In addition to the step above(Step 1) learn the spawn locations of the weapons that you want to use. In this case, that would be the sniper and the pistol. Pistols are usually the default weapons, so whenever you respawn you will have a pistol in your inventory.
Facing who? - It may be crucial to found out what and who you are versing using the zoom function will easy give you a long range view of who is coming towards you. For example, you wouldn't just charge aimlessly into a Scorpion moving rapidly towards you. That's just idiotic. Instead you would quickly find a location to hide from it and slowly sneak away. Or you could try to take it out with your sniper when the tank isn't in motion (a.k.a still).

, It can be used to take out any enemy in one shot if you know how.
The reticle - Basically you know that circle in the middle the one that you use to aim? That's the reticle. Snipers have two levels of zoom (2x and 8x). 2x Zoom is used for those at long and short range. 8x However will be usually recommended only for when the target you wish to sniper is at a very long range.
Leading your weapon - Leading your weapon is most vital to you if you want to live after you fired that gun. Leading is where you aim your reticle in front of where the person is going. Leading in most cases must be done because of the lag. The lower the lag the less you have to lead and vice versa. One thing that has to be taken into account is the distance. Usually the further you are, the less you will have to lead.
One Shot Kill - To achieve this, use the lead technique and keep the reticle at head level of the enemy. If you are leading correctly, it should be an instant K.O. This only works for snipers though.
Three Shot Kill - To achieve this you need a pistol. Use the lead technique and fire, If three shots come in contact with the enemy's head it should be an instant head shot.

Make your map.",How to Design a Map for Call of Duties Zombies," the first and hardest part of map design is the theme. It is what makes your map, your map. To decide on an idea, first look at the themes in other maps. They are usually war-related. Next you should look for something that fits with zombies, but doesn't already exist.

Tribal Island
War Struck Town
Labour/Concentration Camp
Mansion;
, You want to make sure you know exactly how your map will work before you start designing it. Use mind maps and try to think about the following:

Perks on the map
Weapons on the map
Wonder Weapon?
Easter Egg Ending?

, It is a good idea to start by drawing a top-down layout of your map. This doesn't have to be the final product, it is just to give you somewhere to start. You should try to include as much detail on this plan as you can. Things like perk locations, doors and box spawns will all help you when drawing your final plan., You now need to check whether your map is going to be fair for the player.

If your map has a Pack-a-Punch, make sure all routes there cost the same amount of points. You should also think about the prices of doors. If a door only leads into one room with not much in it, it isn't fair to charge 1500 points, think half that.
Furthermore, doors out of spawn should only cost 750, and then up in the following order: 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000.
It is also a good idea to think about zombie spawns if you haven't already. Don't make their locations unfair.

, Now the map is fair for the player, you want to check it isn't too generous. Look for potential areas where they could camp or find immunity glitches. Also check that the zombie spawns aren't lacking in any areas, leading to camping. A good way to avoid camping is to include a spawning window at the end of a corridor or potential camping spot., Make this drawing as neat and detailed as you can. Use colours to define important things and even use a form key to help. Include everything your map will include, from easter eggs to zombie spawns. Take your time and don't rush it; it may spoil your finished product., Download the COD mod tools and get started. The longer it takes the better it will look. Some of the best custom maps take months to make, so don't be afraid to spend some time fixing minor details."

Buy Halo for PC or Xbox.,create a profile in the game

,
know where to get a sniper rifle and/or pistol, they are both atop each of the 2 bases on the map (I recommend starting out on Capture the Flag (CTF) because you start off with a pistol already).

,make sure your mouse sensitivity is to your liking, the default X and Y is 3

,know how many shots give you a kill for each gun (1 head shot for the sniper, and 2 shots anywhere else on the body)

,
have a good sidearm in case someone manages to sneak up on you and take it into close range, since the sniper rifle has a very bad close combat effectiveness.,
It would be a good choice to go through the teleporter to snipe, near each of the teleporters, there are 2 hills overlooking each of the 2 bases, this would be an excellent sniping point.

,
An average sniping point is the ledge of the cliff, there is one for each base but i do not recommend it because firstly: it takes a long time to go there by foot, and second: If you go there via a vehicle, it'll be a dead giveaway to your position

,
A good tactic is to snag the fuel rod gun as your side arm, located on the hill overlooking the blue base, it'll be effective if someone tries to run you over with a warthog, it is also pretty useful dealing with foot soldiers too, just shoot at the ground near them.

,
If there is someone manning a turret of a hog, without a driver, take close and careful aim at their head, you don't have much ammo for the sniper, make every shot count.

,
If someone sneaks up on you and he is mid-range, do not try to snipe him, if you have a pistol, good, if you, like me, have an assault rifle, then lob some grenades at him and run up with your assault rifle.,A) The rifle has terrible range and stopping power, if you want to get a quick kill, you better hope the enemy is low on shields, otherwise it make take several clips

,
B) In order for an enemy to sneak up on you, he cannot suddenly go into close range, not without going through the mid range first, therefore the assault rifle and the sniper rifle will be rendered useless.,
Remember, a true sniper does not camp, that is not the most effective way of getting kills, not to mention it makes you head shot bait for enemy snipers.,Do not get power ups like over-shield or active camouflage, they will slow you down and waste time

,
If you snag a banshee, you should go get active camouflage and take the passenger seat of a hog...no one will think of looking there.

,
Always, I repeat, always lead your shots if your enemy is mobile, the bullet is slower than you'd expect and if you don't, you will not hit the enemy.

",How to Snipe in Halo PC on Blood Gulch," You can also download the demo for free online, in which blood gulch is one of the maps included.;
,,,,, I would recommend the assault rifle for close range, and pistol for medium range. A good idea would be to pick up some frag grenades located in front of the teleporter atop each of the 2 bases. In CTF mode, you already start with 2 frags. I do not recommend getting the plasma grenades only because they are very far away from the main areas of combat and will waste a lot of time to get to and from them.

,,,,, However, my recent studies show the assault rifle has very minimal efficiency for two reasons.

,, This is why mastery of the pistol is crucial in the concept of sniping.

, I recommend strafing in one direction, unless you are in the cross-hairs of an enemy sniper, which also makes you head shot bait. If you do get a hostile snipe on your trail, take him out before anyone else in terms of long range because he is the biggest threat to your survival (note, ""in terms of long range"" if there is someone closer to you and is trying to kill you, be it foot soldier or vehicle, take care of them before you do the hostile snipe).

, Once you are ready to try multiplayer, you will need a friend or two with PSPs and a copy of the same GTA game you are using., Then pause it and select ""Multiplayer"" from the menu. Select ""Host Game."" Now you can set the game mode, victory condition, timers, location, and the character you want to use.


For the purpose of this guide, select ""Liberty City Survivor"" or ""Vice City Survivor,"" depending on which game you have. This is a basic deathmatch mode set on one of the city's islands. VCS players will note that they can select individual neighborhoods to play in, but the whole island remains open during the game. Let the other players join and then begin the game.

, You will find your character standing in the game world, holding a Tec 9. This is the default weapon. You can now go and find other weapons, armor, vehicles, and other players to kill. Specific strategies will be discussed in the Tips section. Don't be afraid to use new weapons, try new strategies, and die. Each death will teach you something about the game.

, As you play, think of the best way to counter your opponents' strategies. Are they driving in cars? Use a motorcycle and fire a Tec 9 at them from behind. Are they using a medium range weapon like the shotgun? Stay far away and drop them with an AK-47. Or get in close and use your Tech 9. Just remember that you shouldn't fight shotgun with a shotgun, AK-47 with AK-47.

, While some aspects of the single-player game, such as extended pursuit by the police, will boost your skills, real multiplayer is best. If you are a student, try to play with your friends before school each day. If you work in an office, play with someone during lunch.

, Weapon strategies include:

Remote grenades: These little bombs can be quite handy. You can throw one anywhere, and then switch to the detonator and activate it whenever you want. This weapon is useful for catching other players unawares. You can, for example, flee down an alleyway and leave a remote grenade just inside it. When your pursuer enters the alleyway, detonate the grenade right underneath them. You can also plant one in the street as another player speeds toward you in a vehicle, and then detonate the grenade just as the other player drives over it. The remote grenades cannot be used in multiple numbers (throwing several and detonating them all at once). They also cannot be set off by another explosion, a car running over them, or gunfire. The grenade is visible on the ground, so other players may discover your strategy. Remote Grenades are pale green on your map.
Rocket launcher: The GTA Rocket Launcher resembles an RPG-7. It has a very long range and delivers an explosive projectile at a relatively slow speed. This rocket is easy to avoid when on foot, so the RPG is best used against players in vehicles or those unaware of your presence. Because of the large blast radius, you should not use the Rocket Launcher against nearby targets. One way to use that blast radius to your advantage is to fire rockets at the underside of a bridge or other thin barrier a player is standing on top of or behind. It may not take much health off, but it will definitely rattle the other player. The Rocket Launcher pickup is lavender on your map.
AK-47: The 'K is one of the best multiplayer weapons. It has a high rate of fire, the best range (aside from the sniper rifle) and is used in one of the best tactics available, explained above. The AK-47 is useful in attacking other players at medium to long range, especially if you don't have a shotgun yet. Its high damage lets you drop the other player with ease. This is the best weapon to use when the other player is at range and does not have an AK-47 as well. The 'K can also be used to take out snipers, as they may not realize that you are close enough to use your AK-47. The AK-47 pickup is orange on you map.
Tec 9: This is the most basic multiplayer weapon. You already have one when you spawn. The most important thing to remember when you are using the Tec 9 is that you can move when firing. The weapon is best used up close, and a player using a Tec 9 will win every time against a player with a shotgun or AK-47 if they use it correctly. You have to get very close to your opponent and target them. Make sure to dodge left and right as you approach the other player. Once you have them targeted, run around them in circles while firing. The AK-47 and shotgun cannot hit a swiftly moving target up close. The Tec 9 can also be used in vehicles for drive-bys, discussed later in this section. It is always worth your while to pick up some Tec 9 ammo (yellow on the map).
Shotgun: The shotgun is a slow-firing short-range weapon that is integral to one of the game's best tactics. When you hit someone with a shotgun blast, they fall down and cannot be harmed with bullets until they are on their feet. Explosions will work on downed players, though. Now, killing someone with multiple shotgun blasts is risky because the reload time of the shotgun and the timing of your shots may allow the other player to get up off the ground and run away. The shotgun is also not ideal for use against moving targets, especially those very close up, as the other player could avoid the shotgun fire and eliminate you with a Tec 9. Therefore, it is best to use the shotgun to knock somebody down at medium range and then switch to another weapon. For best results, immediately switch to the Tec 9 or AK-47 and stand in one place while firing at the other player. About 95% of the time, this is an instant kill. Here's why: As the other player gets up(and loses protection from bullets) their head passes through your line of fire. When this happens, the head is destroyed. This is an instant kill, and it works regardless of any remaining health or armor the other player might have. This is the easiest way to score in the game. The shotgun is dark green on the map.
Sniper Rifle: The sniper rifle in GTA has always been a hassle to use. Use this weapon only if you are very, very fast. The best place to use it is atop a building, or some other place where you are out of range, not visible, or hard to reach. The Sniper Rifle is purple on your map. Whilst in zoom, hold L to steady and slow down the movement, thus giving more precision.
Chainsaw: The chainsaw is the ""best"" melee weapon in Grand Theft Auto. It is ""best"" because, though it is highly damaging and fun to use, it can be difficult to wield and usually ends up getting you killed. There is no reason to use the chainsaw when you can use your fists. The chainsaw is pale blue on your map.

, In each multiplayer GTA game, there will be a variety of vehicles that all conform to a set rule. There will always be one type of motorcycle, one type of sports car, and various sedans and vans. Vehicles are generally easy to find and acquire in multiplayer.

Bikes: The motorcycles are some of the most useful vehicles in multiplayer. Because you can shoot straight ahead with a Tec 9, bikes are a good choice against cars or players on foot. You can do strafing runs on walking players by driving straight at them while firing. If you are lucky, you may kill them. If you miss, you can just whip the bike around and try again.
Other vehicles: All of the other vehicles are good for knocking people off bikes and doing drive-by shootings. The drive-by causes much more damage per bullet than regular Tec 9 fire and lets you use your car as an extra layer of armor. Just be ready to bail out if the car catches on fire. Another car strategy is using the vehicle as both a weapon and a diversion. If your opponent is standing in an open area, drive straight at him. Then, right before the car hits (hopefully), bail out the side. With luck, your opponent will have been hit by the car and killed. If not, they are probably confused and think you are still in the car. As they get up off the ground or try to figure out where you are, whip out your shotgun and execute the shotgun/AK-47 attack as explained above.
Repair (VCS only) will fully repair whatever vehicle you touch it with. Don't go out of your way to pick this up, because vehicles are cheap in multiplayer.
You can lock on to cars and bikes that are being driven by an opponent. The best weapons to use against vehicles are the AK-47 (at medium to long range) and the shotgun (at short range.) If your opponent survives the explosion, take them out normally. You may think that the rocket launcher would be a better choice against vehicles, but the slow speed of the rocket means somebody in a car can easily dodge it.
Tires: In Vice City Stories, you can shoot out a car's tires. After 1 is gone driving is hindered, after 2 it makes difficult, and after 3 blown tires moving in the correct direction is almost impossible. A car with all 4 tires shot out is uncontrollable.
You can actually jump over most cars to escape damage. Just face the oncoming vehicle and hit the square button just before it reaches you. You will usually end up on your feet behind the vehicle. Now is the time to hit it with your AK-47. This works on both large and small vehicles, so long as you can jump high enough to get on the hood.

, First are the basic health and armor powerups. These appear as a neutral beige and bright green on the map, respectively. Each raises the named attribute to 100%. Next are the true powerups. When activated, most last for two minutes and are dropped if the player is killed. These can be disabled for a fairer game.

The first powerup is represented by the rampage icon. When activated, the player is given a Rocket Launcher with unlimited ammunition. All of the players other weapons will be unavailable until the powerup expires. This powerup is useful only when you can get to a secure, high-up area and fire almost continuously.
The next powerup is called Mega Damage. It makes all of your attacks four times as powerful. Needless to say, this is one of the most desirable powerups. You can use any weapon you want, and killing other players is much, much easier. The only real problem here is finding enough opponents before time runs out.
The third powerup is called Health Boost. When activated, it makes the player's health regenerate slowly over time. This is not a very useful powerup because the health regeneration is too slow, and any prolonged damage will nullify the effects. This powerup is displayed as a large plus sign.
The fourth powerup grants you invisibility. It is represented by a question mark. The invisibility applies to both the radar and tag that floats above your head. Your character model and vehicle can still be seen, though. One of the trickiest ways to use this powerup is to grab an undamaged car and creep up on the other player. Act like NPC traffic until the other person leaves his car, then break from traffic and run your opponent down. You could also hide somewhere with a sniper rifle, but that's exactly what they expect.

Accept the Resource Pack.,
Enter The City.,
Collect loot.,
Obtain a gun.,
Make money.,
Drive cars.,
Use the bank.",How to Play Grand Theft Auto (GTA) in Minecraft2," The game is most enjoyable when the resource pack is enabled. If you do not accept the download when it prompts you, you'll not be able to see any of the custom items such as:


Custom Gun Textures
Custom Ammo Textures
Car Textures

, When you first join the GTA world you'll spawn at the main GTA lobby arena. In order to play you need to teleport to the city, where you will be able to start your survival on the streets. To teleport to the city right away, just walk over to the Train Station and click any of the buttons; you'll be randomly teleported to a location on the map.

, One of the most important things to do in this game type is collect loot. You'll find all sorts of stuff in chests like this which will help you survive on the streets. For example you will find guns, cars and ammo in these chests. There are thousands of loot crates like this placed around the whole map. Loot chests will repopulate with items after 30 minute intervals.

, Having a gun in your possession is critical, as the main focus of this game is guns; if you don't have a gun you'll most likely just keep getting killed by other players until you find one, unless you're good at hiding. You can get guns from Loot Chests or from the Gun Shop. You can get to the Gun Shop by typing /spawn in chat. Note that you will need to earn some money before you can buy a gun.

, You can make money on Grand Theft Auto by selling unwanted loot that you find from the loot chests. To sell unwanted loot you need to pay a visit to the Pawn Shop which is located in the spawn area too, which you can access by using the /spawn command. The Pawn Shop is very easy to use; you simply drag the items from your inventory into the shop inventory to sell the items.

, If you want to drive a car all you need to do is find a minecart; you can buy one or find one in the loot chests. Unlike regular Minecraft, you can use a minecart on any surface - it does not have to be on a rail track to drive on this server. You can freely drive around in your minecarts and they work just like cars in real life. You can also shoot while driving if you have a gun in your hand.

, The purpose of the Bank is too keep your precious loot safe. If you find something that you don't want to lose then it's best to put it in the bank, that way if you get killed you don't lose everything all the time. The bank is located in the spawn area but you can use the command /warp bank. You use the Ender Chests that are in the bank to store the items.

Build Headquarters.,
Participate in a Free for all.,
Dominate.,
Search and Destroy.",How to Become a Veteran in Call of Duty (by Experience Points)," Headquarters is simply the most safest and one of the fastest leveling up games on Call of Duty. Considering if your team has control of the HQ then you get +10 experience per 5 sec you have control over it. The 10 experience points means you get 5 and your team's overall score get plus 5, so therefore the +10 is split in half.;
, In free for all, if you're the best player in the game then you can rack up some experience quite fast. But only if you're the best player in the game, cause there is a score limit.

, Domination is another fast way to develop experience in both mental stability and in the game. Cause the more flags, of which there are three, your team has, the more experience points that are awarded to your side of the engagement.

, This is the fastest way to develop experience on Call of Duty. But, if you wish to play this type of game you have to know how to play it. In Search and Destroy, you have two opportunities in the game. One, is whenever you have the bomb and your objective is to play up the target with it. There are two targets labeled ""A"" & ""B"". Two, is whenever your on the hunt for the team with the bomb, whilst defending the ""A"" and ""B"" targets. You get +100 experience per kill(which means you get 50, and your team gets 50) and +200 if you successfully plant the bomb(must have the bomb, and you receive 100, and your team receives 100).But on the contrary, if you die, you don't re-spawn until the next round. First to 4 wins the match-up.

Learn and pick a control type suitable for you.,
Optimize your load-out.,
Learn the maps and spawns.,
Communicate well with your team.,
Select your scorestreaks to how well you do.,
Play with a team.,
Watch your HUD.,
Learn to drop and jump shot.",How to Dominate at Call of Duty," With such a varying audience, there are several different control types that are optimal for different situations. The most common, other than default is ""tactical"" this switches the crouch and knife buttons, allowing you to knife enemies easier. There are a variety of options, so test them out for a few games before deciding.


Sensitivity is another factor. A high sensitivity allows you to change targets faster, however a low sensitivity allows you to be more accurate when shooting. A higher sensitivity is best, but if you cannot get the feel for a high sensitivity, sticking to a lower one is better than trying to push it.;
, Every game has guns that are notably better than other guns in the game, for example the ACR and MP7 from Modern Warfare 3. In the same way, there are some attachments that are best for different play styles. If you like to hang back and pick off people, picking a long range rifle or machine gun may be best, along with perks that suit not moving much and attachments to increase range and lower recoil. It would be silly to have extreme conditioning if you don't move during the match. Similarly, it wouldn't be productive to put a grenade launcher if you are a run and gun type of person.

, Especially important in games like Domination and Team Deathmatch, knowing where and when the enemy is going to spawn allows you to kill them almost instantly off spawn in some maps. Take a few games and spectate where people are going, learn the common paths people take and choke points you can use to your advantage. In games like Search and Destroy, knowing where the enemy spawns isn't very relevant, as they won't respawn, but knowing popular routes to the bomb and vantage points to see if someone's planting can be a tide turner.

, Talk to your teammates about what you are going to do, where enemies are, what flags they are taking/bomb they are planting. You can use this to push your advances together in teams, instead of getting picked off in 1 on 1 fights.

, If you get a few kills then die, it wouldn't make sense to pick streaks such as a Tactical Nuke or Swarm. Similarly, it wouldn't be smart to pick UAV's if you can go on long killstreaks almost every game.Select scorestreaks that you know you can get, and will help your overall goal.


If playing in a team, have designated scorestreaks for people to use. For example, have one or two people run ""support"" streaks like UAV, Counter-UAV, and Blackbird/Orbital VSAT/HATR. Have a person run mid-tier streaks that are good at clearing many people at once. Examples include the Hellstorm Missile, Mortar Strike or Harrier Airstrikes. Finally, have one person run big streaks like dogs or tactical nukes, as this allows for many people to help the team overall.

, If you know who you are playing with and how they play, you can adjust how you play to compliment them. If you know someone always rushes in right away, you can watch their back, both protecting each other. With a team, you also are able to communicate better, since you know each other and aren't afraid to talk to them.

, HUD is a heads-up display, that displays things like ammo, score, and a mini-map. If you know you are low on ammo, maybe it's not the best idea to charge into a building full of enemies. With the radar, you can see un-suppressed fire, which shows you the positions of enemies.

, Jump shots and drop shots are done to make it harder for your enemies to hit you. A jump shot is simply where you jump up while being shot at, and a drop shot is quickly going to prone and back up again, which makes it harder to lock on aim to you.

Start Lester’s Assassination missions.,
Go online and access the stock market.,
Buy stocks.,
Kill your target.,
Sell your stocks.,
Buy stocks again.,
Sell the stocks again.,
Repeat Steps 1 to 7 for every assassination mission.",How to Make Big Money in the GTA V Stock Market," After completing the “Fame or Shame” (the fourth mission you need to complete using Michael as your character), pull out your map and you’ll see an “L” icon. This points to Lester Crest‘s—one of Michael and Trevor’s partner in crime—location on the map.


Follow the L icon on the map to find and talk to Lester. He will tell you that he can manipulate the stock market if you perform some assassination missions for him. He will also tell you which stock will lose its value after you perform the hit and which one will sell like hotcakes.;
, Pull out your in-game phone and select the web browser to go online. Your game screen will change into an Internet page.


Control the mouse cursor using the arrows keys on your controller, and click the LCN or Liberty City National, web page from the screen to access the stock market.

, Click the Market tab on the upper portion of the LCN page to view all the current listings of the stock market. Scroll down the list and click on the name of the stock that Lester told you will go up after killing the target.


Click the stock’s name on the list to open it on a new page, and click on “Buy” to start purchasing. Buy as much share of this company as your current money will allow.

, After buying stocks online, press the Exit button on your controller to go back to the game screen. Get into a car and follow the target icon on your map showing the location of the person you need to assassinate. Once you get to the place, pull out your weapon and kill your target.


Assassinations are best done using a sniper rifle from a long-range distance. This will let you kill the target without acquiring a wanted star.
Once you’ve killed your target, the assassination mission will be completed.

, After the hit has been done, wait for a day or two. Visit LCN’s website once more, and go to the Market tab again. On the fourth column you’ll see how much percent each stock went up or down in market value. You’ll notice that after killing your target, the stock that Lester told you will sell like hotcakes, will go up over 100%.


When this happens, click the name of the stock to open it on a new page, and click “Sell” to start selling all the shares you have.

, After selling, go back to the Market tab and look for the stock that Lester told you will go down after the assassination. You’ll find that these stocks have gone down almost 50% in value. Buy a generous amount of this share, but do not spend all your money.

, Wait for a few days again and visit LCN’s website once more. Go to the Market tab and look for the stock you bought in Step 6. You’ll notice that it has now rebounded and regained its lost value before. You can now sell these shares for a higher price than you initially bought it.

, Lester will give you a lot of people that you need to kill. Simply repeat Steps 1 to 7 before and after you complete each of these assassination missions to make big money in the GTA V stock market.

Run around to increase your Stamina.,
Practice to increase your Shooting.,
Increase your Strength by fighting.,
Increase Stealth through practice.,
Get a plane to increase Flying.,
Practice Driving to bump that bar.,
Go diving to increase your Lung Capacity.",How to Maximise All Skill Bars in GTA Online," Find a big, open place and start running around like crazy. Your Stamina skill should be raising as fast as you're running.



Places to go: The docks, Vespucci Beach and the region around it, the bike course.
This will increase your running speed and you'll be able to traverse faster on ladders.;
, Search for a big, rather uninhabited place and get out your rusty old standard pistol. Give it a go; shoot around a little bit and your Shooting skill should be raising as fast as your bullets fly.


That isn't enough for you? - Mark down an Ammu-Nation with a shooting range and add the extra challenge you need.

Places to go: Ammu-Nation with shooting range, the bike course, the docks.
This leads to your aim being more secure, your accuracy and range also increase. This is independent from the Accuracy stat seen in the weapon menu.

, The first of the three hardest skills to master - you have fight. But you'll have to go on the street and attack a big batch of pedestrians, just for a single bar. Rather than doing this and risking your life, search for big, open places, jump into a session with your friends and have a nice brawl!


Also, there are many free time activities such as arm wrestling or you could take a bike tour.

Places to go: The docks, the bike course, Vespucci Beach (at nighttime, there will be fewer people).
This will increase the damage dealt by unarmed melee attacks and increase the chance that a melee attack with a weapon instantly kills another player.

, This is a very easy skill that can be mastered very fast. Get some space around your character, get something heavy and activate stealth mode. Lay the heavy object onto the left thumbstick or the key you're walking to the left with and enjoy the show.


The only thing you have to be careful about is the traffic. The drivers will not stop if they see you creeping up on your car. If you get run over and stand back up, you won't be sneaking anymore.

Places to go: The bike course, Vespucci beach; and pretty much any 15 ft wide area.
This will decrease the noise you make when sneaking and when shooting weapons with suppressors.

, Flying is the second one of the three hardest skills to master. Go to McKenzie Airfield and grab yourself a plane - after making sure you didn't trigger a Gang Attack. The only thing left to do is to activate Passive Mode and fly around until your character has mastered the skill.



Places to go: McKenzie Airfield; any other place you can obtain a plane at.
This will lead to you flying more steady in general and air turbulence will no longer affect you as bad as they do at the beginning.

, This is the second easiest skill present. Get yourself a car or any other vehicle you want and start cruising around Los Santos. A good strategy is to just take the most complicated route through and around the city until your character has mastered the skill.


This will increase the maximum speed your character can drive independently from the Max Speed stat of a vehicle. Also, this will increase the traction and how your character reacts to commands when airborne in a car.

, This is the hardest and most nerve-racking skill of all of them - but not impossible. Get to the docks and find a place high enough to do the special dive animation; there's a good spot with a ladder nearby.Jump into water with special animation
Stay underwater until there are about 0.05 in (1 millimeter) oxygen left in your character's lungs and get up
Swim to the ladder and climb it up - rapidly tap your sprint/run button while doing so.
Restart the list here.
Most likely, it'll take you about 1 hour to get from 0% to a 100% if you do this continuously.
This will grant you about ten times as much time underwater. If you actually run out of oxygen underwater, you'll die slower. You'll be able to ride bikes longer on high-speed without your character seemingly getting a stroke. At last you'll be able to swim and dive faster.

, This way you will not be shot by the police helicopter. Try in a tunnel or under a bridge. It's also good to get up off the ground so the cops find it harder to hit you. To get on a high building, find a helicopter or plane and drop onto a roof.

, Don't concentrate on one area unless all the police come from that place. Look all around you, especially behind you, and don't forget to listen to where the sirens and shot sounds are coming from if you can't find who's shooting at you!

, Do this with a few cars, and just wait for the other speeding cars to smash straight into the block, causing mass fire! Make sure you are far away though, or you will be blown up. This also kills the cops that come along because their cars just blow up. Hours of fun!

Getting to Staunton Island: To get to Staunton Island, from Portland, you first need to use the cheat CHITTYCHITTYBB.",How to Get to Staunton Island or Shoreside Vale in Grand Theft Auto III," Next, you need to find a fast car.


If you want to hijack a police without getting caught, walk up to the passenger side, and attempt to enter the vehicle (or just take one f the cars outside of police station). Wait for the cop to get out and close his door, then you can get in and drive away. Other vehicles that are fast enough include the Banshee, Ambulance,mafia sentinel, Fire Truck.






Go to Callaghan Bridge. If you have not yet unlocked Staunton Island, slowly drive through one of the gaps in the barrier, then drive across the bridge as fast as you can - you'll barely make it to the other side if your car is fast enough. If you have unlocked Staunton Island, drive across normally.






Now to get to Shoreside Vale. Go to the northernmost docks, on the East side of Staunton Island, and hijack the speedboat. Head north towards Rockford.






When you reach the barrier, keep heading North for a while, then turn around. There's a nearly unnoticeable slope in the inside corner between the military base and the rest of Staunton Island. Head for it as fast as you can. If done properly, the boat will fly onto land.






Unlike other vehicles, boats do not blow up when flipped upside down, so don't worry if the boat flipped. What you need to do now is hijack a really big vehicle like a Bus or a Yankee. Do not go far from the boat or it will disappear.






Drive towards the boat in your large vehicle. You may want to kill the previous occupant so he or she doesn't get in your way. Slowly push the boat around the West side of the military base.






When the boat is close to the water, exit your vehicle. Push the boat on foot by sprinting at it. Be careful, you don't want it to fall in yet.






When the boat is about to fall into the water, enter it. If done properly, the boat will slide into the water with you in it.






Take the boat to somewhere on Shoreside Vale that you can get onto from the boat.

Avoid your pursuers.",How to Get a Military Jet in GTA Online," Head to the westernmost side of San Andreas, towards the beaches, and from there, take the Great Ocean Highway all the way north for a couple of miles until the road goes over a delta (where a river meets the sea).


Make a right turn on the last corner you’ll see before the road crosses over the delta. Keep following this road, and make a left turn around the first corner that lets you go left. This will lead you straight to Fort Zandcudo.;
, Just like with previous versions, military bases are restricted areas. The moment you set foot inside, your wanted level will rise up to 5 stars. Head towards the gates of the fort at full speed and ram through the gates. This will make it harder for the guards to shoot at you, increasing your chance of survival.

, Once you’re inside Fort Zandcudo, press the B button (for Xbox) or Circle button (for PS3/4) on your controller to bring up the phone. Select “Lester” (one of the non-playable characters that assists you through the game) from your contacts and choose “Cops turn a blind eye” (costs $5,000 to use) from the available options on the menu screen. This will stop the military guards inside the base from hunting you for 3 minutes.


This step is optional. You can simply take on the military guards inside the base, but this is not recommended as the soldiers here are equipped with heavy artillery, which can kill you with one shot.

, Once you spot a P-996 Lazer, found everywhere inside the base, press the Y button (for Xbox) or Triangle button (for PS3/4) to board the aircraft. Once you’re inside, press the UP button to take off and fly away.

, If you’re still inside the base once the 3 minutes has lapsed, other Lazer jets will start coming after you. To avoid these attackers, simply fly all the way up as far as your aircraft can reach. The pursuing jets will eventually stop chasing you and de-spawn once you’re high enough.


Congratulations! You just got a military jet in GTA Online.
