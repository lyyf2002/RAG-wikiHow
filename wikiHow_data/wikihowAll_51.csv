You'll need to upgrade to the paid version in order to trade items with other players. You can purchase the paid version from the Steam Store, or trade Steam items with other Steam users for a copy of it.;
, Team Fortress 2 items range from extremely common to extremely rare, making the value of your items very important when it comes time to trade. There are a few different ways you can check the value of an item:


Check the selling prices on the community market. You can see this price when you select the item in your inventory. You can compare prices of items to see relative value.
Look up the same item on trading sites to see what other players are asking for it.

, The most basic way to trade with someone is to start the process from a Steam chat window. You can only open chat windows with people on your Friends list. If you've found someone that you want to trade with, you'll need to add them before you can start the trade.


See Finding Other Traders for more information on finding a trading partner.

, You can also right-click someone's name in your Friends list and select ""Invite to Trade"" from the menu that appears.


You can also start a trade with people playing on your current server if you're playing the game. Open the Character menu by pressing M and then select Trading. Choose the Current Server option and you'll see a lit of people connected to the same server you are. When you select a player, a trade request will be sent.

, At the top of the trade window, you'll see a drop-down menu. You can switch between your and your trade partner's inventory.

, You can use the chat box at the bottom of the trade window to coordinate the trade. Check the box beneath your trade offers when you've added everything you want to trade.


When you're trading in-game, you can only offer Team Fortress 2 items. When you're trading through Steam, you can offer any tradeable Steam items.
Not all items are tradeable. You can tell which are by looking in the item's Description box.

, Your trade partner will add the items they are trading into the ""Username offerings"" grid. You'll be able to review everything that is being traded before the trade officially occurs.


When both parties are satisfied with what they are offering, green bars will appear underneath each grid and the ""Make Trade"" button will turn green.

Carefully review the items being offered. Many players will attempt to scam you by offering items that look similar to the one you actually want. Check each item before proceeding with the trade.

, The items will be traded between you and nd your partner. The items should appear in your Inventory immediately., Trade Offers allow you to send a potential trade to someone on your Friends list. The difference between a Trade Offer and a standard trade is that you don't have to perform the trade together. You can send the offer to the friend and then he or she can complete the trade at their leisure. You'll need to be Steam friends with the person that you are making the Trade Offer to.

, You can find this by hovering over your profile name and selecting ""Inventory"" from the menu that appears.

, This can be found above your inventory grid.

, This will open a list of all of your friends. Select the friend that you want to send the trade offer to.

, Use the ""Your inventory"" and ""Their inventory"" tabs to add items to the trade offer. Make sure to select what you want from your friend's inventory.


If you can't see any items in your friend's inventory, they do not have any tradeable items available.
Items added to a trade offer will not be available for other uses as long as the trade offer is active.

, If you need to explain the trade, or just want to leave a friendly greeting, enter the message into the box in the lower-left corner.

, Review the contents of both your offer and the requested items. Once you're satisfied, check the box underneath your offered items and then click the ""Make Offer"" button. The offer will be sent to your friend, and they will be notified the next time they sign on if they are not currently online. If your friend likes the offer, they can accept it and the trade will occur immediately.

, Steam allows you to join Groups, which are collections of like-minded players. You can find lots of Groups dedicated to trading, whether it's all Steam items or specific to Team Fortress 2.


Hover over your username and select ""Groups"".
Click the ""Browse groups"" button and type your search terms. If you're looking for TF2 trades, enter ""tf2 trade"" into the field. If you just want general Steam trading, enter ""trade"".
Browse through the related groups and join any public groups that seem interesting. You can then use the group message boards to organize trades or find people that are offering things.

, There are several very popular sites that are dedicated simply to Team Fortress 2 trading. These sites have powerful tools that allow you to advertise your items and find people with the items you want. Most sites allow you to securely log in with your Steam account, which allows you to load your items and automate trades. Popular TF2 trading sites include:


TF2 Outpost
TF2 Trading Post
Trade.TF
Scrap.TF
tf2trade subreddit

, There are tons of TF2 servers that are dedicated to allowing users to trade. Trading within servers allows you to trade with people who are not on your Friends list. Open the Server Browser in the game and search for ""trade"" in the ""Tags"" field. This will filter the list to just display Trade servers. Join one that's not full. Most trade servers run on custom maps, which will be downloaded automatically if you don't have it.


Players will often say what they are offering in the Chat window. You can use this to organize trades.

, Most players in regular servers don't want to be bothered by trade requests during the game. Unless you come to an agreement with someone, don't spam the chat with your inventory, and don't send trade requests to each player on the server. It is considered polite to confine trading to the dedicated Trading servers.


If you see an item that you really want and know you can make a good offer on, consider sending the player a private message. Understand that many players will not accept blind offers on items they are using.

Select the rocket launcher weapon.,
Face the direction you are going to jump in.,
Move forward.,
Jump.,
Quickly look down towards the ground.,
Fire a single rocket immediately after you've looked down.,
If you follow these steps correctly, you will jump significantly higher than you would normally.",How to Rocket Jump in Team Fortress 2," Do this by adjusting the scroll wheel on your mouse in either direction until you can see that the rocket launcher is selected on the left hand side of the screen. If your mouse does not have a scroll wheel, or if you are playing using your laptop's trackpad, (which, due to the nature of the game, is not generally a good idea) you can also select your weapon using the number keys on your keyboard. Push the ""1"" key on your keyboard to select the rocket launcher. By default, the standard rocket launcher is assigned to the first slot. If it is assigned to another slot, push the number corresponding to that slot to select the rocket launcher. If the rocket launcher is not assigned to any slot, you can do so by pressing ""m."" This will access the load out screen. Assign the rocket launcher to one of the three available slots. This may replace whatever weapon is already there, so choose carefully.;
, For the purposes of this tutorial, it is recommended that you look in the direction you are jumping in. Do this by moving the mouse in the direction that you wish to jump in. You may also jump in place, in which case the direction you are facing does not matter.

, For the purposes of this tutorial, it is recommended that you move in the direction you are looking. Do this by pressing and holding the ""W"" key on your keyboard. If you are going to jump in a different direction, you may also press one of the other directional keys, ""A,"" ""S,"" ""D,"" or a combination of the two to move diagonally.

, Do this by pushing the space bar.

, If you are already looking down, skip this step. Do this by moving your mouse back towards you. It is important to do this quickly, so that you do it just before you reach the pinnacle of your jump.

, It is important to do this as soon as you reach the highest point in your jump. This is important, as it will ensure that you are out of the blast radius of the rocket, and thus out of harm's way. Fire a rocket by pushing the left mouse button.

, Use the ability wisely, and with a little practice, you will become a rocket jump expert! Have fun!

Find a Ranked or Player match to take part in on Team Fortress 2.,
Play as a spy.,
Disguise yourself as an enemy player and blend into the enemy team's ranks.,
Attract the attention of a nearby enemy medic, either by walking near one or by pressing the Right Joystick on your Xbox 360 controller to call for one.,
Let the medic heal you.,
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Master of Disguise achievement has been unlocked for 15 gamerscore.",How to Unlock the Master of Disguise Achievement in Team Fortress 2," Although either will suffice, Player matches do not record your rankings, so any failed attempts will not go against your name. Of course, Team Fortress 2 is an online, multiplayer game, so your Xbox LIVE membership will need to be activated first.;
, This is the only character you can play as to get the achievement. Try practicing using your spy before attempting this achievement in order to perfect your skill.

, This may take several attempts, which will only get harder to pull off if you're uncovered to be a spy several times, so be patient and skillful in your attempts. The trick is to look natural and not panic.

, Make sure you don't put yourself at risk of being uncovered by calling out for a medic - remember, it'll only get harder to unlock the achievement if you are uncovered.

, You don't even have to have taken damage. Only a small amount of healing is required for you to unlock the achievement. You may dispose of the medic as you wish after you are done with him.

Look for trade servers.,
Search on to the website TF2 Outpost (often referred to as Outpost or TF2 O).,
Try busy servers.,
Make sure you're making a profit or that the trade is particularly beneficial to you.,
Keep change on you.,
Don't take up offers that are 'Too Good To Be True'.,
Understand the concept.,
Be patient during the first few steps.,
Don't be afraid to compromise every once in a while.",How to Trade Well in Team Fortress 2," Before you think about how to trade well you'll need to have someone to trade with. Try going into the 'Servers' menu and typing 'Trad' or 'trad' in the search box. This will bring up a list of all the Servers registered as 'Trade Servers', which are places, usually combat arenas of some sort, that allow Traders to meet up and make deals easily.;
, This is a site where you can advertise items that are in your backpack and show what you want in return. It's very useful to use Trade Servers and Outpost, as combining the two will give you an alliance of people begging to trade with you. Remember, though, that you should take down any listings from Outpost if you complete the trade, as your would - be customers might get confused or leave bad feedback, saying that you are 'lazy' or 'aren't dedicated'. However, simply apologizing to the person and explaining what happened is usually enough to prevent them from being negative about your services.

, Once there, try to find the right people. If you go on to a Server full of Unusual - Wearing Pay To Players, the chances are you won't sell a Flare Gun. However, if you go on to a server full of Gibusvisioners, the chances are higher. This does not count as Sharking.

, Otherwise, there's not really any point, is there? Use the site 'Backpack.tf' to check the values of items, and also check the item prices on the Mann Co. Store (though they may be quite overpriced), as you may make a surprisingly good deal with this info.


If someone says 'Umm', 'Err' or 'Let me check something', the chances are they're on Backpack.tf and are price-checking, but there's no harm in that, so don't act too rash.

, Normally, this is only a few scrap/rec, but it's good to have spare metal lying around if your trading partner just can't pay exactly. Don't get frustrated with people who ask for change; they're just like you, after all. Also, if they don't ask for change, but you think it's needed, not giving it to them is completely fine... You lying scumbag!

, Chances are, they are exactly that. The person is probably trying to fool you into giving them good items for poor items, but, if you know the person well, they may just be being nice!

, Scrap-banking is where you ask for one scrap for one weapon, then ask for two weapons from that one scrap. You then sell each of those weapons for a scrap each, and sell those scraps for two weapons each. You then sell each of the four weapons for a scrap each, giving you four scrap. This scrap is then used to buy eight new weapons. Then, these weapons are sold for a scrap each, giving you eight scrap. Eight scrap is then sold for sixteen weapons, and the sixteen weapons are sold for sixteen scrap. Keep going on like this, and you'll have a hefty sum of scrap!

, As time has progressed, many have become aware of Scrap-banking, and that, if they trade one scrap for one weapon, the chances are they aren't getting a good deal. Eventually, you'll get going and, once you have that four scrap, you really begin making a profit. Just think, one more step each time and you get double the amount!

, Others will Scrap bank, too! Maybe sell that eight scrap for 15 weapons instead of 16; just don't expect to have a deal every single time.

Decide on what taunt you will use.",How to Taunt Kill in Team Fortress 21," Each class has at least one weapon that can taunt kill with, so you will need to decide which taunt your will use. Below is a list of all the taunts that can kill and their special attributes:


Home Run (the Scout's Atomizer or Sandman): The Scout points towards the sky, and then swings his bat. This is the longest taunt kill and has a small kill range (jumping in front of the Scout will prevent you from getting hit), however the taunt is completely silent unless you hit someone with it, in which case a crowd will cheer. A good strategy with this taunt is to drink a Bonk! Atomic Punch right before taunting, as the invincibility it grants you is great if someone spots you while taunting.
Kamikaze (the Soldier's Equalizer or Escape Plan): The Soldier chucks his pickaxe over his shoulder, cracks his knuckles, pulls a grenade from his uniform, and sticks his hand with the grenade in it upwards while the grenade explodes. This taunt deals damage to all enemies around the Soldier, destroys any nearby buildings, and is decently quick, however it kills the Soldier upon executing it.
Armageddon (the Pyro's Rainblower): The Pyro blows a bunch of bubbles in front of him while a rainbow with a Balloonicorn appears above him, then leans forward and starts laughing while a ring of fire appears around him and the rainbow turns into flames. If viewed by a person who is not in Pyroland, the bubbles and rainbow will be replaced with fire. This taunt deals damage to all enemies around the Pyro and deals afterburn damage, however it is slow, deals 400 damage (meaning it cannot kill an overhealed Heavy), and every consecutive person that gets hit by the taunt only takes half the damage of the previous person (the first person affected takes 400 damage, the second person takes 200, etc.).
Execution (the Pyro's Scorch Shot): The Pyro turns sideways while sticking his hand out, and shoots the Scorch Shot in the direction that the crosshair was pointing in before the taunt. This taunt is decently quick, and deals afterburn damage, however it uses ammo, deals 400 damage (meaning it cannot kill an overhealed Heavy), and deals the normal 15 damage if the flare hits at medium or long ranges.
Hadouken (the Pyro's Detonator, Flare Gun, Manmelter, Reserve Shooter, or Shotgun): The Pyro brings his hands together and creates a ball of fire, charges up a bit, and releases a burst of fire in front of him. This is the second fastest taunt kill (right behind the Showdown taunt), it can kill several enemies, and can destroy buildings, making it a great taunt kill.
Decapitation (the Demoman's Claidheamh Mòr, Eyelander, Half-Zatoichi, Horseless Headless Horsemann's Headtaker, Nessie's Nine Iron, or the Persian Persuader): The Demoman spins his weapon behind his back, then swings it horizontally in front of him, and then wipes the blade with his finger. This taunt is relatively slow, however a kill increases your head count when wielding the Eyelander, Horseless Headless Horsemann's Headtaker, or Nessie's Nine Iron, as well as completely healing the user and allowing them to switch weapons when used with the Half-Zatoichi.
Showdown (the Heavy's Apoco-Fists, Fists, Holiday Punch, or Saxxy): The Heavy stands still for a few moments, imitates pulling a pistol with his hand, shoots the pistol in the direction that the crosshair was pointing at before the taunt, and then blows the barrel of his imaginary pistol. This is the quickest taunt kill, and has a range of about 9 classes standing side by side, but an overhealed Heavy can survive it due to it doing only 400 damage at long ranges.
Dischord (the Engineer's Frontier Justice): The Engineer pulls out a guitar, plays a few notes, and then smashes it in front of it. This taunt has decent speed, and can hit people that are standing on top of the Engineer.
Organ Grinder (the Engineer's Gunslinger): The Engineer pulls a cord attached to the Gunslinger to rev it up and cause it to spin quickly, and then pushes it forward. This taunt is relatively quick, stuns the enemy on the first few hits, and can be aimed before taunting.
Spinal Tap (the Medic's Ubersaw): The Medic waves his Ubersaw around, then thrusts it forward and then retracts it. This taunt has a relatively good speed, stuns the opponent, and grants 25% UberCharge on the first hit and 75% on the second hit (unless the victim is under the effects of an UberCharge from the Medi Gun or is a disguised Spy, in which case none will be given on the first hit and 50% will be given on the second hit), however, the stun can be interrupted.
Skewer (the Sniper's Fortified Compound or Huntsman): The Sniper takes an arrow, twirls it, stabs forward, and then retracts it. This taunt is quick, relatively quiet, stuns the opponent during the stab, but the stun can be interrupted. If the second hit is interrupted or does not hit, the stun will last long enough to retry taunt killing them.
Fencing (the Spy's Big Earner, Black Rose, Conniver's Kunai, Knife, Saxxy, Wanga Prick, or Your Eternal Reward): The Spy switches the knife to his other hand, swings back and forth a couple of times with his knife, and then stabs in front of him. This taunt is slow, but it can hit multiple people and destroy buildings. The Spy also has an easy time sneaking behind enemy lines, so don't discount this taunt.

Find a suitable target.,
Make your way to your target.,
Once you are at your target, prepare for the taunt.,
Use your taunt.,
Watch as your class preforms the taunt.",How to Taunt Kill in Team Fortress 22," Good targets are usually ones that do not move a lot, or don't move very quickly, such as a Sniper, a Heavy pushing the payload cart, or an Engineer that stands near his buildings. Snipers are particularly good targets as most of the time they stand perfectly still, looking through their scopes. Be careful when trying to taunt kill Heavies and Engineers though, as if the Heavy spots you he can deal some serious damage to you with his Minigun, and the Engineer will likely have a Sentry Gun nearby.;
, Try to flank your target or take a route that isn't used as often, as this will reduce your chances of getting spotted or having to confront an enemy. Use all of the mobility options your class has available to get to your target quickly.


Scout: Use the Scout's double jump and his natural quickness to get to your target quickly. The Scout also has many weapons that help with mobility, such as the Atomizer (allows you to triple jump), the Baby Face's Blaster (speed boost from dealing damage), the Bonk! Atomic Punch (grants invincibility), the Crit-a-Cola (increases speed when ingested), the Force-A-Nature (triple jumps from the knockback of firing it), the Soda Popper (three extra jumps when boost meter is full), and the Winger (higher jumps when active).
Soldier: Make use of rocket jumping. To rocket jump, shoot a rocket at your feet as you press jump and crouch. The rocket's explosion will propel you forwards.
Pyro: The Pyro can hold the Powerjack to gain a small speed boost, or the Pyro can flare jump with the Detonator. To flare jump, the Pyro must shoot a flare at his feet while pressing jump and crouch
Demoman: The Demoman can use any of his shields (Chargin' Targe, Splendid Screen, or Tide Turner) to get a burst of speed, or can sticky jump with any stickybomb launchers. To sticky jump, place a stickybomb on the ground and detonate it with right click while pressing jump and crouch.
Heavy: The Heavy can use the Buffalo Steak Sandvich to gain a speed boost, however be aware that this makes it so he can only use his melee weapon until the effect wears off. While the Heavy's Gloves of Running Urgently also boost speed, they don't have a taunt kill, meaning they can't be used if you want to taunt kill.
Engineer: The Engineer can place teleporters to help him get closer to his target, or the Engineer can use his Wrangler and a mini-sentry to get to high places by standing on his mini-sentry, aiming the Wrangler up, and then shooting himself to propel himself upwards.
Medic: The Medic can use the Overdose to get a small speed boost, as long as he has at least 10% of his UberCharge built, or he can use the Quick-Fix to gain any mobility boosts the person he is healing has, such as the Scout's speed.
Sniper: The Sniper does not have a weapon that grants him increased mobility, however the Sniper is relatively quick naturally, so use this speed to your advantage.
Spy: The Spy can use his cloak and disguised to make it to his target without confrontation. With these, you can take the main route and not have to resort to detours (if the main route is faster), as you will not be confronted if you are disguised or cloaked.

, Some taunt kills have different ranges from one another, so make sure to line up your taunt correctly. If you are using Scout, you might want to drink your Bonk! Atomic Punch (if you are using it) to grant you invincibility in case someone spots you. If you are using Spy and have used your cloak to reach your target, do not uncloak too close to them, as they might hear the uncloaking sound. This is especially true for the Dead Ringer, as it has a loud and distinct. Make sure to also undisguised if you are disguised as you cannot taunt while disguised.

, Press G to use your taunt, or if you have any equippable taunts equipped (such as the Conga), press G twice.

, If the taunt connect, congratulations, you have just preformed a successful taunt kill! If the taunt doesn't connect, the taunt is interrupted, or you get killed, better luck next time! Try again, and hopefully if will connect next time.

Make your way to a spot where lots of easy targets travel to.,
Find a hiding place near the spot.,
Wait for an enemy to come.,
Once a suitable target has reached the spot, prepare for the taunt kill.,
Use your taunt.,
Watch as your class preforms the taunt.",How to Taunt Kill in Team Fortress 23," For example, many maps have an area where lots of Snipers congregate and stand still while aiming, so find one of those spots.

, Make sure that your hiding spot has a line of sight to the spot where the targets go to. Be creative when hiding; use the environment to your advantage. Hide behind objects that people won't expect you to hide behind, such as a bush or tall grass. Try to find hiding places that are high off the ground; many people do not look upwards when searching for people.

, This may require some time, but it can potentially be easier than finding a target and approaching them.

, Since some taunts have different ranges, you must get in the correct position in order for them to hit. If you are using Spy, make sure to undisguise and unclock, and if you are using Scout, you may want to drink a Bonk! Atomic Punch (if equipped) to gain invincibility. If the enemy that has reached the spot isn't exactly a suitable target (such as a Scout that won't stand still), you may want to continue to wait until an easier target has come, such as a Sniper.

, Press G to use your taunt, or if you have any equippable taunts equipped (such as the Conga), press G twice.

, If the taunt hits the enemy, congratulations, you have successfully preformed a taunt kill! If the taunt doesn't hit, better luck next time! Try again, and hopefully if will connect next time.

Sappers.",How to Stop Spies in Team Fortress 2," Pyros and Scouts are excellent at detecting and destroying Spies, but any class will be suitable if you are alert and observant.;
, Spies like to hide and wait for a passing victim to stab. Gain the upper hand by surprising them first!

, You have the power of teamwork in Team Fortress 2. Use it to detect and eliminate Spies!

, The Flamethrower can be used to easily distinguish cloaked or disguised Spies. Use it everywhere, but be sure and keep ammo on hand.

, Spies are always waiting for your back to be turned for an instant kill.

, Cloaked Spies can sometimes be seen as a faint glow or shadow. Look for teammates who are acting strange, or ones you bump into and don't pass through.

, Spies have an extremely accurate Revolver by default that can kill in two to three shots if you don't finish them off quickly.

, When a building is sapped, look for the Spy who placed the sapper. They may be disguised as a teammate! Beware of the backstab while building or repairing buildings as an Engineer.

Play the tutorial mode first!,
Have a computer with sufficient specs for smooth gameplay.,
Be conservative with video settings.,
Learn the levels.,
Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each class.,
Team Fortress 2 is a team-based game, therefore kamikaze gung-ho tactics won't work.,
Communicate.,
Configure your keys.,
Survive!,
If your team lacks a Medic, then become one.,
Complete the achievements.,
Know the balance of power.,
Understand the game's mechanics.",How to Play Team Fortress 2," To find it, look at the bottom of the main home page and look for a spiked ball with a graduation hat on it. You will be granted with four classes that sum up an online team during a game. The Tutorial is split into 2 sections: Basic tutorial and practicing with bots. The basic tutorial shows you how to play Solider, Demoman, Engineer, and Spy. It is strongly recommended to complete all these tutorials to get a good grasp of the types of classes. Practicing with bots is mainly used if you need to brush up on skills, or practice 1 specific class without the pressure of pvp. With Practicing with bots, often referred to as ""Offline Practice"" since you aren't play with others across the world, is recommended to grasp the mechanics of the game, but isn't required. Sometimes putting in 20 minutes of practice with bots can make a difference between a good and bad spy.;
, You'll have to have a constant frame rate of about 30-40 FPS to make gameplay tolerable. To add to this, play on a server with a maximum of 24 players. Team Fortress 2 was designed for this type of lag. But if you do play on a sufficiently powerful computer, it should withstand the 34 player cap. Most servers set up by Valve, under the ""Casual"" tab, are set at 24 players max. Only player-created servers will have the 34 player cap.

, Unless you're running a top-of-the-line gaming system, you'll probably benefit more from performance in an online multiplayer shooter than from visual appeal. The follow tips guarantee a nominal boost in frame rate.


Put all of your settings on low if your recommended settings are medium.
You may think setting sound quality to low would help, but sound is very important in TF2!
Disable anti-aliasing.

, Know which team might have the starting advantage. RED has a huge advantage over BLU team in Payload maps. With payload maps, BLU needs to push a cart with a bomb strapped to it to the end of the map. Red spawns halfway through the map at the start, and are given a minute to build up their defenses. In this time, Medics can get their charges ready and Engineers can build up some turrets. After a minute is up, BLU's doors open, and the battle begins. In most maps, RED is defending an objective from BLU. Some maps have both teams fight for 1 control point, these maps are know as King Of The Hill. Other maps require a team to steal the other's ""intelligence"" 3 times to win. The intelligence is a color briefcase full of classified documents. This mode is known as CTF.

, Work out which classes are suited to which maps. In maps with an objective, Scouts are a good pick. One of Scout's strong points is he captures points and pushes payloads as fast as 2 people. Scout also runs at about 130% speed, making him the fastest class in the game. This makes scout incredibly good at capturing points and running ""circles around the enemy."" Sniper will also be a good pick for control point maps. He must stay out of the fight, and train his rifle on the control point. To capture a control point, a player must stand on the control point for a bit of time depending on how many people are on the point. Because of this, players tend to stand still on the control points, leaving Snipers to pick away.

, This is not like Call of Duty, work together as one. Depending on the objective, you are either holding down an area or pushing forward.

, TF2 offers a wide variety of ways to communicate with your team. You can either use the chat, both team chat and all chat (both teams see it), use pre-set voice commands, such as ""Go Right"" or ""Incoming!"". Each class has the same commands, but different ways of saying them. For the most specific, use voice chat. If you have a microphone, you can use it to say anything you want! For this reason, many parents would rather not their children use voice chat, and there are some settings in the menu to disable voice chat if you are hearing bad words. Communicating with the rest of your team is essential to winning the round, whether you're typing in team chat. Work out a plan for maps and classes so that you know where everyone is and going to.

, There are many functions in Team Fortress 2 bound to keys, all configurable. Put the keys where they make the most sense for you. With features like fast weapon switching turned on, you will be more effective in the heat of battle if you don't have to look at the keyboard.

, It's easy to keep suicidally running at the enemy shooting wildly - but don't forget that you're far more valuable to your team alive than a corpse on the frontline. Every team has a Medic to keep them alive. Call for him to heal you up. Medics can also temporarily over heal you to 150% health!

, No team can win without them! Playing Medic is also a great way to learn a map. (Do the same for each class. If your team lacks a lot or has none of a certain class, fill that spot!)

, Every achievement that you complete with a certain class counts to a special weapon that's in your taste. After you reach a milestone, you may earn a weapon. Practice with the weapon and find out your best tactic. The game also has a ""Drop System"", in which you may get hats and other weapons after playing for sometime.

, Only professional Scouts can kill Heavies. A Pyro can reflect projectiles, meaning death to Soldiers and Demomen. Snipers are easy targets for Spies as Snipers tend to stand still while aiming and don't pay attention to their surroundings that much. (These are the classes that balance each other out, not necessarily the only way to kill each class)

,


The chance of random critical hits is higher if you dealt more damage in the past 5 seconds.
Most weapons deal less damage over longer ranges. Some are not affected by range, and some actually deal more damage over longer ranges. Critical hits aren't affected by damage falloff (for example, a single critical pellet from the Scout's Scattergun will deal 18 damage at any range, with 10 pellets fired per shot).

Figure out the goal.,
Choose a class.,
Upgrade before each round.,
Find a good spot.,
Work with your teammates.,
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.,
Try all the classes.",How to Play Mann vs Machine in Team Fortress 2," MVM maps all have robots carrying a bomb to a hole, and if they jump down the hole with the bomb, you will lose the round. Destroy robots by shooting them. After robots die, they will drop credits. You can upgrade your stats, such as movement speed and bullet resistance, or your gun's stats in the Upgrades Shop. Special classes have special abilities, such as the Scout's ability to pick up credits in an area or the Engie's ability to build two-way teleporters. Look at the ""Select class"" page and look at the MVM abilities for each class.;
, If you want to put out heavy damage, choose a class such as Soldier, Demoman, Heavy, or Engineer. If you would like to take down one robot at a time, take Pyro, Spy, or Sniper. Medics and Scouts are in a league of their own, as scouts do plenty of damage but many just collect credits, and medics can upgrade their medi gun to heal insanely fast. Medics can also, with upgrades, press Mouse-3 to deploy a red shield that will block 50% of projectiles headed that way. This is extremely useful against a wave full of Soldiers and Demomen.

, You start most maps with 400 credits, so pick a statistic you want to upgrade and put some money into it. For example, if you want to pick up credits and not do much damage first round as Scout, upgrade Movement speed. If you want to do tons of damage, upgrade Scattergun's damage. Each class different upgrades based on their weapons and role.

, Snipers, Engineer sentry guns, and Demos will want to be on high ground to launch their attacks. Other classes, such as Spy, won't be any help 100 meters away from the fight. Spies, Scouts, and Pyros need to be right in the robot's face, attacking them directly. Heavies, Medics, and Soldiers should not be right next to robots, but within shooting distance.

, Cooperate and try to have a even split of classes. Six Heavies will do worse than a Soldier, Demo, Scout, Heavy, Engie, and Medic. If your team has an even spread, you will maximize your damage and effectiveness.

, You learn by failing in this mode, and it is rare to play the very first time and beat all 6-8 rounds. Learn which classes are good against which bots, and adjust your playing strategy appropriately.

, If you are a Sniper main, try out Spy or Soldier. While Sniper is good at killing enemies far away, he won't do well against tanks, because you can't headshot tanks. If you go against a tank, take Demoman or Heavy, which do very well against tanks.

Gather your items.,
Use the Scattergun.,
Assess the Scout's abilities.,
Remember your speed.,
Remember your health.,
Use your double jump!,
Take the front lines!,
Contribute to your team, and don't be self-centered.",How to Play As a Scout in Team Fortress 2," As discussed above, Scouts have a 6/32 medium-close ranged Scattergun (Primary). Aside from this, he also wields a 12/36 medium ranged Pistol (Secondary) and finally, the Bat, which is completely deadly for picking at the opposing players' health until death (Melee). The other two weapons are his speed and double jump, which the Scout possesses for movement, confusion and evasion. Learn these in a combo.;
, It is very powerful. It works well in medium ranges and can be lethal at short range. It is stronger than the regular Shotgun. To do maximum damage with this weapon, you have to be up close to your target. Reload this weapon whenever you're out of combat range, and make sure to think ahead and plan your reloads carefully if you have to do so during battle. This could mean popping behind some cover to do so.


Use the Pistol in long ranges. The Pistol is the most accurate weapon the Scout has, and it is perfect for picking off enemies who try to flee. This weapon does more damage than the Scattergun at long ranges. The Pistol also has a very fast rate of fire. You can use it as a second-hand weapon to the Scattergun. To fire it at maximum speed, you should rapidly click the mouse button instead of holding it down.






Use the Baseball bat at point-blank range. The baseball bat can be lethal when in range. It is also very fast. However, if you miss a swing, your plan could go awry. You should only use this on an unsuspecting enemy whose back is turned, or when the Scattergun and Pistol are not available for use. This weapon, compared to the other melee weapons in the game, swings faster, but each swing does less damage, so it isn't like the burst damage of the other melee weapons. Beware if your target is also trying to use their melee, as a critical hit from it will kill you instantly if your health is low.







,


1. The Scout runs around 1/3 faster than the other classes that run at standard speed. The Scout is also capable of using a double jump to dart around in the air during combat or reach places unreachable to other classes (excluding Soldiers and Demomen). The superior speed and movement is one of the key abilities to his style of gameplay, and you should hardly ever be staying still. Jump around and move in unpredictable patterns during combat to make it harder for the enemy to aim at you, giving you a further advantage.






2. The Scout has a health pool of 125 HP. This is one of the Scout's main weaknesses; being exposed to heavy damage (such as a Heavy's Minigun or a Sentry gun) will kill you very quickly. You will be constantly rushing for health packs or a Medic to keep yourself alive. Make sure you memorize the maps you play on so you know how to retreat from a battle or rush for a health pack to heal you.







, As a Scout, your biggest advantage is speed. This allows you to escape in tight spots. Scout, with the exception of Spy, is the only class who can get into a fight and get away clean by running away. You can run across places other classes can't. You can easily capture the ""intelligence"" in Capture The Flag games. You can also easily capture control points, as Scouts capture twice as fast, and can run before any enemies attack them. You can also use your speed, to a certain extent, to avoid enemy fire, although don't rely on it for heavy, concentrated fire. Jumping around and running in unpredictable patterns in combat makes it harder for the enemy to accurately aim at you, so use this to your advantage.

, As a Scout, your biggest disadvantage is your low health pool. Your health pool is at only 125, so you will be constantly rushing around for health packs. Make sure you memorize the maps and remember where they are. One of the best way of staying alive is attacking while your targets are focused on killing one of your team-mates. If you are at the center of attention, you are likely to take heavy damage and die very quickly.

, As a Scout, you can, while in the air, jump again to get a double jump. You can reach places inaccessible to other classes (excluding Soldiers and Demomen). Utilizing your double jumps to take small shortcuts on maps can make you traverse even quicker, or get you into advantageous positions (e.g. straight behind your targets without them knowing, allowing you to wound or even kill them).

, Scouts aren't particularly known for their defensive abilities, but they perform at their best on the front lines. Being in a small group is the most convenient, as Scouts are known to die quickly if they're on their own with a lot of enemies surrounding them. Assisting your team-mates in attacking ensures the highest rate of survival for you, if your enemies keep their attention off you. Strike at them from positions they wouldn't expect, and even if you don't manage to kill them in the first encounter, run off to get a health pack or something else, and strike again when their attention is focused on something else. Scouts are probably at their weakest if they get caught up in direct confrontations. Assisting other players attack and attacking from unexpected positions greatly bolsters their ability to perform better.

, Scouts aren't well known for massive killing sprees. Helping your team through a group perspective, such as capping the point, or attempting to get the enemy Intel, is an area where you shine, as you are specialized in doing these things (Scouts cap twice as fast as other players, and can make great carriers due to their speed).

Practice.,
Play the best that you can.,
Know the game.,
The Three.,
Shooting.,
Dodging.,

Explosives.,
Shootable Grenades.,
Dedication.",How to Become the Ultimate Player in Call of Duty," Nobody gets anywhere without practice. You need to invest a quality amount of time into Call of Duty to become an ""ultimate player."" This is will also help with dedication, in consideration this process can be lengthy.;
, Always go after higher levels such as level 55's. If possible, during a match like ""Search and Destroy"", whilst your in kill cam, go to the level 55's. By doing this, you are able to watch their actions and predict future moves.

, You need to know the weapons, classes, levels, and techniques. This will allow your knowledge to carry with you while in the heat of battle. A good way to do this, other than playing a traditional match, is playing with a friend and roaming the levels. Use multiple weapons to get a better feel for the game.

, Modern Warfare, World At War, and Modern Warfare 2 are all considered ""The Three"". These games are what you should attempt to master. If you have the knowledge of all three games, then this should improve your skill in Call of Duty by suggesting different ways to approach situations/other players.

, Shooting is what will get you to be the player you want to be. You have to know where to place the bullets and when to shoot them. Sometimes shooting at the target won't work, due to the targets possibility of moving an inch, which would make you waste ammo.

, Another key is dodging bullets shot at you. If you can not do this, then you'll find yourself dead more than alive. Two great ways to do so is by watching the person and moving the opposite direction that their firing quickly or drop shooting.

, This tactic assists you in going further in the game. It allows a kill with no ammo loss plus a skill increase in one of the less common skills. Practice often to help with this technique.

, No player gets any further without being a master arsonist. You need to know how to place grenades and stun bombs. This way you can use it for your advantage. This can be mastered in almost all of the game plays.

, This step is the same as above, but slightly more time consuming as it takes more practice to place a shot grenade instead of a thrown one.

, There is no doubt that you'll get bored while doing this, but with a promise, it'll all pay off in the end when you start kicking some rear end around on the playing level. Create a dummy account where you can practice or get to know the maps online first hand, if you do bad then it's ok because you are practicing. After you have practiced and feel that you're good and confident enough then create an another account so you can have bragging rights to your friends that you have a high KDR.

, Set the sensitivity that you are comfortable playing with. Try a few different sensitivity options and see which one suits you the best.

, Playing more than one part (or version) of the game will acquaint you to the different maps and situations of the game. Try using multiple guns and see which one suits you the best. Different maps may require different types of guns.

, Playing multiplayer will help you face tougher situations and will make you think of different strategies/ tactics.

, Communication is a very important part of any Call of Duty game. Most of your communications will be taken up with relaying or receiving locations or enemies or objectives.

, Watch other players and observe their tactics. Try using YouTube to watch game-play and tactical videos.

, Use button layout for drop shooting. This allows your player to drop while still shooting. Try disabling vibration. This will allow your controller not to rumble when shooting someone. It can cause a distraction and we need none of those.

, Learning your maps and the hot spots, will only add on to your kill-streaks, and make the game difficult for the other players. Master the maps, you master the game.

, Aiming is your bread and butter. Learn how to perfect it. You'll know when you mastered aiming when you see 3 threats heading your way, facing your direction, and you take out all 3 of them, without having to reload. Dodging and using cover is your peanut butter and jelly. Learn to master dodging and using cover, will make you a hard target to hit. You'll know you mastered dodging and using cover when, you have 4 threats shooting you from different directions and you don't get hit by any one of them, then you take them out.

, Use your brain. If you shoot someone and don't kill them, don't go chasing after them, unless you know for sure you'll get the kill. Instead, chill, let the enemy go. Living is better than dying.

, But only the best will dedicate themselves to it and do it everyday and give it 150% every time. That's what a master does. That's what the best do.

, Spawn killing is a tactic looked down upon in the CoD community. If you choose to use this tactic, do not be surprised if you receive hatemail.

,, Even if you're face to face with a guy with an automatic weapon, you can still kill him. Hide, move farther away, always keep moving (unless hiding), and don't be afraid to use your pistol.

, Attempt to run away and flank, or ambush them from another angle. This should go unsaid.

Design the class you wish to use for sniping.,
Practice your aim.,
Find a good spot to snipe from.,
Take out your target(s).,
Leave your spot if you have drawn too much attention.,
Keep an eye on your bullet clip.",How to Be a Better Sniper in Call of Duty," When you begin playing Call of Duty online, you will not have a wide selection of sniper rifles to use; more experienced Call of Duty players will have more sniper rifles unlocked. Choose a sniper rifle, as well as a backup weapon you are proficient with, then design the rest of your class to your choosing. Most snipers try to make themselves stealthy through the use of suppressors, smoke grenades, Claymore mines (to cover your back when hiding), perks that muffle noise, etc. Once you have used a certain sniper rifle for a while, you may choose to customize it with attachments and camouflage.;
, Sniper rifles are useless to most players unless the player can aim the rifle properly down sight. Practice is best done against friends in a private lobby or against enemy bots. If you can't find anyone to practice with, or your version of Call of Duty does not support the use of bots, try practicing in the campaign mode, or by shooting inanimate objects in a private lobby by yourself.

, You should plan to stay unseen and be able to take out a high volume of enemy players from this spot. Your spot should be a good vantage point for a large area of the map, yet not dangerous or conspicuous. Try spending about 30 seconds to 1 minute to scout your spot; once it looks clear, situate yourself.

, Look for enemy players. If you have chosen a good spot, enemy players should be readily visible. Don't waste time aiming for their head if it is too difficult a target; sniper rifles will often eliminate targets in one to two hits if opponents are shot above the waist. Aim for the chest area first; if you cannot line up your sniper rifle's crosshair with the target's chest, try aiming for the target's legs. As soon as your target is steady in the crosshair, take the shot.

, It is difficult to take more than 2 shots in one location. If it seems that the opposing team has not discovered your location, then you should check your rear and see if you are being ambushed. Do not sit somewhere for so long that enemy players can easily find and kill you.

, If you are a productive sniper without a Scavenger perk, your clip will run out of bullets before you die and respawn. In this case, you should switch to your backup weapon and search for another primary weapon. If you do not have a backup weapon, use your knife.

Take up position behind the cart to cover from enemy fire and keep the payload moving to its terminus.,
Run on ahead small distances to remove enemy resistance before the payload gets near.

Slow moving classes (with plenty of health) should get on top of the payload to keep it moving and provide support to those on the ground.,
Keeping the payload moving forward is imperative, so stay near the payload.

,
Medics should save Übercharges for blasting through enemy defenses where they are stronger.

,When at low health, consider pushing the payload and getting health and ammo instead of asking Medics to heal you or going to the respawn cabinet

",How to Play Team Fortress 2 Payload Gamemode1," Demomen may shoot over the payload to eliminate enemy sentries.;
,, For instance a Heavy traveling in this fashion can keep the path of the payload clear from an elevated viewpoint whilst being supplied with health and ammo from the payload

,,,"
"
Know that the Engineer's role cannot be understated here as level three sentries prevent the slow moving opponent force from moving forward.,
Preventing enemies from getting near the payload for 30 seconds will start the payload moving backwards (if it is ""overtime"", you only have to wait 5) (these are the default settings for official Valve Payload servers, community ones can have more or less time for these things to happen).,
Try to keep your team together.",How to Play Team Fortress 2 Payload Gamemode2," Sentries are, however, quite vulnerable from sneak attacks by spies, so stay near the sentry. Teleporters are imperative for any chance of holding a capture point as getting to the front by walking takes too long.

, This is the only way to push back.

, A defending team that is spread-out makes the job of the attacking team much easier. There is no reason to go away from the Payload tracks because the Blue team that is pushing will mainly be on those tracks, it is the only way for them to win.

There is one inside the Undercroft (0G Room), on the opposite side of the wall where PAP is.;
, Once you've fed all three dragons, go in the Undercroft (0G Room), go up the stairs, and you will find your very own bow., Then, go and pick up the arrow that pops out of the wall.,

The first one is directly beside the clock tower outside the map.
The next one is east to the KRM wall buy.
The final one is at the rocket pad, with a bunch of sticks on top of a stone slab.

, Once it turns on, you'll see these wind symbols on the walls. You need to wall run to all of them, and you cannot touch the ground. If you touch the ground, you will need to wall run all the symbols again. You'll know you're finished if you hear a sound cue after hitting the final wind panel., The locations of these earns are:

In the clock tower, underneath the staircase.
In the lower courtyard, near the jump pad and build table.
The final one is in the rocket pad near the teleporter.

, To charge your arrow, you need to hold it back like doing a power shot, and go up to the earn. If you miss the shot, you need to charge the arrow again. This can be frustrating, but it's achievable!, Go where you picked up the arrow, and hold square if on PS4, or X if on XBOX. It will take your arrow and slowly come back down again with a solid straight arrow. Pick it up, and you're on to the final step., Hold Square (PS4) or X (XBOX), and you'll get a max ammo. As similar to all the other bows, you must feed the arrow souls, until it has a blue fire effect. Hold the reload button on the arrow while holding your bow out, and it should take your bow.

You’re a silent soldier.",How to Be Stealthy in Call of Duty," Silence is the key to stealth. So therefore when you’re at the beginning of a match, be sure to have both weapons attached onto a silencer. This away whenever you fire, you'll be impervious to the UAV. It also helps to have the UAV jammer perk as well, because this will allow you to be totally unknown.;
, Not many people seem to do this. You’re running the same speed as if you were to be standing up, but however, you make no noise when ever you’re crouched. So always, or in most cases, keep your crouch on.

, Snipers are the COD ninjas' one weakness. Snipers can see almost everything, especially when it's moving. So keep an eye out.

, Because whenever a grenade is thrown, if it doesn't at least harm someone, then they'll have an eye out for the direction the explosive came from. So keep the grenades pinned unless absolutely necessary.

, You'll have to have some patience. Usually people who stealth, have to camp in places for quite a while. Sometimes up to 5 minutes. So make sure your patient whenever sneaking around a map.

, Any person in the game isn't good to be around you. Let alone an enemy soldier. So if one of your teammates is sticking around you, be sure to get away from all notations of life. The worst thing is to have a crowd around you whenever you’re attempting to stealth to the enemy's side of the map.

, If you've done all of this correctly then you should still be alive, or at least with a low number of deaths. Congratulations.

On the first round, let the zombies break down the barriers.,
Shoot 'em up.,
Go out by the PM63 (but don't buy it), and open the next door for 1000.,
After about 3 rounds here (so about 5-7) you should have the points to pass up the MP5K in the next room and go straight to the power.,
Have one person in the back by the window grab claymores and the M16, and the other needs the M16 and the MP40 from earlier, and they should take the front.

,
The person in back can place claymores against the wall to save them for later, and also provide a few facing the other person as a backup space for when they need some breathing room.,
So, you can help the guy in front thin the zombies coming from the dressing room, allow your clay by the window you were guarding go off, then need to use the backup, replace them all, and still have claymores to spare.

,
You can trade off on the door or window, or let the more skilled player take the front while the other handles the window.,
Leave out (turn the power on) only when you have at least enough for Jugg and the bowie knife (so around 7000 each.),
Now, use the knife to take care of any crawlers, as it should be around a one hit kill or a shot or two and a one hit kill.,
A this point, the accepted strategy is to run the level counterclockwise from the start to the theater, through the middle, and repeat.,
Simply open the area to the Alleyway (through the back door of the stage toward the AK74u) and post up by the door in the back.

,
DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR!,
Sit back by double tap and watch that window.,
Using this strategy (and leaving a Stubbs* at the end of a round to hit the box, upgrade, etc.)",How to Be a Team Player in Nazi Zombies," Don't worry, they are REALLY slow. Simply knife every zombie once for a cool, easy 130 points each. To maximise the amount of points you receive per zombie, you should shoot them in the leg four times and then knife them. An easy 170 points a kill. At this rate you should have your first grand in no time.;
, This round is also very easy, if you are good with a pistol. You will want to go for chest shots, and drop 4 rounds into each zombie (same strategy as before, but chest shots do more damage). A knife will then kill them.


Every level thereafter, it will take an additional 4 shots and the stab to kill them, so a whole clip and a stab on level 3 (note that it is possible to kill them with only a clip with occasional headshots).
After round 3, it is slightly dangerous to keep with the pistol, as you'll need to either get consistent headshots or reload for each zombie, however it does still get points like crazy.
At the end of round 2, you should have the points to open the top door.

, This leads you to the MP40 and Stakeout. One person takes the top by the window and the table, and the other can watch the two windows on the bottom. All the zombies will walk toward the person on the top, so the bottom person can use the pistol to rack up points. The person on top is recommended to take the MP40, but nobody should grab the Stakeout.

, DO NOT TURN IT ON. This is the best place to rack up points in the level.

,, When you save claymores, it allows you to use more than two when the situation calls for it.

,, It all depends on how you prefer to play.

,

, The reason the Bowie Knife is a necessity is because the crawlers will not explode when you kill them with it. Plus, it make the Ballistic knife ridiculously powerful when stabbing.

, This should get you to a high round by itself. However, if you dislike crawlers enough to merit buying the bowie knife, you can get rid of them entirely here.

,, This is crucial.

, One player (with monkey bombs and a thundergun) sits by the door and shoots the zombies coming down the alley. This player RUNS THEIR GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF AMMO TO RELOAD. Failing to do so will open the door, causing crawlers to pour in and zombies spawning behind your group. The other two stand facing down the alley in line with chain link fence.

, you can permanently rid yourselves of the crawlers. Using these simple methods, you can have fun, help your team, and not seem like a total douche in online zombies. Read on for more helpful tips on how to be an efficient, number crunching zombies player.

If you want to be able to trickshot last, you are going to need to leave some weapons on for trickshotting, or set up the preset classes to be able to trickshot.

, Most of the maps mentioned have a way of killing the enemy repeatedly as soon as they spawn. When you get the location and timing of when to shoot down, beating your opponent should be a breeze.

, Have a piece of paper or an emblem that has your Win/Loss Ratio; it's no fun to play competitively if you don't have a way of knowing how good you are doing.

, Turn off all tactical and lethal. Also, put it on a map mentioned above and adjust the time limit to infinite, and the score cap to you and your opponent's liking

, The jump shot is the act of jumping while in a gunfight in the hopes that it will make you a harder target to hit. Dropshotting is where you quickly go to prone in a gunfight, to again, make you a harder to target to hit. Don't forget to adjust your aim when doing this.

, This has a lot to do with experience, knowing common places people like to go and shooting before you actually see the person guarantees you the kill if you are right about where they are.

, Contrary to what the name would suggest, this is not a glitch, but a mere tactic in which you can see your enemy, but he can only see the top of your head. This is good against amateur players, but if your opponent is a veteran, this will make it easier to kill since your head is easily shot at.

, Knowing what each gun is best used for is important if you don't want to die. For instance, you wouldn't shoot someone right next to you with a rocket launcher or shoot a tank with a pistol.

, This sounds stupid but you should always take aim at the best player and try to kill him/her more than the other players. This makes the other players scared of you and less likely to want to find you. That is, unless they have a sniper rifle.

, Have a cool and funny name like 'Pony Slayer' or 'Bullet on you'. If your name is your first name or something like 'Halo Dude', you probably won't be very scary.

, The Fun Way is taking two SMG's, Needlers, etc. and just going on a rampage.

, This means get in the biggest vehicle in the match and just shooting every freaking thing you see. Don't stop shooting because the vehicles never run out of ammo and you will be twice as scary.

If all else fails, go play outside for a while.",How to Pwn in Halo for Noobs," Don't get frustrated as you won't think clearly and will probably just end up rushing shots and shooting blindly. Laugh at your mistakes. Laugh at your enemy. This helps a lot. You might also try keeping a glass of cola nearby, sipping it every now and then.;
, Banshees and Scorpion tanks both have weak spots on them. If they're in a Scorpion, you'll want to shoot at the cockpit (you'll notice the targeting reticle flash to red). If a Banshee is buggering you, shoot at the two feet hanging out the back as the pilot turns to get another shot at you. For players on foot, just snipe them anywhere (if you're not playing host, aim a little in front of them). Who needs head-shots? As soon as you've targeted them, double-click, and you've nailed them.

, Frags recommended when being rushed by a Warthog or swooping Banshee as they explode more quickly. You can also use plasma grenades to stick an oncoming vehicle. You may have been run over, but soon enough you'll respawn in time to watch them explode and possibly snipe them as they respawn.

, If you're tired of being blown away all the time by a tank, sneak into one of your own and go for it! Now you've got a 50% chance of killing them. Don't get too excited and rush it though.


Use buildings and bumpy terrain to your advantage, especially on Blood Gulch. Try to stay on lower ground than your opponent. Trust me, it helps. If you do manage to kill them, get even with them! Kill their spawn for a little bit, maybe two or three times max. Anymore and you're an official hypocrite.
Killing Tank Spawn Killers in Blood Gulch is especially tough. If you're on a blue team and tanks are on the hill spawn killing, take cover behind the small hill in front of blue base (don't worry, tank rounds shoot straight, not over the hill). Switch to pistol, peek above the hill enough to take aim, and shoot the tank driver.

, When they try to run you over with a Scorpion, don't run away. That's exactly what they're expecting you to do. Run towards them. Chances are that they'll think you've got something tricky up your sleeve and panic! This is your chance to stick them with a plasma grenade or snipe them.

, You're too good for them! Why waste your time with them? You've got better things to do.

Select campaign mode.,
Start a new campaign and choose ""heroic"" or ""legendary"" difficulty.,
Try to play through the first few stages at least.,
Think about how difficult the campaign was for you.","How to Tell if You Are a ""Noob"" in Halo1"," Making it through the campaign is not a real indicator of your skills in multiplayer, but struggling with it is a definite sign that you won't be among the online elite.;
, These are significantly harder than the easier difficulty levels, and will prove reasonably challenging even to semi-seasoned Halo players.

, If you can, play through the entire campaign, but you don't have to if you only want a basic evaluation.

, Ask yourself some basic questions about your performance, and be honest with the answers. If you answer ""no"" to any of the following questions, you are very likely still a noob.


Could you make progress easily without having to try to die several times fighting the same wave of enemies?
Did you always have a good sense of where to go and how to read your radar?
Were you able to effectively manage your ammo and other resources?
Were you able to drive the vehicles without falling off cliffs or rolling over?

"
"
Set up a simple game of Halo with several of your friends.,
Set the kill count to over 100.,
Consider your performance after the game.,
Check for ""noob habits.""","How to Tell if You Are a ""Noob"" in Halo2"," Try the following settings to have a well varied experience and make sure you get a chance to use all the different weapons and vehicles.


Select the Slayer game type.
Set first and second weapons to random.
Have shields on.
Include random tanks, turrets, and light vehicles.
Include Overshield and Active Camo power-ups on the map too.

, The exact number doesn't matter, but set it high enough so that you will be playing a single game for an hour or two. This may seem like a long time, but will go quickly.

, Compare your kill count and death count to your friends. If you are clearly at the bottom of the pile, there is a good chance you are a noob. Some other factors to consider include:


How good are your friends? If they are Halo experts, you shouldn't feel too bad if you can't keep up. If this was their first time playing, you should be able to clean house—unless you are a noob.
Were you constantly confused about your location on the map? Understanding and being able to instinctively navigate the main maps is one of the basic skills non-noobs develop.
Did you accidentally kill yourself often, either with explosives or by falling off the map?
Did you die quickly, or were you able to respond to an attack and put up a fight?
Could you make decent use of any weapons you picked up? Seasoned Halo players should especially be skilled at the assault rifle, the battle rifle, the shotgun, the sniper rifle, and both frag and plasma grenades.
When you got in a vehicle, were you quickly killed or kicked off?
When you picked up a power-up, did you make good use of it? Or did it not seriously impact your effectiveness?

, For many Halo players, a noob is not just one who is unskilled at the game. The term is also used to describe players who use cheap but often ineffective tactics that are usually frowned upon. Check for these habits and consider rethinking your strategies to avoid being labeled a noob.


Did you use the combination of a SMG and a charged plasma pistol?
Did you camp, staying in one spot for two or more minutes with a battle rifle, sniper rifle or rocket launcher?
Did you look at your opponent's screen to figure out his location?
Did you always go for the rocket launcher?
Did you go for the Banshee and stay in it as long as possible?
Did you go for the tank and stay in for a long period of time?

"
"
Join an online Slayer or Team Slayer game.,
Play a few rounds.,
Give yourself an honest evaluation.","How to Tell if You Are a ""Noob"" in Halo3"," Maybe you can trash your friends, but that doesn't mean you aren't a noob. Jump on Xbox Live and try your skills against the larger Halo community. Just watch out—you're swimming with the sharks now.

, You never know if you are going to be matched against serious players or other potential noobs like yourself. So try a bunch of games to play against a variety of different people.

, Were you able to hold your own? Or were you constantly getting shot down from a mysterious direction? If you found yourself constantly cut down unexpectedly without knowing how, you are likely still a noob.


On Team Slayer, were you able to work with your team members effectively? Did you know where your help was needed? Could you pay attention to which enemies had already taken damage and finish them off before their shields recharged? Did you work to help your team win, or did you just try your own random strategy?

",How to Play Halo Well," Starting racial or other fights or name-calling can lead to your opponents getting defensive.;
, If you have to, you can get in a shee against orders, but don't kill them more than once in a shee, or you'll be a hypocrite, and well... you know the rest.

, In open combat, you could pull it off, as long as you make them feel like they have a chance by shooting you in the foot a couple times with a pistol before you spring a ball of green gooey goodness, but DON'T fire it from a vantage point at an unsuspecting 'pro'.

, You can't really be called a noob for using a rocket, so fire away, and DO NOT RUN OUT OF AMMO!

, One of the things almost as satisfying as rod gunning with a shee, is watching someone flail around screaming with a blue ball of flame on their back, yelling and cursing as you laugh with victory, but don't get carried away, run away from them immediately, a well placed head shot, or the blast of the grenade, could have you going up on the death count also.

,, This is a professional technique.

,,, Otherwise people will call you a tank noob, tank whore, etc.

,, They can save your life!

,

The pistol is great, because it takes only five shots to the body or three to the head to kill someone.






The sniper rifle is also one of the best, as it takes about two shots to the body to kill, or one shot to the head.






Explosive weapons like the rocket launcher and fuel gun are only good for vehicles and suicide kills.






All other weapons should only be used if you're really bored and don't care about dying, including vehicles.






Tanks may rally you a couple of spawn kills, but as soon as someone throws a grenade at you, which is easy, you're dead.







, The bullets in halo take a sec to reach their target. So if someone is moving to the right, shoot maybe an inch or so to the right. If you can't time it right after weeks of practice, play World of Warcraft.

, Live to win! On the weekends, play an all nighter once in a while if you'd like to have some real fun.

, Get a friend on Halo to do a one on one practice match to see what works for both of you, then kick some ass on another server.

First of all, make sure you don't get backed up into a corner.,
If you manage to do that, one pistol shot at the orange (uncovered) part of the Hunter will kill it (on any difficulty).,
If that seems a bit hard, try either sticking them with a grenade and making sure they don't just block it, or throwing a grenade to the side and shooting them while they look at it.,
If you think you're godly (which you might be), let them charge, then sidestep and melee them in the back, immediately get out of their way and sidestep again.,
If you want to practice fighting in close quarters with them without relying on melee, try running up to them and immediately backing off.,
Or, run at them, and at the last second jump up.,
As hunters come in pairs, switch to a zoom weapon (Pistol/Sniper Rifle) And get rid of one like that.,
Instead of that, you can also kill the first, then charge for the second one.,
Alternate method of killing hunters: circle around them while meleeing them.,
In order to sneak up to a Hunter, crouch and ever so gently push the joystick toward the hunter and do it in bursts, with this you can easily a attach a Plasma Grenade on their back.",How to Kill Hunters in Halo," Run to the side and try to get behind the Hunter. If you go up close to it (be careful!) and run around it fast, you should be able to get to its back.;
, Try to keep your distance and time it for when they are not shooting, as their fuel rod cannons shake your screen.

, This a good tactic to buy you some time, not to kill them.

, If you can do this, well... you're good. If you fail, it is your fault. You can practice this in multiplayer by letting people charge you and then sidestep while turning around and meleeing them. If they hit you, you did it wrong. Try again. It's useful in multiplayer as well.

, When you come close enough, they will try to melee (Again, don't get hit!). At this moment, they will lift an arm, exposing the belly, which is uncovered like the back. Fire the pistol as many times as possible into the uncovered region to ensure that enough bullets actually strike it.

, they will hit you with their shield, but you won't die. Instead you'll fly into the air, while up there throw a plasma grenade ( the sticky ones) onto the orange part of its body.

, Then, DO NOT MOVE. The hunter almost never hits you, unless you move. This is because the kickback of his weapon severely damages his accuracy. Then finish him off by throwing a grenade behind him, and let him walk away from it. Then shoot him in the back

, When he charges back at you, walk back and wait for his stomach to be unprotected. Then, empty your assault rifle. Like crazy.

, This causes them to spin around following you, but not actually meleeing you as you need to be standing still for them to melee you. Note: Not tested on 2 Hunters. MAY be effective on them, though. -300spartans

, After that, just run and come back for seconds.

Take a vehicle.","How to Kill a Hunter in Halo 1, 2, 3, 3 Odst, or Reach"," Take a grenade (Plasma; stick grenades work best) and get it stuck on him. After you have done so, it will die (may take two on higher difficulties). Both Frag and Plasma Grenades work, but the Plasma Grenade is recommended.;
, The purple armor protects it, but there are certain chinks you can aim at. Shoot/stick the knees, neck, and back, as their orange flesh is vulnerable.

, Even though MOST of the marines would be dead after fighting a Hunter, they are really a great help. Any marine summons other marines and a Pelican to drop off weapons upon seeing a Hunter.

, Scorpions work the best, but any vehicle works

On Halo 1, a shotgun will take care of Combat Forms in the most expedient way possible (excepting a rocket launcher or any type of explosive).,
On Halo 3, there are Flood Pure Forms, which are a lot harder to kill.,
For Halo 3 The Flood can be generally be easily killed on any difficulty, the only time they put up a decent fight is when you are playing on Heroic difficulty, and they can be an actual challenge when you play on Legendary difficulty.,
When you encounter a Tank Flood Form,UNSC weapons are weak against these huge things!If you find an Energy Sword or rocket launcher,and fuel rod cannon kill them quickly they can also pack a punch!

",How to Kill Flood on Halo 1 and 3," On Halo 3, duel wielding Plasma Rifles is your best bet. Any precision weapon will do as well, as long as you hit the Infection form that's embedded inside the Combat Form's chest. An almost just as good solution is to use the Magnum Pistol. It takes out most combat forms in 1 to 3 shots. Even on the harder difficulties such as heroic or legendary.;
, Tank Forms (the big ones) are nearly impervious to most weapons, however they will be killed instantly by an energy sword lunge, they can spew out infection forms as a special attack. Ranged Forms (the ones that cling on walls) will shoot at you from a distance. Stalker Forms (the little spider-looking things that crawl around you) will jump and attack you. Stalker Forms are the easiest to deal with. They are very weak. A simple melee will take care of them. use a sword (which are found on the bodies of elites or flood throughout the level) on the tank forms. on all difficulty settings they will die. for the ranged forms generally you will want to put them into shield mode and advance until you get within range to stick or melee them. one of each will kill them.

Also players love it when other players know how to use the Spartan Laser effectively.,
Don't always use a vehicle, because odds are that a lot of people know how to play and will kill you easily by sniping, sneak attack, or car jacking.,Be aware that some clans require a microphone or video camera.",How to Join a Clan in Halo," It is pretty easy to get into a clan using this method. All you have to do is play decently, ask around in a matchmade game, and not annoy people.;
, Quite a few people in Halo are in clans, so some people on your friends list may be in a clan and you may not even know about it.

, This is probably the easiest way. The thing about this is that in order for your clan to be successful is that you will need a relatively strong base of members so that people don't join, and leave the next day. I recommend starting the clan with a few of your friends, and then slowly adding on the people.

, There is nothing more that a clan leader loves than a good sniper. Snipers play a key role in clan battles so try to get good at that

, Googling clans on the world-wide web is an easy way to find clans if you know what to Google. Usually if you type in keyword say for instance ""Halo 3 clan"". Results show up in a matter of seconds. Some clans maybe easy to get in while others aren't. So Google keywords pick a clan that looks like they are going to do well. Who knows? Maybe you might make a few friends while belonging to the clan.

, Practice that as well. Clan leaders would very much like it if you knew your way around a map and how to Search and Destroy (without getting destroyed yourself)effectively without a radar. Pull together your buds or online players to practice this technique.

, Use it when appropriate or when you feel like needing a getaway or rush attack, but don't stay on forever because then you could become a burden to your team or clan. Practice with vehicles so that if you do use them you'll be good with them.

, There are three different types of gang wars, which are listed below.


Escort, which has a rival gang escorting a target vehicle you need to destroy.
Cruising, which has a rival gang on bikes or in cars waiting for an attack.
Hanging Out, which has enemies at a location you need to attack.

, At Cruising and Hanging Out gang wars at gang war 30, kamikazes will run at you and your comrades, while burning in flames.


If you see an enemy with grenades or Molotov cocktails, kill him immediately.

, There is an increased risk of police involvement and explosives used against you as you progress in gang wars.

, This gang war includes a target vehicle, either a lorry, a limo, a van, a sports car or an ordinary car that you need to chase and destroy to complete the gang war.

, Shoot the driver to stop the vehicle, then shoot at the vehicle until it starts burning and consequently explodes.


It is essential you have either a sawn-off Shotgun or SMG as you need to shot at the vehicle from your bike.
Alternatively you can try to get ahead of the target vehicle and use an explosive weapon like the RPG.

, The Cruising gang war requires you to attack a rival gang on the road.


There are many enemies in this style of warfare as they do call for more backup and more gang members spawn.

, You should also aim for head shots.

, Some enemies will follow you to an ambush. Return to the remaining foes afterwards.

, This gang warfare style is when a gang is situated in one location of the map and there approximately 20-30 enemies to gun down then has the capability to call for reinforcements.


It is a good idea to get on top of a building or on a platform overlooking the enemies. This way you can snipe the enemies down, their weapons can rarely harm you and you don't risk losing your backup.
Hit-and-run tactics can also be used here to lure the enemies into an ambush.

Don't overuse this technique, as you may be attacked and forced to use valuable health items.,
Red herbs: Can be combined with green herbs to replenish large amounts of heath, usually used on danger (red in color) or heavy caution (orange in color).
Blue herbs: Used to replenish poison damage (pink/purple in color), would not recommend combining with other herbs.

, Saving in Resident evil 2 is crucial. If not used, it can mean the whole game might have to be started over again. Make sure you only save before big fights where you know there might be some difficulty. For example, as the final boss (birkin) or other fights with bosses within the game. Saving over three times will cause you to loose your A rank.

Grab your toolbox.,
Get metal.,
Recognize when and how to use your primary weapons.,
Understand how to use each of your structures.,
Develop a strategy.,
Be wary of Spies and their sappers.,
Use more gun.",How to Play an Engineer in Team Fortress 2," Engineers hold a 6/32 medium ranged Shotgun (Primary), a 12/200 Pistol (Secondary) and the Wrench that helps build the crazy contraptions (Melee). In addition to this, Engineers have multiple buildables that require metal to build (Four key).;
, When you spawn, every Engineer starts with a maximum of 200 metal (shown bottom right). To collect metal, walk over to ammo boxes, guns from the dead, a resupply cabinet or a Dispenser. Once you build something, you also have to upgrade it to its full potential. Every building can be upgraded from Level 1 (Newly built) to a Level 2 (Requires 200 metal) to a Level 3 (Complete). Upgrading a Sentry to its maximum level (3) makes it the most deadly, being able to shoot twin Gatling guns and rockets (which is like two Heavies and a Soldier shooting the target at the same time. whereas upgrading a Dispenser further helps the team by deploying more ammo, more metal and increasing the heal rate.

, Engineers are given a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench, and a tool for detonating their own buildings.


Use the shotgun for short-to-mid range attacks. This is your base weapon, which you will be using to attack for the majority of the time.
Use the pistol for long distance. While not pinpoint accurate, the Engineer's pistol is good for finishing off a retreating enemy. If you run out of ammo in the heat of battle with the shotgun, pull out the pistol and fire away.
Use your wrench to repair your structures, and for close combat. Wrench kills are fun, but not always practical in head-to-head combat. Save your wrench for repairing your sentry gun and other structures. Except against a spy sapping your buildings. Its quicker and more effective to attack a spy with the same weapon you use to fix your buildings than to switch between.

, Engineers have the ability to build a sentry gun, a dispenser, and teleporter entrance/exits. Select a blueprint and turn it 90º by right clicking, if you desire. Place a structure at your desired location and watch as it automatically begins to construct itself. You can also hit it a few times with your wrench to speed up the process. Be sure to keep it well guarded in the meantime, otherwise an enemy can easily destroy it before it finishes.

Sentry gun (130 metal). These turrets will automatically fire at any oncoming enemies, making them a staple in base defense. Sentries have a limited range, which is outlined by a wall of your team's color prior to placement.
Sentries have three levels of firepower (levels 1, 2, and 3), which can be upgraded by obtaining more metal and hitting it with your wrench. Each level upgrade requires an additional 200 metal. At its lowest level the sentry will only complement the team's defense/offense, at Level 2 and higher the sentry is capable of shutting down any enemies in the sentry's vicinity, with the exception of spies.
Level 1 sentries are very basic. They fire rounds and rotate much more slowly than other levels, making them susceptible to damage by faster players. They are comparable in firepower to the Scout pistol. Pretty much any class can handle a sentry at this point
Level 2 sentries have stronger firepower and can rotate faster than Level 1 sentries. They are roughly comparable to a Heavy's mini-gun.
Level 3 sentries are the most powerful, able to rotate and shoot rapidly with rockets and additional rounds. They are the equivalent of a Heavy's mini-gun and a Soldier's rocket launcher
Dispenser (100 metal). The dispenser slowly generates metal and ammo for teammates. It will also heal teammates, albeit much more slowly than a Medic.

Coupled with a nearby sentry, a dispenser can provide virtually unlimited metal, ammo, and health to an Engineer and to other players. Be wary that dispensers generate metal at a relatively slow pace, so don't expect to have a batch of metal right after it finishes constructing itself.
Place a dispenser strategically on the front lines to provide teammates a consistent source of health. These are invaluable during sudden death matches.
Unlike in Team Fortress and Team Fortress Classic, you cannot kill enemies by detonating your dispenser. You can, however, place a dispenser in a tight corridor to create a makeshift barrier. This is useful to hinder retreating enemies, as well as inform the Engineer of incoming enemies.
Dispensers have 3 levels. The more levels the dispenser has, the faster it can heal people. At level 1 it heals at the rate of 10 HP/sec At level 2 it heals at 15/sec At level 3 it becomes 20/sec almost as fast as a medic with a rate of 27 HP/sec.
Dispensers healing stacks with other near by dispensers, two or more makes for a very quick healing point for your team, however it requires the cooperation of a second engineer.
A heavy or pyro near a dispenser will never run out of ammo even if they fire constantly, so with proper placement you can have a heavy act as a makeshift sentry or pyro as a spy checker.
Teleporter (125 metal). The teleporter is highly useful for transporting newly spawned players to the front lines quickly. Remember that you will need to place a teleporter entrance and exit.
Be strategic when selecting a location for your teleporter entrance. You will want to place an entrance where your teammates can readily see it, but not so obvious as to leave it open to enemy fire.
Similarly, avoid placing exits out in the open. Not only do you want to preserve the life of your exit, but also the lives of your teammates as they come to learn where they've been teleported.
Remember that players passing through your teleporter will temporarily leave your team color's trail in their wake. Experienced opponents will take note of this and attempt to track down the location of your exit.
Your teleporter can transport one player about every 10 seconds unless upgraded, which then the time is reduced to 5 seconds for level 2, and 3 seconds for level 3.
Before building an exit, make use of your ability to turn structures by right clicking. It helps to give incoming players a clear view of where they are going, rather than staring into a corner.

, While Engineers are catered to being a defensive class, they still have much opportunity to play on offense as well. Be sure to experiment with different techniques and plans that offer the most benefit for you and the rest of your team.


Consider your defensive role. Most Engineers will spend their time within the base, placing sentries in locations where they cannot easily be destroyed. If you are very close to the re-spawn, you might consider building a far-off dispenser near the front line to provide health to your teammates since you have easy access to the supplies cabinet. Don't forget about placing a remote teleporter exit to assist in transporting your teammates. For a defensive engineer, the sentry gun should be positioned to best protect the objective.
Consider your offensive role. Engineers can be used to create ""mini bases"", which can provide a place for teammates to retreat for health and ammo, as well as a place to transport teammates with the teleporter. In an offensive role, a sentry gun should serve to protect the teleporter exit and dispenser.

, Spies are equipped with sappers, which will disable your structures and render them unusable. Sappers will also slowly drain your structure's power, and will destroy it if it is left on for too long. If a Spy saps one of your structures, quickly hit it a few times with your wrench to destroy the sapper and to repair your structure. It is usually a good idea to focus on killing the spy first, and then repair and/or rebuild your structures. Otherwise, the spy will just continue to sap your structures over and over again, or he could backstab you while you're facing your sentry.

It's important to remember that sappers will disable your structures. Hence, if a Spy saps your sentry, it will not be able to shoot until the sapper is removed. This can leave you vulnerable not only to the Spy's attacks, but also to other incoming enemies.
Naturally, don't forget that your sentries will not attack a Spy that is cloaked and/or is disguised as one of your teammates.
Usually your sentries, dispensers and teleporters will be first priority to be destroyed by the opposing team, whether attacking or (especially) defending. in many cases, therefore, building sentries and teleporters in hidden or unexpected, hard-to-reach locations can be a better decision than building it in traditional defense spots, which would be the first place targeted. Consider using a dispenser and a crouch jump to reach to roof on point C on Gravel pit, or the corner ledge on stage 1, point 2 in Goldrush. A team faced with a sentry in an unconventional position will sometimes be too stunned to strategize around it and destroy it!
Keep an eye out for demo men, whose stickies can knock out a whole set of engineer buildings if they're close together. Make sure to keep an eye on all the corners and blind spots where the demo man can launch stickies from

Pair up With a Medic!",How to Play a Soldier in Team Fortress 2," Soldiers jump into the war with a 4/20 Rocket Launcher, useful for knocking someone far away (Primary), a 6/32 medium ranged Shotgun (Secondary) and a Shovel (Melee).;
, The Rocket Launcher is a very powerful primary weapon. It can be used in all ranges.


At close range, shoot it at an incoming enemy for instant death.






Shoot it at an enemy's feet! An enemy is less likely to dodge a rocket attack if you shoot it at their feet. Keep this in mind, especially at close range.






At medium range, shoot it at an enemy for a very strong attack that lowers their health exponentially.






At long range, shoot it at an enemy for a shot that can deal much damage to your enemy. Remember that it helps to try to predict an enemy's movement before shooting because it can be easily dodged. Use your rocket against enemy snipers. While, as said before, they can dodge quickly, the rockets deal a surprising amount of splash damage.






Watch out! You can injure or kill yourself with your own rocket shots!







, When you are unable to use your Rocket Launcher, you may want to use your shotgun. It provides adequate power that can chip away at enemy health to help deliver a finishing rocket blow or pick off retreating enemies with low health. Using the shotgun for longer range can guarantee damage is being dealt, whereas the rocket launcher may be too slow to reach any foes in your sight. Enemies on elevated ground are also valid shotgun targets, because your rockets can't be aimed at the ground in front of them to deal damage. Also, use this against Scouts, because it can be nigh impossible to hit them with your very slow Rocket Launcher.

, As with all melee weapons, the shovel is very fun to use, but only use it when you are close and have a clear shot. One misstep and you can be dead.

, With your Rocket Launcher, you can create a ""shield"" which your teammates can hide behind. Watch out when you take on many enemies, for they can attack you while you are reloading.

, Rocket-jumping is a technique used by many Soldiers. Rocket-jumping allows you to jump to huge heights. You can use it to escape, attack, get to a place, or just for fun. To Rocket-jump, you need to jump, then shoot and crouch at the same time. You should be in the air in no time. Remember that this will injure you. It is sometimes a good idea, if you have the time, to get a nearby medic to beef you up to 150% health to lower the health lost.

, If used effectively a medic soldier combo can be even more deadly than a heavy medic combo. If you like having high DPS have your medic try the kritzkrieg, if you are a heavily mobile soldier have your pocket medic use the quick fix. Shoot rockets at any oncoming enemies while the Medic heals you, and you have a huge rocket shield. Be sure to protect your medic!!!

In the phase of the game where battles become significantly fast paced (such as while storming an enemy position with a couple of teammates in tow) or close combat battles (where the team has to go through series of corridors) it is not always advisable to keep your gun spinning while you move.",How to Play a Heavy in Team Fortress 2," Heavies are armed with an outstanding 300 health. Add the Medic's 150 health boost and Heavies hold the highest amount of health possible, 450. Aside from the health, they also boast the slowest speed possible but also holds a dangerous 200 bullet Minigun, a 6/32 medium ranged Shotgun and their own powerful Fists that can dent metal.;
, A heavy medic combo is devastatingly strong, and and an ubercharged heavy can take down groups of enemies and destroy entire mini bases made by engineers. Your medic will keep you from dying, and will provide another target for your enemies to shoot at...

, Pick up enemies' dropped weapons to keep your ammo up. The Heavy's standard mini gun carries 200 ammo, but you can go through 12 ammo in 1 second. This stacks up, so make sure to pick up some ammo boxes.

, Heavies may have 300HP, but those points get used up pretty fast when up against several enemies. A enemy heavy firing at you will do more damage than your medic can heal, so make sure to retreat once in a while.

, It takes a second, and prepares you for the opposition, but it makes you slower than you already are being the slowest class.

,, Instead learn how to anticipate enemy attacks (listening to footsteps, enemy weapon sounds and projectile trajectories) and how to jump-spin (simple - just jump in any direction and hit the right mouse button the moment you jump). This will allow you to maximize your limited mobility and allow you to deliver unpleasant surprises to opponents by jumping around corners and opening fire (your mini-gun's loud spinning sound is a sure give-away of an approaching heavy otherwise, and will attract immediate rockets/sticky bombs etc from even average players).

Alongside those are other weapons you can obtain through achievements and item drops. The achievement weapons unlockable for the sniper are: The Huntsman - A bow which shoots arrow projectiles(Primary), Jarate - a throwable jar of urine (Secondary) and the Razorback - A shield which prevents back-stabs. If you are far away from combat, and will not use a knife, take the Razorback as extra protection. (Secondary).;
, The Sniper Rifle is a powerful weapon with a small charge-up time. and its main use is for picking off enemies at a good distance. This weapon is very powerful and can be lethal with one shot. Remember, aim for the head of your enemies. Depending on how much you have charged up before a shot, the rifle will do 150-450 dmg on a headshot, or 50-250 on a bodyshot.
, You should generally stay unscoped and avoid staying zoomed in. This is so that you can be more aware and observe the battlefield. Additionally, scoping will limit your sight and decrease your movement speed. A Sniper who doesn't know what's going on is vulnerable to Spy backstabs. Staying unscoped, you can use any of the four techniques below, elaborated on in the next four steps: No Scoping, Hard Scoping, Strafe Scoping and Quickscoping., No Scoping, also known as hip-firing, is firing the gun without zoom, from the hip, and is useful to pick off any close or fast moving enemies, such as scouts. An unscoped shot will do 50 dmg, no matter if you hit the enemy's head, chest, or boots. If you think that scoping is dangerous in a situation, you can help your team out and fire from the hip to potentially assist in killing any enemies., The longer you are zoomed in, the more damage your shots can do. A meter will charge every second you are zoomed in. When it is full, you will do the most damage. If you headshot an enemy as soon as you zoom in, the bullet will deal about 150 dmg. This is enough to kill scouts, pyros, medics, snipers, or spies. This is an effective and easy way, along with no-scoping, to take down some of the high damage classes with 1 shot. A fully-charged headshot will deal 450 damage to the enemy player. This will be enough to kill any class, including a heavy charged by a medic. Sniping can be done by aiming at an entrance and waiting for an enemy to walk into your crosshair.
When you're zoomed in, a dot will show on whatever you are aiming at. Your enemies may see this and avoid your shot. You may want to aim a bit to the side or above the doorway where the enemies will come out, where the dot is not visible and then swiftly move your aim towards the enemy to surprise them. Hard Scoping may be effective, but it is frowned upon by more experienced players, especially enemy snipers, since it takes the least skill. However, this will kill any class on the enemy team and will rack up points for you in the game.

, Strafe-scoping is taking advantage of strafing (moving left and right with the A and D keys) while keeping your crosshair at the level of enemy heads to assist aiming. This technique is great against enemies while on flat surfaces, particularly enemy snipers trying to pick you off. Strafing will allow you to move constantly while still firing at the enemy, making it harder for enemies to shoot you. Most players keep their crosshair at head level and zoom in only when it is near an enemy. This technique is great for popping a quick, uncharged headshot on an enemy, forcing them to run back to base to avoid dying., Quickscoping is taking advantage of good muscle memory and is the technique used by pros. At the sight of an enemy, quickly move your crosshair towards the enemy's head and zoom in. As you right click, quickly slide your mouse towards the enemy's head. It also helps you use your mouse in conjunction with the A and D keys (strafing) to help increase accuracy. Players may take time to pick up quickscoping but once you know how to do it, it'll be extremely useful. By using quickscoping, a skilled sniper can fight close to mid combat, altering the flow of the game., The SMG is adequate for shooting enemies at a somewhat close distance. It has a very fast rate of fire but is quite weak. Use it when there is an oncoming enemy who is too close to snipe.

, While, like all melee weapons, the Kukri is fun and satisfying to use, it is somewhat weak and should only be used when the other weapons can't be used or you know that the enemy has low health.

, Know where you're most effective. As the Sniper, remember that there are certain places you should stay out of. Crowded, small rooms are probably not a great environment in which to use this weapon. Always find a secluded (preferably elevated) area to use this weapon. Make sure you are hidden from enemy Spies and Snipers at any time. Furthermore, you should try to avoid close-combat and attempt long-range combat since, at 125, the Sniper's health is quite low.


, You should scan the battlefield and note the often predictable movement patterns and strategies of the enemy team. In Payload maps, if you are defending look at for the track,and position yourself where you can see an long stretch. The BLU team will be pushing the payload right into your crosshair. Likewise, if you are on BLU in payload maps look up in the hills and at the end of tunnels for enemy snipers. As a Sniper, your biggest threats are enemy Spies and Snipers. Remember to un-zoom and look around to see if any possible Spies lurking around or Snipers aiming at you from another direction.

, Always be on full alert! Make sure you often look around you so that you don't get attacked by a spy. If your back is turned to a spy, they can easily backstab you, killing you instantly. Many spies often act very suspiciously so spy check players by shooting or attacking any players coming near you. Even if your back is against a wall or you are wearing the razorback, an enemy spy could easy take out his revolver or just swipe his knife at you and kill you. Use your ears; the cloaking and disguising sound effect of a spy is often easily audible and will alert you or any nearby spies. You can easily discover if someone is a spy if you cannot walk through them. If you can walk through them, then it's not an enemy spy: stop wasting your time. If you are unsure about a teammate, ask them in chat to fire their weapon. Enemy spies can't fire weapons without losing their disguise. If they don't respond, shoot them or run at them, swinging your Kukri. If they run away, they are defiantly spy. Call your team on them or just shoot them yourself., Remember that unseen enemy Snipers can snipe you at any time! Additionally, you can mash the WASD keys and walk around and jump around. If you jump (space) and crouch (ctrl) at the same time, you will jump higher than without crouching. In mid-jump, you can tap your crouch (ctrl) key rapidly two times. This will make your character move up and down so quickly that enemy Snipers will most of the time fail to headshot you.
, However fun it may be just looking out for yourself and sniping only at your enemies, your main goal is to help your teammates, not just yourself! When you see an enemy in combat with one of your teammates, your job is to try to snipe the enemy so you can help your teammate gain points and survive! Don't waste time check for nonexistent spies and especially don't play Sniper vs Sniper minigames. If you only snipe at enemy Snipers, you won't be helping your team very much at all, as it isolates you from the main game (as you are instead playing a 'minigame' of just seeing if you can compete with the enemy Snipers in killing them). This is notorious in maps like 2Fort, where the battlements on each side are used by Snipers to play the minigame, constantly competing against each other to see who's the better Sniper. Avoiding this minigame and actually helping out your team mates can be as simple as going to other sniping positions where enemy Snipers are less likely to see you, and doing something useful such as killing Medic + Heavy combos or helping out in general combat.

,


The Huntsman is used for mid-ranged combat, and can do massive amounts of damage. The Huntsman is a bow which shoots quick projectile arrows. It takes one second to charge up, where fully charged shots usually kill or cripple weak classes like Scouts. However, if you charge your bow for more than 5 seconds, the accuracy and damage of the shot will be extremely low. Headshots are instant critical hits, and can usually instantly kill most classes. The Huntsman replaces the Sniper Rifle in the primary slot. Wanting to be very annoying. You can spam fully charged shots towards the enemy, hoping that they kill. This infamous technique which is frowned upon is dubbed the ""Lucksman"".






The Razorback is a shield used to protect you from infamous backstabbing Spies. It protects you from a single backstab. When a spy attempts to backstab you while you have it equipped, your shield will break and the attacking spy will not be able to attack or cloak for about 2 seconds. The Razorback is one of the side-grades for the SMG in the secondary slot. Although this may seem useful, many spies may take advantage of their revolvers to take you out instead of their knives. Therefore, you should consider carefully before equipping it.






Jarate, the Jar-Based Karate, is a throwable jar of piss. The jar can be thrown at enemies to coat them in urine, making anything that hits them Mini-Crits, which does 35% more damage than normal. You can assist your teammates by coating the enemy so that your team deals more damage. When used on spies, it has an additional effect, allowing you to see them when they are using their invisibility cloak. It has one use per charge, and it recharges after 20 seconds. Note that it can instantly be retrieved from your Respawn Room's Resupply cabinet (which implies that, for whatever reason, the Sniper keeps an infinite number of jars of his urine in the supply cabinet). The Jarate replaces the SMG in the secondary weapon slot.






The Tribalman's Shiv can be used to identify Spies, cloaked or otherwise. It is a melee weapon which causes hit enemies to bleed for six seconds. The affected enemy will also be visibly bleeding to other players (The bleeding is less noticeable than being set on fire, however); an enemy Spy will be shown bleeding as well, whether they are cloaked or in disguise. So, The Tribalman's Shiv can be used as a Spy-check for Snipers. The Tribalman's Shiv serves as a replacement for the Kukri.

Know the Pyro's basic loadout.,
Use the flamethrower at short-range.The Pyro's flamethrower is most dangerous up close.,
Use the flamethrower to deal burning damage over time.,
Use the compression blast to reflect projectiles and push enemies.,
Use the shotgun at medium-to-long ranges.,
Use the axe as a last resort.",How to Play a Pyro in Team Fortress 21," Without any upgrades or optional gear, Pyros start with a 200 fuel Flame Thrower for close or medium range as their primary weapon, a 6/32 medium ranged Shotgun as their secondary, and a fire axe for melee.;
, At point-blank range, it's almost guaranteed to be fatal. Get as close to your enemy as you can before you use your flamethrower for massive damage.

, The flamethrower is the only base weapon that causes additional lingering damage after the initial damage has been dealt. Any enemies (besides enemy Pyros) who are hit with the flamethrower are set on fire and receive gradual damage over time. Because of this, even if a burned enemy runs away, he may still die, so it is not always necessary to chase your enemies down.

, The flamethrower has a useful secondary fire (right mouse button) called the compression blast (or air blast) which has a variety of uses. Upon pressing the right mouse button, the flamethrower emits a blast of air that can blast enemies backwards through the air, though it won't damage them. It can also reflect slow moving projectiles such as the Demoman's bombs, the sniper's arrows and the Soldier's rockets. Soldiers in particular are very vulnerable to their rockets being reflected back at their team, as reflected explosives mini-crit against their own team.


The compression blast can also remove flames from a team-mate.
A sniper's jarate along with the crusader's crossbow arrows can be reflected as well. Use reflected jarate for a quick mini-crit kill!
Note that the air blast is expensive in terms of ammo, using 20 ammunition per blast. The air blast uses the same ammo as your flamethrower, so use it with caution!

, The shotgun is weaker than the flamethrower, but much longer-ranged. Use this to your advantage. If an enemy is rushing toward you from a distance, it can help to switch to your shotgun and start shooting to inflict some damage before he or she is within the range of your flamethrower. This is especially true when you are about to enter combat with another Pyro because the burning damage of your flamethrower is negated.


It's also smart to use your shotgun to pick off retreating enemies that are otherwise out of the range of your flamethrower. Try to ignite a player with your flamethrower and finish them off with the shotgun as he runs away.







, Using the axe is a lot of fun, but be careful. It can be very satisfying to score a melee kill with the axe, but, until you run out of ammo, it's better to use the flamethrower at melee ranges, as it almost always deals higher DPS.


Some of the unlockable axes have more versatile uses (see below).

Take your enemies by surprise.,
Disrupt the enemy team's coordination.,
Reveal spies with your flamethrower.,
Use the compression blast to break ubercharges.",How to Play a Pyro in Team Fortress 22," Your flamethrower does massive damage, but it's very short-ranged, so you must use it carefully. Don't charge at your opponents head-on while blasting your flamethrower. It's intimidating, but you'll probably be gunned down before you can even singe another player. Instead, try to sneak up behind a group of enemies, get up as close as you can, and then let your flamethrower rip!

, As a Pyro, fear is essentially your middle name. You generally live to cause chaos and confusion in other players. Apart from an oncoming Heavy, nothing is more intimidating to an enemy than a set of flames that continues to damage him or her after you are out of the way. As such, you'll find that players tend to scatter and run from you, which helps to keep the enemy team from executing cohesive strategies.

, As a Pyro, Spies fear you more than any other class. If you see the brief silhouette of a player flicker before you, immediately let loose with your flamethrower to reveal any cloaked Spies near you. Even spies in disguises can be set on fire by a vigilant pyro, instantly blowing their cover.

, The Pyro is the only class that can effectively break an ubercharge. You can use the flamethrower's compression blast to separate a medic from his uber-ed companion. If you separate the two by enough distance, the medic will no longer be able to share his uber with his buddy and your teammates will be able to gang up to finish both off. Do this when the uber players don't see you coming, as an uber-ed Heavy will make short work of an oncoming Pyro.

Unlock the flare gun by completing 10 Pyro achievements.,
Use the flare gun at long ranges to take out sentries.,
Unlock the Backburner by completing 16 Pyro achievements.,
Unlock the Axtinguisher by completing 22 Pyro achievements.,
Switch back to your original equipment at any time by accessing the TF2 menu (i.e.",How to Play a Pyro in Team Fortress 23," The Flare Gun, which replaces the shotgun, shoots flares that can set enemies on fire from a distance. A flare fired arcs down when travelling through a long distance, and flies pretty slowly through the air, so hitting anything that is moving may be quite difficult. This is useful for hitting stationary or slow targets like Snipers or Heavies. Most enemies though, when seeing a Pyro with a little flare gun trying to hit them, assumes low threat towards the Pyro, as opposed to him using the Flamethrower. The flare gun also has a 100% critical chance against burning opponents. A critical flare deals 90 damage, which can be devastating to any class.

, One of the biggest advantages of the flare gun is that it allows the Pyro - traditionally one of of the shortest-ranged classes - to attack from long ranges. This allows a cautious, accurate Pyro to take out sentries that aren't accompanied by an engineer, which the Pyro would otherwise have no way of doing. Level 1 sentries will take about 5 hits from the flare gun to hit, while higher-level sentries will take more hits.

Watch out for spies. Taking a sentry out with flares can take a relatively long time, during which you'll be vulnerable to a well-placed back stab.

, The Backburner, which replaces the flamethrower, does constant critical damage when shooting someone in the back. The tradeoff for this is a huge increase in the cost of your air compression blast (From 20 to 50), so you may want to use it more frugally. If you're using this weapon, you ideally want to attack your enemies from behind, so this weapon encourages a stealthy style of play.

, The Axtinguisher, which replaces the basic axe, does half the damage of the regular axe if the enemy isn't burning but has a 100% critical hit chance if the enemy is on fire. This can also be useful in some situations, like if you manage to approach a firing Heavy from behind without him seeing you, you can give him a quick puff from the Flamethrower, whip out your Axtinguisher, and hack into him. This should usually kill him in about two swings, whereas the normal ax would take much longer.

Use your sticky bombs to ""stickyjump"" to unreachable heights.",How to Play a Demoman in Team Fortress 2," Demomen have a 4/16 Grenade Launcher, which shoots grenades that last for three seconds if not hit a player (Primary), a 8/24 Stickybomb Launcher, which allows up to eight grenades to be stuck to any surface and be detonated at anytime using the right mouse button (Secondary) and a melee only Bottle (Melee).


Use your bottle for point-blank attacks. Like all melee weapons, the bottle can surprisingly come in handy for short point-blank attacks, but you must be careful, for if you miss the first time, you could end up being killed.
Use your grenade launcher for medium range attacks. Grenades are one of your main explosive projectiles. They will explode about 3 seconds after they are launched unless they directly connect with another enemy player or enemy building, in which case they will detonate upon impact unless the Grenade Launcher you are using is the Loch-n-Load which will explode on contact with anything it touches.
Grenades will only detonate upon impact with another player/building if they do not bounce off the ground or off a wall first. Otherwise, they will harmlessly bounce off the player. In either case, they will still explode after 3 seconds.


Use your sticky bomb launcher to set up traps and chokepoints. A sticky bomb will detonate at your command with a simple right click. You can launch up to 8 sticky bombs at once that stick to walls, ceilings, and other hidden locations to lure unsuspecting enemies into an explosive mess. You can switch to another weapon and still explode your bombs.
Use sticky bombs to set up bottlenecks that prevent/hinder enemy advancement on the field. You'll find that many players find a set of sticky bombs on the ground to be very intimidating.
You can hold down the fire button to ""charge"" your sticky bomb launcher to shoot long distance bombs. This is especially useful for inflicting some damage before you are in enemy sight.

;
, Demomen are particularly useful to eliminate close enemy congregations, since they can deal a significant amount of damage from a distance in a relatively short amount of time.

Use your sticky bomb launcher to clear out an Engineer sentry quickly. Lob about four or five sticky bombs around a corner or over an incline and detonate them all at once to destroy a sentry gun immediately. You'll probably take out the Engineer in the process, as well.

, The Demoman's sticky bombs are a defensive staple in guarding your intelligence, as well as your capture points. Try to conceal a set of sticky bombs out of enemy sight, such as around a corner or around the outer edges of a doorway. As a group begins to rush in, detonate the concealed sticky bombs and watch the chaos that ensues.

, You can detonate your sticky bombs no matter what weapon that you have selected. Don't be afraid to switch to your grenade launcher while you have your sticky bombs set up, so that you don't become a sitting duck to incoming players.

, This may appear to be a trivial and intuitive notion, but nothing is worse than being caught without any extra sticky bombs or grenades in your launchers when a group of enemies start to come your way. Be sure to keep your weapons fully loaded whenever you have the opportunity to do so.

, Similar to the Soldier's rocket jump, the Demoman can use his sticky bomb launcher to reach great heights. Simply put one or two sticky bombs on the ground, crouch, and simultaneously jump over and detonate it to fling yourself in the air.

Some notable locations to ""jump"" to are on the top of the Capture Point ""B"" building in cp_gravelpit and over the dividing wall in cp_well—most useful before the setup timer reaches zero.

Watch out for Dead Ringers!",How to Detect Enemy Spies in Team Fortress 2," Spies can disguise themselves as a member of your team. Doing so gives them the name of a player on your team of the same class. For example, if a pyro on your team is named ""Fireguy"", and the spy disguises himself as a pyro, his name is likely to be ""Fireguy"". They can also become invisible for a short amount of time. They carry a revolver and a knife as weapons, and a knife attack from behind will always be fatal. A spy loses their disguise when they attack. They can place sappers on engineer buildings. These sappers disable the building and then drain their health, destroying them if not removed. Spies do not lose their disguise when placing sappers.;
, ""Teammates"" with your name are certainly spies, as no two people with the same name can be on the same server at the same time. Spies disguised as medics will not have an Ubercharge meter. (360 and PS3 only!) Also, you cannot cause damage to a teammate. If you see a friendly pyro catch a ""teammate"" on fire, that person is a spy. You will be able to pass through teammates, but spies will be a wall. If a friendly spy is cloaked, you will see a faint outline. If a ""friendly"" spy appears out of thin air, he is in fact an enemy. Also, when leaving a teleport, people's feet will glow the color of their true team. A blue sniper with a red glow is a spy. (360 and PS3 only!)

, Spies can backstab you, and if they are good at it, they probably will. If a teammate seems a little too ""chummy"", shoot him.

, An inexperienced spy will often stay near his teammates despite being disguised as your team. This is a dead giveaway.

, However, don't go overboard with this, as is can really annoy other players.

, If you see a spy cloaked, immediately try to shoot where they are or run into them. Shooting them or colliding with them causes temporary malfunctions in the cloak.

, The Dead Ringer allows the Spy to fake his death and escape. Listen to the sound of a Dead Ringer decloaking to see if the Spy is actually dead.

Use the pistol.,
Exploit the assault rifle.",How to Improve Your Skill in Halo1," The pistol is arguably the powerful weapon in the game. You should always carry around the pistol and you should never get rid of it.;
, The assault rifle may have a wide spread and many people tend not to use it, but if you get your opponents' shields down, it can be a dangerous weapon.

"
"
Use the plasma rifle.",How to Improve Your Skill in Halo2," One of the most unused weapons in the game is the plasma rifle. The Plasma Rifle is excellent for taking out shielding. Also for an added bonus, it can slow down your enemy. A quick kill for you would be using the Plasma Rifle, followed by striking your enemy with a melee attack.

"
"
Use the shotgun.,
Use the Sniper.",How to Improve Your Skill in Halo3," The shotgun seems like a simple weapon, but it is hard to get a precise hit unless your assailant is charging straight toward you. Make sure that you get very close in before even thinking about using this.

, The sniper, by far, is probably the greatest weapon in the game. It is long and short range if you learn to use it right. It is also an EXCELLENT weapon to wield with the shotgun. The shotgun can take out people who try to sneak behind you and melee you. That's when you turn around and point blank them. Also with the sniper you have the option to snipe anywhere on many maps, such as blood gulch, boarding action, or infinity.

"
"
Start with frag grenades.,
Throw it in front.",How to Improve Your Skill in Halo4," There is nothing more deadly (and idiotic) than trying to stick someone with a plasma grenade and missing completely. Use fragmentation grenades first because they are easier to aim and may be better than plasma grenades.

, The easiest way to get someone with a grenade is to throw it in their paths. Say someone was shooting at you and strafing left, what would you do? Throw it in the direction he is going. It is hard to avoid a grenade if it is thrown directly in their path.

Scout (Mostly Offense): The scout can take points twice as fast and push the cart x2, so he should be used for an offensive role.,
Soldier (Generalist): The soldier is the most versatile class in the game.,
Pyro (Moderate Offense): The pyro is better suited for offense, however, it is also a utility class due to his compression blast.,
Demoman (Slight Defense): A demoman is pretty similar to soldier, except his grenades do not explode immediately after hitting a wall.,
Heavy (Slight Offense): A heavy can push through the enemy defense, but he is not good at entering deep into enemy territory by himself as he will be overwhelmed, due to the fact that he cannot sneak around the enemy base.,
Engineer (Mostly Defense): The engineer builds a sentry, then sits back and watches as people that come into the sentry's range are quickly mowed down.,
Medic (Moderate Defense): The medic should not enter into enemy territory as he is pretty much defenseless against the other team.,
Sniper (Pure Defense): The sniper barely gets any movement on the battlefield as his job is to sit, wait and then to picking off enemies.,
Spy (Pure Offense): The spy should go into enemy ground and wreak havoc, and he has the tools to do just that.",How to Determine Which Class to Play in Team Fortress 2," He is also good at capturing the enemy intelligence and excels at hit and run tactics due to his speed.;
, He can be classified as the Jack of All Trades. He is also fairly easy to play. On almost every occasion, a Soldier can be useful to a team, be it stopping the cart, taking a control point or destroying an enemy sentry nest.

, Pyro lacks serious long range capabilities, so it cannot afford to wait for the enemy to enter into friendly territory.

, He also has sticky bombs which he can detonate whenever he wishes. He can be used to delay the enemy from entering a choke point.

, He is more suitable for holding an existing area.

, He is pretty weak on his own (arguably the weakest) and also, he often has to watch after his buildings lest they get destroyed. Therefore it is ill-advised for him to enter the enemy area.

, He should stay near the battlefield and heal his teammates.

, He is not a suitable class for when the team needs to push forward, as he is better at taking out unsuspecting enemies that come out of chokepoints. On offense, his main purpose is to counter-snipe (take down the enemy sniper)

, He can sneak behind enemy lines undetected and then backstab the opponents. Literally. Spy may be good on some occasions as a defender, but if your team is getting rolled, it is better to be a stronger class such as Heavy or Soldier.

Keep an eye out for good weapons and spots.,
Avoid running for the good weapons if everyone is grabbing them.,
Pick up good weapons after people die while using them.",How to Get Good Weapons on Coagulation," No matter where you spawn on the map, there will be excellent benefits.


If you spawn near the caves, run and grab a vehicle. If there are no vehicles, then run on top of the base and grab the sniper rifle.
If you spawn next the rocks, run and grab the rocket launcher in the middle of the map.
If you spawn in one of the bases, drop down and grab the banshee. If there are no banshees, grab the sniper rifle on top of the base.;
, Chances are you will get killed by more experienced players. Simply hang back and grab a simpler weapon, such as a shotgun or a plasma rifle. Add a couple of grenades to your inventory before going to hunt.

, They will respawn, and you can grab them.

, This program is called Halo Custom Edition (Also known as Halo CE. You can find this program by following this URL: Download and selecting ""download now"". Don't worry - this site has been triple checked for harmful viruses. The download is free but could take awhile... get some food. Popcorn, cereal, tea...

, Once you have halo CE downloaded, give it its own special icon.

, This leads to a map called ""Huge***"". Inappropriate name I suppose, but that's its name. Once again, simply scroll down and hit the download button.

, Once the map you've gotten is downloaded, it should create its own zip folder on your desktop called 'huge***.zip'. This is good. Double click the zip folder. You should see a number of random files, but look for the one titled: 'huge***.map'. The map means you can put it into Halo CE. Leave it there for now (cold snap is also a suitable map)

, Locate and click the 'open file location' button. This should open another screen that has folders, triggers, and basically everything else in Halo 1. Find the folder that's called: 'Maps'. Open it. You should see a list of all the maps like 'Death Island', 'Ice Land', etc.

, (It really doesn't matter where so long as its in the Maps folder.) Once the map file has been transferred, things should start to disappear off of your screen. A good thing. Now click ""Apply"" followed by ""OK"" on the 'Properties' screen of Halo CE

,, Then click 'Create Game'

,,, You should be in a huge-*** hangar. Look around for a Pelican Drop ship .

,, Otherwise it is regular 'W' and mouse moving for movement.

Find your heavy weapon.,
If you are not the heavy weapons type, try finding a nice hole and hiding out there with the sniper rifle.,
Remember the pistol is very overpowered in Halo.,
Use grenades.,
Vehicles.",How to Get a Lot of Kills in Halo 1 Multiplayer," They are usually placed in the tunnels and other hard-to-reach areas. Kill anyone along the way. Try to get more ammo along the way. Get to the enemy base. Do not let up. If you run out of ammo, switch to a pistol or go back to find another heavy weapon.;
, This works very well in large level with open spawn points like Blood Gulch, Sidewinder and Timberland. Try to always strafe (use ""a"" and ""d"" keys) while sniping if you can, this prevents giving the enemy sniper an easy shot at you (your contrails make you a sitting duck). Also watch your motion tracker in between shots, make sure no one is sneaking up on you with a shotgun! Finally, remember to lead your shots. The lead you need on each server is different. The best way to figure out what it is to shoot at someone going in a straight line with a pistol, when you consistently hit them is the server's ""lead"". Remember the distance and use it while sniping.

, When you spawn in front of a guy with a rocket launcher, you can actually kill them with a pistol sometimes. The key is to get off a shot, jump and strafe to dodge the rocket or fuel rod shot, and get off 2 more. At this point their shield should be down and you can either randomly shoot with the pistol (you will eventually hit them) or take out your AR and blast away. The pistol is great only at mid range. If they have a close range weapon, like AR, shotgun or flamethrower, run backward and shoot. If they have a sniper, strafe and run toward them until you are in range.

, You start with 2 frag grenades. I usually throw one at me opponents feet when i come in firing. If I hit him twice in the next three second (Not uncommon in a pistol fight) he is dead (or had no shield and no health and is an easy kill). Throw spades at people feet, and remember the delay. So if they are running toward you, throw it in front and back away. If they are backing away, aim a little behind them. Also use them to take out hogs and ghosts. If you have plasma grenades, if you can get close to a person, try to stick the grenade on the person, then run, as the blast will take out your victim as well as you if you are too close.

, Get in a ghost and run people over. Use cannons to freeze them in place and drive over them. when driving a warthog, help out your gunner by running enemy's over. It even works in a banshee, just fly down and splat. Watch out from sticky plasma grenades though. Also, the guns on vehicles all have unlimited ammo and ranger from powerful rapid fire AR (warthog) to plasma cannons (ghost/banshee) heavy guns (rocket hog/banshee cannon) and tank turrets (tank). Have fun...

On snipers, after each shot, you should take cover.",How to Get a Quick 'Running Riot' or 'Killing Spree' in Halo 1,", One of the best ways to kill with a banshee is to drive your banshee straight into the enemy for an instant kill, while trying to avoid warthogs and SMG's.


Or get a scorpion tank and drive it to the high ground behind your base and play a ""special"" version of snipers.

A great way to kill without being killed is to use a sniper rifle.,
Pistols are very overpowered in this game.,
Use your radar!,
Don't stand still.,
Vehicles are a wonderful way to kill without dying.,
Spawn killing is a horrible way to get points, but it works.",How to Get a Great Kill to Death Ratio in Halo Online," A x8 scope lets you get one shot kills from across the map. A x2 scope is also available for somewhat closer targets. Press your scope button once or twice for a x2 or x8 zoom respectively. Press it a third time to return to normal view.;
, They are a deadly mid-range to close combat weapon. Pistols have a x2 zoom, so they can be used for mid-range sniping. They are also fun to bash people with! It is an instant kill if you sneak up behind someone and bash them with a pistol. This is useful when you come across snipers too busy looking down their scope to notice the big red dot on their radar. Which brings me to my next point...

, Anytime something near you moves, it shows up on your radar. If you see a red dot coming towards you, turn and shoot! Kill more than you get killed, remember?

, If you do, you stand the risk of being sniped of run over.

, This is why many players consider them to be ""cheep"" and the people who use them to be ""noobs"". Ignore people who say this. They are only saying this because you got there first. Remember, if they get the chance, they would use a vehicle on you in a second. Be sure to always get there first! Hop in a Warthog and run people over! Swoop down in a Banshee and crush those losers bouncing around below you while hitting them with a rain of plasma from above! Avoid rockets, fuel rods, and grenades.

, Spawn killing is the killing of players just after they die and before they can get good weapons. I like to do this with the sniper rifle. I aim the cross-hairs (with x8 zoom on) from my team's base to the other teams base across the map. I then shoot heads as soon as they appear.

,, There's a narrow dark alcove here you can reach with a drop into a vent.,

The Black Eye Skull enabled, players must melee enemies to regenerate shields, as shields will no longer regenerate automatically.

,, As you drive the tank, the Cargo Ship (and Phaeton) appears above and to the left as you move up the hill., After you do this, the skull will spawn in the area. It always spawn in one of three locations; on the roof of the Scorpion garage, next to the fence on the left before you reached the hill that triggers the Cargo Ship/Phaeton, or under a natural archway beneath the garage. The skull always spawns under grey metal boxes or yellow barrels.

The Iron Skull forces players to restart at the beginning of the mission rather than the last checkpoint, so use this Skull at your own risk.

, Then enter a large door inside the mine with a forklift., When you're on the pipes, go right and enter a short cave / vent where the skull is easily visible.

, Early in the mission, you'll enter an area with a crashed Phantom surrounded by Covenant enemies. Clear the soldiers and then climb on the cliff side to the right of the combat area.

Look behind the Phantom to spot a tunnel -- jump to it. At the end of the path you'll find a Grunt talking to a skull. Melee him and the skull will spawn where he was sitting.
This Skull causes all Grunts killed by headshots to burst into confetti, while Grunts killed without headshots explode like a grenade, dealing damage to anything nearby.

, At the very end of the level, you'll encounter a familiar face in an alien installation. Before approaching her, turn right and move up the hill. Move onto the small Forerunner landing to spot the skull. 

This skull disables the motion sensor on the HUD, preventing players from detecting nearby enemies.

, You'll get a view of ships flying in the distance through a door with a fallen cross-beam., Jump into the cracks of the beam using the exterior cliffs.,

This Skull doubles the health of all enemies, increasing their sustain.

,, Enter a Banshee and fly into a high alcove above the green light.,

The Catch Skull increases the amount of grenades that enemies carry and throw.

, This is where a Warden fight ensues, but if you're quick you can grab the skull before he spawns., At the edge of the cliff over-looking the Guardian, there's a metal beam jutting out and pointing down. Drop onto this beam to discover a hidden alcove with your next skull.

The Cowbell Skull triples the explosive power of all explosive weapons.

, There's a rock formation between the bridge you just crossing and that ring.,

The Tilt Skull generally reduces the effectiveness of weapons depending on the favorability of the target certain weapons are used on.

,, There's hallway entrances to the left and right. In the center you'll find a skull.

Using swords is all about timing.,
When your aiming sensor turns red, press the right trigger for an instant kill.

,
Hide.,
Always pay attention to your radar.

,
When sneaking up on opponents, crouch walk.,
Practice, practice, practice.

,
Many players will tell you to wait until the cursor turns red before attacking with the sword, but sometimes this will backfire.,
Don't lead with the sword, carry it in your off-hand.,
Know areas where it is easier to get the jump on a person.,
Grenades are your out of sword range answer.

,
If players start to complain about your sword usage, and after they kill you, know that the player who killed you will nine chances out of ten attempt to use the sword against you.,
Yes, the sword can be a very cheap weapon.,
Speaking of Rockets, if your opponent has one, chances are slim that you will survive that fight.,
A shotgun can beat a sword, however the window for this to work is about 1/4th of a second, so if you go in for the kill and get blasted, the guy you tried to kill is either really lucky or really good, not modding.

,
Another strategy to dominate in sword games is when you are lunging move your body and cursor to the left or right so you will be on right or left of them not in front of them.",How to Dominate Swords in Halo," Know your attack range and experiment with timing.;
,, If you can catch your opponent off-guard, it is an easy kill for you.

,, This way you will not appear on their radars.

,, A well timed shotgun blast can trump a sword lunge, and waiting for the cursor to go red can take a few seconds. Two swipes will almost always take care of a player, unless they have an overshield. Always go for close range whenever you have the sword, and once you've reached close range, start attacking immediately. If your cursor turns red before you reach close range, then lunge, but if you're already in close range, don't waste time waiting for a lunge. You attack faster right after the first sword hit, so just a quick double tap will do it. If they run away after the first swipe and you can't get to them, throw a grenade behind them and you should get the kill. Also, jump-lunging is a must. It throws off your opponents aim and it's a fast attack. To effectively jump lunge, you'll have to be fairly well at keeping your cursor on a player. Keep them in the cursor and jump at them, then when it goes red (usually at the peak of your jump) lunge. It's a rewarding tactic to use because it reduces the amount of damage you take during the fight so it betters your chances of staying alive for long periods of time.

, Use any weapon and move into close range, then when switch to the sword, you may be able to get a lunge in. Also, if they're weakened up before you get the sword out, one swipe might be all you need.

, The tower where the sniper rifle is located in Lockout is a great place to get kills, just remember to stay on the stairways on the outer edge and never to go up to the top, a talented sniper will aim for the barrels and will get you with the explosions.

,, Remembers to use grenades. Almost any weapon you can find will be better than an SMG against the sword, except for Plasma Rifles and Needlers. If you have a plasma pistol, fire off a fully charged blast, and then try to hit them with a grenade. Fire Battle Rifles at their head. If you can get the shotgun, line them up with you, and then wait for them to lunge, and fire while they are in mid lunge. This trick may require several tries to master. The key here is not to jump the gun, once fire you don't get many second chances.

, So don't brag, and maybe your friends won't Noob Combo, Vehicle Whore, or Rocket Whore against you in future games.

, Try to avoid them at all costs.

,, Most of the time when you lunge when you are in front of them, you will die.

, The advantage of a sniper is its range, so use it. Attack from a long distance so your opponents can't retaliate.

,, On large open maps such as Bloodgulch, it is not uncommon for two experienced snipers to have a shootout on opposite sides of the map, both strafing around while sniping at the same time.

Find a location where it is hard for people to sneak up on you (against a wall for instance).,
Know thy enemy.",How to Become a Good Sniper in Halo for Computer2," While it may be tempting to find a good camping spot, the sniper rifle in Halo leaves a visible trail that will make even the stealthiest snipers vulnerable. Strafe around unpredictably to avoid getting shot and learn to predict the opponent's movements.

, When crouched, you halve the area for someone else to shoot at. And being a sniper, you don't really need to move that fast.

, Do NOT walk straight or head on into the enemy as that can get you easily sniped.

, A good location gives the sniper a wide open range to snipe targets from while eliminating the threat of surprise attacks from the behind or side. Use peripheral vision to watch your radar and be weary of sniper trails from the enemy. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!


Every time you enter a new open area, scan the perimeters quickly for potential targets or enemies.







, Remember which ones walk straight or predictably, remember which ones carry a sniper or is wearing an over-shield.

Learn how to snipe moving vehicles.,
Learn to point blank-no scope.",How to Become a Good Sniper in Halo for Computer3," Snipe the exposed body of the enemy rather than the vehicle itself. When done correctly the vehicle's protection is moot.(This is an extremely difficult skill to master and should be practiced thoroughly first in order not to waste ammo)

, In Halo, the sniper has a cross hair whether you zoom in or not, which makes it much easier to point blank someone with the sniper rifle. However, this is still a tough skill to master and possibly remains outside the realm of 'sniping'. However good snipers in Halo can utilize the sniper rifle's potential whether in close range or at a distance.

A banshee is not recommended if your opponent has a tank, as unless you are an exceptional flyer you will be an easy target. If you are using the banshee, when you are trying to splatter them watch out for people with rockets or nades.

, Don't stop firing the machine gun because it has unlimited ammo. Aim carefully at your enemy and fire the main gun. It should kill in one shot.

, If you only it's back to the enemy you are no longer a sniper target and can kill them easily.

Or you could go with the rocket launcher, which is good for blowing up warthogs that your enemies might take once they get the flag, but it can hurt you if you hit a close by target.;
, All levels are different, but for the levels where the teams have an inside fortress (Blood Gulch, Battle Creek, Ice Fields, Infinity, Hang 'em High, etc) you can wait on top of the base (but keep moving so snipers can't hit you) and shoot at approaching enemies or vehicles with your handgun, doing some damage to them, and then when they are heading into your base to get the flag, jump down into there and introduce them to your shotgun. Or, you can just wait inside the base, crouching and staying motionless until an enemy comes.

, Warn them if you see any enemies coming in advance, so they have enough time to go and defend the flag if you end up killed. Maybe ask for another camper to help you.

, Lisa then enters the area, smashing one of the statues.


If as Jill, Barry will go crazy and point his gun at you. As soon as Lisa enters, you will be faced with a decision to give him back his gun or not.
If you give it back (recommended for a better ending), he can survive the battle and help you out.
If you don't give it back, he automatically gets knocked off the edge by her and drops a family picture and you get to keep his .44 Magnum.



, There are two ways of doing this;


Push down all four pillars to uncover the tomb and make her scream when she sees it and jump off the edge. She will mainly focus on your partner because he is the one shooting her. If she is about to kill your partner, shoot her to divert her attention. Also be careful not to let her push you off or hit you.
Shoot her until she falls off. Shoot her until she gets to the edge, where she will almost fall off but holds on. Run right over to her, aim down with your gun and fire again. That should make her lose her grip and fall off. Using the Infinite Rocket Launcher if you unlocked it by completing Normal or Hard mode in under 3 hours, you can get her close to the edge and then shoot, and she will be knocked down and will just fall off the edge without holding on.

Avoid carrying any unnecessary guns/ammo.,
Master the knife.,
Lay down the smackdown.,
Use the rocket launcher on bosses.,
Use upgrades to get more ammo.,
Run when it's smart to do so.,
Don't panic when a Plaga pops out of an enemy.",How to Conserve Resources in Resident Evil 41," It may seem strange to you, but traveling light is essential if you want to keep going and have enough useful bullets.  You'll only ever find ammo for the weapons you have in your attache case from random drops and boxes.  If you don't have the Rifle?  You won't get Rifle drops.  If you don't have a mine thrower?  Ditto. In general, you should stick to maybe three weapon types- plus a magnum for sticky situations and bosses. Try the Pistol, Shotgun, and Rifle, but feel free to mix and match and find your own play style.;
, Learning how to effectively use your knife will go a long way in preserving your ammunition.  Use these tips and practice to master the knife!


Slash boxes with the knife to open them.
Slash downed enemies with the knife.
The enemy AI in the game is programmed to start swinging early if you're running towards them.  If you stop short when they wind up and back off, they'll miss and you'll have an opening to run in and slash their face- which will have the same stunning effect that shooting them in the head would, leaving them open for a melee attack.

, In general (with a few rare exceptions towards the end of the game) you don't want to shoot at the body of a Ganado.  Instead, aim for the face or knees.  Shooting these targets will allow you to perform a melee attack that will knock an enemy down and send them flying.  


However, past the castle section, it's worth it more to shoot them in the knees.  If you manage to send a Zealot or Militia Ganado to their knees, then you can perform a devastating suplex.  It has a very high chance to decapitate your foe, and will never generate a Plaga.  
You're also completely invincible while performing melee attacks, so no need to fear.  If you play your cards right, and use this strategy in conjunction with your knife-work, you can use as little as one handgun bullet to take out normal enemies.

, It is one of the greatest tools in the game, especially for boss enemies.  El Gigante, Salazar, Verdugo, U-3, whatever- nothing is a match for this weapon.  30,000 Pesetas for an instant boss kill you can easily waste whole stacks of ammo on is a winning exchange.

, If you run out of ammo and you're near or about to hit a merchant's stand, go and upgrade the weapon's capacity.  The merchant will be kind enough to throw in the bullets to match the upgrade, so you're basically getting free ammo.

, Those who fight and run away, live to fight another day.  Don't get wrapped up in a fight that you absolutely don't have to get involved in.  Save your bullets for required fights.

,  Primarily because they can be insta-killed with a flash-bang.  However, it should be noted that the crawler Plagas need to be crawling on the ground before you try it.

Don't overbuy guns.,
Sell upgraded guns for a high price when it's time to buy the next round of upgrades.,
Avoid certain weapons.,
Don't forget the freebies!",How to Conserve Resources in Resident Evil 42," It bears repeating- you don't want more than four guns in your attache case.  They take up a lot of room, they're expensive, and upgrading them gets costly quick.  Stick to four guns, and keep it simple.

,  In addition, treasures are scattered all throughout the game.  These items can be sold to the merchant for large amounts of money.  They're all hidden in various places, but you can buy a treasure map close to the start of each area that marks their location with a star.  Before you sell them, however, make sure to check the description.  If it says anything like ""This looks like it was once set in something"" or ""It looks like something was set here,"" then keep it and try to find what can be attached to it.  This includes:


The Beerstein (combine it with the Three Catseyes, Red, Yellow, and Green)
The Elegant Mask (combine it with the Green, Purple, and Red Gem)
The Butterfly Lamp (combine it with the 'Eye' gems you get from killing Novistadors)
The Golden Lynx (combine it with the Blue Stone of Treason, the Red Stone of Faith, and the Green Stone of Judgement)
The Crown (combine with the Crown Jewels and Royal Insignia)

, This is somewhat a matter of personal opinion, but you're better off skipping these weapons and holding out for the betters to save on Pesetas.


Red9 - The first offender.  The power it packs is an incredible draw- and when fully upgraded, it packs 5.0 power, the equivalent of five standard handgun shots.  However, while the punch it packs is nice, it's outperformed in all other areas by the other handguns in terms of reload speed, capacity, and firing speed.  Not to mention the gun is so hard to aim reliably that you pretty much have to buy the stock if you want to do reliable damage.  Also, the you have the option to purchase the Blacktail the minute you get into the castle, and it's fully upgraded power is still a respectable 3.4.
TMP - The Machine Pistol is certainly a good weapon for crowds, admittedly.  However, if you're dealing with a crowd of Ganados, you'll rarely find yourself in a situation that the Shotgun won't perform equally well in.  Plus, in the Castle segment, the Blacktail is available for purchase, which hits harder per bullet, has more common ammo drops, and is far more precise than the TMP, which really needs the stock to be accurate.
Killer7 - This is a powerful gun. 25 base power compared to the Broken Butterfly's 13.  However, you're very rarely going to find yourself in a situation that needs that base power- in fact, you should rarely, if ever use the magnum.  The fact that you find the Broken Butterfly for free in the castle is a far better deal than the 77,700 Pesetas you'd spend on it.  It's a boss killer weapon, but so is the Rocket launcher- and you could buy two of those for that price.
Mine Thrower - This is an incredibly dangerous weapon that takes up too much space in the inventory and has a tendency to blow up in your face without the additional scope.  Literally.

, There are several free weapons throughout the game, and they're all worth your time if you can spare it.


Shotgun - Hanging on the wall in the two-story house in the Pueblo.  Do not try to get it until the normal enemies head to the church in the opening chapter. Otherwise it will trigger a massive enemy rush.
Punisher - Through the Village, you'll find blue medallions hanging around.  Shoot ten of them and talk to the merchant to get the Punisher handgun for free.  Shoot all fifteen, and he'll throw in a free firepower upgrade.
Broken Butterfly - In the castle, if you give Ashley a boost in a certain segment, she can unlock the door to a free Broken Butterfly Magnum.

Save resources based on what weapons you're using.",How to Conserve Resources in Resident Evil 43," These are methods of saving ammo with the various weapons:


Handgun: Shoot for the knees or head, and go for the Melee/Knife combo.
Shotgun: Try to get more than one Ganado in your sights, aim at head level, and fire.  The results will be satisfying, and mimic the results of a Gallagher show.
Rifle: Headshots are the obvious method, but the Rifles get so powerful that body shots will suffice- and this is where it shines.  The Rifle can penetrate multiple targets (at least three, on previous play-throughs) and can thusly take out multiple foes with one shot.
TMP: The same strategies that were used for the Pistol can be used here- although you'll burn through ammo fast.
Magnum and Mine Thrower:  Don't miss.  This may seem short, but anything you hit with the magnum is a goner anyway.

Prepare for a challenge in the Water Room!,
Suplex as you go up the Spiral Elevator.,
Don't be afraid to run on the Island.",How to Conserve Resources in Resident Evil 44," The Pueblo is the first area you encounter- a small village with a few buildings.  You have to kill a set number of enemies to progress, but if you play your cards right, you can get this section complete with only one bullet.  Here's how:


Once you enter, you'll see a barn on your right.  Go to the house to the immediate left and kick the door open.  Now run to the right and push the chest of drawers halfway in front of the door.
Now, go in front of the door and shoot a hole in the door around the knob.  This will open up a hole.  Run towards it, get out your knife, and start swinging.
There you go!  You're untouchable, and are free to just slice away!

, Getting stuck in the Cabin with Luis is a nerve-wracking experience.  You can make it easier on yourself, though.


To start, push two bookshelves in front of the boarded up windows.  Just two, not all three.  Then destroy the boards of the one you left uncovered.  This gives you a chokepoint that you can easily control.  After they all start swarming in through all the openings, the Ganados are all in the small space with you.  Try shooting the Ganados in the head and try to kick a lot of them at a time.
When Luis urges you to go upstairs, this is where the Punisher really shines. Stay at the top of the stairs, and aim down them. The enemies will try to use ladders to get up to you, but Luis will always knock them down, forcing the enemies to use the stairs. As the Punisher blasts through two enemies at once for the same damage, it will make a troubling segment that much easier.

, Take the right path, buy a rocket launcher, and shoot El Gigante.  The Sheer number of Ganados you have to shoot on the left path is simply ridiculous, especially with Ashley following you around.

,  Now, scope up and shoot the zombies.  Don't worry about hitting a vital point, they'll fall over when you hit them.  Instant kill.  Not to mention the Rifle pierces enemies, so you can potentially take out three Ganados with one bullet.  If you run out, switch to the Pistol.  No need to reload when the Semi-Auto Rifle is so close.

, After you take the truck out, run.  Just keep moving and get inside the Castle, it's triggered by a cutscene after you're over the bridge.

, But seriously, the worst part is when Ashley has to turn the two cranks on the upper level. If you still have some flash grenades, you can make them flinch while Ashley does her work.

, Remember your suplex on the elevator!  It makes you invincible, and is an insta-kill, most of the time.  Use it!  And remember, you can kick enemies off of the platform.

, It's honestly better to run away from most of the fights here.  Luckily, you have one of the best tools to do so- the Striker.  There's a glitch in the game where if you take aim with the striker- and before the aiming laser can show up, switch to another weapon - once you resume the action, Leon will be moving at 1.5x speed.  This is extremely handy, especially for slipping past ""It"".

A really fun and hard to do thing is killing your opponent by a vehicle.,
You can fall on an opponent and catch him between banshee's wings, target will lay down immediately.,
Always try to catch your opponent's tail if possible.

If you are close enough to a turret, quickly get over it and shoot from there.,
You can still turn a turret warthog upside down when it is in range, practise to make it accurate.,
Often return to a med-kit position, as it is the key to immortality.,
In Shee-to-Shee battles accelerate facing the other, and when it is close enough stop accelerating and shoot the plasma ball a bit upper of the target shee.,
When still falling, don't hesitate to throw your plasma bolts under the target, as it will deadly reduce his maneuver ability.

,
After all you will get in to the banshee-circle sooner or later.,
Never stop firing at this time, but use your plasma balls well enough, because you can only use them once in 5 seconds.

,
Don't forget that banshees does not give you a super armor, so you must dodge (as much as possible) whatever they throw at you.

,
Try to blow the weapons away from your opponents.,
Never ever forget about the jitter and ping in online games.",How to Become a Master Banshee Pilot in Halo Combat Evolved," Banshee has low maneuver ability, but it is better when not accelerating. (remember that) and it is vulnerable against the plasma weapons so try to dodge them.;
,(Also it protects you from angry ""bombing"" team mates)

, (do not suck the ground) if you want to crush somebody, do it from the top of him, as i told banshee has lower maneuver skill than on foot so dive from the sky on the target to stay alive and to make yourself harder to get shot.

,,,,, Just come close without fast maneuvers and crush him.

, Shoot his legs until his shield is down, then place the big plasma cannonball between his legs. That should be enough.

, So that rocket shooters can't get you.

, This will avoid you from the rockets.

, Bomb will either make its respawn time maximized (so it won't disappear) and shortens your take off time.

, This may sound crazy but it adds lots of team advantage to the game as it makes the respawn time longer. You can use a plasma bomb under the vehicles. Or you can always use suicide attacks. For example you are facing a rocket launcher man shooting at you but you are pretty high, the moment you are dead means the moment he is dead. (It is really fun to do)

,(called manride- by me ;D)

,, Easy as that.

,, if nothing works, use a bomb outside the banshee.(hope you will be still alive in the middle of all opponents ;D)

, fire until shield is down, then plasma cannonball as usual.

, It is very useful when you want to get close.

, With time you can reduce the back-in-the-field time.

, It will get hit up to %85, which is a good rate.

,, Though it is a bad thing. Break the circulation by turning the other direction, or stopping the acceleration to get better maneuver ability.(most useful-as mentioned at the top)

,,, Is very useful if someone's trying to reach a rocket launcher.

, even though the ping is low jitter highly differences between host and clients. So if you are the client you should guess your opponent's next move and depending on that, you must shoot at slightly further of the target's visible position. However host does not need to calculate the jitter as they have none. (Called host advantage-most hosts deny that it differs though) You will be able to see the difference easily in a vehicle.

Decide whether on not you actually want to fight the Nemesis- on Easy he does not drop anything, however on Hard he drops weaponry upgrades.,
Expect a long fight, and bring plenty of ammunition.,
While unarmed the Nemesis will use four forms of attack, all of them dodge-able.,
When using his rocket launcher the Nemesis loses his signature grab, however keep in mind that you always dodge rockets to Jill's left.",How to Beat Nemesis in Resident Evil 3,";
, Freeze rounds will slow the Nemesis, however any form of grenade, and the magnum, will shorten the battle significantly (the shorter the battle, the less chance of you losing health). The shotgun is not recommended as it has a considerable amount of recoil, and can make dodging difficult. Filling your free slots beforehand with herbs is obviously recommended, however if it is not an option be ready to be forced to practice dodging via trial and error.

, It is strongly recommended that you take one or two shots, and, only run a little between shots. Avoid walls or dodge may not work, and remember- don't get greedy.
Note: the Nemesis uses his left hand for his attacks- swinging to his right has a better chance when not using the R1 dodge.


The first attack is a straightforward punch, a little practice with dodging(tap R1 directly after he throws the punch) can make this attack worthless.
The second attack is a ""power"" punch, in which the Nemesis reaches back before punching. The timing has a delay, and misinterpreting it as the quick punch often results in a hit. Only real way to get used to the switch up is trial and error.
The third attack is his grab- mash buttons to break the grip, but remember-low Caution or any form of Danger makes it a guaranteed kill. Keep your health in the green to guarantee survival if possible.
Should you attempt to place too much distance expect a charge, however don't bother learning the timing when you could simply keep close.

, Waiting for him to fire and simply moving left or right can be a much safer way to avoid rockets, but should you have the space to use the dodge be prepared to stop firing when he aims. When your already holding R1 the X button will dodge, should you press it too soon after firing, however, it will not count as a dodge.

Stay calm.,

Handgun only. Walk forward and alert the two Zealots. Walk into the corner close to the door, and kill them here. The Garradors will not hear. Next, walk up the stairs. For some reason the Garradors will turn around, and get their claws stuck in the wall. Run up to them, and take about 4 shots in each of their backs. They will scream in pain and stay there for about 8 seconds. Now, run into the tunnel, and shoot the Zealot in his knee. Suplex him, and he will die. When the Garradors come, they will get their claws stuck for SURE! When they do, run to the bottom where you entered. For some reason, they continue to roam the tunnels. Once here throw a grenade at the last set of Zealots, or go into the corner and shoot them there. Then, all you need to do, is shoot the bell, and get about three shots in there back. Done!
Shotgun/Handgun Only. Follow the instructions above on how to kill the Zealots. Simply do what it says above, only when their claws are stuck, shoot their parasite with the Riot Gun/Shotgun. About 4-5 shots to kill each.
Rifle. Pretty easy. Kill the Zealots like in the handgun directions. Then shoot the bells, and rifle each of their backs. Try to take multiple shots. Easy!
Broken Butterfly. This is so easy! Kill the Zealots like in the handgun directions. After this go up the stairs, and they get their claws stuck. Do two Broken Butterfly shots each. They will die, before the next flight of Zealots arrive!
Knife only. O.K, this will be very hard. It's best to go anywhere (walk) and kill the Zealots. When they are about to attack, back it, then rush in and knife. Then focus on the Garradors. (Stay on the bottom floor!) Run around and one will charge. Dive out of the way, and begin knifing his back. When he turns, don't run! Stay there! The other Garrador will stay up there if you are luck. Keep turning so you are facing his back, and knife away. After a while he will die. Pick up the money and repeat for the next blind guy. After this, you have 30, 000 pesetas. Go to the merchant and buy a gun!

Be aware of which classes you play well, and which ones you don't.,
Try your best to stay alive.,
Remember the name of the game!,
Communicate with your team.,
Practice makes perfect.,
Last, but not least, enjoy yourself.",How to Be an Effective Team Member in Team Fortress 2," If you haven't logged many hours of gameplay yet, avoid playing as the Spy. Everybody knows he's fun, but know that spying is best left to more experienced players. Chances are, you won't have any of the equipment that will make him easier to play (Eg. Dead Ringer, Cloak & Dagger, etc.) and you haven't seen a decent Spy in action or what his most crucial roles are. Starting out, try playing as the Soldier. The Soldier is versatile in a game that was not intended to be. He is easy for new players to understand (basically, point and shoot), and his health is not so ridiculously low that he is difficult to play. You can really help your team out by playing as him. If this does not appeal to you, or you don't feel like you're helping your team enough, play Medic. The Medic can turn the tide of battle in his own way. Teammates constantly failing, because everyone is too interested in the action to play a class as ""boring"" as him? Do NOT be afraid to step up to the challenge. It will give you a large sense of satisfaction seeing your teammates succeed thanks to your brilliant medicine skills. See Play a Medic in Team Fortress 2 and other class-specific wiki-hows for more.;
, A dead teammate is utterly useless to the rest of the team. Enough said.

, TEAM Fortress 2! What does that suggest? That you should play it using TEAM work! The first step after learning how to use a class is learning how to use it in conjunction with your team. An example of this would be the Pyro: he can help his teammates by checking regularly for Spies, putting out flaming teammates or heroically pushing an ÜberCharged Medic away from the one he is ÜberCharging.

, It will help everyone know the who's, where's, and etc., so they can contribute to the effort. Timing your offensive push along with everyone else is a stellar use of communication. You should also take time to listen to others. If everyone is griping for a Medic, maybe you should respawn as one, etc. It is possible to play the whole game without a microphone, but the amount of chat spammers, trolls, etc. out there right now makes it difficult to do so. The set of voice commands get ignored a lot. Bind short sentences to effectively communicate when you're in a pinch.

, Simply doing your best and logging hours on the servers will help your teamwork tremendously (not to mention help you become better as an individual). MGE Servers are really good for developing your death match skills.

, It's a game. Don't take it too seriously. If you get killed by that same guy over and over again, just laugh it off, tell him he's doing a good job. It doesn't matter what team you're on- you have to play with/against them, so you might as well get along, make some new friends, and have fun doing so.

Master the knife.,
Kill only what you must.,
Pick up Everything.,
Use each weapon appropriately.",How to Conserve Ammo in Resident Evil,"


If you are less than proficient with the knife, there is still a way for you to use it, but will still require some ammo. Shoot zombies a few times until they fall, but not die. Go over and slash their fallen bodies as quickly as possible. If they get up before you are done, finish them off with a gun. If you want to do this to multiple zombies at the same time, kill all but one of them and do the trick on the last one standing. If you really want to save some ammo, try angling your knife downwards and slashing them in the legs a few times whilst they are still standing. This will bring them down and allow you to lay into them freely.;
, Only kill enemies in spots you will be backtracking through a lot, pose a big threat or are bosses and must be killed as part of the plot. Be sure to remember where the living enemies are, though, so you can be prepared or don't accidentally go there if you are lost. Remember, Resident Evil is about surviving, not killing.

, Examine the color of rooms on the map to see if you forgot anything. If you run out of inventory space, go to an Item Box and come back.

, Each weapon has its own uses. Weapons where ammo is scarce are usually meant to be used on bosses.


Handgun: Your primary weapon in all games, ammo is common. Useful against zombies and other weak, common enemies.
Shotgun: Usually the first weapon you find in the game, shells are second most common to Handgun rounds. Also a great multi-purpose weapon - while it is deadly in close quarters, you can also take advantage of the wide spread of the pellets and use it to damage multiple enemies at the same time at a distance.
Automatics: These include Sub-machine guns like the the MAC-11 (RE2) and the Assault Rifle (RE3). One shot from one of these is weaker than that of a Handgun, but being Full-Auto makes up for that. They also usually have high capacities. Exceptions include the Gatling Gun (RE2 and 3) and the AK-47 (RE:CVX).
Special Weapons: Includes Magnums and Grenade Launchers. Ammo is scarce, suitable for bosses, and can usually be replaced by the shotgun.

Trap and combo enemies.",How to Airblast As Pyro in Team Fortress 2," The Pyro's airblast can extinguish any teammate that is on fire. Simply go close to your burning teammate and aim the airblast at them. If you see any teammate on fire, extinguish them, even if they have high health. You get points for extinguishing teammates, and you can save your teammates from dying.;
, If timed correctly, the Pyro's airblast can reflect many projectiles. Some examples of projectiles that the Pyro can reflect are rockets (including sentry gun rockets), grenades and arrows. A reflected projectile will deal mini-crit damage, unless the projectile was a critical projectile or the Pyro is under the effects of a crit-boost (such as the Kritzkrieg UberCharge), in which case the reflected projectile will also be a critical projectile. While reflecting projectiles with the airblast can be used effectively on the offense, it can also be used for defensive purposes, such as:


Defending a sentry gun from rockets
Protecting your team from rockets and grenades fired by robots in Mann vs. Machine

, A Medic using an UberCharge on himself and his patient can be a real threat to your team, but the Pyro can use his airblast to separate the Medic from his patient. Doing this will make it easy for your team to dispatch the Medic's patient, however if the patient of the Medic manages to see you while you are going to disrupt the UberCharge you could take lots of damage or get killed. Be aware that if a Medic has the Quick-Fix and UberCharges someone you won't be able to break it up, due to the Quick-Fix's UberCharge preventing knockback

, While the airblast itself does not do any damage, the Pyro can use the airblast to push enemies off of large drops to kill them from landing out of bounds or from fall damage. This can be a very useful strategy on maps such as Upward or Hightower, which have large out-of-bounds zones.

, Since the airblast can push enemies, it can be used to defend a capture point being captured by an enemy. This can be very useful if there are many enemies capturing the point, because it would be difficult to kill all the enemies by burning them. This strategy can also be very effective on capture points that are high up, such as the last point on Gravel Pit, as the enemies could potentially die from fall damage.

, Using the airblast's ability to push back enemies, you can trap enemies in corners or against a wall. This can allow you to follow up easily with a melee attack or a shot from your secondary. This strategy is very effective with the Reserve Shooter as it deals mini-crit damage to enemies in the air as well as decreasing the time it takes for weapon switches, meaning that you can burn the enemy with your flamethrower, airblast them against a wall, and then shoot them with the Reserve Shooter for lots of damage.

Look at your equipment: Every Spy has a deadly and accurate 6/24 Revolver (Primary), the class based Sapper (Secondary) and a deadly Knife (Melee).,
Understand the nature of disguising: There are several points to consider when attempting to disguise.,
Don't hide from the battle: The cloak and dagger allows Spies to remain cloaked indefinitely, but a good Spy won't take advantage of that ability.,
Be deceptive and unpredictable: Players are humans, and will be more careful as you become more successful.,
Understand the nature of your cloak: The cloak, as expected, will render you invisible.,
Stay out of the way of enemy Pyros: In general, Pyros are one of your arch nemesis, since they can burn you and render your cloaking ability completely useless.,
Backstab your enemies: One of the primary associations made with the Spy is his ability to kill any enemy with one knife strike from behind.,
Set your target priority: Going for ""Personal Glory"" and landing four backstabs in a row feels great, but may not be the most beneficial way to help your team.,
Understand how your sapper works: Sappers slowly damage an Engineer's buildings (sentry guns, teleporters, and dispensers) and disable them, making them useless unless the Engineer removes the sapper in time.,
What to do if discovered: Most of the time, if you are discovered, you are easily killed; however, in some situations you can spy yourself to safety.,
Remember your revolver: While it can be tricky to aim, the revolver is still very powerful, and can be devastating if you get a critical hit.,
Distract.,
Sabotage and Thievery.,
Know how sentry guns work.,
One way is to crouch jump on top of the sentry without a disguise (using your Eternal Reward) and uncloak: the sentry takes a while to look up at you and shoot.,
Know where to hide.,
Know your watches: The Spy will start with his basic Invisibility Watch, rendering him completely cloaked.",How to Play a Spy in Team Fortress 2," Foreshadowing all of this, he has an Invisibility Watch to cloak him completely, rendering him impossible to see (Secondary Fire) and a Disguise Case, useful to fooling the opposing team (Four key).;
,


One of the major improvements for Spies in TF2 is the effect of movement speed on the Spy, depending on your current disguise. For example, you will slow down to a Heavy's movement speed while disguised as a Heavy.
Keep in mind that you will not speed up to a Scout's or Medic's speed (although the Medic's speed is not much different from your speed.)
Make sure that your disguise makes some sense. You probably wouldn't find a Scout running down to your own intelligence room, just as you wouldn't find a Pyro defending in the water, or a Sniper charging the front lines. The general idea here is that you want to blend in with the other team as much as possible, so don't do things that they wouldn't do otherwise. Also try not to disguise as an enemy Spy because most enemies go crazy when they see a Spy, theirs or the enemy's, and instantly attack them. Also, try to stay away from your team mates; when the enemy sees you close to your team mates without you shooting at them or vice versa, they will get suspicious.
Remember that enemy Medics can heal you when you are disguised. Your health will match that of the person you're disguising as, so you will often appear to need a heal. Calling for a Medic while disguised can often give you an excuse to retreat into the enemy base, which is particularly useful with the Dead Ringer.
Enemy Engineer dispensers will also heal you while disguised. Level 3 dispensers restore cloak in both the Invisibility Watch and Dead Ringer more quickly than cloak is used, so you can stay invisible near a Level 3 dispenser indefinitely.
Back in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), a disguised Spy would resemble an enemy player to your teammates, which proved to be very confusing: When disguised in TF2, you will resemble a Spy wearing a ""cardboard-cutout mask"" of your chosen class, to your teammates. This will help to distinguish you from an actual enemy player.
Before the Sniper vs. Spy update, the enemy Spy disguise was useless, as it didn't wear a disguise mask. Disguising as a friendly player was the preferred way to approach the front lines. Now, with the update, you will disguise as a disguised Spy, making an enemy Spy disguise much more effective.

, While you're cloaked, you aren't helping your team.

, Hide somewhere different every time, don't always camp the same place. When you are disguised and an enemy becomes suspicious and starts shooting you, the best thing to do would be to cloak and hide. This is because the Spy's revolver and knife will not do a remarkable amount of damage in direct combat. When safe, disguise as a different class and return to enemy lines.

, It's very useful, yes, but it doesn't make you invincible. Keep these tips in mind when using the cloak.


You will be partially revealed if you take damage using the cloak and dagger or the vanilla watch. As such, don't run into oncoming fire while cloaked, such as toward a Heavy's minigun. The Dead Ringer will not shimmer when you take damage, and damage will be greatly reduced.
When you uncloak, you will glow your team's color. That is, if you are on the RED team, you will glow red before fading back into visibility. This happens regardless of whether you are disguised as a red or a blue player, so this will quickly give you away if you are seen removing your cloak.
Note that you cannot use any of your weapons or reload your revolver when cloaked or uncloaking. You will need to wait a few seconds to uncloak before being able to attack again.
Remember that you can still bump into enemies while cloaked. This makes running around corners tricky, as you'll probably end up bumping into a player by accident. If you bump into an enemy with the C&D or vanilla watch, your cloak will flicker and briefly reveal you, which has the potential to blow your cover completely. You will still block and be blocked by enemies with the Dead Ringer, but you will not flicker.
Keep in mind that you will only bump into enemies. You can easily pass through your teammates.
Uncloaking right behind enemy players is generally a bad idea. Becoming visible takes about two seconds, and in that time someone can easily see you. Furthermore, uncloaking makes a distinct sound, especially with the Dead Ringer, which an aware enemy will notice.
Use the Cloak and Dagger for infiltration. The cloak and dagger allows you to regenerate your cloak while you are cloaked and standing still. If you are moving, the cloak will be reduced more quickly than your normal cloak, but when you run out you stay partially cloaked. This makes it much easier to hide in an enemy base and disguise yourself without any trouble. The cloak and dagger makes cloaking a much more powerful weapon because you no longer need to be visible at any point in time during the round. Just be careful that when recharging you stand in a place that you won't get bumped into.
If you run while you're out of cloak, you will glow your team's color as if you were bumped or uncloaking. However, crouch-walking will allow you to remain fully invisible.
Use The Dead Ringer when under enemy fire. The Dead Ringer cloaks you when you are dealt damage and shows a death animation to your killer. As such, it is most effective when your team is charging the front line, or you're getting Spy-checked. Even after the fact, you may not be revealed to have the Dead Ringer if you have another Spy on your team. Try not to use it too much though, or you may find yourself still getting Spy-checked after you cloak. Just be warned, when you have the Dead Ringer out and you're not cloaked, it acts as if you are cloaked, so you cannot fire your weapon.
Find a safe place to uncloak with the Dead Ringer. The Dead Ringer makes a loud crackling sound upon uncloaking, which will instantly reveal you as a Dead Ringer spy. Find a place far away from enemies to uncloak.
Be particularly careful of Pyros. The Dead Ringer can extinguish flames, but if you use it while under fire from the flamethrower, you will be lit up again.

, If you are spotted by a Pyro, it may be in your best interest to cloak and get some cover. Be sure to stay out of the range of his flamethrower.

, When disguised, try to sneak up on an unsuspecting player and stab them in the back.


Always attack the farthest player in a group. If you manage to sneak behind a group of five players, start from the back and slowly start backstabbing forward, making sure that no one spots you in doing so. This works well when playing a Payload game since all of your enemies should be focused on pushing the payload and killing enemies ahead of it.
Avoid using the knife as a melee weapon. TF2 has made melee weapons pack a greater punch than the old knife/crowbar from TFC. The knife is excellent at backstabbing, but it comes at a cost. It is the weakest melee weapon in the game when not backstabbing, on par with the Scout's bat, but much slower, and does not deal critical damage. It is generally a good idea to switch to your revolver if you have given up on backstabbing your target. The Spy is not suited to close quarters combat. If you are discovered, cloak, get out of the area, and try again.
The Sniper class can unlock a secondary item named the Razorback. a wooden shield attached to their back, which makes them immune to one backstab, and a Spy breaking it with his knife will become unable to attack for a few seconds. If you bump into a Razorback-wielding enemy Sniper, simply shoot him in the head instead of using your knife.

, Get behind enemy lines and observe the other team. Do you see well-positioned sentries or teleporters? Does their Heavy wreak havoc to your team, and is he being healed by a Medic about to Ubercharge him? You constantly have to make the decision as to which target you attack first.

,


Since sappers disable sentry guns. It can help to shoot a sapped sentry with your revolver or stab it with your knife a few times to help destroy it quickly. It will not shoot at you so long as the sapper stays in place. Be careful when doing this with an Engineer attempting to repair it, as you may get killed in doing so.
With your sapper out and trained on your target object, a white outline of the sapper is displayed on the object. Bear in mind that this is visible not only to you, but to everyone present. Place your sapper and put it away quickly to avoid attention.
Don't forget that using a sapper will not remove your disguise.
Like for the other 'weapons', you will need to remove your cloak in order to be able to activate your sapper.
Enemy sentries are usually target priority, because they tend to cause a lot of destruction on your team.
Don't sap a dispenser immediately. Sap the sentry in an engineer camp and then let the dispenser refuel your ammo and health supplies. Then, when ready, sap the dispenser.

,


If you are close to your team, or there are not a lot of enemies covering the route to your team, you can just walk backwards while shooting your revolver to safety.
If you are not on fire, you can attempt to fool your pursuers by running in one direction, cloaking (it doesn't matter if you take a few hits) then running back in the other direction. It is also smart to take on another disguise while cloaked. Usually your pursuers will keep running in the first direction and checking everywhere for the cloaked Spy. This also leaves their backs wide open for a backstab if you are bold enough.
If you are near an Engineer and his buildings, do not simply sap everything. Typically, an Engineer would have no trouble removing all of these sappers and you will have lost time you could have spent killing the Engineer. It is best to sap a sentry first, kill the Engineer and proceed to sap the rest of his buildings. In rare cases the Engineer can be stabbed first, but the sentry must be sapped quickly after.

, Remember though that the revolver loses much of its power over medium to long range but critical shots don't.


The Ambassador is the more effective pistol over long range, due to the initial shot being perfectly accurate, and able to deal 100% crit damage for headshots; this strength is balanced against poorer body-shot damage and a slower fire rate. Choose your pistol according to your play style and map design.

,


A spy can let the opposing team ""accidentally"" discover him and lead them away from a battle or into a trap. A quick cloak and the enemy has been led on a wild goose chase. This won't work on all classes like Pyros or Scouts though, so be careful.
Conversely, enemies in combat don't have opportunities to check their backs. It is often easier to kill enemies in the middle of a fight than to kill them on their way to one.
Sapping teleporter entrances near the enemy's spawn will slow down their advances and sometimes distract Engineers into leaving their buildings to run back to spawn to build them up.

,


With the Dec. 10, '08 patch, a spy can now recharge their cloak with ammo boxes and dropped weapons. Use this to your advantage in enemy territory and strip enemy Engineers of respawning ammo boxes. This will not only slow down their construction but hopefully lead them further away from their buildings and teammates to find more metal. You can take this opportunity to sap or stab accordingly.
Also with this update a Spy can stay cloaked next to an enemy dispenser and drain its metal slowly.
Similarly to ammo boxes, stealing health packs in enemy territory can hamper them. This means less health for the enemy team and can lead to people dying sooner, Medics burning to death, etc.

,


Sentry guns cannot shoot through their own team's dispensers. If an Engineer is positioned in a way that won't allow a Spy to stab and sap quickly, consider stabbing the Engineer, hiding behind his dispenser, disguise, then sap the gun. This is risky as the enemy can see you without a disguise, or their gun can kill you, but this is still an option.
Sentry guns also spin to target players faster with lower levels. If you backstab an Engineer while he is behind his gun, you can sap lower level sentry guns easier without being shot because they spin to shoot you slower. Level 3 sentry guns are harder to sap in this case because they spin very fast and will push you back with a barrage of their bullets. A Spy can still sap a Level 3 sentry gun, but it must be done with proper positioning and fast weapon switching. Make sure you enable fast weapon switch in the game options to do this, or alternatively use the 'last weapon' button (default: Q) to instantly switch to the last weapon you were holding. You should briefly switch to your sapper before engaging the sentry in order for the 'last weapon' button technique to work.

,


The Spy Update has given the spy more options for tackling sentries. Due to the greater accuracy and firepower of the Ambassador over a long distance when aiming at an enemy's head, the weapon can effectively disable a turtling engineer outside of a sentry's range of fire, or from behind cover.
You can do a similar strategy with this using walls, boxes, posts, ramps, etc. Out of sight of the sentry gun generally means safety.

, Players tend to take the shortest routes and generally don't stray from this path, especially if their destination is far away.


For example, players will take the inside corner of a hallway. As a spy you can travel or hide on the outside corners of these hallways and see enemy traffic and pick your targets accordingly.
Hiding on boxes, on top of objects on the wall, etc. makes it much less likely to be bumped into while cloaked or shown with enemy fire, explosions, etc.
Hide behind boxes, walls, around corners or places with respawning ammo boxes to keep your cloak up. Players don't usually check all corners so you can be relatively safe if you weren't spotted or suspected of being there.

, This watch can be used to run the length of the 2fort bridge, without stopping. The cloak and dagger allows you to cloak for an infinite amount of time as the cloak with regenerate while stationary. The Dead Ringer does not allow you to cloak until you get hit with it selected (MOUSE2), thus creating a fake ""corpse"" and cloaking you for a limited time. When the timer runs out or you uncloak, the watch will emit a loud noise, possibly alerting people near by.

Watch and listen.,
Keep an eye on every teammate.,
Check the Medic.,
Spy check.",How to Defeat a Spy in Team Fortress 2," Spies can't be seen, but they can be heard. Watch the kill/death list on the top right and listen to any screams from a teammate. If one screams out loud, quickly turn around and check to see if it's a Spy who backstabbed. The prime targets for a Spy are Engineer, Sniper, Heavy, Medic and basically anyone who is helping the team advance or defend.;
, Spies have the ability to disguise as a class but the name of the player will always be random. If you notice someone running around with your name, notice you and flee, give chase and start firing. If a teammate is doing something that's suspicious, tail him/her and see what happens. If the person can sap a building, it's a Spy.

, As said before, Spies like to play someone else and it's only a matter of time before someone your team mixes up the fake player with the real one. Always try to damage your Medic before going with the flow of the game. Spies can easily trick you and stab you while you're running. Remember, spies can't heal so it's easy to see who is a spy.

, A tactic everyone is familiar with, shoot everyone and anyone on your team. If the teammate takes damage, that player may be a Spy. Fire damage is the most popular to exploit for Spy-checking. Another way to Spy check is to play a Scout and run into everyone. Only teammates can phase through teammates, while enemies will run into each other and become roadblocks. Another way is to check the speed. Scouts and Medics are the only fastest classes past the Engineer, Sniper, Pyro and Spy. If you see another Scout that's running at their speed, it's a Spy. If you see a Medic who's running are their speed, it's a Spy. Force-a-Natures also provide a unique Spy check by pushing someone away. Use the two shots in one go and you can kill a Spy. One final way is to use explosive knockback by grenades or rockets.

Plan which kind of intelligence runner you want to be.,
Don't go alone!,
Anticipate possible problems.,
Look for shortcuts.,
Make sure you aren't being followed.,
Remember to check for enemies behind you very often, even if you are sure there isn't anybody following you.,
Don't immediately grab the intelligence, unless you are a slow moving class like the Demoman.,
After grabbing the intelligence, immediately take the shortest way possible to the exit.",How to Be Good at Capturing the Intelligence in Team Fortress 2," Only a few classes are ever good enough to actually get the enemy's intelligence out of their base. For example, a slow moving Heavy certainly would cause a ruckus, but probably couldn't even get out the flag room because of it's slowness. A fast moving Scout, on the other hand, is fragile, but can dodge enemy attacks.;
, Certain classes are perfectly built to help others. Go in small teams where each is given an achievable goal. Can your team deal with a base full of sentries? Are they mobile enough to get back to the base with the intelligence, or powerful enough to lock it down until a faster class arrives? Remember to communicate with your team as well. If you were killed by some camping spy/pyro etc. don't let your death be in vain. Warn your teammates so that they may avoid a similar fate!

, For example, if you are playing ctf_2fort, an engineer is likely to have set up a sentry near the spawn room, to kill enemy scouts. If possible, alert your teammates to the problem so they can at least delay your death until you can get around it.

, On ctf_2fort, the bridge across the middle has a roof. Scouts can double jump onto this roof and onto the other side, short-cutting across the entire lower section. Scouts can also double-jump across the court-yard if there is excellent defense near the lower entrance.

, If a pyro saw you, for example, you could turn around and gun him down while running down a long stairway. If a Heavy saw you, you could use your melee and run in circles around him to (mostly) avoid his minigun.

, Flag runners die from enemies behind them all the time.

, Wait a few seconds to let the enemy team be fooled into thinking there is nobody that got through their defense.

, In ctf_2fort, this is the courtyard. The closer you are to the enemy team's exit when you die, the easier it is to retrieve it on subsequent trips if it hasn't returned to its home.

Use the Bonesaw sparingly, at point-blank range. Melee kills are always fun, and melee weapons have taken quite a boost in power since the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) crowbar, but don't get cocky. Save your Bonesaw for stealthy strikes from behind, or if your attacker is right next to you and retreating isn't an option. Otherwise, you're usually better off healing another teammate and letting them finish the job for you instead.






Use the Syringe Gun for distance shots. As the name implies, the Syringe Gun fires hypodermic needles. It is not the most powerful weapon in TF2, but it is often underestimated by most players. An experienced player can be lethal with the Syringe Gun in their hands.






Note that the needles from the Syringe Gun actually fire slightly to the right of where the crosshair is. Fire at a wall from varying distances and look where the needles land to get a feel of where to aim. They also arc downward rather quickly. You'll need to aim upward and to the left with the Syringe Gun if you intend to hit any enemies from a distance. This does, however, make it useful to shoot over short hills.






The Syringe Gun's needles travel through the air slowly, which can make them easy for other players to dodge them. Keep this in mind.






Try using the Syringe Gun to provide cover fire for your team. They'll stay in the air long enough to travel at enemies that like to sidestep back and forth from corners.






Since the Syringe Gun's projectiles move through the air slowly, it is a good strategy to fire if an enemy is chasing you, with you either standing still, moving towards him, or backtracking. If he moves towards your syringes, he is more likely to get hit and thus die.





;
, This is essentially a given; your teammates will respect you for being able to heal them effectively and quickly.


The biggest change to the Medic since TFC is his ability to heal from a distance. You can now space yourself out from between your teammate as you heal them to avoid splash damage. You don't have to keep your crosshairs on the player to keep healing them, so you should look around frequently to keep an eye on the rest of the battlefield; it's a good idea to look for other wounded players, and keep an eye out for approaching Spies and Pyros.






In addition to healing, your Medi Gun can raise a player's health to 150% more of their maximum health. This will slowly return back to its maximum when you stop healing them. You can tell how ""overhealed"" a player is by the white glowing/pulsating surrounding his or her health cross; the bigger this glow, the more over healing they have received.






You will earn an ""assist kill"" if you are healing a teammate that gets a kill point.







, As you heal players, you will notice that the small bar on the bottom right corner of your HUD will start to fill itself. This is your ÜberCharge meter. When this reaches 100%, the Medic will announce that he is ""charged"". By right-clicking, you will activate the ÜberCharge, which will make you and your healing target completely invulnerable for a maximum of 8 seconds


Note that you and your target cannot capture points when Über Charged. Similarly, you and your target will not be able to carry the enemy intelligence (flag). However, you can still prevent the enemy team from taking a capture point while ÜberCharged.






Your ÜberCharge meter will fill fastest when healing a damaged player. It fills slowest when over healing a player who is already at 150% of their maximum health. This gives Medics an incentive to take care of his team as a whole, rather than to attach themselves to the nearest Heavy.






The announcement of ""I am charged!"" can be heard by nearby enemies. If you wish to cover up this tell-tale signal so they are less likely to be prepared for it, you can call for a Medic (or any other vocal command) just as the meter reaches 100%, and it will override the passive ""I am charged!"" announcement.







, The Medic is almost exclusively a support class, so he won't be taking part in as much battling as would a Soldier or other class. Even so, you'll receive plenty of assist kill points by keeping other players healed as they take out enemies.

, This is one point that most Medics tend to forget while on the front line. Medics slowly regenerate their health over time, but not fast enough to be useful during battle. Good Medics should look out for one another. If you are hurt, don't be afraid to call for a Medic like everyone else. Most of the time, it's colleagues before comrades. Healing another Medic on your team to save his life will ensure that he continues to heal, and keep building his ÜberCharge up.

, Lots of players like to shout for a Medic for the sake of getting your attention to come keep them healed - despite having full health. While it's good to keep your more vocal teammates buffed, make sure that you keep everyone else alive too.

, Medics have 36 class-specific achievements that gradually unlock three unique items.

The Blutsauger replaces the Syringe Gun after completing 10 Medic achievements. Each needle that strikes an opponent will heal the Medic for 3 HP. The tradeoff to this weapon is that it will reduce your own rate of health recovery.






The Kritzkrieg replaces the ÜberCharge. This is unlocked after attaining 16 Medic achievements. A charged Kritzkrieg will allow the Medic to grant another player a 100% critical hit rate for 10 seconds. It also charges 25% faster than the Medi Gun, but it does not provide invulnerability. Using the taunt for the Kritzkrieg (Oktoberfest) will give you 10 health points, but you are vulnerable while the taunt animation plays. This is best used when alone and on fire.






The Übersaw replaces the Bonesaw. This is attained by unlocking 22 Medic achievements. The Übersaw swings 20% slower than the Bonesaw (about one swing per second), but each hit will charge the Medic's ÜberCharge meter by 25%. Keep this in mind when you are attacking another enemy, as while you will get more ÜberCharge but will get less attack time. Be aware that that might kill you, losing all your ÜberCharge.






Note that you may switch back to your original equipment at any time by accessing the character load out (default key M or via the TF2 menu (i.e. hit Escape)). You can also edit up to 4 pre-set loadouts of equipment, and just change the preset you're using when the situation calls for it.







, This is a key aspect of survivability, if you're ahead of your team you will be an easy pick for the enemy., Use your ÜberCharge as an offensive tool, not to save your heavy that is backing up. In competitive play, the game is based around which team has Über advantage (more Über than the enemy). When Übering, back up towards the end of it! The uber ends in 8 seconds (less if you change targets) so once you are alone with your healing target you will be an easy pick., But you still are not faster than a scout. Remember that overdose will give you a 10% speed boost when ÜberCharged, but deals 20% less damage.,), for rapid engagement from one player to another.,,,,"

Know your enemy.,
Use PARANOIA, as this is your greatest weapon.,
Use the Long Distance Sniping.,
Use ""Spawn Stabbing"".,
Use the Wild Goose Chase.",How to Be an Expert Spy in Team Fortress 21," Observe them and take note of some things:


Is your enemy blind? If you run towards the enemy spawn disguised as an enemy scout and the enemy walking to you does not react, take note of this. You can be more daring in front of him.
Is your enemy deaf? If you uncloak with the DR(Dead Ringer) and the enemy does not react, he is probably deaf. Take liberties with him and do not be afraid to cloak or fire around him.
Is your enemy constantly spy checking? If so, you need to ramp up your game. Put on the full Anti-Pyro Setup (DR and Spy-cicle) and take long detours to ensure you don't get flamed.;
, You have succeeded when half of the enemy's team is playing as pyro.

, From a moderate distance away from the enemy's spawn, start spamming bullet shots at enemies who come out of spawn.


For maximum results, use the ambassador and line up those headshots (particularly easy if enemy players are waiting for the teleporter to recharge). From this location, you can also snipe down enemy buildings. Be clear of your escape routes, as you can be certain that angry enemy team members will hunt you down.
pl_badwater is a good place to do this. When the blue team spawn moves up, simply camp on the roof. There are a total of 4 escape routes (2 staircases and 2 sides of the roof to jump off).

, Simply camp outside the enemy's spawn door and wait for them to come up before quickly stabbing them and disguising again.


You should rack up 3 - 4 stabs before fleeing and waiting a while before doing the same thing. Hit ""TAB"" to ensure that the enemy you just stabbed isn't coming out of spawn to hunt you down.

, Using feints, mislead the enemy so that they will fruitlessly chase you, and after discovering that you have vanished, they will start to worry that you are right behind them, ready to attack.


Pulling this off is simple. Wait till an enemy sees you and starts to fire at you. Cloak while running in one direction; this will leave a smoke trail. Immediately after that, run in the opposite direction. The enemy will assume you went in the first direction and spend a long time looking for you.
You can do this more easily and while taking less damage if you use the Dead Ringer, a cloaking watch that when active, when you are damaged it immediately makes you fully invisible, the damage when activated and the damage while activated are reduced by 90%, and when you bump into enemy players, instead of being only partially visible, you remain as an invisible wall.

Learn to bunny hop.,
Get to know the best clans around.,
Explore as many servers as you can.,
Don't go to servers where the game settings are strangely altered.,
Look forward to getting your ass kicked when you challenge or play with great players.,
Use the gravity gun!,
Make use of every weapon you have.,
Remember that armor is very important.,
This is general rule for all beginning players.",How to Improve at Half Life 2 Deathmatch," There are many good how-to videos on YouTube.


Follow the steps to making good bunny hops. Take a few days to get used to it. It might actually take a few weeks to get it down right. Even though you won't get perfect bunny hops, you can still use the bursts of speed to reach around areas you couldn't get to before. Do these by yourself, and try to hop around a lot, shoot some things in mid air while you're at it. Get used to multi-tasting a bunny hop and a shot with a 357, shotgun or bow.;
, SW, VDUS, 911(I guess about 911, but I heard they cheated in some instances)are all but a few of great clans. Really, SW and VDUS are the ones I know to be the best clans.

, You don't have to go to servers that dump around 40 megabytes of sounds. It's a waste, and usually servers like that are just plain dumb, as they modify so many things such as the gravity or running speed. Good players usually go to servers that have not been altered, as they just like to get in and jump into the game, and play the game right.

, Such as increased shotgun damage, increased sprint speed, unlimited sprint, all weapons. Servers that do this is Skullshock servers, they're shit. It's fun once in a while to play in these, but they don't really give you much skill out of it.


You might think you're good, and you start getting pissed at someone who truly is a good player, kicking your ass all over the place. Stop crying. If someone is better than you, then suck it up. You should in fact be glad that you are playing someone who is better. Here is one of the biggest ways of improving: GETTING YOUR ASSED KICKED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY SOMEONE WHO IS FAR BETTER THAN YOU, WILL NO DOUBT, INCREASE YOUR SKILLS. Over time of playing with this certain group of top notch players will soon make you into a top notch player too! If you play with the best, you will soon become one of the best! That's how it is. Their skills starts to rub on you, and pretty soon, you're learning their tricks, their tactics as you get dominated by them. Pretty soon, they're going to have a harder time trying to take you out, because you have been learning what not to do, and what is right to do in a certain situation. And you shouldn't play with just one great player, play with a variety of them. Remember, it doesn't take a day to improve.

, Whenever in a server, try to find the best player in there (It's not always the guy with the most kills, btw) and make it your goal to take this guy down personally (But not insulting or in your face personal). Everyone else should just be an obstacle to you.

, This weapon should be the most important weapon in your inventory(Next to the crowbar or stun-stick). The Gravity Gun is both an offensive and defensive weapon. With it, you can throw heavy objects at your opponent. Also even grab an object thrown at you and throw it back at the attacker. You can speed up your combine balls with it (More on that later), and catch them to send them back to an attacker. You can cook your grenades with it (More on that too later), toss a grenade back to an opponent, etc, etc. There are so many ways that the gravity can help you survive almost anything, even an smg grende, but more on that later.

, A balanced player can use any weapon correctly, and efficiently. Most players switch their weapons at the times that is suited. Shotgun for close range, SMG nading for close to medium range, 357 Magnum and crossbow for long range. After you get real good with these weapons (By practicing tons)you can use almost any weapon for close or long range. After a while, it becomes an art of how you use what gun and how. Good players will usually jump, shoot a double shot from the shotgun, switch to gravity gun and toss an object, all before touching ground. The more attacks you can send in one swift collection of movements, the better. Also helps to be precise, else all those attacks were for nothing. Practice switching from shooting an smg nade to shotgun. Shoot a bow, then shotgun. Shotgun to pistol.


You start out with an SMG and two nades. An SMG alone does no good. Nades are handy when you have learned to ""cook"" them(Look in tips). Scavenge around for better weapons. It's best to learn where they are. Don't get into a fight with someone who is equipped with a shotgun, while you only have an SMG. Big chance you'll lose. There's no shame in running away for the while to look for a better gun.

, With no armor, a bow can kill you instantly. With 15 armor and 100 health, a shot with a bow will reduce your health to 15. It's very low, but at least you're still alive, hopefully you can run away and look for some more health and armor. Usually, you want to get used to avoid fighting until you have at least found some armor. Have you ever gotten someone cornered, and you blew him up with a grenade and a double barrel shot with a shotgun, and still see him alive? Only to have him shoot you in the head with a magnum? Well, he was smart. He stocked up on as much armor as he could. Armor should that little gem you should pick up every time you can.

, DON'T STAND STILL, EVER. Jump, duck, weave out of the way of your opponents crosshairs. Standing still just for a mere second can get you killed. Also don't be predictable, by staying to one side the whole time. Mix it up, left, right, backwards, jump around, make it hard for your opponent to hit you.

Partway through the chapter, you are given a shotgun that holds six shells.",How to Survive Through Ravenholm in Half Life 2," Since the enemies are headcrabs and mindless zombies, they make noise. If you listen carefully, you won't be surprise-attacked.;
, There are three zombie and headcrab types. Normal zombies, the most common, are slow moving, and say things muffled by the headcrab. Skeletal zombies are thin and very fast and make high pitched howling when at a distance, and ferocious gasping noises when nearby. Poison zombies are slow, hard to kill and throw venomous headcrabs at you. They make aggressive grunts.

, throw barrels, saw blades and exploding barrels.

, Saw blades, when used with the gravity gun, are extremely effective for killing zombies, try to carry one or two saw blades as far as you can through the chapter before ditching one.

, If you don't, the headcrab will survive and attack you

, Common headcrabs and thin headcrabs (both flesh colored) require four hits from the gravity gun's primary fire to be killed, venomous headcrabs (black with red and white rings on the legs) need three to kill.

,, The venomous headcrabs are larger, black, and move slowly compared to the thin headcrabs, which have similar proportions, but move much more quickly.

, The zombies will throw things at you, so be careful. Physics objects hurt more than bullets.

, Reload whenever you have a break, and aim for the head.

Hunt the medic/engineer job.,
Hunt the heavy.,
Take down the Sentry Nest.",How to Be an Expert Spy in Team Fortress 22," The engineer is more valuable than the medic if he is on the defending team at the start of the match. His teleporters and sentry also keep your team in lock-down.


The medic is more valuable if he is a good medic and is healing everyone.

, Heavies deal a ton of damage and have a ton of health. Stab them and you will save your team a whole lot of trouble.

,


The best method to use is the stab and sap. Stab the engineer before sapping all his buildings. If you cannot do that, sap and stab. Sap the sentry and stab the engineer. If you miss the stab and the engineer comes after you, shoot like mad at the sentry. If you die destroying a L3 Sentry, it is worth it.
It is recommended to watch some videos on how to perfect the above methods.

This can be easily done with the Ambassador, a gun that when you shoot a headshot, it becomes a Critical Hit.

, Stab 1 engineer, sap a sentry, and pull your Dead Ringer up. Repeat.


Remember that if you are disguised, enemy Dispensers can recharge your cloak, and a L3 Dispenser can keep you cloaked with Dead Ringer, taking only 10% of damage forever
If possible, go for engineers and sentries that are hidden from other sentries (e.g. behind a wall). That way, you won't have to take as much damage.
Use the knife Your Eternal Reward to slowly take down each engineer. The silent kill and instant disguise will ensure that you are safe.

,, Try new loadouts constantly so that, as a spy, you can handle any situation.


Practice your trick stabs. A walkway is a very good place to do so.

, It is a large open valley recognizable by the numerous supply crates lying around and explosive barrels floating in one section of the water. Stock up on health and suit batteries before entering this area.

, A good spot for finding crates is around the capsized ship on the right of the valley when you enter from the sewers.

, The key to defeating the Hunter-Chopper is to keep moving and not staying in one spot. Moving through the valley will also provide cover for you as the rocks in the middle will protect you from the Hunter-Chopper's pulse turrets.

, It will blanket a large portion of the valley with them, so either run directly through them or away from them; either way, do not stand still or they will detonate on you. Avoid touching them or they will explode. The gap between mines should be enough to get through to avoid them.

, It will alternate between mines and pulse turrets frequently, so you won't have to wait long. The only way you can viably kill the Hunter-Chopper is when it is using its pulse turrets, so wait until then. Gather some supply crates if you need them.

, However, it won't be for long, so immediately spin your airboat around. The Hunter-Chopper will be within range and for a much longer period of time. This is the perfect time to attack it and do a lot of damage.

, Before long pieces will begin to break off and when it is critically damaged, it will dump its entire payload of mines into the valley, blanketing it. Run to the sides to avoid these.

,,,,,, The alternate route is to go up the ridge! Once you are on the ridge, turn left a bit immediately, not too much. Making a mistake here might cause you to fall off your Warthog.

, This is one of the hardest bit (if you don’t want to fall off). Do not aim your Warthog on the narrow path but aim it on the edge of the wall.

, Then crash at the highlighted area as shown and the Warthog would naturally fly off to the left side and land upright without falling off it.

, Do not drive on the path up the cliff but go up the side of the cliff.

, At that point, turn left for more than 90° as quickly as possible. Be careful not to turn too much, passing 180°. The Warthog should spin in mid air, like when a helicopter spins automatically when the engine is down.

, Once the Warthog is back upright, reach the final checkpoint to complete your lap.

Become an Agent of Nocturnal.",How to Return the Skeleton Key to the Ebonmere in Skyrim," Do note the Skeleton Key is a useful tool for dealing with locked doors or chests. It will never break will make it easy for you to find any lock’s sweet spot without wasting too much time fiddling around. This is useful for players who have not invested many points developing their Lockpicking skill or simply don’t like Skyrim’s lockpicking mechanics. However, returning the Skeleton Key to the Ebonmere is permanent, and you will no longer be able to use it in the future. Keep this in mind before entering the Twilight Sepulcher.;
, The Twilight Sepulcher is west of Falkreath. If you have no quick travel points near the Sepulcher, take a carriage to Falkreath and simply walk west until you reach the entrance to the Sepulcher. It is located near a small waterfall and is marked by two prominent pillars near the sides of a mountain. Once you enter the Sepulcher, talk to a ghostly apparition, a Nightingale Sentinel, who will direct you to the Pilgrim’s Path to the Ebonmere and will warn you of the dangers you will face ahead.


Keep questioning the apparition about the Pilgrim’s Path, and he will give you the optional goal of retrieving Nystrom’s Journal. A quest marker leading to the journal will appear, and reading it will give you some warning about the tests you will face.

, Go deeper into the first area of the Pilgrim’s Path, and you will be confronted by hostile Sentinels. You can sneak past them if you wish, or you can defeat them in combat to pick up some useful loot in the process. This is a straightforward area, but do be mindful of pressure plates as well as being ganged up on by multiple Sentinels.


Do note that creating any light, from torches or magical means, will attract the attention of the Sentinels in this area, especially on a darkened staircase in this section of the Pilgrim’s Path.Cast a spell or drink a potion to invoke the Night Eye effect to see better in the dark. Or simply cast your lesser power of you rolled a Khajiit during the character creation process.
Remember that you can draw the attention of Sentinels using your bow and arrows. Shooting an arrow will cause the Sentinels to investigate the area where your arrow hit, giving you a short window of time to sneak past before they start looking around and return to their original posts.

, There will be pitch-black areas and brightly lit areas in this part of the Pilgrim’s Path. Standing in the brightly lit areas will cause your health to rapidly deplete, so stick to the shadows and make your way across the area. Just keep your eyes open and proceed slowly to avoid accidentally stepping into the light. Dash back to the shadows if you find yourself caught in the light.


Proceed cautiously through this area, as there are multiple tripwires that will unleash poisoned darts if tripped. Be especially mindful when moving up or down stairs, as these are where three of the four tripwires are located. The only tripwire not near a staircase can be found just before crossing a wooden bridge.

, This part of the Pilgrim’s Path will lead you to a statue of Nocturnal. She desires an offering of darkness, which in this case means extinguishing the two stone torches on her sides. You can do this by moving behind the stone torches and pulling the chains located there. Once both torches are extinguished, a hidden passage will open and lead you to the fourth test.

, You have two choices here. You can choose to take the direct path, which will involve evading multiple traps, or you can go the roundabout way, which involves unlocking a door and dealing with two Sentinels.


If you choose to brave the traps, then time your dashes to avoid the swinging pendulum blades. Be careful at the end of the pendulum trap though, as that is where a pressure plate is located. Triggering it will cause spears to stab out from multiple points, so jump over or around it to avoid being skewered. Opening the door at the end of the pendulum trap will also trigger a battering ram, so back up from the door the moment you open it and wait for the battering ram to recede before moving on.
If you choose to unlock the door, you will have an easy time doing so thanks to the Skeleton Key being in your possession. You will also have to neutralize the Sentinels along your way, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how eager you are for some more combat.

, Moving forward, you will eventually encounter a dead-end where the only choice you have is to drop down into a pit with no obvious exit. Jump down and wait for about 25 seconds. The Skeleton Key will activate and cause the floor to break away, causing you to conveniently fall down right on the Ebonmere lock. Activate the lock, and you will have returned the Ebonmere to its rightful place.

, Once you’ve returned the Skeleton Key, Nocturnal will appear and congratulate you in her own unique and taunting way. Karliah will appear later and explain to you what it means to become an Agent of Nocturnal, with the powers that come with being one. You can choose to be one of three kinds of Agents: the Agent of Strife, the Agent of Shadow, or the Agent of Subterfuge.


To become the Agent of Strife, step on the circle with a full moon on it. This will give you a lesser power in which you can drain the life force of a target once a day.
To become the Agent of Shadow, step on the circle with a crescent moon on it. This will grant access to a lesser power where you will turn invisible while sneaking. You can use the power once a day, and the effect lasts for two minutes. As long as the power is active, you will always go back into stealth whenever you sneak.
To become the Agent of Subterfuge, step on the circle with a half-moon on it. This will allow you to use a lesser power that causes everyone near you to fight each other for thirty seconds.
Do note that you can choose to become a different agent once a day. This will allow you to pick the power that you need the almost every 24 in-game hours.

Enter the Sanctum.,

Exit the Sanctum.,
Give the Dragonstone to Farengar.",How to Retrieve and Deliver the Dragonstone in Bleak Falls Barrow in Skyrim," After you deliver your message, the Jarl will instruct you to talk to Farengar Secret-Fire, his court wizard. Farengar will explain that he is looking for the Dragonstone, and he will direct you to go to Bleak Falls Barrow. This will result in a quest marker leading to Bleak Falls Barrow popping up on your map.If you have completed the quest “The Golden Claw,” chances are you might already have the Dragonstone in your inventory. This is because the quest will take you through the exact same path required for the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest. You will also be unable to sell or transfer the Dragonstone out of your inventory, ensuring that it will stay on your person until you give it to Farengar at the end of the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest.;
, One of the quickest ways to find Bleak Falls Barrow is to go south from Whiterun. This route involves finding a footpath from the base of the northern wall of the mountain all the way up to Bleak Falls Barrow—presenting the fewest threats along the way. The more commonly used route though is the one from Riverwood, which involves crossing a bridge north of the village and then turning northwest along a winding path leading up to the barrow. This route, however, will pit you against hostile forest animals (usually wolves) and a few bandits near an abandoned tower along the way.


Be careful as you approach the barrow, as you will encounter around a half-dozen bandits near its entrance. The wide open space of this area will give their archers plenty of opportunities to stick you with arrows, so fight near the pillars to give you cover as you handle the bandits that close in on you with melee weapons.

, When you first enter the barrow, you will notice a lot of skeever and human corpses around you. Sneak forward, and you will overhear bandits talking about someone named Arvel and how he ran off with a golden claw of some sort. If you have not started “The Golden Claw,” this quest will start right now. Neutralize the bandits and proceed deeper into the barrow.

, Moving forward, you will eventually encounter a torch-wielding bandit who will run forward into a puzzle room. Let him pull the lever, and he will be killed by a dart trap. Now move forward and examine the symbols around you—one on the ground, two on the wall. Note the animals on the pillars and rotate the pillars so they face you. From left to right, these symbols will be Snake-Snake-Whale. Pull the lever and continue onwards.Be careful while descending the spiral staircase, as skeevers will start swarming you. Stay on top of the staircase to bottleneck their attacks and make it possible to deal with them one at a time.

, You will eventually reach an area filled with cobwebs, with someone calling out for help. Cautiously move forward into the room, where someone is caught on a web, and a giant Frostbite Spider will drop down to confront you. Kill it and talk to the trapped man, who turns out to be Arvel the Swift.


If you are having difficulty fighting the spider, beat a hasty retreat through the door you used to enter the room. The spider will not be able to pass through the door. Heal up, and use magic or ranged weapons to wear the spider down from afar. Just remember that the spider can still spit poison at you though. Dodge to the sides when it rears up, as this is the sign that it will spit a glob of poison at you.

, Talk to Arvel to interrogate him about the whereabouts of the claw, and he will agree to show you how it works in exchange for cutting him down. Use a melee weapon or your magic to strike the webs binding his arms and legs. Arvel will drop down, and he will promptly run deeper into the barrow in an attempt to escape you. He will eventually be cut down by the draugr waking up from their undead slumber or will run face-first into a spike wall after stepping on a pressure plate. Neutralize the draugr and search Arvel’s body to find the Golden Claw. Once you have the Golden Claw, proceed deeper into the barrow, dealing with the traps and the draugr within.

, You will eventually encounter a locked door with rotating rings around the keyhole. Open your inventory, select the Dragonstone, and inspect it. Rotate it so that the claw faces you, and take note of the symbols you see on it: Bear-Moth-Owl. Rotate the rings around the hole of the keyhole to match this combination, and it will open up, gaining you entrance to the Sanctum of Bleak Falls Barrow.

, Entering the Sanctum will lead you to a wide, open room with waterfalls and a prominent wall with strange script on it. You will hear chanting that will grow louder as approach the wall. Get close enough, and your screen will darken while one word on the wall will glow brightly, causing you to learn a Word of Power from the Word Wall. Once you have learned the Word of Power, the coffin behind you will break open as a powerful draugr boss emerges. Defeat this draugr and loot its corpse to find the Dragonstone.

, You don’t need to run all the way back to exit the barrow. Just follow your quest marker to find a hidden exit, which will lead you outdoors and allow you to fast-travel back to Whiterun or Dragonsreach, the latter of which will lead you closest to Farengar.

, Continue following your quest marker, and you will encounter Farengar talking to someone named Delphine. Listen to their discussion to learn more about the return of the dragons, and talk to Farengar to give the Dragonstone to Farengar and finish the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest.You may want to make a stop at Riverwood to return the Golden Claw to Lucas before heading back to Farengar. He will reward you with some gold for doing so and will also give you better prices for buying or selling goods, perfect for unloading the loot you just gained after running through Bleak Falls Barrow.

Create a Backup Save.,
Steal Gaius Maro’s Travel Schedule.,
Find Gaius Maro.,
Assault Gaius.,
Provoke Gaius Maro.,
Snipe Gaius Maro.,
Slay Gaius in his sleep.,
Poison him.",How to Kill Gaius Maro in Skyrim," Skyrim is a massive game with various triggers and scripted events. This makes it a very good idea to create multiple save files to serve as backups in case something should go wrong. Do this before tracking down Gaius Maro, as this quest has a few bugs that could potentially prevent you from gaining the bonus rewards or even finishing it altogether.;
, You will first encounter your target, Gaius Maro, on Dragon Bridge. After he finishes talking to his father and the innkeeper of the Four Shields Tavern, Faida, he will begin roaming the various towns and villages of Skyrim. If you want to have a much easier time knowing where he will be at any given day, you can steal his schedule. You can find an in-depth guide to stealing his schedule here. If you don’t want to go through the effort of stealing the schedule, then here’s the schedule of places where you can reliably find Gaius Maro:



Morndas—Solitude, Emperor’s Tower during the day and Castle Dour at night.

Tirdas—Windhelm, the Palace of the King during the day and the barracks at night.

Middas—Riften, Mistveil Keep.

Turdas—Whiterun, Dragonsreach during the day and the Bannered Mare during the night.

Fredas—Markarth, Understone Keep during the day and the Guard Tower during the night.

, This task will be relatively easy once you have the schedule in hand. Just make sure to factor in the time it takes for you to fast-travel from the different points in Skyrim. Open the “Wait” window and check the current day. Compare it to Gaius’ schedule, and move to the town he will be moving into the next day. Now wait until Gaius walks into that town and you should be able to have a much easier time ambushing him.


If you have a high enough pickpocket skill, you could just reverse-pickpocket Gaius to plant the letter on him while he is still alive.

, One of the ways to kill Gaius in the city is to just pull out your axe and kill the man in a straight-up street brawl. Seriously. Kill him, quickly plant the note on his body, and surrender to the guards. Serve the week-long jail time or pay the resulting fines for murder and assault, and you’re done with the quest. Simple, straightforward and brutally effective.

, If you want a straight-up brawl without incurring a bounty, then you can actually provoke the man into striking you first. As long as Gaius lands the first blow, guards will ignore your duel and you’ll then be able to kill him without having a bounty placed on your head.


To provoke Gaius, simply walk up to him, tell him that he will die and that the Emperor will be next. He’ll then pull out his sword and begin attacking you. Again, make sure he lands the first blow before retaliating; otherwise, the guards will strike a bounty on you.Kill him and plant the letter on his body.
Provoke Gaius when the both of you are in full view of a guard. If you are dueling and a guard decides to walk in on your duel, you will incur a bounty if the guard sees you land a blow before Gaius does.

, You could also kill Gaius Maro from afar if you have invested points in the archery skill tree, have a powerful bow and arrow on hand, and have prepared deadly poisons to coat your arrows with. Sneak to a place where no one can see you, coat an arrow with poison, and send it flying toward Gaius. Wait until the guards are done investigating his body and plant the incriminating letter on his body when the guards have moved on.


Invisibility will make this method a lot easier if you can kill Gaius in one shot. Position yourself far away from Gaius before casting invisibility or drinking an invisibility potion. Nock an arrow, let it fly, and immediately get as far away from the crime scene as possible. If done properly, you should be able to kill Gaius without incurring a bounty.

, If you want a more nuanced approach to killing the man—avoiding combat and staying true to the stealthy approach of a Dark Brotherhood assassin—then you will want to do the deed when Gaius is alone. This will be hard as Gaius tends to stay in areas with lots of witnesses around, but not when he’s in the Bannered Mare. Breaking into his room in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun gives you a relatively safe opportunity to kill him in his sleep without anyone seeing you do it. Pick the lock to his bedroom, close the door, slit his throat, plant the note, and walk away.

, This will work if you have enough points in the pickpocket tree and have spent a perk point in the “Poisoned” skill. Reverse-pickpocket enough poisons on him, and he will die without you incurring a single septim in bounty.You can either buy powerful poisons or brew them yourself if you also invested points in alchemy.


You can also reverse-pickpocket a frenzy potion on Gaius. Once frenzied, he will begin attacking the nearest target, often getting himself killed by the guards in the process. Just make sure to frenzy him when he is away from named characters, as you might end up inadvertently killing an NPC that would otherwise have been useful in the future.

You can even get one during the early stages of the game. You can use any type of bows since Giant Scorpions can be harmed by any weapon material.


If you’re character specializes in magic spells as its primary offense, just skip finding a bow and just have whatever type of attack spell your character currently has.;
, These monsters are commonly found loitering around swamp areas and forests, especially on the southern part of the map. Giant Scorpions can also sometimes be found inside dungeons, but not as commonly as in the outside world.

, Once you see a Giant Scorpion, quickly look for a safe spot far away from the monster that you can stand on and attack from. Go to a place where there are no objects that could block your attack.

, Fire your bow or cast your attack spell on the Giant Scorpion by pressing the corresponding attack button on your controller. It would take around at least three arrows or spells to kill a Giant Scorpion, but if your character already has a high level, you can probably take it out with just a single attack.


Killing a Giant Scorpion with a spell or long-ranged weapon is the best option since you’re safe from getting poisoned when the monster attacks you.

, Giant Scorpions can be damaged using weapons made from any materials. You can get swords and axes randomly from monsters or by opening treasure boxes all throughout the game. If your character specializes in close combat, you can use the melee weapon it already has.

, These beasts usually live inside swamps and forests areas near the southern part of the map. Dungeons and caves also house Giant Scorpions, but not as predominantly as in the outside world.

, Once you find a Giant Scorpion, slowly walk up behind its back without getting spotted. This way, you can increase the chance of dealing a strike on the monster without resistance from it.

, Once you’re near the Giant Scorpion, swiftly slash it with your sword or axe. Repeat slashing as many times as needed to kill it, and as quickly as possible. Don’t give the monster the chance to fight back. Giant Scorpion attacks have the chance of poisoning its target, which could seriously damage your main character."

, This house is located north of Whiterun Hold in the Cloud District, and can also be accessed by foot or carriage.,,, This prevents other characters in Dragonsreach from seeing your character and disturbing your quest.

, You may need to double-jump to get stuck in the corner between the wall and sacks of grain. The goal is to get your character directly against the wall so you can access the hidden room on the other side of the wall.

,, The wooden plate acts as a portal so you can access the secret room on the other side of the wall. After entering the room, you’ll see the Ebony Blade lying on a table.

Collect bait.,
Find a fishing hole.,
Identify the fishing hole.,
Start the fishing process.,
Choose the right bait.,
Reel in the catch!",How to Fish in Elder Scrolls Online," To fish successfully in ESO, you will need to collect bait. There are various types of bait that can be found around the world of Tamriel. For the best success in fishing, you will need to use the correct bait for each of the four water types. You can also purchase simple bait from merchants that can be used everywhere, but it isn’t perfectly suited for any type of water.;
, Nearly every body of water in ESO has a fishing hole. You can identify a fishing hole by finding a large ripple in the water.


You will automatically begin the game with a fishing rod, but bait must be collected in-game.

, There are four different types of water in Elder Scrolls Online: lakes, rivers, foul water, and oceans. The appearance of each water type is self-explanatory, although if you find a fishing hole that you’re unsure of, you can use simple bait to catch a fish first. You can use the details below to identify the body of water you are in:


Lakes include Spadetail, Silverside Perch, and Shad.
Oceans include Dhufish, Longfin, and Minnows.
Rivers include Salmon, River Betty, and Fish Roe.
Foul water includes Slaughterfish, Trodh, and Chub.

, To start fishing, simply tap “E” on a fishing hole. Your character will show an idle fishing animation as he fishes.

, Whilst you can use simple bait for all four water types, your chance of catching better rewards is improved with the right bait. You can choose between collected bait by holding down the “E” key instead of tapping “E” whilst at a fishing hole.If you are fishing in a lake you can use Guts or Minnows. Guts can be collected by killing and looting small passive mobs such as rats and frogs. Minnows can be fished for in oceans.
If you are fishing in an ocean you can use Worms and Chub. Worms can be looted from undead corpses or from interacting with alchemy plants found throughout Tamriel. Chub can be fished from foul water.
If you are fishing in a river you can use Shad or Insect Parts. Shad can be fished from lakes. Insect Parts can be collected when interacting with torchbugs or butterflies, which are both found flying in the air throughout Tamriel.
If you are fishing in Foul Water you can use Fish Roe or Crawlers. Fish Roe can be fished from rivers. Crawlers can be collected by killing and looting passive spiders or from interacting with alchemy plants found throughout Tamriel.

, While fishing, you’ll need to watch for visual cues for when to press the E key to reel in any catches. As soon as you see your character tugging your fishing rod, you can reel in the line to catch a fish. If you reel in before the tugging animation, you will leave the fishing activity without catching anything.


The average waiting time for catching a fish is just a few seconds.

You’ll need to earn enough gold so that you can purchase a horse from a stable. Here are some tips for earning gold:



Loot everything - Everything you loot from mobs can be sold to vendors for gold. Sometimes mobs can drop rare weapons and armor that can sell for a few hundred gold.

Prepare for the climb.,
Learn the “Dragonrend” shout.,
Use “Dragonrend” to bring Alduin to the ground.,
Use “Clear Skies” tactically.,
Avoid Alduin’s front.,
Use frost magic.,
Apply poisons to your weapons.,
Keep the pressure on.",How to Defeat Alduin1," Purchase or craft a number of healing and fire resist potions in any town. You may want to consider recruiter a follower to help you as well.


A solid melee fighter, like Lydia or Mjoll are good choices to tank Alduin when he lands. Ilia is also a good choice for her proficiency in frost magic.
There will be a few Ice Wraiths on the climb, so a couple of frost resist potions may be a good idea as well.
If you have training in Restoration magic, you can use spells to substitute for healing or resist potions.;
, When you reach the top, you will speak to Paarthurnax and watch a lengthy cutscene to learn the shout before the fight with Alduin begins.


Paarthurnax will aid you in your fight against Alduin and act as a distraction, but you will have to deal the bulk of the damage.

, Tap and hold the shout button to charge it. Follow Alduin’s flight with the camera as you charge so that you do not miss. If you miss you will have to wait while your shout recharges.


Equip an Amulet of Talos if you need the shout cooldown to be shortened.
Although Paarthurnax will spar with Alduin in the air, Alduin cannot be damaged until you ground him with Dragonrend.
A single tap of the shout button will do a single-charge version of the shout that can still effectively stun Alduin after he is already grounded. You can use this to help preventing him from becoming airborne again., Alduin has his own shout that causes meteors to rain from the sky. When this happens, you can use Clear Skies to cancel it.


You will have learned this shout from The Greybeards before being allowed to ascend the mountain, so you cannot have missed it.
If your shout is on cooldown when this happens, then it is a good time to use a fire resist potion.
Remember, using Clear Skies means your shout will go on cooldown and you will have to wait for it to recharge before you can use Dragonrend again.

, Once on the ground, Alduin uses a powerful fire breath attack that does lots of damage to everyone in front of him and a strong tail whips from the back. Try to attack from the sides regardless of range or melee.


Eventually he will turn to bite you, causing you to face his front again, so keep strafing to the sides.
Fire resist potions can help if you want to challenge him from the front, but best to avoid it altogether.

, If you have training in destruction magic, spells like ice spike and ice storm can do big damage to Alduin since he has a slight weakness to frost.


Ice storm can damage your follower, so use it with caution.
If you have it, the Marked For Death shout will greatly increase your damage with magic, but timing it between uses of Dragonrend and Clear Skies can be difficult.

, Lingering poisons are just as effective against Alduin as any other non-undead creature. These can be crafted or acquired from an alchemy shop in any town.


Using poisons if very effective when using a bow from afar while a follower tanks Alduin’s hits at melee range.

, Keep Alduin on the ground with Dragonrend, use health potions when you get low, and before long Alduin should succumb to the damage and retreat.

Enter the Star and slay Malyn Veryn.",How to Find Azura's Star in Skyrim," Ask innkeepers about the latest rumors as you explore Skyrim, and one of them will eventually tell you about the shrine. This will result in a quest marker popping up to lead the way.;
, The easiest way to reach it is to travel to Winterhold and make your way south-southeast to the shrine., Your quest marker will lead to a female Dunmer named Aranea Ienith right on the Shrine of Azura. Talk to her, and she will speak of a prophecy about a fortress and an elven mage. She will then leave you with instructions to look for clues in Winterhold.

, Travel to Winterhold, ask people about an elven mage, and they will direct you to Nelacar who can be found in the Frozen Hearth inn. Or you can just go straight to the Frozen Hearth and talk to Nelacar.

, He will be reluctant to share information about Azura’s Star with you. Pressing him on the issue will result in a Speech check with three options: Persuade, Bribe, or Intimidate. The easiest way to get him to talk is to intimidate him, though all options are open if you have enough Speech skill to pass them. Once you get him to open up, he will start explaining the properties of soul gems as well as sharing the story of Malyn Varen, a former College teacher who tried using the Star to make himself live forever and lost his sanity as a result. Nelacar will then task you with finding the star in Ilinalta’s Deep while pleading with you to not return the Star to Azura., This will be easy if you have discovered the Lady Stone, as the dungeon is right next to the Standing Stone. If not, then you can travel to the three Guardian Stones you encountered at the start of the game as you were making your way to Riverwood. Cross the river to the north of the Stones and follow the northern bank of the river all the way to Ilinalta’s Deep. You will find the dungeon’s trapdoor entrance atop a large sunken tower., You will be facing a lot of skeletons and necromancers in Ilinalta’s Deep. The skeletons are not that difficult to deal with, but the necromancers can prove to be a serious pain if you are not properly prepared to deal with them. Kill the necromancers as fast as you can, but don’t be too aggressive and let yourself be struck down by their attacks. Retreat to an easily defendable choke point when you get swarmed by undead, and use the tight corridors to take cover against spells. Continue following your quest marker, and you will eventually find the broken Azura’s Star in a room with Malyn Varen’s remains.


A high resistance against frost and magic will prove useful against the necromancers in Ilinalta’s Deep. You can gain these resistances by quaffing the respective potions and donning equipment enchanted with the appropriate resistances.

, Once you have Azura’s Star in your inventory, you will be given a choice between giving the Star to Nelacar or Aranea Ienith. Giving the Star to the latter will lead you to a conversation with the Daedric Prince Azura. Giving the Star to Nelacar, on the other hand, will lead to him to think about finishing what Malyn Varen started. Both options will ultimately lead to you entering the Star to defeat Malyn Varen, who is trapped inside the Star and whose presence prevents it from being fully restored.


Choosing to give the Star to Aranea Ienith will ultimately reward you with the restored Azura’s Star. It will trap the white souls of creatures, which you can then use for your own purposes. You will also gain Aranea as a potential follower if you choose to have her accompany you.
Giving the Star to Nelacar will lead you to the Black Star, which should, according to the lore, only be able to contain the black souls of sapient beings. In the game, however, the Black Star is capable of holding both white and black souls, making it the more practical choice from a purely pragmatic point of view. You will not, however, gain Aranea as a follower. In fact, she will threaten to kill you for defiling the Star if you ever talk to her again.

, Azura or Nelacar will send your soul inside the Star, depending on who you gave the Star to. Once inside, you will end up confronting Malyn, a powerful mage who will retreat deeper inside the Star and send three arguably more powerful Dremora spellcasters to stop you. Kill them all, and either Azura or Nelacar will pull your soul out of the Star, granting you Azura’s Star or the Black Star—depending on who you gave the Star to.


The Dremora will hit you with a lot of magic, oftentimes with different elements all at once. It is for this reason that raising your magic resistance is a very good idea for this particular encounter. Again, potions and enchanted equipment will help you do this as well as gaining the blessing from the Atronach Stone. This particular blessing will give you a 50% chance to absorb spells in exchange for slowing your magicka regeneration by 50%.Loot the corpses of the Dremora before dealing with Malyn, as killing him will trigger your being pulled out of the Star. Once you are being pulled out, you will have a very short window of time to loot what else you can, including Malyn’s corpse if you’re fast enough to do so.

Know what you can't do at Breezehome.",How to Buy a House in Whiterun," This quest is part of the main story in Skyrim, and you receive the quest from Farengar Secret-Fire at Dragonsreach in Whiterun. This quest immediately follows the quest ""Before the Storm"".


Note: You can make everything a lot easier for yourself by traveling to Bleak Fall Barrow before you even get to Whiterun. You can start the Golden Claw quest by talking to Lucan Valerius in Riverwood. This will allow you to get all of the items you need from the Bleak Falls Barrow and give it to Farengar Secret-Fire as soon as you get the quest, without having to backtrack.;
, You can find this dungeon to the south of Whiterun, and to the west of Riverwood. There will be several bandits outside, so you'll want to dispatch them before you enter. You'll find the entrance to Bleak Falls Barrow at the top of the stairs in the ruins.

, You'll soon come across a bandit that pulls the wrong lever, setting off a trap that kills him.

, You can look at the tablets above the gate and beside the lever to determine what order the pillars need to be in. Set them to ""snake"", ""snake"", and ""whale"". This will allow you to pull the lever and proceed.

, You'll find Arvel the Swift trapped in a spiderweb further down the dungeon. Hitting the spiderweb will free him, and he will take off running. Try to kill him now so that you can easily get to his body. If you don't kill him, he'll either be killed by a draugr a little farther down, or impaled by a spike trap.


Arvel will cower for a moment after being freed from the spiderweb, making this the best time to kill him.

, You'll find this item on Arvel's corpse. The Golden Claw is required to pass through Three Ring puzzle later in the dungeon. Zooming in on the Golden Claw's palm in your inventory will show you the correct order the rings need to be in (from top to bottom: bear, hummingbird, owl)., The Word Wall will teach you Unrelenting Shout, one of the most useful Shouts in the game. After reading the Word Wall, you will be attacked by a draugr overlord. Dispatch the dragon and take the Dragonstone.

, This will complete the quest and allow you to purchase a house in Whiterun., After completing the quest, talk to the Jarl in Dragonsreach. He will inform you that a home is now available for purchase, and point you towards Proventus Avenicci.

, You can usually find him near the throne in Dragonsreach. If he's not there, he's either in his bedroom or dining in the Great Porch.


If you haven't purchased the house by the time you start the ""Battle for Whiterun"" quest for the Stormcloaks, you'll be required to purchase the house afterwards from Brill in Dragonsreach.

, Proventus will sell you the house if you can cough up the 5000 Gold payment. If you don't have the cash yet, raid a few nearby dungeons and sell the loot off to the merchants in Whiterun.

, Your house will be pretty bare when you first purchase it, but you can add additional furniture and decorations by purchasing them from Proventus. When you purchase additional furnishings, they will be delivered to your house automatically.


You can purchase furnishings by the room. For example, furnishing your Living Room will provide 2 Weapon Racks, 1 Bookshelf, 1 Cupboard, 1 Small Table, and 2 Small Chairs. Furnishing the bedroom will provide 3 End Tables, 1 Dresser, 1 Table, 1 Chest, 2 Chairs, 1 Shield Plaque.

, After purchasing your home, you'll receive the key and can start using it. The house is called ""Breezehome"", and you can find it to the east of ""Warmaiden's"" just inside the western gates of Whiterun.

, Many containers throughout Skyrim will reset after a while, making them an unsafe place to leave valuables for later. Containers in your house, however, will never reset, allowing you to safely dump all of your excess loot between adventures.


Many players will sort different categories of items into different containers to make finding items easier later. For example, you might place all of your clothing and armor in your Bedroom containers, while keeping all of your ingredients in the Kitchen.
Weapon Racks will automatically store your equipped weapon when you use them, making them a great way to show off your more prized weapons.

, Upgrading your Kitchen provides you with a Cooking Pot. You can use this pot to combine food ingredients to create more effective and powerful food.


Most foods will require Salt as an ingredient.

, The alchemy lab allows you to use ingredients to brew very powerful potions. You can combine up to three ingredients (two base and one bonus) to create a large variety of helpful potions and devastating poisons. The alchemy lab is the most expensive add-on at 500 Gold. Click here for a guide on brewing potions.


If you have the ""Hearthfire"" expansion, you can replace your alchemy lab with a Children's Bedroom. This allows you to adopt children to live you with. Click here for more details on adopting in Skyrim.

, One of the best features of Breezehome is its close proximity to Warmaiden's. This means you can quickly forge and repair equipment without having to track down all the proper equipment.

, Breezehome doesn't have an Enchanting Table, or a Mannequin. This means you cannot enchant items without walking all the way to Dragonsreach. Without the Mannequin, you can't display your favorite pieces of armor. Breezehome is also fairly far away from the Thieves Guild fence at Honningbrew Meadery."

Find a silver or better weapon.,
Find a vampire.,
Keep your range close.,
Time your attack.,
Defeat the vampire.",How to Defeat Vampires in the Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall," Only weapons made of silver or of a better material can harm a vampire. Weapons made of iron, leather, or chain won’t deal any damage to vampires. Weapons made from steel, silver, elven, dwarven, mithril, adamantium, ebony, orcish, or daedric deal heavy damage on these monsters. Swords and axes made from silver or better materials can be obtained as random loots from various kinds of monsters. There’s no specific area or monster that you can get these kinds of weapons, but you are sure to get one by opening treasure boxes inside dungeons.;
, Vampires can be found in dark places like caves and dungeons. They can also be found roaming around the outside world during nighttime because these creatures cannot walk in broad daylight during the day.

, Since majority of the weapons that come in silver or better are melee weapons, like swords and axes, you have to battle the monster up close. Spells are useless against vampires. When you see a vampire, ready yourself to attack any time and slowly approach it.

, Vampires attack slowly, so there’s no need to panic when you encounter one. If you have high HP points, you can go ahead and relentlessly attack when you see one. Otherwise, take time to observe the attack pattern of a vampire. They only have close-range attacks, so take a quick back step to avoid damage.


Also, if you do get hit a vampire’s attack, there’s a 2% chance of contracting a disease, and 0.6% chance of your character becoming a vampire, so be very extra careful.

, Once you get the rhythm of the beast’s attacks, time your offense and quickly slash it with your sword or axe made out of silver or better material. You’ll notice that the vampire will take severe damage from your weapon, and if you’re weapon is made of a higher material, like orcish or daedric, there’s a 100% chance of taking the monster out with a single blow.

The best way to attack someone hard (especially if battling online) is if you hide behind a bunker (log, block, vehicle, etc.),
The best weapon combination (for me at least) is to have a chain gun, a fusion cutter, a wrist rocket, no power-ups, level three health, level 0 speed, level 0 capture rate, and the health and ammo special weapon.,
Always watch your health!,
Another good strategy is to get a sniper rifle with jet pack.",How to Win in Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron," then come out for quick bursts of fire.;
, This will give you a powerful attack, lots of health, backup health, and a way to get rid of those annoying enemy vehicles.

, If you are getting low use one of your health packs (they are worth it).

, Then you can fly up high and snipe people off. But be careful this won't work for every map as you may not be able to get a good spot. And remember to have a good backup gun in case you encounter someone.

Extras.,
Film your movie.,
Play back your movie.,
Get a good editing system.,
Edit the movie.,
Create the DVD.",How to Make Your Own Star Wars Film," You can't do anything until you've got a couple of main characters. You don't have to flesh it all out now, just have enough to build a story around. A good guy. A bad guy. Just make sure you have enough to start your plot.;
, Start with a main idea—the main conflict of the movie. Next, think of some things that could happen along the way. Characters that could be introduced. New plans and schemes that people are coming up with. And remember to throw in a few battles here and there. But don't overdo it.

, Now you have to decide who's playing whom. Here's a good way to do this: Count up all the characters in your story. Say there's 15. Now choose 15 of your friend who are good actors. Then try to think of who would be best as which character. And if there are people you still want to invite that you don't have parts for, either write a new character into the plot or cast them an extra.

, This is the tricky part. You're going to need costumes, props and sets. Be thinking about where you want to film. Sets are essential. So are costumes and props. No big deal. When your friends come ask them to bring any Star Wars costumes they might have, as well toy laser guns or plastic lightsabers. Whatever you need. And if there's costumes that nobody has, you can get used clothes really cheap at secondhand stores and make them into costumes. Improvise!

, Remember: Star Wars is full of extras. Random people and aliens who walk by behind the main action. They don't have to look like anything special. Nobody pays that much attention to the extras, or what they're wearing. But they do add color and texture and interest. So if there's a friend who's not playing a big part, or somebody who's not in that particular scene, throw a wig on them and have them walk around behind the main characters. Bike helmets work well for extras., Get everybody over at once in their costumes. Then get your camera and film away. You can film the scenes out of order, because you can always change them around when you edit., Make sure you don't need to re-shoot anything before putting it on the computer.

, If you don't already have an editing software, you can download one from the Internet. Also, every Mac comes with the free editing system iMovie and a program called iDVD, Upload it to your computer, then edit away. Chop, crop, and add titles and music. Remember to add an opening crawl to make it more like Star Wars. Also, you might want to spend a few dollars on iTunes buying the official Star Wars soundtrack.

, Once you're satisfied, send the movie to a menu-making program, like iDVD or any others that work for you. Make a cool menu design, then burn your movie to a disc. This is your prototype. If you're happy with your movie then burn some more. Sell them on the street or something. Maybe make a trailer!

Play with teams like Manchester United, Arsenal, FC Barcelona, Inter Milan, etc.,
When your opponent plays better than average defense, cross early and often.,
Learn the shots.,
Instead of getting upset after allowing a goal, you should attack twice as hard and result will be, then you win.

,
Do the finesse shot whenever you can.

,
Use a player like C. Ronaldo in RMA, Neymar or Iniesta in FCB, etc.,
Attack through wings rather by mid.,
While dribbling though wings you can beat defense easily as you have to cut the the ball through one side.,
Use skills like running and fake shot to change direction.,
Whenever you pass defender in wing, just sprint to move ahead with speed.",How to Score Easy Goals in a FIFA Game," Only shoot within the 18 yard (16.5 m) box. It has a much better chance to enter the net.

, It will then be easy to score goals by 1 2 1 pass.

, Just stand in front of your opponent's defender, steal the ball, and tap shoot. The goalkeeper is usually out of position, and it is an easy goal.

, FIFA has a very sensitive shot control system and most times pressing shoot will give your opponent a goal kick.

, These teams feature the world's best strikers who all have superior speed, shot accuracy, and shot power. Follow the trend and score some easy goals with the best of the best.

, Crosses are very difficult to defend.

, There are three different basic shots in FIFA 2010: normal, finesse, and chip. The chip works wonders on a charging keeper. Learn all three shots and use them when necessary. Result: You score more goals.

,, Ground through balls work great, but lobbed through balls work better. It is nearly impossible to block a lobbed pass, plus it beats most offside traps with ease. You get lots of breakaways.

, Slow down your player when shooting. Use pace control if you need to. The less movement you are making, the more accurate your shoot will be.

, This means if you play in goalkeeper difficulty amateur, then you should practice kicking from far of the post. It is better to press Q+D instead of pressing D. Sometimes your opposing goalkeeper comes much forward from the goal post, in this regard try kicking from midfield by pressing Q+D and by giving full power to the shot.

, Keep running until you get to the line crossing which will cause goal kick. Turn around by pressing the left key(in action camera) run to the up-left of the opponent d-box if you are playing in the right wing and run to the right-left of the opponent d-box if you are playing in the left wing. Now facing the opposite bar press ↑+→+A (less power) if you are in right wing and press ↑+←+A if you are in left wing. If you practice this, it will be surely a goal.

, In this regard try the free kicks by taking the camera to the ultimate right, pressing Q+D+↑+← and giving full power to the shot with a player whose preferred foot is right. This is for the free kicks from right side. Try the opposite thing in the free kicks from left side.

, So try to throw the ball to another player when one on one. It will be a goal for sure.

,,,;
, This will allow you to dribble ball easily, as only one or two defenders will oppose you.

, Most times when defense tackles the ball, it will be outside.

, Or, press maximum times RB while making a cut.

, Then when you will come in near corner, cross the ball in the striker's direction and head it by pressing shoot with power to the cross coming direction post. The goalkeeper will move through the ball and it will not easy for him to reflect. Celebrate!

For All-Play controls, there is only one pass command (A), and the computer takes care of the rest.







, If you’re player keeps the ball for too long, you’re increasing your chances of having it stolen. Passing the ball keeps defenders trying to catch up, and puts the flow of the game in your favor.The triangle formations is one of the most potent in soccer. Passing the ball between three different players as you move down the field is very difficult to defend against and gives you control over the field.







, Shooting works almost exactly the same as passing. Aim your player towards the opposing goal and either tap or press the B button. This will affect the power of your shot.


Hold the C button while shooting for a chip shot that you can lob over defenders’ heads.






For All-Play controls, there is only one shoot command (B), and the computer takes care of the rest.







, Pressing different directions on the D-Pad on the Wiimote will cause your player to perform different ball tricks. Not only are these great for showing off, but they can be useful to trick your opponent into thinking you’re doing something that you’re not.

, Press the C button and a direction on the Wiimote D-Pad to call a quick tactic for your team. The players will attempt to follow the tactic that was assigned to that button. You can use tactics to rush a goal, fall back for defense, or a variety of other situational moves., While you’re on defense, you can switch to any character on the field to best defend your goal. Pressing the A button or the D-Pad on the Wiimote will switch control to the nearest player to the ball. This will let you constantly be in on the action. Make sure to switch players as soon as the opposing player leaves your area of the field!

, One of the most satisfying ways to wrest control away from your opponent is to tackle them and steal the ball. Holding the B button will perform an auto-tackle, while shaking the Wiimote will perform a slide tackle in the direction you are running.


To tackle successfully, always try to tackle towards the ball, not the player. If you tackle the player, you may find yourself with a yellow card.







, Use the Jockey function to get close to an opposing player and get an advantageous position. Jockeying is best-suited for headers and incoming passes, and can lead to a lot of steals. Jockey by holding the C button.


There is no Jockey command for All-Play







, The Second Man Press function will bring the closest AI player on your team to you to help you overwhelm your opponent. Press and hold the A button to call in a second man press. One way to take advantage of this feature is to bring in the second player to pressure the opponent, and then use the player you control to intercept any pass the opponent may make.

Play an offline game every day before playing online.",How to Play FIFA 12," FIFA 12 makes some big changes to the previous versions, so even if you've played before you'll probably want to spend some time in the tutorial. This will let you get familiar with how the passing, dribbling, and shooting mechanics work.;
, One of the big mistakes most new player make is to continuously hold down the Sprint button while playing. This will tire your player out and, more importantly, keep you from having full control over the ball. Save your sprints for when you really need them, such as when you have an opening on the pitch to make a run at the goal., Soccer is a game of possession, and its always more beneficial to make a safe pass back than to try to push forward when outnumbered. If the defense collapses in on your ball handler, make a pass back to one of your trailing teammates to set up a new approach.

, You will automatically drop into precision mode when approached by a defender, but you can manually enter it at any time. This can give you more options for faking out your opponent.

, You can command one of your teammates to make an offensive run at anytime. A well-timed pass to a teammate that has broken free from the defenders can open up major scoring opportunities.

, Formations are powerful when used properly and the right formation can make the difference between winning and losing. On offense, many players recommend the 4-1-2-1-2 formation or the 4-4-1-1 formation.Make sure that your players are placed in their optimal position for the formation so that they're strengths shine through.

, One of the best ways to set up a goal is to cross the ball from a player coming down the side of the pitch to a player approaching the goal down the center or other side. This throws off defenders and can make for a quick shot from a different direction.

, Certain players on your team are simply better than others. Pay attention to the stats and try to give the ball to your star players as much as possible. You will be more likely to make shots, connect passes, and out-maneuver your opponent if the ball is in the right feet.

, Defending has changed significantly in FIFA 12, and you are penalized much more for being overly-aggressive with your tackles. Use the new defensive situation to your advantage by getting in close and contesting the ball instead of going for the tackle.At the same time, you don't want to be too patient. Not putting enough pressure your opponent will allow them to move down the field easier, putting you on your heels.

, If you can spare a player without leaving another opponent too open, call in a second defender to help put the pressure on. You can use this to shut down pass lanes or force the defender to lose possession of the ball.Be careful when doing this, as it often leaves an opponent open for a pass. Make sure you are aware of where the opposing players are in the field and shut down any passing lanes.

, One of the most useful defensive formations in the game is 5-3-2, as it provides good coverage for your defenders. Another solid choice is the 5-2-2-1 formation as it packs the midfield with defenders.

, In FIFA 12, the key to successfully defending is by anticipating where the opponent is going to pass, and then shutting that pass down. This will be difficult at first, but after some time you'll start to be able to tell which direction a player is going to to based on their direction and speed.

, While the default Assisted controls are good for getting a handle on how the game plays, you lose a lot of control and finesse. Switch to manual controls to enable complete control over your players. This allows for better and more dynamic ball-handling, as well as more effective defense.

, Although its tempting, try to avoid jumping online as soon as possible. There are a lot of good players out there, and if you don't practice a little bit you're going to get stomped. Play an offline season to get used to the controls, and use Practice Mode to practice formations, corner kicks, and penalty kicks.


Practice mode is also a great way to practice your offensive footwork.

, When you're first getting started online, you're going to need all the help you can get. Use one of the more powerful teams as you get used to playing against other opponents.


Barcelona, Man. U., AC Milan, and Real Madrid
Once you get a feel for the game, avoid using these teams as they are viewed by many other players as ""cheap"".

, During your first few online games, focus on defending the other player and denying goals. You can work on offense later, but a good defense wins games.

, Passing is incredibly important in online games, as you're likely to face much stiffer defense than against a computer opponent.

, Don't bring the ball up the same side of the pitch every time. Avoid going to the same player for every play. Fake doing one thing and then do another. One of the keys to winning an online game is to constantly keep your opponent guessing.


This goes for taking shots as well. Don't always use the same strength or shot type. Vary it up to keep your opponent's defenders on their toes. You can modify your shot type by using the shoulder buttons on your controller. Use different shots for different situations.

, A chance to score can be a rare opportunity in FIFA, so you'll want to ensure that you give yourself the best opportunity that you can get. There are a few factors to keep in mind before lining your shot up:Space - taking a contested shot will rarely work in your favor. Make sure that there is clear space in front of your player.
Range - Try to make sure you're inside the box before shooting. Taking a shot from the midfield line is a recipe for disaster.
Angle - If you're too far down on either side of the field, you will have a very small angle that you can make a shot in. You'll be better off crossing to one of your teammates.

, If you have a particularly tall striker, send more balls to him at head level. If your opponent has good dribbling skills, make sure to take advantage of that and try to juke your opponents.

, Try to avoid running players all over the pitch on offense and defense. Let the formation do the work, and switch to the best player for the situation and spot.

, Take some time to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of all the teams that your opponent can choose from. Knowing which players they're likely to favor can help you set up your defense and shut down their stars.

, If you're serious about your FIFA rank, warming up offline will help you get into the flow without jeopardizing your online game. Play a quick match to get your legs back, and then head online to find a real opponent.


Use the offline game to practice and tricks or plays you've been thinking about implementing in your online games.

Try to get a player with the best shot on the ball, usually a striker or a midfielder.,Get him into a position somewhere in the box or around the D where he can strike the ball towards goal on his stronger foot (ie if he's left footed shoot from the right and vice versa)

,
Make sure the player is not off balance.

,When there is no opposing players in the way of the goal, press O and apply about two or two and a half bars of power (bottom left)

At the same time, push the left analog stick away from you to make sure it stays fairly low.

The counter attack.",How to Score a Goal Using a 1 Star Team Against a 5 Star Team," Nearly every team in the Republic Of Ireland are two stars or below. There are very few that are higher than that. However, there is a two star or below team in nearly every country. Pick a team that has low star rating, but are not awful so you can still pass and dribble etc.;
, The team's first eleven might not contain the best players in the team. While it sounds strange, resting your best players on the bench is not completely unheard of and is often quite common in low rated teams, where you save your best players until you really need them. While the team's layout is really up to you, there are some basic guidelines. For example:


Goalkeepers are the last line of defence on the football team. For that reason, you will want them to have high stats in diving, penalties, footwork and speed. Five star team strikers are often quite quick and you will need to be prepared to defend against them.
Defenders stop the other team from getting through. For this reason, you will want them to have high stats in strength, so that they can slow the opposing team's speed so that they can catch up with them and tackling so that you don't give away silly free kicks. If you're going to have three defenders, make the middle one the strongest and the two outer ones the fastest.
Midfielders carry the ball forward. For this reason, you will want them to have high stats in speed, passing -long and short-, strength so that they don't get pulled down and tackling so they can help out the defenders if needed. There are usually three or four defenders on the team and you want them all to be equally good. If that's not possible, make the middle ones the strongest and the outer ones the fastest.
Strikers finish off all that hard work. You will want your attackers to have the highest stats in shooting, speed, strength and shooting techniques such as curving. With all of these things combined, your strikers should be able to score at least one goal. There are usually two or three attackers. The outer attackers need to be fast and good at crossing while the middle attackers need to be good at headers and shooting.

, When you start the game, click the left button on the D-Pad three times to go into ultra-defensive mode. This will automatically move your team into a more defensive formation. Against a five star team, all you can really do is defend and counter attack when they make mistakes. For this reason, you want your team to be as defensive as possible. Don't let you players get tired as they won't play as well, substitute them for an equally good or better player. When the other team become frustrated and make a mistake, start the counter attack.

, As soon as the other team make a mistake, clear the ball out of your box with your defenders. The ball should end up with one of your defenders. Don't boot the ball as hard and as randomly as you can, it's just going to end up with the opposing team again. Instead, keep it with your midfielders until you see an opening. Pass the ball around and keep possession until you can release the ball to your attackers. With the fastest of your strikers, sprint towards the goalkeeper and slot it in to the back of the net. Now you can repeat these steps or hold that one goal.

Start up the game.,
Scroll down to Manager Mode in the Menu.,
Decide which team you would like to be.,
Once you have signed with a team the game or your boss will ask you to date for friendly matches for the pre-season.,
After these pre-season matches you will come to the manager mode central menu.,
Once you understand what the transfer market is then you will need to master the manager menu so that you know how to make changes to your team, schedule practices, and look at the Board's Expectations.,
If you are trying to put in different players then you will need to go to the regular manager menu then scroll to click team management.,
Once you have finished looking at all the items in the menu then you can play the soccer game.

,
You can either Play the Match, Visual Sim, or Quick Sim.,
During your time in Manager Mode you will play in different tournaments such as the English League Cup, ECC, and the F.A.,
You will be asked questions sometimes so you will have to make the right decision.,
At the end of the season you will be asked if you want to re-sign to that club.",How to Play FIFA 2008 Manager Mode," This works with whatever gaming system you have for Fifa 08. This is more presumably about Fifa 08 for the PS2 but they should all work the same way.;
, If this is your first time playing (probably why you are reading this article), you will need to sign with a team. The best teams from England are the ones in the Barclays Premier League. Using this League will give you a great team to jump start you as a manager. You can also find great teams in Series A and La Liga.

, The USA doesn't have any teams higher then 3.5 stars or 3 and a half and those teams don't have good chemistry. If you want a team with 4.5 starts (which is the highest) then choose Manchester United, Liverpool, or Barcelona. There are more teams throughout various leagues, but these teams offer the best players, such as Ronaldo, Rooney and Messi

, You should try to play against worse teams with 2.5 stars. Anybody lower then that won't play you if your team has 4.5 stars.

, Here you can plan practices, look at the transfer window(if it is the time) and control where your players play.


The transfer window only opens 2 months out of the whole season.
The transfer window is when players are for sale, for loan, or free agents.

When players are for sale you will have to have enough money obviously to buy them but they have a transfer price, and you will have to give them a salary. This is going to add up to a lot of money in the end. If you don't bid high enough then the player will reject your offer.
For loan is when a player is signed with another club but they can play for you but they are not fully your player. This doesn't happen really often but it might happen. Don't ever sign a player if they are with another team because if you build them up after a season then they will either go back to their club, go for sale, or become a free agent. These are a waste of money but are good if you have some injuries.
A free agent is when a player isn't sign to a club. You will have to pay for their transfer fee and their salary but it might be a good buy. Try to buy players that are 17-25 in the 70 overall range. This will be good so that you can build up your players.

The Board is technically your boss so you have to please them. Also never go down to $0 or $-100 or something because that can get you fired.

, If you make the right decision then your team morale, job security, or Fan support will go up. You make the bad decision then one of those will go down. Sometimes if you pick on the job security might go up and the morale go down. It all depends on the decision that you make.

Snipers are alright, but their low rate of fire puts them at a disadvantage in terms of kills. Engineers are good on battlefields with a lot of tanks and turrets, plus their shotgun is quite powerful.;
, Most big vehicles are hard to kill, so use them to make yourself practically invulnerable. Speeders are useless for anything other than getting around due to their low power weapons and low armour. Only use them if you can steer.

, If you get a Jedi hero, make sure you use your force powers and jump attacks. Jump attacks have higher power than normal attacks due to their low rate of fire. Go on rampages to keep your hero meter up. Capturing bases is good for longevity as well. Non-Jedi heroes are generally useless, as they will be crushed by the Jedi heroes. The only exception are the Fetts, who can leave the action and snipe from mid air.

, As the old adage goes, 'practice makes perfect'. This is especially true when you want to get good at using a particular infantry class. Sniping requires practice more than the others.

, Although it may seem pointless, it isn't. Once you reach legendary status with a particular award (usually around 60 medals) you will be permanently granted the reward.

The first thing to do is to check out the controls and make sure you know them well.,
Remember when playing campaign, listen closely to the instructions.,
Spawn as a marine or pilot and fly the transport to the enemy hangar.,
Go over to the ammo and health droids and load up on both.,
Take a right and go into the engine room.,
Leave the engine room but watch out for the auto turrets.,
By now you should be close to the frenzy bonus, which is 12 kills with the blaster rifle.,
As for killing Jedi/Sith, shotguns work well.,
If you get stuck on a level, don't freak out.,
Use your surroundings to help you.,
Pick your trooper class according to the battle and the task at hand.,
If you're about to die and there's no way out, throw a grenade or set off a det pack or lay some mines.,
Use the ammo and health droids.",How to Do Well in Battlefront 2 for PC," If you need tips for game play, you can skip this. You can also modify the controls if you don't like the originals.;
, Using your map is an easy way to avoid tanks and infantry if necessary. When you are assigned to defend or capture a CP (Command Post), a tank can be a good way to do it. If you run into a wall of troops, throw grenades and start shooting. It may take few lives to wipe out the troops, but you'll get more reinforcements for each completed objective. One of the easiest ways to do well is to get awards. Space is a good place to get lots of awards.

, Then head straight to the control center. Shoot out the auto cannons and take out a few pilots. Then roll/sprint to the shield room, which is straight ahead. Use timebombs or grenades and rockets to take out the shields. Using timebombs is a better option if the hangar is not heavily guarded, because it takes 8 rockets (or 6 rockets and 6 grenades) to destroy the shields (without the damage increase award) but only 4 timebombs. This will take more ammo than you have, so use the ammo droid located in the command center (repair it, if you have to) or kill some foes to get more. By this time, the auto cannons are probably back on, so shoot them again.

, Destroy the auto turret defense mainframe. That's the big cylinder in front of you. This won't gain you any points, but it disables the auto turrets of the ship, so you and your teammates will have an easier time flying near the ship.

, Shoot the auto cannons. The reason for shooting the auto cannons is to protect yourself and each time you do this it gives you 1 point and you can even get awards (Energy Regeneration, Damage Reduction, Damage Increase, Precision Pistol or Elite Rifle) if you destroy them enough times. Blow up the engines. If you haven't died yet, you should get the award for endurance, guardian and maybe war hero.

, Shoot them if they have come back or ignore and run past them. Load up on ammo and health (it can be helpful if you hide behind the wall while doing it, because it is safer and the game only measures distance from droids, it doesn't matter if there is a wall between you and them, you will heal and your ammo will be replenished anyway). Go into the room on your left. Take out the auto cannon and at the end of the room, there should be a big screen. Blow it up.

, If not, shoot more foes/auto cannons. Now exit the control room and enter the hanger. Find the health/ammo droids and shoot enemy planes. Try to wait until pilots are just getting in them or near them to get more points. If done right, you should be close to winning. Do this 64 times to permanently get the fore-mentioned awards.

, But for more powerful Jedi/Sith, use EMP launchers, Arc Casters or rockets to kill them. Mines work well also. The last strategy works well for the Jedi masters on Coruscant in campaign.

, It is always possible to beat it. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be on the game. Try new ways of going at the objective. If your troops run out, try to complete other objective as fast as possible, so you don't lose troops.

, If you're playing in Jabba's Palace or Polis Massa or any level with close quarters, bounce grenades off the wall. You can also stand next to a frequently used doorway and lay waste to your enemies with a shotgun or any other gun. Those doorways are called choke points.

, If you run into a tank and your playing as a sniper, you will most likely die. If you are near a CP, run up to it and press E or enter and pick the rocket trooper and go to work.

, This way you can go out with a bang take some bad guys with you.

, If you are wounded badly, turn tail and retreat to the nearest pair of droids and reload. If are the class with a recon droid, use it while you heal and reload.

Many of them will be in predictable sniping spots (see the Tips section). If your team is using vehicles, then try to aim for the anti-tank units. If the battle is close-quarters, you should aim for the engineers. Otherwise, simply eliminate enemy soldiers.

, It's true that it kills most enemies, but the reach of the weapon decreases drastically. This means that the sniper can no longer fill its position on the battlefield: long-range shots.

, A good tactic is to point the cross hair at your enemy, then quickly switch the weapon to the sniper and fire. This is good since there is no cross hair when using the sniper. Eventually, you will learn where the cross hair should be.

,,, This does not come automatically. Simply switch to your pistol and then switch back and you'll receive the new beam rifle. There are pros and cons for this. Pros: Powerful, fast rate of fire. Does not leave a trace to you. Kills target wherever you hit them on. Cons: Short range. If you are too far away the beam won't even hit the target.

For example, the goalkeeper does not need to have a link with the striker, but he does have to have one with the center backs.;
,


There are two ways to get a good link. The first one is players having the same nationality. The second is players being in the same league. There is a bonus for players being in the same club, but it is not required.

, If a player isn't in his preferred position, then there will be a chemistry penalty for that player. For example, a left back playing right back will get a chemistry penalty. A way around this is using position change cards.

, A manager will increase the chemistry of players that have the same nationality or are in the same league he is in. This is useful, because a player has 9 chemistry max without a manager, but can have 10 chemistry with a manager.

Don’t rush.",How to Be Good at FIFA 13," If you’re new to playing football (or soccer), learning the basics should be your top priority. Browse some articles on the Internet and make sure you're familiar with the soccer guidelines before you try your hand at the game.


Though FIFA 13 is a video game, the game rules and regulations are based on real ones. Watch a few matches or ask someone you know who’s a fan of the sport for some explanation on rules that you may not understand immediately.;
, FIFA 13 is not a fighting game, and playing it like one won’t do much help. Every push of a button you do affects how your players play on the field.


Since FIFA 13 can be played on various platforms like PS3, Xbox, or Wii, learning which buttons does what can be a great help to you.
One way you can go over the controls is by playing the tutorial mode, accessible from the main menu.

, Hours of play time will get you where you want to be in terms of mastering the game. Just keep on playing matches, regardless whether you win or lose, to make you familiar with the entire game and its rules.


By the time you face other players online, you can attack and defend using only your instincts and familiarity with the controls.

, Take advantage of your team’s offensive strength. If you have great strikers like William José on your team, use plays that will emphasize and make openings for your striker to score a goal.

, On the other hand, if your team specializes on defense, create plays that can stop the other team from scoring a goal.


Having goalkeepers like Nicola Leali on your team will definitely strengthen its defensive plays. Also, defending in FIFA 13 is one of the game’s failing points, simply because it’s really hard to do in the game.
Don’t take on the opposing team’s players one-on-one. Instead, control your players to work as a team and defend as a group rather than individually.

, Keep on tackling players that has the ball. Majority of the teams in FIFA 13 only have a few technical players and those average ones will easily lose control of the ball once pressured, giving you the possession. Use plays that will make your players trail on whoever is carrying the ball.


Be mindful of fouls since you’ll most likely commit one as you pressure the other team.

, Practice ball rotation. The football field is very wide and very easy to find an opening. If your player carrying the ball gets cornered, don’t hesitate to pass the ball to another member of your team.


Quickly passing the ball around the field is also an effective way to disrupt the opposing team’s defense formation.

, Patience is one of the tools you’d surely need when playing FIFA 13. Don’t be in a hurry to get across the field and score a goal. Plan your attack or defense carefully and study how the opposing team is moving about the playing field. With good timing, you can easily steal the ball or score a goal flawlessly.

You can also throw a glance at the GPS when you are moving at a considerably reduced speed, e.g., when returning into the action after crashing.
Try to keep the parts of the GPS map that show the road in your immediate vicinity in memory. This will minimize the number of times you have to take your eyes off the road.

Immediately after the race kicks off, check your GPS map for any sharp bends you might have to immediately negotiate.
Form a strategy on how to tackle the bend without sacrificing too much speed before you get there. In NFS Hot Pursuit (2010) PC, for example, the best way is to drift around the bend.

When you reach the mouth of the bend, tap the brakes (use the Down arrow key), and get straight back on the gas (Up arrow key) while steering the car in the direction of the bend (Left/Right arrow key).
The brake button should be held for longer if the bend is long in order to drift for longer.
You can also opt to reduce your speed so you take the bend nicely or momentarily let go of the gas as you take it.



, Refer to Part 2, and repeat the process to gain an edge on other racers.

, The GPS System is invaluable if you are a racer who is being pursued by the uncompromising long arm of the law.

, They mostly appear as bright red glowing triangles.

, Do so if you are seeking to evade the cops or drive into the roads if you want to stir the hornet’s nest (for the purpose of racking up pursuit bounty).

, When you’ve thrown the cops off your trail, the GPS System will show you Cool Down areas where you can lay low, and let the heat pass.

Know the minimum requirements needed for running the game.,
Reduce graphic settings.",How to Reduce Lag in Need for Speed for PC1," The most common cause of lagging in NFS is a PC that does not meet the performance specifications required to run the game. For the most optimal performance, the PC should meet or surpass the recommended requirements.


For example, the minimum requirements for NFS Underground 2 are as follows:

Windows 98, or later operating system
Intel Pentium III 933MHz or better CPU
DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card with 32MB or more of video RAM
256 MB RAM
DirectX compatible sound card
2 GB of Hard Disk space
8X CD-ROM


Check your game’s casing for its minimum requirements, or research online for the information.;
, In the event that your still lags, you can reduce the expected quality of the graphics.


Launch the game from the Start Menu (Start >> All Programs >> Electronic Arts >> Need for Speed) or from the desktop by double clicking its icon.
When it finishes loading, press “Enter” to display the main menu.
Scroll rightwards by repeatedly pressing the Right arrow key and choose “Options” by pressing “Enter.” This is the rightmost option on the menu.
On the Options menu, choose “Display.”
On the window that appears, you can reduce the resolution by scrolling leftwards (Left Arrow key respectively). You can also reduce the level of detail by scrolling downwards to highlight the option (Down Arrow key) and then scrolling leftwards to reduce the level of detail.

"
Know why adequate hard drive space is important.,
Research to find out how much space you should have for the specific NFS version that you are playing.,
Check how much space the hard disk or hard disk partition containing the game installation has.,
Delete unneeded files to free some space.,
Try moving files and folders to a different hard drive or partition.",How to Reduce Lag in Need for Speed for PC2," Apart from the space required to install game files on a computer, each version of Need for Speed requires a certain amount of hard disk space to be available to properly run all the features of the game.


For example, while Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 requires only about 6 GB to install game files, it requires at least 20 GB of free space to run properly.
Freeing up space is important even if you already have the minimum required free hard disk space for your game. This is because low space increases the chances of file fragmentation occurring, and this would further cause the game to lag.

, This info may be displayed on the game’s CD case or saved on the CD itself in the form of digital help files (for disk versions of NFS).


If not, browse EA Online Help (https://help.ea.com/en/) and select your game to view its requirements.

, Compare this against the game’s requirement. For Windows 7, follow these steps:


Open the Start menu and go to Computer.
Right-click the icon of the hard drive or partition on which your game is installed.
Select “Properties.” This will bring up a dialog box showing the amount of used and free space on the hard drive or partition.

, Do this if you find that you need more space for the game.


Open the Start menu and go to Computer.
Double-click the icon of the hard drive or partition containing the game installation. This will allow you to view the contents.
Highlight the files or folders you do not need by clicking them with the mouse and then pressing Shift + Delete on your keyboard. This key combination will ensure the files and folders are completely deleted rather than stored in the Windows Recycle Bin.

, This is an option to free space on the partition containing the game if you don’t want to delete files.


Open the Start menu and go to Computer.
Double-click the icon of the hard drive or partition containing the game installation. This will allow you to view the contents.
To move a file/folder, right click it and select “Cut.”
Open Computer again (Start >> Computer).
Double-click the icon of the hard drive or partition where you wish to move the file/folder.
Press Control+V. This will paste the file/folder.

"
"
Know what a fragmented hard disk is.,
Defrag your Windows.",How to Reduce Lag in Need for Speed for PC3," Another cause of lagging in NFS, one that is much ignored, is hard disk fragmentation.


A fragmented hard disk is one on which parts of different files are not physically stored in optimal proximity to each other. If for instance there is a file that is required to load the main menu of an NFS game and one part of it stored in a sector of the hard disk far away from the second, there will be a lag in loading the main menu.

, Defragmentation is the process of consolidating file fragments to ensure files can be accessed faster. To defrag your Windows, begin by opening the Start menu.


Select “Computer.”
Right-click the icon of the hard drive or partition on which your game is installed and select “Properties.”
On the dialog box that appears, select “Tools.”
Click the “Defragment Now” button to open Disk Defragmenter, and on that window, click the “Defragment” button.

Learn the route.,
Avoid crashing into the AI.,
Tune your car for the race.,
Upgrade performance before looks.,
Tune your car for your ideal racing style when not racing.,
Avoid repeatedly changing cars.,
Get through the career races.",How to Succeed at Need for Speed 2015," Keep replaying the race, while studying the racing line and the map route. Having to keep watching the racing line can easily let you fly into a wall at high speed, which can lose you the race, even if you're only half a mile from the finish line. If there's a point you keep crashing at, remember it, figure out how to deal with it, and keep an eye out for it in future races. Know when the straights are, and view the map every now and then while racing, just so you know what's coming up.;
, Crashing and banging into the other racers will slow you down, and can send you spiraling out of control and into last place. The AI is rubber band, meaning you won't stay too far ahead for long. If you're out front, don't worry about how close they are and keep checking the map. If you go too slow, they'll overtake you. If that happens, just try to keep the pedal a little lower to the floor, as long as it's safe.

, Most races will have at least a few twists and turns, so drift tires and a high drift setting will be helpful in the majority. Grip tires are only very useful in drag races, as turning a corner with them equipped is nearly impossible. If a race has a lot of straights, choose time-refill nitrous and set it for duration. If a race is very windy, choose action-refill nitrous and set it for power. Individual tuning choices can make it easier than just keeping one setup for every race and hoping it will suffice.

, This will make everything easier. Looks won't get you anything but a good snapshot and praise from fellow players, it's the performance that makes the magic happen. Use your money to get your car as quick as can be, and once it's fully upgraded work on the bodywork. Wraps are fine, however, since they're free, and they can make even a plain old Honda Civic look intimidating.

, Like sliding round corners and pulling off tight and technical turns? Use drift tires. Like speeding along the highways for miles on end? Use grip tires. Tires and nitrous are really all you need to choose between, as this game follows the classic Need for Speed formula: Bolt on the best upgrades you can until you don't even recognise the sound of your own car anymore.

, One car will carry you most of the way in this game, as long as you keep on making it faster. The three starter cars you can choose from aren't very good in the long run, so save up and buy a reasonably cheap, but reasonably fast car. The BMW E46 M3 and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII are both good choices, but either will do.


When near the end of the game, it can be best to sell your car and buy a very fast car. The Aventador is expensive, but it's arguably the fastest car in the game, and it will easily win you the game.

, Later races can reward you over $10,000, so get to these and make good use of the cash they offer. Once you finish the game, you can use all your cash to buy and tune some cars for fun! Once you finish the career, the best you'll be able to get from a race is $8,000, which is a fair amount, but these aren't as rewarding as the career races.

On the other hand, with autosave disabled, you can keep retrying till you end up with the elusive pink slip!;

Of the three, Tuners have the best handling (they corner the best) but feature reduced engine power.
Muscles have the highest top speeds and acceleration capabilities but poor handling.

, Try focusing on the acceleration more so if you have crashed into a lorry (or truck), you'll be able to pick up speed quicker. But don't increase the acceleration TOO much, or your top speed will probably only be 135mp/h!

Pulling the e-brake will cause the car to slide further towards the outside of the track, which also helps the car spin more.






Your speed affects the points you gain exponentially.






Using NOS will make the car tend to go straight.;
, Flooring the gas will cause the car to slide and the car spins at a normal rate. Releasing the gas will cause the car to go to the inside more, and spins at a higher rate.

, Do not be afraid to hit the walls when ending your combos. You will still get half of the points and the multiplier, so it is always better to hit the sides trying to go fast than drifting like a turtle for the entire course.

(Note: The Mazda RX-7 only costs 31,000 and is a great car for customization.);
, This will benefit you greatly in Career mode. If you are in My Cars, upgrading your car's performance is optional.

Unfortunately, after a minute, a cutscene will appear where your car will bump into the side of a truck that drops its haul on your car, totalling it. Another cutscene will appear.;
, After the cutscene, you will get to choose between the Mazda RX-8 (Tier 1 Tuner), Chevrolet Camaro SS (Tier 1 Muscle), and Alfa Romeo Brera (Tier 1 Exotic). Tuners have the best handling, but they lack top speed and possibly acceleration. Muscles have the most powerful acceleration, but they lack handling. Exotics have fast all-around stats, but they are expansive to buy and upgrade. Choosing your car solely depends on your racing preferences and will affect which cars you're going to unlock during Career mode. Choosing your car will also affect which cars your crew members Neville and Sal are going to drive. It's a good idea to test drive each car before choosing.

, After selecting your car, you, Neville, and Nikki will head to Salazaar Street where Nikki will tell you how to use your wingman. After that, you and Neville head to Palmont City where the cops will chase you and him. After escaping the pursuit, Neville will send you a message telling you to meet him at a safe house. An arrow will appear above your car, telling you where to go. After arriving at the safe house, you will go to the Crew Management screen where you will set Neville as your wingman. Then you will choose your crew logo and its colors (you can change this later). You will also choose the name of your crew (unlike your crew logo, this can't be changed). Once you're all set, you'll be taken to an cutscene where Nikki will tell you about the Palmont City and its crews.

, Most of the game is pretty self-explanatory if you read the on-screen directions. Every time you win a race, you will get some cash. Races also unlock performance upgrades, visual upgrades and cars.

, Then, you'll unlock a performance upgrade or a car.

, First, you'll have to race the boss in a normal Circuit race. Then, if you win, you'll have to take on the boss in a Canyon Duel. In this type of race, racers will take turns following each other down a narrow, curvy, and dangerous canyon road. Whoever follows the closest wins. On the first run, you will be following the boss to collect as many points as possible. On the second run, the boss will be following you to take away your points. If your points decrease to zero, you lose. If you fall off a cliff or fall behind/get passed for ten seconds, you automatically lose. Also ramming the boss will take away 5,000 points on the first run, but will give you 5,000 points on the second run. This could be used as an advantage to prevent your points from decreasing to zero. Once you've won both races, you officially own that area.

, First, you'll race Kenji, Angie and Wolf in a Canyon Sprint race, then you'll race them in a regular Sprint race. After you win, you'll race Darius in a Circuit race, then in a Canyon Duel. Once you win, you will have completed the Career mode.

,, Customize cars in My Cars, try the Challenge Series, race in Quick Race, complete the Reward Cards, and maybe play Career mode again using a different car.

Consider what you want your Pokémon sprite to look like.,
Open a Pokémon image generator program or website.,
Capture the Pokémon images you want to borrow from to make your sprite.,
Copy the Pokémon images to your graphic editor program.,
Decide which Pokémon image will form the body of your sprite and which image(s) you will take parts from to add to the body.

",How to Make a Pokémon Sprite1," You may want to have your Pokémon have the features of a single class of Pokémon, such as an electric Pokémon that combines the features of Pikachu and Voltorb. You may instead want to have a Pokémon that crosses types, such as a miniature version of Gamera that combines Charizard's flame with Blastoise's jet appendages.


Even if you want to create a sprite to fit into a single Pokémon class, you may want to borrow from Pokémon of several classes to create your sprite. If you want to create an electric Pokémon with a body like Voltorb's, you may want to give it a shock aura that looks similar to Gasly's gaseous aura or projections resembling Bulbasaur's whip-like tendrils.;
, Also called sprite programs, these programs/websites are sources of raster images of existing Pokémon that you can combine to make your own creatures. Examples of such generator websites include http://randompokemon.com/, and http://www.dragonflycave.com/testing.htm.

, Instead of using a Pokeball, you'll use the screen capture commands for your computer system or the graphic editor program you'll be using. You'll need a Pokémon for the principal body type, and one or more additional Pokémon for arms, legs, and other appendages.

, Place the captured images close together to make it easier to move image portions from one Pokémon to another.


You may also wish to save your selection of images, so that if you make a mistake, you don't have to recapture the images when starting over.
Some images will display a black background when copied onto the canvas of your graphic editor program. For those images, you'll need to erase or repaint the background to match the canvas, or use the option to make the background transparent when pasted if such an option is available.

Erase the parts from the body of your base Pokémon that you want to replace.,
Cut the part from the donor Pokémon that you want to apply to the base Pokémon.,
Affix the donated part to the base Pokémon.,
Repeat the previous two steps until your sprite has all the appendages you want.,
Color your sprite as you wish.,
Save your sprite.",How to Make a Pokémon Sprite2," For example, if you want to give Charizard's arms to Squirtle, you'll want to erase Squirtle's existing arms.

, If you plan to use the part more than once on the base Pokémon, you may instead want to copy the part.


You may want to flip or rotate the part to make it better fit onto the base Pokémon before attaching it, such as if you want to use Feraligatr's head spikes as chin or belly spikes for a sprite made from Voltorb's body.
In some cases, you may want to erase away the body of the donor Pokémon, leaving only the part you want to attach to your sprite. For example, Voltorb and Gastly are both ball-shaped, so if you want to put Gasly's aura on Voltorb, you can erase Gasly's body, leaving only its aura.

, In most cases, you'll drag the donated part to the base Pokémon. In other cases, you may find it looks better to drag the base Pokémon to the new part. Experiment to see which way works best.

, In some cases, you may want to capture additional Pokémon images if you suddenly realize one of them has appendages your sprite should have.

, You can use the existing colors from the base Pokémon, its appendages, or any of the colors available in the paint palettes of your graphic editor program.


One coloring technique you can use is to set up your erase feature to erase in the color you want to paint the sprite and use it instead of one of the brush settings.

, Give the sprite a name that suggests its appearance or capabilities. This is how most Pokémon are named.

Defeat a faction in the campaign.,
Complete the campaign to unlock all factions.,
Use the hacking method for all remaining factions.",How to Unlock Factions in Rome Total War1," If there’s one specific faction you want to play, wipe out that faction in the campaign by killing every one of its family member (generals). If this is your number one priority, try making a large number of assassins and send them to kill the family members directly. This is not always a great strategy for winning, but it will unlock the faction more quickly than defeating it on the battlefield.


Without the hack described in the section below, you can only unlock The Greek Cities, Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, Carthage, Gaul, Germania, Britannia, and Parthia.;
, Once you beat a campaign as any faction, all remaining playable factions are unlocked. Choose the short campaign to achieve this sooner.


Of the three starting factions, the Julii are probably the easiest to win with.

, Certain factions are not intended to be playable, typically the smaller, less powerful ones. If you're up for the challenge, use one of the methods below to unlock these.

Find your Rome: Total War game files folder.,
Locate the campaign data.,
Make and open a copy of that file.,
Move faction names to the playable list.,
Move the altered file to the correct folder.,
Edit the faction description file if this didn't work.",How to Unlock Factions in Rome Total War2," Look in one of the following locations, depending on your game version. This is the first step for altering the Barbarian Invasion expansion as well as the original game.



Steam version: In Steam, right click the game tab and select Properties → Local Files → Browse Local Files (or from your desktop, go to C:\Programs\Steam\Steam Apps\Common\Rome – Total War)

Rome: Total War basic edition: C:\Program Files\Activision\Rome - Total War

Rome: Total War gold edition: C:\Program Files\The Creative Assembly\Rome - Total War

, Once you've reached one of the folders above, locate the file that contains faction playability information, located in one of the following paths:



To unlock factions in the base Rome: Total War campaign: \data\world\maps\campaign\imperial_campaign

To unlock factions in the Barbarian Invasion campaign: \BI\data\world\maps\campaign\barbarian_invasion

, Right click that file and copy it, then paste it to your desktop. Open this file.


This lets you edit the file even if you are not an administrator account, and gives you an unaltered backup copy in case something goes wrong with your game.

, The file should begin with a list of faction names, sorted underneath the words ""playable,"" ""unlockable,"" and ""nonplayable."" Select all factions underneath ""unlockable,"" cut them from the document, and paste them into the list under ""playable."" Before you do the same for the factions underneath ""nonplayable,"" read the following warnings:


In the original campaign, the maximum number of playable factions is 20. Keep at least one faction underneath ""nonplayable"" to avoid bugs.In the original campaign, most people experience frequent crashes when playing as the ""romans_senate"" (SPQR) or ""slave"" (rebels) factions. See Tips below for a possible workaround.
In the Barbarian Invasion, the following factions should be left under ""nonplayable"" (they crash the game if you attempt to play as them): romano_british, ostrogoths, slavs, empire_east_rebels, empire_west_rebels, slave.Every faction name must have a ""Tab"" indent in front of it, and should be the only word on its line.

, Save the file without changing its name. Move the original, unaltered file to another location, so you can restore it if your game becomes buggy. Drag the altered file back to that folder and open Rome: Total War to see your changes.


You may need to close and reopen Rome: Total War before it takes effect.

, This is only necessary in early versions of Rome: Total War. If the game still doesn't have additional faction options, and you're certain your previous edit contained no typos, try making this additional change:


In your Rome – Total War folder, make a backup copy of \Data\Text\campaign_descriptions, then open this file.
Paste the following into the file, then save it:

DON’T DIE.",How to Play DotA 2," When you first start playing, you’ll want to play against bots first. This will help you learn how to play the game and get comfortable with the controls, so that when you play with your friends you won’t be a terrible teammate. Click on ""Play Dota"" at the bottom right, then choose ""Practice With Bots"", where you will be able to select the difficulty and team.


Always play against bots first. The strangers you get paired against will not be...welcoming if you suck.
Another way to play against bots is to join a Co-op bot match. With this type of game you will play with strangers or your team (if you become part of a team) against bots.;
, When you’ve got a good idea of how to play the game, you can play against and with your friends. Nothing build friendships like killing your friends and insulting their moms. Create a lobby from the play menu and either password protect it to only play with your friends or leave it open to play against a few friends and a few strangers.

, If you enjoy having your playing aptitude, gender, and sexual preference mocked or simply enjoy making strangers look like idiots by thoroughly beating them, play a match or play a team match (if you have a team).


Choose your game mode. Sometimes you might want to change your game mode. This is possible for any matchmaking game, as well as lobby games. Game modes affect how you can choose the heroes that you, your teammates, and the opposing team play with.“All Pick” is wide open.
“Single Draft” gives players a choice of three heroes based on attribute.
“Captain’s Mode” (the standard format for championship games) allows team captains to choose heroes in turn for their players from a nearly unlimited pool.
“Random Draft” gives players a 22 hero pool to choose from and turns are taken in choosing heroes.
“Least Played” removes your 40 most-played characters from the pool.
“Limited Heroes” is limited to the easiest to play heroes.
“All Random” is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.


Adjust settings. Don’t forget to make sure the settings are correct when you go to join a match. The settings can help get you matched with the right people and make sure your connection is strong, combatting rage-inducing lag. Remember: Lag kills. Friends don’t let friends lag.

The most important setting to pay attention to is region or server location. You want to play against people and with people that are close to you if you know your connection is slow. This will help ease lag issues.



, After joining a match you will choose your hero (or have one chosen for you). What character you choose is really important, so don’t just choose the red-headed chick because she’s hot. That is a bad plan. Choose your character based on how you play best and based on what your team needs. There are many rolesbut here are a few:


A “Durable” or “Tank” is a hero who purposefully draws the enemy attention and takes damage while the other teammates work on taking out the other team and the towers. Good examples of Tanks are Axe, Dragon Knight, and Elder Titan.
A “Carry” is the hero who will deal the majority of the team’s damage, theoretically ranking in the most kills by the end of the game. At early game, this role is still weak and needs a great care of the supports for they will be carried in late game. This is a powerful role with powerful heroes, but it takes a great deal of skill to pull off. Good examples of Carries are Phantom Lancer, Medusa, and Spectre.
A “Lane Support” sticks with the team’s carry to keep them safe, healing them or replenishing their mana. These heroes generally do not make kills, and accordingly do not get gold. Good Lane Supports include Lich and Dazzle.
A ""Support"" focuses on buying the courier and buying the wards to give vision to his/her team. Great supports include Crystal Maiden and Omniknight.
A ""Initiator"" starts the clashes and manipulates the war. They have the abilities that can disrupt the formation of the enemies, leaving them unguarded. Great initiators are Clockwerk and Tidehunter.
”Pushers” are the heroes who focus on bringing down enemy towers as quickly as possible. Examples of Pushers include Broodmother and Leshrac.
If you’re familiar with the role of mages in other games, then you’ll understand the “Nuker”. Nukers deal damage using spells with large areas of effect, often from a distance. These characters make great Pushers and the roles can be doubled.
You can always random if you think you've got what it takes. If you random you'll get 200 extra starting gold. But remember, you can't random in the last 10 seconds of the picking phase, so don't wait too long.

, Attributes determine the effectiveness of the armor, the amount of health your hero has, and the amount of magical power (or mana) that they can draw from. Each character has a major attribute (one which is higher than the others) which greatly determines how they will play. Attributes increase with level.


Strength, which builds health, is essential for heroes who will need to take a lot of damage.
Agility, which builds defense, is essential for heroes who will carry the team (explained below).
Intelligence, which builds mana, is essential for supporting heroes or those who intend to attack from a distance.

, When you first enter the map, you will be placed next to the store, where you should buy some items. You can purchase consumables (potions and similar items), items which fortify your attributes, armaments to protect yourself with, and magical items (if your character is so inclined). You can also return to the shop during the match or buy a Courier which will take items back and forth for you.


Use secret shops. There are also secret shops hidden in the jungles between the roadways (or lanes). These sometimes have items for sale which are not available in the regular shop.
You will purchase these item with gold. Gold is earned passively (every few seconds) but also for things like killing enemy soldiers (called Creeps), destroying enemy towers, and various other accomplishments.

, There will be two runes in the river, between the three lanes. They give short-term boosts and disappear once taken. They respawn every 2 minutes. They can be stored in a bottle (purchased at the shop) to be used later., There are three main roadways on the game map. These are called lanes. During the game, you and your enemies will largely be positioned in these lanes, in varying numbers, where you will fight for control in order to reach and destroy each other’s towers. You and your teammates will need to figure out how you want to handle your lanes.


Center Lane - The Center Lane, which go diagonally across the screen from base to base, is usually played with one hero versus one hero. This is why it is often called the solo lane. Players in these lanes will commonly move to the outer lanes to create uneven numbers and gank (or gang kill) the enemy heroes.






Top Lane - The top lane is usually played 2v2.






Bottom Lane - The bottom lane is usually played 2v2.







, Work together with your teammates to slowly chip away at the enemy. Remember, the goal is not to kill them but to instead destroy their towers. Be strategic and play your hero well. There is no “i” in team but there is an “i” in dick: support your teammates and together you can all succeed.


Creeps, the funny looking fellows that you can’t control, are also part of your team. Use them. Worship them. They are the key to your success. They will spawn every so often and come in waves down the lanes. There they will clash with enemy creeps and towers, protecting you from much damage. Stay behind the creep line of defense.
Destroy the other team’s creeps to gain money, though. Those guys are jerks.

, The game is won when the enemy’s main structure, called their Ancient, is destroyed. This main tower is located on the opposite corner of the map from where you begin. Progress your way there by destroying the intervening towers that block your progress.


The other side of this, of course, is that the enemy team will be trying to destroy your towers. Protect your towers.

, Mostly you’ll be dealing with enemy creeps, sometimes enemy heroes, and hopefully the enemy towers. Attack the enemy but never forget your focus of getting to their towers (and eventually their Ancient). Don’t be stupid and don’t be rash, take your time and make smart kills.


Right click on enemies to perform basic attacks.
Use and advance abilities through the course of the game. Abilities will be different for every character. They are assigned to keys which you choose when you start the game. Experiment with abilities and find the best ways to use them. Make sure you use them to help not only yourself but your team as well.

, Last hit is a very important aspect of playing DOTA 2. Only the person who gets the last hit on an enemy gets the gold (though all in the immediate area get the experience). If your character is one that benefits from gold, make sure you’re getting the last hit. The best way to do this is to wait until you see an enemy’s health is low and then go in for the kill. Timing this is a learned skill. Don't forget that last-hitting will also push the lanes forwards if not countered with a friendly hit. (See below)

, You don’t want your enemies to get gold or experience for killing your creeps, so when you see the opportunity, kill your own creeps to deny them the pleasure and rewards. This should be done just like last hitting.

, Don’t forget that there are neutral creeps in the jungles between the lanes who will attack you given opportunity. There is also the dragon Roshan lurking just off the lanes and he will deal out a butt kicking like you can’t even imagine. Be cautious.

, Pick up some healing salves at the beginning of the game (from the store). These will allow you to regain some health while fighting. Later in the game, after winning a hundred battles, you will be allowed to teleport to base for free (which will also heal you).


Heal yourself by returning to base. You’ll need scrolls to return to your base, so this isn’t ideal, but it’s preferable to dying so keep it in mind.
You can also use tangos. A tango is an item you purchase in the store at the beginning of the game. Use it in order to gain back some health. Using a tango allows you to cut down three trees which are then converted to health.

, Remember, this is a strategy game. A STRATEGY GAME. Not run-in-and-kill-things game. It requires skill and patience. Dying is seriously punished, so you will need to play smart. Dying means you’re missing out on experience and gold, and your teammates are going to get gut-punched while they wait for you. So, yeah, don’t die.

Roam around.,
First you should hide and let your team-mate farm first.,
Carry a dagger.",How to Play with Earthshaker in Defense of the Ancients (DotA)," This hero can be a roamer at early game play by carrying a bottle. Try to block an enemy hero by using the 1st skill. Try to start at the bottom lane.;
, If you see the enemy hero stand at a position where you can block by using your first skill, like between a tree, then just go for it.

, This hero is better if he has a dagger with him. With this combination skill, that is use dagger at hero. If they regroup, that's even better. Then use multi + 1st skill + 2nd skill.

If you want to have a head start, Great Britain is one of the better choices. Great Britain has powerful navies, which allow you to control the waters around Europe, India, and the New World.


This island empire will be left untouched unless an enemy country manages to build a strong battleship.;
, Early trade agreements and alliances will give you an edge. It will boost your income and relationship with the nation you wish to work with. Building your income in the early portion of the game is crucial for building your military might.There are chances that your allied nation will remove the treaty, so make use of them as much as you can.
Build trade ports. The more trade ports you have, the more trade partners you can get. You can also trade with neighboring countries by land.
If you're using Great Britain, it's necessary that you have a trade port for your supplies to be exported and to receive resources from your trade partner.
Pirating is a good way to decrease your enemy's resources. To do this, have your privateers block your enemy's trading route.

, Building and upgrading farms will help field larger armies, and production such as furs, cotton, sugar, and coffee will help increase your economic power.


Destroy Church Schools and replace them with Schools to let you do research. Research is conducted in Schools. The more you upgrade your Schools and fill them with Gentlemen, the faster the research goes. If you have multiple schools, you can research multiple technologies at the same time, but Schools cannot team up on the same technology.
Researching technology costs a certain number of research points. Research points can be gained from Schools per turn. The higher the level of your school, the more points they produce.
Gentlemen also provides points and decreases the turn time required to finish the research, so make sure to put your Gentlemen inside the School building to acquire this bonus.

, Research military technologies such as Plug Bayonet, Ring Bayonet, Formations, etc. These will strengthen your soldiers in the battlefield. Performing research under the Military tab will give your units new and stronger weapon upgrades and also unlocks drill buildings, which gives you access to tougher soldiers.


The same goes for naval upgrades. Aside from faster building and cheaper ships, high naval technology increases the movement range of your battleship, making travel much faster. Higher naval upgrade gives more accuracy using ship cannons.
You can upgrade your explosives for cannons.
Naval ships can be loaded with military units. This enables you to conquer lands across the ocean, but make sure you have enough soldiers to invade the capital city.

, Once you have a stable economy and strong units, don't hesitate to help your allies whenever they request for assistance. This will strengthen your relationship with them and also gives you a chance to conquer new lands.


To wage war against a certain nation, click on the Diplomatic Relations button and then look for the nation's name on the list and click on it. Make sure that your future enemy ally is not part of your allied group to avoid breaking the treaty. Now click on Open Negotiation and then Declare War.
If you declared war against your ally, the alliance automatically breaks.
If you have declared war against the same enemy as your allied nation, you can ask for their assistance. This is useful in putting down nations that constantly get in your way.
Rejecting an ally's request for help may or may not cancel their alliance with you.
Helping an ally in taking down an enemy nation increases your chance of having new lands. With their military support, there's no need for you to dispatch a lot of platoons to take over a city.

, Garrisoned forts have a zone of control that works exactly like the one for armies. This makes forts ideal to guard certain passages that will force enemy units to attack before they can get through.


Fortifying your unit in forts increases defense greatly, giving you enough time to summon reinforcement to put down invaders.
With the use of Generals or Admirals, you can recruit units directly.

, Plan which nation you will take down first. Make sure it's close to your main city and within your reach, or a nation close to your allied country. Most players target nations that are already struggling in war. Joining the battle is considered cheap but a very good strategy.

, In the Diplomatic Relations window, you can see every nation's status and their attitude toward other nations. Search a nation that can be considered as common enemy, and then make an alliance with those whom you think can give enough aid during your attack.

, Move your platoon close to your target. With your units gathered right outside your target's border, open your Diplomatic Relation window to declare war against them or just simply invade their territory.


A window will appear asking you if you wish to ask help from your alliance. Remember, choose only those who are close to you so they can give fast reinforcements.

, In Empire: Total War, there are two types of nations: Major and Minor. Minor nations usually only have one city, but can still field impressive armies if given enough time. Find the Minor nations nearby your starting point and mark them as your first targets.


If you give the minor nations too much time to build up their armies, they can pose serious threats and significantly slow down your expansion.
You can use Minor nations as a way to grind for more XP for your troops. Keep attacking the single city, letting the nation rebuild between each attack. This will provide you constant, easy targets for your armies.

, If there are no enemy armies nearby, you should almost always attack an undefended city. Even if you only have a few units, your soldiers will have an advantage over the garrison guarding the city. Attacking and sieging cities is a much more effective way for dealing with opposing nations instead of meeting their armies on the field.


If the city is defended by nearby, besiege the city with a large army. Use other troops to engage the nearby armies, or let them attack your besieging army. In either case, you will have the advantage over the enemy, and will split their forces.
When attacking a city, make sure you have the force necessary to take it and use the Auto-Resolve option. The computer will give you a higher advantage than normal. If the enemy comes out of the city to attack your siegers, play the battle manually. If any enemy attacks one of your cities, play the battle manually as well.

, Conquering Europe is just the first step, and shouldn't be your only focus. Use your strongest naval unit, load it with ground units, and start exploring the other side of the world. You should have a foothold in the New World by the 1700s at the latest.


Conquering America is much more ideal than taking over India since America holds a lot of resources and trading ports for you to use.
Some of the best provinces to take in the New World are Huron-Wyandot or Northern Quebec. You aren't likely to be attacked by other nations when you're that far north, making your stronghold secure. You can also easily move south or west to take out the other nations occupying the New World, as they are likely not very heavily defended.
If you're using Great Britain, you can start infiltrating America by using your base in Nassau and Port Royal. If your Thirteen Colonies are still under your protection, you can request for their assistance in conquering Native American tribes.
You get to fight France as well if you're at war against them; if not, avoid making sour confrontations until you're able to take over the Native Americans.

, Once you've entered America and taken over the Native Americans' city, build and expand your empire. Upgrade your resources, upgrade your drill building, and draft soldiers to have them stationed in your newly captured land to protect them from any invaders.


A newly claimed city will have a very unstable economy due to the residents' satisfaction.
Once you conquer a city, don't forget to repair them. The city needs to be in good shape in order for you to start upgrading and drafting more soldiers.
Exempt the region from tax if needed; this will boost the happiness of the residents. Once they're settled down, you can switch off the exemption to start earning income.
Build, increase your resource, draft, and then expand. Repeat. With high resources, you don't have to worry about income. Just focus with conquering, and then travel to India to continue your world domination.

, As your army grows, you may find that your income production does not match the upkeep costs of your military. Strike a balance between what you need to expand and conquer versus how much you can support.


Taxes are a great way to avoid bankruptcy in the late game, especially if you are playing as a Monarchy. Tax the wealthy classes to gain big income without inciting unrest.

, Whenever a city is attached or conquered, the residents' happiness drop dramatically. Rebellion, protesting, and other problems may happen. To get rid of this, attack any rebels that appears near your captured cities. Rebels will put a damper on your economics, and count against your world domination total., As the game starts wrapping up, you will find that you only have a few opponents left. Take them down one at a time, making sure that your forces aren't spread too thin.


You will need to start taking out your allies as well. Make sure that you only attack your allies one at a time. If you attack one ally, it will make you other allies mad but they should be too scared to try to attack you. Attacking multiple allies at once will cause them to band together against you.

Watch out where you walk.",How to Master Quarantine Regen," As you will spend most of the time trying to survive as a human, you are very likely to at some point have to flee from the infected. That requires speed gear as they are normally faster than you. Also always use standard backpack, the other ones will slow you down. Here are some examples


Specialist: You can buy Viper (15%+ speed and 20%+ sprint stamina) or Hawk (16%+ speed). Scorpion is not recommended as he only gives a 10%+ speed increase. They are available by NX at about 4K for a week (all prices EU version) or GP for about 17K a week (to buy with GP you need to have Lieutenant rank).
GP gear: Light vest + Military bandanna gives you a total of 15%+ speed increase.
Fastest (NX): Buy Recon vest + Cyclops bandanna, it gives you a whopping 22%+ speed increase. If you have extra nx, you can buy either an Anti-Flash Glasses or one of the Patriot Skull masks. They both add +3 speed, but the Patriot Skull mask gives also a +10 stamina increase. In total, you can have up to +25 speed and +10 stamina.

, Unlike in Elimination, some weapons are not suited for use in this mode. This is a summary of what you should carry


Primary weapon: A shotgun as they push back the zombies a lot and can be shot while reloading. M4/M3 Super 90 is best as it reloads really quick, M590 Military is another nice gun, but it only comes only with 6 rounds. If you are going to buy a gp shotgun, buy the Spas-12 because it is automatic and shoots faster.
Secondary weapon: Pretty much any pistol will do, however you shouldn't bring power pistols, because if you miss a shot, you have to shoot again, and by that time, the zombies probably infected you. I would recommend a m92fs or a pistol that shoots fast like the g23 usp and p226.
Melee: Standard M9 will do the trick. If you have extra nx, buy a Tracker knife.
Support: Mines if you plan on some camping, otherwise M69HE nade.
Backpack Slot A: If you bought a specialist you will want to buy and equip a specialist weapon like M32 or the Flamethrower as they take loads of HP from the infected. If you have your normal character, a second nade or LAW/RPG is a good choice.

, To become a pro at Quarantine Regen you need to know all the maps extremely well, both for hiding or running as a human and for finding the humans when you are infected. This is a short review of the maps, for a better understanding play them multiple times.


Overdose: Small map with safe-rooms for the humans that opens when there is about 1 minute left of the game. You can rarely hide anywhere for a full round without being spotted so your best chance is to cooperate with other humans and guard the saferooms. If you are trying to free run, there is an area next to Site A that is filled with boxes. There are many cool neat tricks you can do there. More than you think.
Junk Flea: Also tiny map but without any safe rooms. Best suited for free runners. The only good spot a group of humans can defend is the roof at Bravo base.
Warhead: Huge map with lots of hidey-holes, it also has a few spots that a group of humans can defend. Take any chance you get to spectate other humans when you join the game or when you are dead to get tips on nice hideouts.
Two Towers: A lot like Warhead, lots of places to hide and a good runner can easily survive by running and jumping from the roof onto window ledges etc.
Showdown: This map is not that big actually but it still have some spots where you can hide. A group of humans is most of the time gathered at one of the roofs.
Kill Creek: The largest map of them all although it lacks good hiding spots. It's a nice map for runners though and at all times you are likely to find some people camping under the bridge.

, You don't want to stand next to a player that turns into a zombie, on the other hand you don't want to be too far away either if you become infected. Best thing to do is keeping some distance to the other humans and be prepared to run in case anyone near you become infected.;
, If you decide to hide you should do it as quick as possible before or after the host infections are selected. Otherwise you risk that a zombie spots you and follows you to your hideout. If you want to defend with other humans, try to group up with middle or high rank players that has mines/rocket launchers/specialist weapons. Some short tips


Hiding: Refrain from hiding at places everyone does, try to find the unusual spots where people normally doesn't look. Also never use the same spot several times in the same game if you have been found, some people will remember it and go look for you there.
Defending: Avoid any spot that has multiple ways to access it. The Office safe room in Overdose is ok as it's easy to cover the ways because zombies has to jump to get there, open areas however aren't.
Free running: Don't try Free running without having speed gear equipped. (discussed above). Also don't run like a fool without looking over your shoulder every now and then to see if any zombies are following you. Do not completely use your sprint while running away from zombies, because it regenerates slowly when you have less sprint.

, A good Quarantine Regen player knows when it's time to abandon a strategy and choose another one. If you are defending with other humans and a zombie break through, it's time to start running. Or if you normally like to just run but all humans are gathered at one spot and there are only host infections you might wanna considering teaming up with the humans.

, In any Quarantine Regen room you will find at least some people with different types of explosives. Shooting or grenading the mines like some people do is utterly stupid, it ruins the defence and in some cases it also kills the player that planted them. Same goes for when there is a specialist with M32, too many players tend to jump in front of them while they are a launching a nade which either damages or kills them. Not only is this behaviour foul against the other players, lots of times you will also be kicked for team-killing. Also be gentle when you are handling explosives, launching with M32 or LAW/RPG too close to you may damage or kill you.

, Sometimes you will find yourself lucky enough that one of the host infections are AFK. However, be suspicious of the AFK zombies, because sometimes they move. If they move in any way, do not try to knife them. This is a great possibility to narrow the number of infected people as a single host infection have a hard time attacking a room full of humans, instead it often turns into a ""zombie hunt"". Use your knife when killing AFK zombies as its the quickest way. Also, if any zombie has been severed by nades or lots of gunshots and is trying to escape, they are likely to run low on HP and are trying to get away to regen. Always follow these zombies (preferably if you are a group of people) and continue attacking them, chances are you can finish it off.

, Whenever you are playing at a map where most humans normally team up (Overdose, Showdown etc), it can be hard to attack them if you are only 2-3 host infections. Instead go look at the regular hideouts and infect any human you see, when you are a bigger number of zombies you can attack the groups.

, As there are lots of weapons that can sever you badly (mines, nades, M32 etc) you should always regenerate when your HP is becoming low. Keep in mind that you only regen when you are standing still and the regen process is aborted if you get hit by weapons.

, There are lots of ways you can infect the humans. If you are playing at a small map and have a hard time infecting anyone, one trick is to pretend to be AFK somewhere close to the humans. It's very likely that one or several of them soon will come and start knifing you. All of a sudden you got yourself some free kills. Also sneak upon the humans whenever possible, it's a lot easier to infect them when they are not aware of your presence and are defenseless.

, CA now has several potentially deadly mines which are often used in Quarantine Regen to kill or damage the infected. 3 regular mines, 2 hornet mines or a claymore can kill you depending on your HP. Never try to jump over these without having full HP, regain if needed.

, If you are in a knife fight, then ignore this step. It will do you no good. If you are not, then walk, rather than run. There is a walk button for a reason. Footsteps are silent when you walk, but you will slow down. If he is running, run carefully behind, once you are close, walk. This should set you up perfectly. Once you get closer, execute a backstab.

, It takes two stabs to finish someone off. Do it fast. The longer you wait, the more time you give them to get you. Once you get the hang of knifing someone with the two right click move, try the 3 hit combo. This consists of doing 2 left clicks and 1 right click. It does 100 damage in all, and is faster than the traditional 2 right click move. One right click to the back will be a one hit KO.

First, place lots of trees on your lot (the chances of the leader of the pack coming increases if you have trees and/or toddlers or babies on the lot). Once the leader of the pack come (he has glowing yellow eyes) greet him.
Get his daily friendship points up to about 60 and then wait. Make sure your Sim does NOT go off to do something else (it would be easiest to turn off free will for this). Soon, the leader of the pack will 'Nibble' you.
At around 8:00 your Sim will transform (as long as the Sim is not doing anything.)

When he comes, greet him and then you should be able to drag the relationship bar up with your mouse, do this on your Sims relationship with the wolf, then right-click the wolf and click MAKE SELECTABLE. Drag up his relationship with the desired Sim. Then right-click the wolf again and choose MAKE UNSELECTABLE. Wait a minute and the wolf should nibble your Sim. And voilá again! You have a werewolf.

Understand its basic statistics.,
Take advantage of its intermediate statistics.,
Modify the weapon according to intermediate statistics.,
You may also want to buy an NX version of the weapon.",How to Use the Famas in Combat Arms," Generally, the FAMAS has very low damage (it takes about six shots to kill someone with no vest on), a decent portability, a high fire rate, relatively high accuracy, and low recoil. Typical assault rifle standards. You will also need to be a Private First Class to wield it, although you can get it in the new player's pack right when you start the game.;
, Nexon tells you the five statistics there, but there are many other ones that they don't - such as recoil path and such. These things are very important, and because of this, choosing a weapon isn't so easy as 1 2 3. Here is a breakdown of intermediate statistics:


Scope magnification and design. Some weapons (not on the FAMAS) will have varying levels of scope magnification. This usually applies to snipers, but also the G36E, G36KE, the Aug A1, Aug A1 Black, TMP, M416 CQB and variants, etc. You can look up more weapons with pre-attached or built-in scopes on the website's arsenal.
Recoil path. This is very important when you are playing in small maps such as Death Room. FAMAS has a recoil path of going straight upwards for the first five rounds when spraying, and then rocks back and forth every two to three rounds. Very good burst weapon, decent spraying weapon.

Some SMGs such as the P90 are headshot machines, with their recoil literally shooting upwards. The reason why it is called a headshot machine is because when you aim at a person's body, the recoil causes it to shoot at the center of the body, to the neck, and to the head. This effect is enhanced when attaching a reflex sight.


Spread recovery. This intermediate statistic is very important when burst firing (i.e. firing intermittent shots of three-eight rounds). When a weapon is fired, the reticle is enlarged. Hold down the fire button, and it will expand and contract corresponding to the time of each shot taken (which is about a split-second). When you release the fire button, the reticle gradually contracts to its normal accuracy. Spread recovery depends on how fast the reticle contracts after releasing the fire button. The FAMAS particularly has a very good spread recovery, meaning as soon as you release the fire button, the reticle shrinks in a split-second. This effect can be experimented with other weapons such as the PP19 or the Negev.
Reloading speed. Unless you are a CQC (Close Quarters Combat) type person, this doesn't really affect your performance. This is pretty self-explanatory. The fastest assault rifle to reload is the Aug A1 and the fastest SMG is the Uzi, but reloading speeds can be adjusted by extended magazines (more bullets in magazine = more time to reload). The FAMAS is not a very good weapon for reloading, so it is best in medium-complex maps such as Short Fuse. (Notice that complexity does not equal to size. Death Room is a very small map, but there are reloading spots for the FAMAS to gain time.) Generally in large & medium maps and small maps with small complexity, you will want to use the extended magazine 1, and small maps with large complexity (Junk Flea) you don't want to use any modifications. You can also buy fast loader magazines, but they lower your magazine capacity.
Space concealment. This basically means how much space the weapon takes up on your screen. Bullpup rifles such as the L85A1 generally take up the least with the exception of the M6A2-SRT (NX only). FAMAS is a bullpup rifle, but the top part really conceals the space, hindering sight. Because of this, do not put a reflex sight or ACOG scope on the FAMAS.

Sound. The FAMAS is the only weapon in the game with a distinct popping sound when fired, so it is advisable to always use a suppressor when firing. If you fire a FAMAS, enemies will automatically be alerted of your presence.

, This means, depending on map and complexity, to add an extended magazine, and to always add a suppressor. Never add a scope - it will hinder sight, and besides, the weapon is already accurate enough.

, These include the FAMAS G2 (suppressor pre-attached, reflex sight attached), and FAMAS G2 SE (improved version of FAMAS G2). While these weapons obscure sight, when zoomed in, they produce virtually no recoil when fired.

Know your way around.,
Camp at the edges.,
Jump around.,
Sneak up on them.,
Drop grenades.,
Camp at the ledges, especially if your opponent is attacking while you are defending.,
Never use a machine gun.,
Plant mines.,
Use a LAW (light anti-tank weapon) (unless Elite Mod does not allow it).,
Camp at the boxes.,
Shoot from the corridor.",How to Master Death Room in Combat Arms," Very important, you have to learn every part of this map before you get to know the strategies. It is very simple though; two rooms with two doors on the left and right side, and a corridor in the middle with two staircases leading up to a side of the corridor.;
, If you are one of those people who fear that people always come through the doors to sneak behind to the corridor, then this is for you. You should use an L96 Arctic Warfare sniper, or a semi-auto sniper. Be sure that if you kill a person, immediately move to the other side, and the other door.

, Death Room is not a good place to crouch because it is very tiny. Instead, you should do the opposite: jump around. This is even more effective when using a shotgun because the reticle does not change in size. However, if you are using an assault rifle, machine gun, SMG, or something else that makes the reticle change in size, then make sure that you are very close to the enemy.

, You have to be brave enough to do this. Sneaking up can be lethal to your opponent, especially if they are attacking. You can also try to knife them, but it is strongly not recommended if they are constantly moving. Make sure that in the other room, you have to kill everyone in their line of sight (including YOU!) before you sneak up. This works with the grenade dropping.

, Go to the left side of the door and when you are near the staircase leading up to the corridor, and drop your grenade. This is extremely effective in CTF (Capture the Flag mode) because everyone will think you are trying to get the flag, and dropping it decoys your opponents. There are also other ways to use these grenades. If people are bunched up defending their flag, hide your grenade and try not to let your opponent see the grenade. That way, if they don't notice, you can kill a lot of people, making a clear path for your ally to capture the flag (or YOU!). If your rank is above SFC-2 (Sergeant First Class 2), you can buy the M69HE Frag. It is very powerful, especially if they are in the open. You can also equip this as your primary support weapon, and your M67 Frag as your secondary support weapon. If you have an advanced backpack, you can equip a shotgun in the B Slot (optional).

, If you use a smoke grenade, you can obscure your path to the ledge and you can camp there. One of the most effective strategies in Death Room, this has fooled people for months. This is awesome in CTF too because you can see your own flag and monitor the whole area to see if it is being taken or not. If a protector comes up behind him, you can kill them both, especially if the person who has the flag is holding a knife; he can't attack you.

, It will slow you down and grenades from the opposite place of the corridor can land on you, and you can get damaged because you are slower with a heavy gun. Instead, use an assault rifle, preferably a G36E, since it has the scope and it has decent damage, fire rate, and recoil. If you guys are wondering where to use a machine gun, Junk Flea is the most effective, as well as a close range weapon in Snow Valley (L96A1 for long range weapon in backpack).

, They are most effective on your side of the door, again usually the right door, because they will go there to sneak up behind you into the corridor. People have gotten ultra kills with simple planting of mines like those. Also, your opponent can use up ammo just destroying mines, especially if he is low on ammo.

, In the corridor, it can be useful if people are bunched up, especially if they have been damaged by a previous ally. You only get 3 rockets, so be sure to use it wisely.


If non-elites request that you do not equip it, then you should do so, because there may be an Elite on the team that can kick you. Use a shotgun of you can but again, some people think they're cheap, and so forth do not allow it.

, Crouch (remember that you shouldn't crouch in this map? Well, this is the only exception) so they can only head-shot you. This will make it harder to hit, and it is OK if you are camping.

, What this means is that at the edges of the corridor has an open space for you to shoot. This means that you can shoot from above to a room below. You can also drop grenades, gas grenades (aka ""color"" grenades to newbies), and smoke grenades too. However, keep in mind that smoke grenades are allies for everyone, not just the person who threw it. The enemy can also use the smoke to obscure their soldiers. Keep in mind that you are still vulnerable, so when you do it once, make sure that you either do it somewhere else, or leave the edge all together.

,, Nothing he or she wears should be in neon colors, with the possible exception of bright, crystal blue for the ocean (remember, this is the fishing district). For athletic wear, you may use the above colors or camouflage colors (for the Hunger Games arena). Make the swimsuit an aquatic color. For sleepwear, regardless of the tribute's gender, use pajamas rather than a nightgown - District 4 tributes, being Career Tributes, would have clothing that is easy to move around in.

, Make her look like a younger version of the mother, except for a girly hairdo. Give her the girliest outfits possible (but make sure it matches.)

Choose the Sim's preferences.,
Make the name something a preteen would want.,
Try to make your Sim's traits very realistic!,
You can also make a preteen sim with a teenager.",How to Make a Preteen Sim in the Sims 3," Nowadays, preteens are really thin or on the overweight side. But if they're in the middle of both, it's best to choose either a little bit more towards the fat or thin side.;
, Most of the time, preteens don't care what color their clothes are (unless it's a girl and they're a tomboy or unless it's a super babyish color they don't like) it's more focused on what kind of colors THEY like and what kind of style the colors are on. Many preteen boys wear more athletic style gear, brand name clothing, or funny novelty tees or clothes that are based on their favorite video games/anime. The novelty tees are the same for girls.

, Make it any way you like, but not extremely curly (custom hair?) or completely perfect, because your preteen will look like a little toddler whose mother rules every part of her life and body! A good hair is the straight, shoulder-length hair. If possible, find a way to see if you can get highlights in the hair! Many preteens like highlights in their hair by the time they are in middle school in real life.

, Most preteens avoid slipping back into childhood and are more focused on things that prove how much more of a teen they look instead of looking like a child (in real life). Choose a plain pair of colored, thin sandals for girls. Try to add multiple colors, but not girlie ones unless they are have icons, designs, and pictures on the shoes (only if you're trying to achieve a tomboyish girl sim, some preteen girl Sims are very girly).

, Don't go overboard, many preteens in real life don't wear makeup.

, Make it as realistic as can be; don't overdo it, though!

, Make the likes very realistic. Stu Surprise may not be a good choice, but maybe foods like cheeseburgers, ice cream, French toast, and even sushi could be good. For favorite colors, red, black, brown, purple, green, and very similar colors are great choices.

, Names like Sarah, Missy (for young preteens), Leah, Courtney, Cassidy, Kayla, Megan, Alex,Sam,Dani, and Kristen/Kristin are excellent names for a preteen girl. For boys, Trey, Jake, Josh, Zach, Ryan, Cody, Kyle, Damien, and DJ are very good names to choose from! However, you could also go for sophisticated names, such as Isabelle, Cecilia, Robert, and others.

, Here are some recommended traits:


Couch Potato/Athletic.
Snob/Friendly.
Genius.
Flirty.

, In this case, try to make the Sim younger and less mature than a normal teenager.

Start a new game.,
Create your founder in Create-A-Sim.,
Place your founder.,
Play the legacy for ten generations!,
Understand the rules.",How to Make a Legacy on the Sims 3," You can use any neighborhood, including an already existing one, but you must switch to the Legacy family right away, and they have to stay active during the entire challenge. Also, you can't use any other neighborhoods after you've selected one.;
, You can't start out with pre-made Sims, or Sims downloaded from The Exchange on the Sims website. They can be male or female. You can use Custom Content if you want. Your Sim must be a Young Adult, an Adult, or an Elder (males only).

, The lot your founder will live in has to an empty lot, and cost at least §14,700. For example, in Riverview you would move into 345 Riverblossom Hills Drive, and in Sunset Valley you would move into 15 Summer Hill Court. The reason why it has to be so big, empty, and expensive is because your Sim will be living like this for a while, and further into the challenge as you get richer, you'll have a lot of space for a mansion.

, This is made up of several parts per generation. For a better explanation, the founder must have kids, and grandkids, and so on.


Fall in love. Simple and self explanatory. The only rules are the Sim your founder or heirs fall in love with can't be created by you, or downloaded from the exchange.
Have kid(s). This part is essential to the challenge. You are allowed to adopt Sims, but they won't count for the legacy. Adopted Sims can't be heirs, or earn any points. Also, all traits are random. If you have the ability to pick trait, click the dice in the upper right-hand corner to randomize the trait. Some players choose not to follow this rule, but it can make it a lot more interesting. You can use the birthday cake to age up your Sim only after you have gotten a notification that the Sim has a birthday coming up.
When the oldest child ages up to a Young Adult, pick an heir. The heir will carry on the legacy, and take the role that your founder did. After you pick the heir, any siblings must move out as soon as they can. The heir will stay in the household with their parents and repeat the process.

, In Legacies, sometimes strange or unexpected things happen. These guidelines will be a safety net when you don't know what to do about your situation.


Death. If your heir dies, switch to a spare. A spare is a sibling of the heir, who can take their place if they die. Continue playing as normally with your spare, but if you don't have a spare, the challenge ends. Also, you can't prolong your Sim's life with death flowers, life fruits, or cheats. This will be against the Legacy rules.
No cheating! This means not using any cheats or mods, produced by EA or by a third party to change your money, mood, or needs. The only exception to this rule is if a Sim or lot is glitching in a way that makes it impossible to complete the challenge. Also, the lifespan for Sims has to be set to the default.

When you name a Sim, you should make it sound like a nerdy name.,
Customize their looks.,

Nerdy houses are always old fashioned, and full of freaky gadgets that the Sims made themselves.,
Don't forget to make it high on the Science or Medical career options.",How to Make a Nerd on Sims 3,"


Try Gertrude, Matilda, Myrtle, Bernice, Edna, Loris, Ethel, Ida, or Beatrice for a female nerd.
Try Milton, Melvin, Eugene, Sheldon, Dexter, Albert (only included here because of Einstein), Egbert, Orville, or Poindexter for a male nerd.
A good way to find nerdy names for boys is to go to any US name popularity site, choose ""Most popular names in 1895,"" and look for any name below the top 10.;
, Side parted, flat hair looks great on nerd boys, and maybe a full fringe, with a thick headband would look good for a girl. Remember that nerds are clashy, and tend to put lots of busy patterns together. Slogan Tees have become a nerd choice.

, Some good Sims 3 traits for nerds include Bookworm, Computer Whiz, Genius, Loner, Neat, Perfectionist or Workaholic. If you have Ambitions installed, another trait you might use is Eccentric. Socially Awkward is another good trait to use when you have University Life installed.


If you want the nerd to be of the ""blow up the world"" variety, you might want to give them the Evil trait.

, Nerds tend to have a bookshelf in almost every room, and definitely some scientific stuff: Telescopes, computers, etc. You should also have some nerdy, educational posters around in your rooms too!

, Jump into every opportunity you are given. Work work work, and no play. Unless that's Chess you're playing!

, Give him either blond or red hair. Facial hair is up for grabs. Dress him in clothes that would fit the district. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Athletic, Loves the Outdoors, Artistic and Brave.

, Give her an elaborate hairstyle, and use the flashiest jewelry you can get. Give her a dress as her everyday outfit. Use the traits Family-Oriented, Athletic, Artistic, Neat and another of your choice.

, She, too, must have an elaborate hairstyle and the flashiest jewelry possible. Use subdued makeup (think Glimmer). Think what a District 1 tribute would wear to the Tribute Parade, and imitate that for her everyday outfit. Use the traits Athletic, Artistic, Snob (because she would be a Career Tribute) and either Mean Spirited or Evil.

, Remember, District 1 is the richest district, being right next to the Capitol. You may need to use ""motherlode"" several times for this.

,, This would be more District 4 than District 1.

,, A District 1 adult would be a businessperson making and selling jewelry and other luxury items.

, Name them whatever their name is, choose their skin complexion, and alter with the body weight and muscle sliders until it's just right. Also keep in mind their age. You DO NOT want to make Madonna as a child. However, it is best to do teen and young adult/adult celebrities.

, If you wish, you can access many Sims 3 Custom content sites have lovely and realistic hair that you can download. Make sure to take advantage of the new options within Sims 3 which help alter your Sims hair color to a greater extent. Make sure that you use the right color. You can also make fantasy hair, but the real thing is recommended. I would suggest using the highlights and roots to make the hair look as realistic as possible, try not to go too overboard though.

, It may be useful for you to start with the generic eyes, and then tweak them. I would suggest keeping a picture of the celeb handy so you can use it as a reference, you may also want to use more than one picture as well.

, Again, use pictures as references. Use eyeliner to make the eyes stand out. You are most likely to skip this step if you are creating a Male celebrity (although some Male celebrities may require make-up e.g. Marilyn Manson)

, It's best to create-a-style to help interpret the celebrities fashion sense. I used the white tank top and skinny pants to create a glamorous look for everyday. Use a wedding ring if they're married, and bangle bracelets, watches, and earrings to spice up the outfit. Everything else is self explanatory, except for the swimming. Use a good shape (always bikinis) and color it and pattern in. Add sunglasses as well. Also for teen athletics, wear the shoes that look like Converse. Males, suits look great, and wear the simple necklace when swimming.

, We need to check if your Sim is an actor/actress, musician, writer, etc. Make them artistic, definitely. Musicians are virtuosos, actors are party animals, and writers are bookworms. Although you can add much more personality traits aside from their profession.

, If you want, make a family for them so they don't get lonely. Teens need a family, some young adults need a husband/wife. For the children, make them pretty artistic and brave, and good looking, too.

, They need limo rides, correct? Open up the cheat bar and type in testingcheatsenabled true. Shift click your Sim's mailbox and select ""Careers"". Keep clicking ""More"" until you see the Music career or Athletic career. If you want your Sim to be in a black limo, select Athletic and click on the highest level. If you want a pink limo, select Music career and then select Rock Star and you have your very own limo! Please note that when your Celebrity Sim is supposedly going to any random place and they don't own a vehicle, they won't get in a taxi, they will get in their Limousine and drive to their destination in the limo. Same thing going home to their mansion.

Start by building a fence, measure two or three squares in from the edge of your building area. Select the white picket fence and build the fence right to the edge on the other side and again, two or three squares in. Copy this until you have a full square of a fenced area. Now, measure 1-3 squares in from the fence and select wall tool. Use the room wall tool and build a room big enough for a car/truck to go in. repeat this on the opposite side making sure they are identical and perfectly symmetrical. Now you build the kitchen. From the garage on the right-hand side, build a small room not much bigger than the garage. Make sure there is a recess between the two garages and the kitchen. This will later become the front garden. Now you build the dining room. This is going to be the same as the kitchen but bigger. From the kitchen to the left garage, build the room. Now you build the living room, make sure it is big enough! There you have the shell of your bottom floor.;
, You will be able to see the garages through the white grid. Build a room directly above each garage. These will be kid's rooms. Split the area between the kitchen and diner into a bathroom and a study. Build a small landing big enough for the width of a staircase. In the rest of the space left, build the master bedroom. In the far left corner of the room, build a small en-suite bathroom.

, I don't have the third floor but if you want, you can. I just built a roof, you can choose your own roof.

, On the outside wall, use masonry or stone. use the same stone for inside the garages. In the kitchen, use tiles for the wall. I use the black and white ones. In the dining room, use a pale paneling. In the living room, use a neutral tone of paint or paneling. In one kid's room, use pink paint. In the other kid's room, use blue paint. In the master bedroom, use whatever colors you want. In the en-suite bathroom and the bathroom use turquoise blue paint or wallpaper. In the study, use light gray paint.

, In the garages, use some kind of stone. In the kitchen, use Black or white floor tiles. In the dining room, use a deep color of the carpet, deep red is the best. In the living room use a fairly light wooden floor. In the pink room, use pink carpet. In the blue room, use blue carpet. In the study, use pure white carpet. In the bathrooms, use aqua floor tiles. In the landing, use the same wood as in the living room. In the master bedroom, use wood/carpet of your choice.

, Use plenty of windows per room. Use the windows that have a box of flowers on one side. Make sure when placing them you put the flowers on the outside. Use a good front and back door, make sure they are the same. Use a plain wooden door to all the rooms in the house. Place a picket gate opposite the front and back door.

, This is easy. Just use the room tool in buy mode. So it will have set for kitchen/bathroom/bedroom/etc. Just make sure all the colors match. Especially in the kid's rooms! One room must be completely pink and the other completely blue.

, Place the mailbox and bin either side of the front door. Use outdoor lights and place them all around the kitchen/diner/garage walls, leaving enough space for a small plant in between each one. Now place the pot plants in between each light. Go back to build mode and use cobblestone flooring to build a two square wide path from the door to the path. Also, build the path right around the perimeter of the whole house. In the back garden place a picnic table on either side of the back of the garage. Place a picnic on each table. Also, buy grills and place them near the picnic tables on each side of the house. Build a long swimming pool in the remaining space. Then click on the ""edit town"" above ""buy"".

, This will allow you to create Sims to live in the house.

Sims, child or older, can also direct the dog to guard the entire house. Dogs can guard: Pet bed, Pet house, Pet bowl, Plants you can harvest, Cat Condo, Parked Car and loads of other everyday objects.;
, If a non-household or low-long term relationship Sims or pets try to approach the guarded object, the dog will bark or growl. Sim generally back away from a guard dog, and coward Sims will flee. When commanded to guard the house dogs patrol around, barking at any Sims or dogs walking by, or any cars driving past.

, Burglars are actually more likely to try robbing the home, which is more fun because the dog is more likely to catch him in the act! Genius pets can sense the burglar from farther away, While clueless pets have a harder time noticing him unless he is right nearby. Aggressive pets will always catch the burglar, while lazy pets will often fall asleep and not notice.


If a guard dog detects the burglar, he runs up to the bad guy and barks. This wakes up the household Sims, who automatically call the cops. The burglar might freak out, run away or ignore the dog and steal something anyway. Otherwise the cops come and that is one less malefactor in Appaloosa Plains (or wherever), thanks to that valiant Guard dog!







, Getting them to guard expensive objects is recommended because burglars take the most expensive.

, Aggressive and loyal pets do better. If your Sims have guests around, they may try to hold the baby or toddler. On some occasions, other Sims take the baby. If your Sims do, and you don't want your baby lost, click the crib and select Command to Guard. Your pet should guard the baby.

, Sometimes, if your pet has a low relationship with other Sims or pets in the family, they go for them. They also chase cars going by sometimes. Since Mysterious Mr Gnomes cost loads, get pets to guard them. Burglars have a 45 percent chance of stealing them, so get pets to guard them.

, Each age span receives a certain amount of traits. Toddlers get 2, children get 3, teens get 4, and young adults, adults, and elder all get 5 traits. Baby and toddler traits can also be inherited from parents' genetics. If they grow up well, you will be able to choose a third trait when they grow up to be a child. A fourth trait may be attained if the child is grown up successfully to become a teen, and so forth.

, A Sim can't have opposite traits, such as good and evil or athletic and lazy. If you choose a trait such as ""dislikes children"", then ""family orientated"" would be grayed out. Also, if you want to have a relationship with another sim, it is harder to build the relationship up if they have contradicting traits

, Traits can also grant Sims different abilities or specific actions. Along with meat related foods, vegetarians can also cook vegetarian foods. If your Sim is hydrophobic, they would never be seen in a pool. In order to boost their social skills, insane Sims may have a conversation with themselves.

Teach your pets in Sims 3, all the valuable traits you want your pets to have.,
Reinforce these basic skills with other skills.,
Learn how to control your pet.",How to Train Your Pets on the Sims 3 Pets for PC," The training and Reinforcement your Sims gives your pets actually alters their traits (adding new ones and getting rid of others). A Piggy pet can learn to eat neatly. A noisy pet can learn to be quiet. With proper reinforcement, new traits can show up in the Simology tab. Traits that have been added though training have a thick green bored and when hovered over, it says '(trained)' underneath. Pets can have Variable traits depending on the reinforcement they receive.;
, Praise them for desired behavior, scold them for undesired behavior, click on your pet just after the action. If that action is reinforced, the reinforcement option will appear on the menu. Then choose whether to praise or scold your pet. The particular action you can praise or scold for appears on the choice.


Praising your pets bestows on the Praised moodlet, While scolding bestows in the Scolded moodlet. Both actions push the pets trait towards the desired behavior and against the undesired alternative. Scolded pets will not bark or bit Sims, chew on furniture or pee in the house. The Scolded moodlet with go away in a little while or if the dog is praised.







, Pets are fully controllable. Can't you just direct the pets to behave appropriately? Sure, you can do this. But the training mechanism provides a representation of the interactive relationship people have with their pets. Pets crave their guardians' love and approval, and will aim to please when properly directed. The autonomous behavior of a well trained pet will be more along the line of what you want. That means you can spend less time directing them and more time enjoying them!

The baby stage does not do much for a child's development, so if you want to, go ahead and buy a birthday cake and make the child age up into a toddler.",How to Raise a Perfect Child in Sims 3 Without Cheating2," The most common way is in a bed by having them both 'relax' and then clicking the other Sim and the 'try for baby' option. Make sure your sound is up so that you can listen for a jingle. If you hear a jingle, then your Sim is pregnant but she doesn't know it yet. The next day, depending what time you tried for baby, she will know she's pregnant and get the 'Pregnant!' moodlet., Read the two pregnancy books 'Totally Preggers: An expecting mother's tale,' and 'Baby Incoming: Preparing With Vigilance,' and seek medical advice at the hospital. It also helps to find a doctor (In Sunset Valley, go to Jamie Jolina) and ask for advice.The harder you try for a smooth pregnancy, the more likely it will be that you get to choose it's traits. Though it is not a guarantee, have the mother eat 3 watermelons to improve the chances of having a girl, and three apples to improve the chances of having a boy., It is also beneficial to give it traits like ""Workaholic"" or specific job traits like ""Handy"" or ""Good Cook"" to prepare for future careers.

Never hire a babysitter; they make things worse. For example, they often turn the stereo on while the baby is trying to sleep, or randomly take the baby out of the crib and put them back while ignoring the fact that they are hungry/their nappy is dirty.

Choose the right traits.,
Have a Sim stay up late.,
Put an alarm near every door.,
Put away your valuables.,
Delete the doors.,
Erase the robber from existence.",How to Prevent a Robber From Stealing Your Possessions on Sims 3," The ""Lucky"" trait decreases the chance of a robbery happening on your Sim's lot. The ""Brave"" trait allows a Sim to fight a robber and chase them away before they can steal anything.;
, Robberies can only occur when every Sim in your household is asleep. If one of your Sims stays awake into the early morning and sleeps during the day, you will be robbery-free. Robbers normally show up between 2 AM to 4 AM, so, if possible, stay away until after 4 AM.

, They will go off automatically when a robber enters the house, summoning the police and scaring the robber so they won't steal anything (if they haven't already). The alarm is called ""Thief-Tech's Gotcha! Alarm"" and can be found in ""Buy"" mode.

, In ""Buy"" mode, look for a tab that looks like a box. This is called the ""Family Inventory,"" and it's a good place to store anything you don't want stolen.


Note that you can't enter Build or Buy mode when a robber is already on your lot.

, Put the outside doors into the Family Inventory or sell them when your Sim goes to bed. This will prevent a robber from entering the house. However, you should call the police right away; if you don't, the robber will just lurk around outside.

, If the robber is on your lot and it's too late to do anything about it, you can resort to cheats if you really want to. Hold down Control, Shift, and C (this will make the cheat screen appear), then type in testingcheatsenabled true. Hit enter, then click on the robber while holding Shift and select ""Object,"" then ""Delete It.""


Note that this will not work on very early versions of The Sims 3. Make sure your game is updated.

When you find out your Sim is pregnant, start building a bedroom for the baby.,
When the baby is born, feed it, change their diaper, and put them in a crib, keep up with it's needs.,
When your baby ages up to a toddler, potty train them, and teach them to walk and talk.,
Give your toddler plenty of attention.,
When your toddler becomes a child, they can do almost everything by themselves.,
Keep in mind that if a child, toddler, or baby isn't fed properly, the social worker will come and take him/her away.

,
When your child becomes a teen, they can be in a relationship, and get a part-time job to earn Simoleons.,
When your teen becomes a young adult, they can get a full-time job, have children, buy their own house, and get married.",How to Raise a Child in Sims 3," The ideal items to put in the room are a crib, a teddy bear, a toy box, a potty chair, a toy xylophone, a shapes box, a high chair and (if your floor is wooden) a rug. Also make sure the pregnant mother reads a pregnancy book, and stays healthy and relatively happy during pregnancy. If she has back pains, try to make sure she gets a massage.Also, try to have your babies room on the first floor so it can crawl around with no steps.;
, If the mother's pregnancy went well, you should have been able to pick the baby's traits or at least the baby should have positive traits. If he/she has bad traits, go into the cheat bar by pressing ctrl+shift+C, and type in testingcheatsenabled true. Shift-click on the baby and click 'modify traits for active Sim'. Give baby desired traits.

, It also helps if they gain skills with the shapes box or the xylophone. If you do this, you will be able to pick your child's traits when they age up!

, This also plays a big part in getting good traits/getting to pick them.

, They will make friends, go to school and go to places like the pool, the library and the graveyard alone. However, they cannot handle Simoleons until they become teen and have a part time job. They have a set curfew and will be lectured if they stay out. This is a good time for your Sim to have more children. If your child is successful in school, you should be able to pick their traits, so make sure they do their homework and go to school happy!

,, They will still have a curfew and will get lectured if they're out past it, like before.

, This is when your parents have no control over them, and when their children move out, miss their child and will sometimes cry.

If you have Showtime, you can give the husband the Singer career, and the wife the acrobat career.

, Suggested jobs are Military, Professional Sports, Journalism, Business, Political, Law Enforcement, and, if you have Ambitions, you could give her the Firefighter, Investigator, Inventor, or Ghost Hunter careers. Don't get her into the Culinary or Criminal careers, though.


If you have Showtime, you can select the Acrobat career for the wife.

, Make a tomboy sister and a young brother who is a bit of an outcast.

Traits suggested for the girl are like Athletic, Loves the Outdoors, and Vehicle Enthusiast. Alternatively, you can give one of her mothers traits.






For the young boy, give him traits such as the Coward, Over-Emotional, and Loner traits. (Those traits are ideal for loners or outcasts, but you don't have to choose the three of them if you don't want to.

Don't forget that the point of this challenge is to have fun: Don't forget that these rules aren't set in stone.",How to Play a Sims 3 Wishacy," It is best to create a Sim with the ""family-oriented"" trait. Then you will have more of a chance of your sim wishing to have a child so they will be able to continue their bloodline.;
, Select or build a house. This is completely open to the player's preference. Any lot type/house will do as long as it is within the ""starting budget"" without any money cheats.

, The two main ways to play a wishacy is either the ""strict"" way (only able to promise/fulfill wishes that are more than one that is already there i.e., four wishes are promised but one of them is worth 150 lifetime happiness points and your Sim generates one worth 300 lifetime happiness points. You would be able to replace the 150 wish with the 300 wish) or the ""lenient"" way (you can promise any wish that you want and get rid of any wish that you want as long as you always have four wishes promised).

, After you fulfill their lifetime wish you can either give them 24 Sim-hours of your complete control (i.e., even though your Sim doesn't wish to marry someone, you make them marry someone anyway) or you can give yourself complete control for the rest of their lives.

, However, since Sims generate their first wishes when they become children, the heir can only become ""valid"" or ""playable"" when he/she becomes a child. After they age up to children take over them and start early on those wishes!

, Do what you want with your playtime and your Sims!

, Check that everything is correct; if there is something not mentioned, you can adjust it however you like.

, You will have three Sims in total: a human male young adult, a ghost (gender does not matter on this one) young adult, and a human female (age does not matter).


The human male: This will be the main character. You can only play as the other Sims one day a season. Give him normal hair, just as you would see on an everyday person. Give him average clothes and make him a little fat. With his personality, you give him two traits that in your mind are bad, and two traits that are good, according to you. Then randomly pick the last trait.
The ghost will be the main Sim's ""imaginary friend"". It will be a ghost, so appearance does not matte. All that matters with this Sim is their personality. They must have the friendly trait and the loner trait. Pick one trait for him and the other traits will be randomized.
The female human: This will be a roommate of the main Sim. Give her the first name that is similar to one of your friend's names. Give her the last name of a famous person. Make her hair dyed, give her lots of jewelry, but make her shirt and pants low quality. Her traits must include ambitious, natural-born performer, and hot-headed. If the age you picked for her does not allow one of these, pick something close to any of these traits. If there is one more trait slot left, randomize it. If there are two left, put one trait of the friend that you chose the name from, then for the second one, put a trait of the celebrity you picked for her last name.;
, Instead, buy an empty lot with your remaining money. Build a small basement on the lot and put stairs leading into it in the basement.

,
Buy an all-in-one bathroom. If you can't, then this is the only time you can cheat money in.
Put a cheap fridge in. That will be the only thing giving your Sim food.
Only one lamp is allowed in the house.


That is the only furniture you can put in until you have 15,000 Simoleons.







, Then put whatever you want in it.

, The male Sim can get any occupation he wants. The ghost cannot have a job. The female must have a profession and not a job.

, The Sims are only allowed to have one each. The male will be able to choose any of his choice. The ghost will have to get something to help its skills or needs. The female will have to get mermadic kelp or friend of the Kraken (Beware if you don't have a big body of water, the friend of the Kraken reward won't help you).

, You can only take in strays if you are still living in the cellar.


If you want an alien for a pet, the only way you can get one is by being romantic interests with them, then you can make them your roommate; or cheat them into your household.

, You may get the pet a food bowl, bed and one toy.

, The male can get married and have as many kids as he likes. The ghost can get married but he must leave the household if he gets engaged. The female can get married but not have kids.

, If a Sim dies, you must kick out the ghost and be on your own; after that, you get a life. Once the ghost leaves you can do whatever you want; it's all up to you as this means that your Sim has finally gotten a life."

,  This works especially well if the name was an occupational name.  For instance, Tanner, Draper, Fletcher, Archer, Hunter, Porter, Parker, Fletcher, Thatcher or Tucker are strong choices.

,  Examples are Cody, Colton, Lane, Wyatt, Butch and Casey.

Think formal.",How to Make a Tomboy on the Sims 3 Without a Mod," If you are aiming for a toddler, pick any style with any (natural) colour, except for the one on the hat and hair accessories list, that shows longish girly hair tied up in lots of different parts. Even as it is tied up, tomboys would not normally wear it all girly like that. But if you are aiming for a child, either pick the hair on the hats and hair accessories menu that is tied up simply, or any short hair that you can find. Any naturally human hair colours can be used.;
, Editing the t shirts sure help a lot. Pick a t shirt, a long sleeve top or a hoodie, not a dress or whatever. Then, scroll down to the right-hand-bottom-corner where there is a paint pallet. Click on that. Once you are on that menu, click on the box that will say misc. on it, and click on the word that says 'themes' and scroll down until you find the designs near the bottom of the page. The race car design is probably the best for a tomboy, but you can pick any boys design that you want. If you have a child and you can't be bothered to edit anything, then go onto where the main designs are, and on the first line there are some unisex t shirts. You can pick any of these, and the line with the long sleeves too, if you want.

, When picking the pants I would recommend picking shorts, but it is up to you. But whatever you do, do not pick a skirt. I would say that the light-brown shorts on the child's menu are the best option, but you can pick any you like if they are not pink or purple. The same with toddlers, too.

, Edit a t shirt so that it looks boyish, I.e the blue skull design and chuck on a blue or white diaper if it is a toddler. If it is a child though, do the same thing with the shirt but because you can't put a child in a diaper (obviously) then pick a pair of blue or grey really short shorts on and you're done.

, Toddlers can't wear swimwear, but children can. Go onto the place where they keep the one-pieces, click on any one, then go onto edit mode. Turn it black, blue, red, or green. Then you should be done.

, Do the same sort of thing that you did for the everyday outfits, unless more formal.

, You'll need to get past about four different advertisement title screens to get to begin the game, each time you load the program on your computer. It may take about 30 seconds to load.

, At first, you'll see several pre-designed areas; these can be used as a tutorial that you may click through to test out the features of SimCity 4. If you want to select a different region, this may be done from the options at the top of the screen.

Build your city away from the center of the map. Never start your city in the middle of the map as this may lead to complications with boundaries later on in game. Try starting with Industrial Zones in one of the corners of the building zones. One major power conductor and the rest can be for production.







, Although Timbuktu - the default region loaded onto SimCity 4 - has some worthwhile areas and can be helpful for training/tutorials, it's not for everyone, so you may wish to pick a new area.

, This area looks like part of a globe centered near Europe.

, From this menu, you can also delete areas with the ""Delete Region"" option (but be careful as deleting regions should only be done on personal regions you created to keep to continuity across all platforms from computer-to-computer).

, Along with Timbuktu, you also have 5 other regions to load, including a close-to real-life representation of Berlin, Fairview, London, New York and San Francisco - devoid of all buildings though.

,, Although the region change isn't instantaneous, you'll know that the change has occurred when the area focuses on the center of the new region, and the new region name appears at the bottom left corner of the screen in the region name box, which could take up to a minute later after you select the different region.,,, Click the corresponding radio checkbox.

,,, Not all cities need to be terraformed any further to be started. You can still play your city in Mayor mode without terraforming the terrain.


By terraforming, you are essential beginning each game in God mode and won't start real city-building until entering Mayor mode. However, this is a great way to remove unneeded trees (as you'll see later), without paying a single cent out of your Sim-money.

, The terraform tool has a tree on it. You can raise, lower or level the terrain here by clicking, holding down and dragging your mouse across the area that needs these actions performed after you select the exact tool you require.


With raising the terrain, you can form mountains, hills, mesas, steep hills and cliffs. Raising it above sea level will create this hills, valleys, mountains and the like.






With lowering the terrain, you can form valleys, steep valleys, canyons, shallow valleys, craters and shallow canyons. Lower it too far, and you'll reach ground water, which will cause a new river or body of water to form.






Leveling will clear away the unneeded trees in the area, but the tool provides large amounts of land space, so don't ask for only a small area to fix. When leveling off the terrain, you can choose between such effects called creating plateaus, softened terrains, quick level brush, create plains and erosions - most of which remove unneeded trees without paying a single penny out of the city coffers.







, All these can become impediments to building, so avoid overuse of these two tools; once you start building your city, you won't be able to remove the flora and fauna you've added without spending money.


For fauna, you can set horses, woodland animals and wild animals free in your city.







, This Terrain tool which looks like an imaginary cloud blowing into the air. It includes an erode tool, smoothen tool, raise terrain and lower terrain level tool. Clicking the tool then clicking an releasing on map will terraform the area without much pressure applied.

, Click the icon that looks like a picture-frame border and click the Accept button to accept the dialog box that results. Reconcile edges when the terrain elevation changes and need to be reset.

, You have the power to create disasters as well as to control the day/night cycle of your game (covered later in this article).

, Click the icon that looks like a top hat with mayor wand to begin. This button can be found near the bottom left corner of the game screen.

, You can either choose to use your real name or a fake mayor name or use the default values for the names of ""New City"" and ""Defacto"".

, Easy, at first, will be understandable for most, but as you climb through Medium, the difficulty level will get harder (mostly because you'll start off earning less money). With Hard you'll get more money but through Sim-bonds that need to be paid back over time.

,, Although trees help in real world cases, in SimCity, trees and rubbish are a nuisance and must be bulldozed/demolished. The bulldozer icon is your demolish tool; and much like building click and drag roads or click the icon that represents the building and watch it implode and fade away into oblivion. If it has no trees or rubbish, get used to the placement, as you might need this tool later to demolish a building of some sort when needed.

, Although each land is different, you can set up shop next to a river, or on dry land near the cities border, or on the top of a mountain peak; as long as the size is big enough, you can place your first power plant directly there.


Some areas come with their drawbacks, such as having to run a power line down to the areas underneath (such as from the top of a mountain) or near a river (making sure that you aren't touching a river as the game will say that this procedure can't be completed by the red zoned tiles as you move the item around on the waterfront).

, Choose the power option from the left siderail of options to begin, and click ""Build Power Options."" Then select one of the power plant choices. No zones will begin to construct until they have been powered. At first, you'll only have four choices including: wind, natural gas, coal and oil plants. Each have their own pros and cons in terms of pollution and price and amount of power output.


Later, as your population grows, you will get other power plant choices such as solar, nuclear and hydrogen plants. Also, you'll receive other power plant types as you level-up and receive them in your Rewards list too, so watch out for these as well.
Later, if you don't have zones sitting next to each other, you'll need to build power lines for these zones. Zones (which will be discussed later) have their own underground imaginary power lines, but must be connected to the power grid via power lines if they are not touching the power plant directly within a one block-zoning distance.

, RCI stands for residential, commercial and industrial. It designates how much of each type of the three zones your Sims are requiring you to build (or dezone when the line goes below the neutral zone). Green stands for residential, blue stands for commercial and yellow stands for industrial. This meter will always be displayed, no matter what options you have selected, and can be found to the left of the charts at the bottom of the screen.


As your city wants more of the zone, you'll see the meter's column rise. If your city has too much of a certain zone type, you'll see the zone dip below the center; at this point, just hold off, since your Sims will need them later on (just don't build more if the line dips south). Be careful that you don't have the speed set to pause; otherwise once you've zoned some land and your RCI meter doesn't move, when you unpause it your Sims will be unhappy because you've zoned way, way too much or you will be out of your Sim mayorship job early.
This meter is an integral part of your gameplay and should be monitored very often.

, You'll find this near the bottom center of your screen. It will give you a general idea how much money you have available to be able to purchase items for zoning (RCI) and placing (such as police, fire, etc.) later.

, Once you place a power plant, your zones tool will open. You can also open the zoning tool manually by clicking the tool that looks like a bunch of colored boxes inside an oval. Select the green tool, select the density level (discussed later), click and drag to place the item, and release to begin the build of these zones. Residential zones are where your Sims will live.

, Your commercial zones are where your Sims will shop, and are colored blue when they are unbuilt but are zoned.

, These zones are where your Sims have jobs (SimCity doesn't call these places by the generic term ""work"" but if you want on the outside, you can call it that), and are colored yellow when they are unbuilt but are zoned.


As you'll learn later, there are three main densities of industrial zone. However, with industrial, Maxis/EA Games replaced the term ""low-density industrial"" with the term ""agricultural industrial,"" which has its own zone limitations in terms of maximum block zoning sizes. Generally, this kind of zone requires several blocks next to each other to begin.

, There are three densities including low, medium and high density. Although each will bring in more money and population, as the density gets higher, your cost to build them will also increase and thereby decrease more of your Sim-spending cash per tile.

, If you accidentally zoned a piece of land that shouldn't have been zoned, you can dezone the area using the dezone tool that is specifically set for that type of zone.


You can't use the industrial dezone tool to dezone a commercial zone, you can't dezone a commercial zone using a residential dezone, but you can use a industrial dezone to dezone a industrial zone, etc. (It's a 1-to-1 relationship of types of zones to their dezone tool.)
In SimCity 4,the fees to dezone these zoning tiles costs a lot less than in real life. However, if construction has already started on the zone, you can't use a dezone tool; it has to be bulldozed instead (which can cost Sim money).
If you dezone or bulldoze a zone later in the game, you'll need to know what direction your zones are heading to ensure your Sims don't complain that they aren't being blocked off from the different transportation routes.

, Your transportation tool is set into several subtypes which have several selections to choose from. On top of streets and roads, you also have highways, and avenues, bus stations, rail stations, subways and lots of other transportation elements that will get your Sims from place-to-place, all while trying to avoid traffic congestion.


Sometimes when zoning an area, zones will create the lowest level of transportation from the transportation options given to you: the street. While you may build roads where streets were once used (you can build right on top of the existing street without bulldozing) and add other transportation elements, you'll need to spend more money to replace and keep up with your roads.
Roads (which look like a two-lane roadway) have several selections you can choose from, including roads, one-way roads, avenues (toll booths can be placed later on these road types thereby increasing your funds available by a little), and streets (road-type placed within RCI zones occasionally).






Highways and ramps (cloverleaf onramp icon) can consist of ground level highways, elevated highways, ground highway cloverleaves, elevated highway cloverleaves, ground highway t-intersection, elevated highway t-intersection, ground highway overpass-onramp, elevated highway overpass onramp, ground highway side onramp, and elevated highway side onramp.






Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.


Rails and depots (which have an icon that looks like the front of a steam locomotive) include rails, passenger train stations, freight train stations, grand railroad stations, monorail and monorail stations.






The miscellaneous transportation options consist of bus stops, elevated rail, elevated rail station, subway-to-elevated transition, subway, subway station, public parking garage and toll booths.






Airports (which look like a jet-airline icon) can consist of small landing strips, small municipal airports and small international airports. In SimCity 4, these are no longer their own zonable areas consisting of red zones but are now their own bulldozable areas. Both airports and seaports reflect the industrial line of your RCI meter when they have been built.






Water transportation methods (ferry boat at a dock icon) include passenger ferry terminals, car and passenger ferry terminals, seaports and a marina. Both airports and seaports reflect the industrial line of your RCI meter when they have been built. Though seaport zones are trickier to initially place, they can built.






Although once easy to construct, bridges over water can be built, but only using the Roads tool (unlike the common Streets your zones will initially put out.

, Watch your maps for crime, fire and health care. Your civic tools tool looks like a mayor house/capitol building and has several options and sub-options of these including options of: police, fire, education, hospitals and health, landmarks, rewards and parks.


Police (which look like a police badge icon) consist of police kiosks, small police stations, large police station, deluxe police stations and city jails.






Fire (fireman's hat icon) consist of small fire station, large fire station, and fire department landing strips.






Educational systems (which look like a graduation cap and diploma icon) include elementary school, large elementary school, local branch library, high school, large high school, city museums, city college, university, major art museum and a main library.






Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.


Hospitals and clinics (which look like a body helix icon) include medical clinic, large medical center, and a disease research center.






Landmarks are so diverse, they can't all be displayed here. Look through the pages-upon-pages of icons to display what choices are available to you. Landmarks are only decorative pieces that can increase tourism - and thereby some population - but can bring a mixed bag of results as to your residential and commercial zones in the RCI meter.






Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.


Rewards will sometimes be displayed in the Rewards menu as you level up. But to ensure you don't look to quantity over quality, these won't be discussed here. It will start with a Mayor's House as the first reward earned, but will escalate from there.






Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.


Parks (which look like trees and bench icon) include open paved areas, open grass areas, small park greens, community gardens (4 different designs each costing the same price), beach, small flower gardens, basketball court, playground, gazebo, ranger station, small plaza, tennis court, medium park green, medium flower garden, medium playground, skateboard park, medium plaza, large flower garden, large park green, soccer field, softball field, large plaza, marina (different than the marina in water transport), farmers market (city needs to include some agricultural population and agricultural zones, minor league stadium, opera house, tourist trap, city zoo and a major league stadium.






Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.



, Your choices can be found within the Utilities tool with an icon that looks like the top of a water tower. You'll have to hook up the pipes into a water tower and water pump. You can also include a water treatment plant and (when your population grows large enough) into a large water pump.


Always start with a small water tower, which should be enough to fill your city with water to all the tiles on the map. However, split this water line out to all other areas of the map, by clicking the Water Pipes and draw pipes (using a click and drag), out from the water tower out so the area in question can be full of a bluish color water icon. Return to the above-ground map, by clicking another icon from any of the other services in Mayor mode from the left hand side of the screen.

, You can include landfill zones (zoned in brown though it doesn't make the RCI meter), recycling centers, and waste-to-energy plants. For this, you'll have it's own dezone tool.

, The feedback bar will help give you a general idea of how well your mayorship is performing for you. This gives you a general idea of how well you are managing their needs.To include this image to your article, simply copy and paste the following wikitext:, You'll also be able to see what other things you can obtain as they come on the market.

, You should be able to see your City Opinion Poll area-chart open before you even begin looking at building your city.


Understand that just to the right of most of these charts, you'll find a upward pointing arrow. This arrow will allow you to customize your city even more than the initial view. This arrow is especially useful when it comes to needing to customize the look of your buildings as well as reading and customizing your budget (as you'll learn about later).

, You'll need to expand this area of your charts after selecting the icon that looks like a power line and a line chart; this setting will allow the game to automatically change the look of your buildings (within your Residential, Commercial and Industrial zones) every 5 SimYears or so, or keep it on one single style upon the build year. You have these choices:


Chicago 1890
New York 1940
Houston 1990
Euro-Contemporary (not checked by default upon first load).

, Once you check an item, a colored overlay on the map will show (the hue and color of colors will differ dependent on which view you pick). You can choose one of sixteen views to see how your Sims feel you are doing. There are many you can choose from including: fire hazards, crime, education, water, power and lots of great data among the many others. This sheet has an icon that looks like a scattered plot chart.

, You can choose to view your outlook with your city planner, finance advisor, utilities advisor, public safety advisor, health and education advisor, transportation advisor or environmental advisor. These advisors might sometimes tell you nothing more than what's already been said in the scrolling news-bar headlines (which can be clicked to grab slightly extended stories). Look for the icon that looks like a person's face-to-chest profile.

, Although these graphs have more extended amounts of data than Data View (as you learned above), this graph doesn't help as much to show you how each individual citizen thinks you stack up on potential issues. You can find this icon that looks like a line chart to begin.

, Click the swirly icon near the center of the screen and click the ""up"" arrow to view. Click the item's options and adjust by moving sliders as you see fit.

, All cities open with this chart open as a default option, but if they were changed to view the budget info, you may have to change this info back. If you find this info never changing and you are expecting an imminent reward or level change, you may want to see what's holding things up.

, Select the ""..."" to open your list of menu options. Another bar will float onto the screen to the right of this ""..."" button.


Save your game progress every few hours of creating the city or until you need to take a break. Open the menu and click the ""floppy disc icon"" - Click OK to the box that displays saying your city has been saved.

, Although exiting the simulation is triggered to know just how far you want to leave, you don't have too many options. The next two options you'll have in the list is to ""Exit to Region"" or to ""Quit"" the program entirely.

Alternatively, place flammable objects near a fireplace, and have the Sim stoke the fireplace repeatedly. Sims on fire for one game hour die and become red ghosts.


Some Sims have hidden traits that allow them to survive three hours on fire. Firefighters cannot be killed by fire.
The expansions add many, many other ways to start fires. These are not listed below, since they don't give any unique results.;
, Have a Sim with low Handiness attempt to repair or upgrade an electric device several times. The first accident will ""singe"" the Sim, and the second will kill him if the singed moodlet is still active. Increase the odds by standing in a puddle, and trying to repair expensive, complex devices. Your Sim's ghost will be yellow.


A Sim with the Handy trait cannot die this way. A Sim with high handiness is unlikely to die this way.
The Sim needs at least 1 Handiness to have the option to tinker.

, Remove fridges, oven, stove and phone so that your Sim has no way of getting food. You could also wall your Sim up in a room. After about 48 game hours, the Sim will die and turn into a purple ghost.

, Pools were infamous in earlier Sims games, since the Sims wouldn't climb out if you removed the ladder. They've become smarter in Sims 3, so you'll need to build a wall around the pool edge instead. Drowned Sims leave behind a blue ghost.

Make the Grim Reaper your neighbor.,
Abuse the Cow Plant.",How to Kill Your Sims in Sims 32," With World Adventures installed, explore the Al Simhara tombs and look inside sarcophagi to awaken mummies. Let the mummy catch your Sim, and there's a chance that it will curse you (adding a moodlet). It will take two whole game weeks for your Sim to die, but you get a cool white ghost haunted by a black cloud.


Sims with good martial arts skills can fight the mummy off, avoiding the curse.
There are several ways to end the curse, but most are hard to do by accident. Avoid meditation, time travel to the past, unicorn blessings, snake kissing, and sleeping in sarcophagi.

, There's only a tiny chance of this happening, but you can increase the odds by using a telescope outdoors.If you hear ominous music and see a shadow, rush the Sim with a death wish to that spot. The ghosts of meteor victims are orange like fire victims, but also smolder with black sparks.


If you also have the Seasons expansion and control an alien, the alien can summon meteors.
Meteors never fall on children, ghosts, or aliens, but those Sims can run toward the meteor impact site to die.

, Surprisingly, vampires in the Sims 3 can survive sunlight. The only special death they get is their version of starvation, death by Thirstiness. After about two days without Plasma, the vampire will turn into a red ghost with a beating red heart, and get a bat-shaped tombstone.


To become a vampire, look for NPC Sims with neck tattoos and bright eyes. (You'll get a ""Hunted"" moodlet when one is nearby.) Become acquaintances with the vampire and choose ""Ask to Turn"" while interacting.

, Each rant has a chance of attracting the Grim Reaper. The first time gets you a warning, shown by a moodlet. Keep ranting about death while the moodlet is active, and the Reaper won't be gentle next time.

, This is another easy death in the University Life expansion. Open the bed, put the Sim on it, and close it. Squish.


This might take a couple tries.

, Shake the vending machine repeatedly. Each time you shake it, there's a chance it will fall and crush your Sim. All worth it for the free soda.

, Send your Sim on the Magician career, and entertain the crowds with your suicide. Actually, the Box of Danger is surprisingly safe, but the Buried Alive and Watery Escape tricks have a small chance at death.


Skilled magicians and lucky Sims may try the trick hundreds of times without dying. Since these are hidden traits, it's hard to predict how likely a Sim is to die this way.

, This is the only death that leaves behind a new piece of furniture: a golden statue of your Sim! Fulfill enough wishes to cash in for the Philosopher's Stone lifetime reward, then transmute everything you can find into gold. Each touch includes a small chance of killing yourself.

, Add a Magic Jelly Bean Bush to your house and keep using it. There's a 5% chance your Sim will be set on fire or electrocuted, plus a 1% chance of a special jellybean death. This death leaves a purple ghost with blue hair.

, Each time a witch casts a haunting curse on another player, there's a chance it backfires and kills them. This can only happen once your witch reaches a certain level of power, so keep on practicing that spellcasting.

, You'd think an island paradise would be death-free, but you'd be wrong. Sims can drown or starve while scuba driving, and even get killed by a shark if they don't find a place to hide. Mermaids can die by spending too much time on land, but a nearby Sim might splash water on the mermaid to save her life.

, The Into the Future expansion introduces two additional ways to die. Flying a jetpack too long comes with a high chance of crash, which may or may not kill the Sim. Using a time machine can cause the Time Paradox Sickness moodlet, leading to Do I Even Exist? and Blinking Out of Existence. Finally, the Sim can disappear completely... sometimes along with their descendants!

, This form of death requires the ""Door of Life and Death"" from the Sims store. Knock on it to greet Death and challenge him to a guitar contest. Fail, and meet the deadly Pit Monster!, One of the weirdest ways to die involves the Cow Plant from the Sims Store. Scold the plant and let it sit there without food for a few days. Eventually, it will offer your Sim a slice of cake, then eat you if you try to take it.

, Ask them their Zodiac sign and ask if they're single. Compliment them. That makes them feel in the mood. Flirt a little bit. Make sure all these actions are done with your 2 Sims alone so other Sims won't come in and laugh. Now use a pick up line and then confess attraction. This will give them romantic ideas.


Hold hands and if you're controlling either the male or female sim, have one of them give the other a shy kiss. If it's late make them stay over. When they're happy have the guy propose. Keep going steady, this makes them BF and GF doing any romantic interactions until it reaches extremely irresistible.

, Basically keep it up and then ask the guy to propose marriage have a wedding how you like.

, This doesn't always work your female Sim might be pregnant if after the woohoo she is nauseous or has pregnant moodlet.

, And get time of work prepare a nursery (If there's only one baby coming.) Two or more if one parent has the fertility lifetime reward.

, If you specifically want a girl, have the mother eat lots of watermelons while pregnant. If you want a boy, have her eat a lot of apples.

, Give her a makeover and do her wishes.

, Watch kid programs read pregnancy books, listen to kid zone and spend lots of time with her partner whether in the nursery or at a swanky restaurant make him give her support and the male Sim HAS to do the housework, but still be romantic with his wife.

, Lots of people will scream ""The baby!"".

, Give it a name you like. If the pregnancy went well you get to pick 2 traits- one from father and one from mother.

, This gives the child a negative moodlet and they won't like it when they're being it in the middle if this occurs leave the child with the parent that she had a higher relationship with.

So is you have four people in your family you can afford a bigger house than 1 person on their own. You will have a choice of a furnished house or a non furnished house. If you click the furnished house it will cost more and you might get ugly furniture. If you go with non furnished you will save money and you will have to furnish the other rooms (except the kitchen and bathroom, but if you are up for the challenge you can redo those rooms). You might want to get a car or bike. If you buy a car you will have to buy a parking place, if you buy a bike you will have to buy a bike rack. Or you can just take the taxi.

, When you create your Sims, let's say you made a girl and her name is Kathy, Kathy will have a lifetime wish based on her traits. Let's say you chose Kathy's lifetime wish to be a Super Star Athlete. That means you can go to the stadium and get her that job, or you can get her a part time job at the grocery store, the bookstore, the day spa, or the mausoleum.

",How to Have a Brilliant Party in Sims 3," You could pay more for exclusive access; this is especially good when you don't want anyone else to show up at public events. Make sure to pick a good location! A few suggestions are the community park, pool, or dance club (for Sims 3 Late Night users)

, Inviting co-workers can also help a lot with your job. The more the merrier!

, You can either cook it yourself beforehand or you could buy a buffet bar. Keep in mind that to serve food on a buffet bar, it costs 250 Simoleons; however, the buffet bars serve nice quality foods like autumn salad, turkey, and cookies. If you want, you could buy a bar and make drinks, or hire a bartender to tend it for you (for Late Night users)

, When the guests arrive, you let him/her make music. Most sims like having music around them.


If you're not having any musical Sim in your household, you should buy a stereo. This will also give you some music at which your guests can dance and jam!







, It will help to prepare a few hours in advance. You're not going to be able to pull off a good party if your Sim is tired all night.

, The more you talk with them, the more fun they will have.

, Use the Make My Sim Know Everyone cheat to make sure it reaches everyone.;
, Choose something cute or flirty.

, When they start arriving, lead them all in. Flirt shamelessly with any boy or girl you cross.

, If so, know your and every other Sims' limits. Some will party forever, others will leave after the first song.

, You must do this unless you want to wake up and find everyone dancing again.

, A bath is preferable as it relaxes your Sim more.

, You might not, but cram a few more things in as you may throw up.

, This is vitally important if you don't want your Sim to die.

, Cleaning up the damage consists of the following:

Shoo everyone, and I mean everyone out. If they refuse, kick them out or kill them. It's better to just kick them out but you can kill them if you don't want to see them again.






Repair any appliances, etc., that have been broken. You may need a bit of money for this.






Generally clean up.






Clean yourself. Take a bath, eat, read, sleep, whatever relaxes your Sim. Get them in the best mood possible. Make sure they can go to the toilet if they need to vomit. Brush your teeth after vomiting.

, Notice in the top left corner of your screen, it will say, ""*name here* thinks that *name here* is being flirty""After the first kiss and the romantic music, you can click on the Sim, then ""Romantic"", and choose whatever kind of romantic action that you want.

,, After they are both relaxing side-by-side, there will be an option saying ""Try For Baby"". When relaxing, click on the other Sim and you will see it. There is about an 80% chance of getting pregnant. The only way to know for sure is if you hear the baby chimes. Once you hear those the mating will be done.

, She won't be able to go into a hot tub or skinny dip, and many other things. After she gives birth, she will go back to normal.

, Their needs will also be very weak. The second day, they will change into their maternity clothes. You can go to the mirror able change the clothes. They will only wear them until they give birth. The third day is when their stomach gets a big bump. The fourth day their bump will be bigger.

, This mostly happens around the time that you mated her in the first place (For example: if you made her mate with another Sim at 8:00 P.M., she will most likely give birth around that time)

, If you have extra money, you can buy extra baby essentials like the baby chair or toys. You MUST HAVE a crib!

, If you decide on having more, note that there can only be one baby in one crib. You'll have to get more cribs.

Wait for signs of pregnancy.,
Adjust during the pregnancy.,
Buy baby supplies.,
Give birth.",How to Have a Baby in the Sims 31," The female Sim must be in the young adult or adult life stage. The male must be a young adult, adult, or elder. Have them interact with social and romantic options until they have nearly full relationship bars.


Some non-human Sims can have a baby, which will typically have characteristics from both parent species. Zombies, SimBots, Servos, and Mummies cannot have children.;
, The ""Try for a Baby"" option only appears if there's an object nearby where the Sims can ""WooHoo."" Some objects have a higher chance of babies than others, or give special traits. Here are a few of the best options:100% chance: Vibromatic heart bed (High End Loft stuff pack) — baby will have Excitable trait
75%: Normal bed
75%: Sarcophagus (World Adventures expansion)
50%: Hot tub (various expansions) — baby will have either Hydrophobic or Party Animal trait
50%: Treehouse (various expansions) — baby traits depend on specific treehouse

, Have the two Sims interact romantically near the chosen object. As you do, keep an eye on the short term context messages. If the interactions go well, the other Sim will think you're being Flirty, then Alluring, then Extremely Irresistible. You'll need to reach the third stage to have a baby.


It doesn't matter whether you control the male or female Sim.

, Once the interaction has reached ""Extremely Irresistible,"" select the ""Try for a baby"" option under the Romance menu. The two Sims will move to the nearby object and have some censored fun.


This option will not appear if your household lot already has 8 Sims living in it.
There may be a small chance of pregnancy from the ""Woohoo"" option as well, but that's an unreliable method., If the female Sim gets morning sickness the day after the attempt, she is almost certainly pregnant. You'll know this happens when she gets the Nauseous moodlet and/or throws up.


One way to know for certain if a female Sim is pregnant is if you click ""Go Here"" anywhere on the ground. If you do not have the options ""Automatic,"" 'Run"" or ""Walk,"" then you're Sim is definitely pregnant.
A short song right after the attempt is another sign of success.
If this doesn't happen, just try for a baby a second time. You can keep trying as many times as you like.

, A Sims pregnancy is much easier than a real one, since it only lasts three days! Still, it pays to be prepared for the following changes:On day two, the mother will be visibly pregnant. She will also get a few days of maternity leave (paid time off work), starting today.
On day three, meet the mother's needs and address negative moodlets fast. If she is unhappy during this stage, you will not get to select the baby's traits.
At any point while pregnant, eating 3+ apples makes a boy much more likely. Eating 3+ watermelons makes a girl much more likely., Set up an area for the baby near the parents' bed, as well as a bathroom. A crib and a teddy bear for the baby to sleep with are essential supplies.

, Some Sims will have birth inside the house, while others will call a taxi on their own and visit the hospital. There are no big differences between them, but the home birth usually leads to a higher starting relationship between mother and baby.


The birth can happen very quickly, or last several game hours. Don't let the noise or the panicking husband worry you — nothing bad can happen.

Hold down 'Cmd Shift C' and type in 'motherlode'. Repeat this once. Your lifetime wish should be fulfilled. Purchase the legendary host from the lifetime wish panel.;
, Depending on what kind of party it is, change the music. If it's extremely formal, put on classical, if it's classy put on Latin, and if it's normal put on either electronica or pop. Also, if it's a kid's party, put on the kid's music.

, Buy two giant spotlights and place both outside your door. They will attract the attention of loads and add some VIP sparkle.


Buy the VIP fence and fence the entrance.
There are balloons. Colour them according to the type of music playing. If it's Latin, go red and black, if it's pop, go pink and black and if it's classical use the normal one. If it's a kid's party, colour it pink and  white.

, If it's a kid's party have at an earlier time ranging from 3:00 to 6:00 on weekdays, and 5:00 to 7:00 on weekends. Adults should be from 6:00 to 8:00.

, If it's an adult party, buy a buffet table. If it's a kid's party, make fish and chips and burgers and diner foods instead. Put out some fruit for the kids.

Make your sims live a great life or a horrible life.",How to Have Fun on Sims 3," Create your family in a different way. You could make the parents hate each other, or make the siblings fight a lot. Or you could make a father who loves to spend the day at the computer and a mother who loves the outside, and loves fishing. This creates challenges in the game, because to thrive they will have to be able to live, doing both things, and still be together if they want a good relationship.

, This is, besides the lifetime wish. Have as many friends as you can, throw some awesome parties, make your Sim a loner, and make him live in the corner of the city, talking to his plants or the TV. Make a technophobic Sim, and try playing the game without ever using electronics.

, Many use cheat-codes to play the game, but have you ever thought of playing it without the cheat-codes? If you have never tried this, then it will be very challenging, and you might enjoy it. You Sim will have to work a lot, try to get a promotion fast, accept opportunities to get money, and live very cheaply in the beginning. When your Sim turns out successful and rich, you will be proud and know that you did it - without cheat-codes.

, This is actually very fun, as much as it sounds mean. If you find this offensive or mean in anyway, then feel free to skip this step. Here are 5 fun ways to kill your Sim and make him turn into a ghost.


Death by Fire. You can make you Sim die this way, if you make him or her cook, and then when the food is on/in the stove/oven you cancel the request to make the food, and make the Sim do something else in the kitchen. Before the fire starts, remove the doors leading to the kitchen, so that your Sim can't escape. Cancel every time your Sim tries to continue cooking. Eventually a fire will start, and your Sim will hopefully burn up.
Death by Drowning. This is a little more complicated. Put you Sim in a pool, and enter build mode. Delete the ladder and try to put fence up around the pool, without any space for your Sim to get up. If this doesn't work, try with kitchen counters around the pool. When you figure out a way to make your Sim imprisoned in the water, turn on the game mode again and wait for death to happen.
Death by Electrocution. Make your Sim tinker with something, or use an electrical object while in a puddle of water. A Sim will have more luck of dying this way if he's clumsy and non-mechanic.
Death by Starvation. Lock your Sim in a room for some days and do not provide the Sim with any food. After some time, starvation will occur, but you will have to listen to a lot of complaining until then.
Death by Old Age. This is the last way of killing a Sim. Play with the Sim and his family until he gets really old. Take good care of your Sim all the time. but eventually your Sim will pass away from old age. This will take significantly longer if your Sim is a Vegetarian.

, Make your Sim become a famous surgeon, politic, criminal or journalist. This is actually very fun, especially if you have the expansion pack ""Ambitions"".

, This is both challenging and hard. Make a lonely mother or father, or even a couple. Then make them have many kids, until there can't be more kids in the household. Now, take care of all the kids, make them grow up happy, potty train them, read for them, make sure they have good grades and take care of their jobs when they become teenagers. And don't forget mom and dad, you also have to take good care of their needs, careers and wishes.

, If you want an interesting family get two people to fall in love with completely different traits, for example one can be family oriented and the other can hate kids!

, See how long you can last without using the cheats. This will be hard if you love cheats!

, Sometimes it is fun to play without cheating.;
, Maybe they will be friends lovers enemy's or strangers to each other. Who Knows?

, Or maybe even one a slave and one a master, keep the slave in a tiny cage and the master get luxury stuff!

, It will make the game much more interesting!

Start with a stable household.,
Phone the adoption services.,
Choose a child.,
Wait for the kid.",How to Have a Baby in the Sims 32," You cannot adopt a child if the Social Worker has previously removed someone from the household, or if you've reached the max household size of 8 Sims.Assuming neither of those has happened, any Sim at the young adult stage or older can adopt.

, Interact with any phone and select the ""Call Services"" option, then select ""Adoption Services.""


The Sim must be on his or her home lot to adopt.

, When adopting, you get to choose between a girl and a boy, and between a baby, toddler, or child. You also get to name the kid, although the last name will always be the same as the Sim who made the phone call.The traits and appearance are always random, but you can improve future traits with a good upbringing.

, Within a game hour the kid should arrive at your house. Babies and toddlers are dropped off by a social worker, while children will ride a bike to your house.

Get abducted by aliens.,
Wish for a child at the wishing well.",How to Have a Baby in the Sims 33," Male Sims at the young adult stage or older have a 1 in 3 chance of pregnancy when abducted by aliens. The baby will be completely alien, and unrelated to the father. Here's how to achieve this:


Install the Seasons expansion.
Collect Space Rocks if you can. (They appear mostly at random, but a Collection Helper speeds it up.)
Have a male Sim stargaze outside at night, using a telescope. Repeat each night until abducted.
If the Sim has the Unexpected Weight Gain moodlet when he returns, he is pregnant. If not, try again.

, If you purchase the Lucky Palms world from the Sims Store, you'll have access to a wishing well. You can wish for a child here, but sometimes you'll get an evil one that appears from a black cloud."

Create a new region.,
Choose what to build and develop first.,
Place a road adjacent to it and drag it down to the bottom middle of your city.,
Stop there and pause the simulation.,
Make some money.,
Go back to the power plant and take its funding down to one light bulb efficiency.,
Create a small area of dense industry away from the neighborhood and near the power plant.,
Expand your medium density neighborhood just a little.,
Wait a bit and let things happen.,
Now on the far side of your neighborhood, away from pollution and power plants, create a small low-density commercial center.,
Wait until your population reaches 500 for this next step.,
Build one or two water towers.,
Have Smoke Detectors!,
Continue expanding slowly and maybe consider making your low-density commercial into a medium-commercial zone.,
Stay patient.,
Make some neighboring cities, start lowering taxes, and slowly expand.",How to Make a Successful City in SimCity 4," Pick plains. At first you have the chance to be ""God"" and create valleys, mountains, mesas, lakes, animals, and so on. I suggest making a plateau in the center and covering the land with trees. Do not make animals! Eventually you will destroy their habitat and make the llama people aggravated. Once you've created a sensible and mostly flat region,turn on mayor mode and name your city any desirable name of your choosing.;
, The key in making a successful city is the order in which you build things. Another vital ingredient is extreme patience. All of my successful cities took hours of careful placement and risky decisions. In the long run, they all pay off. Anyway,the first thing you should do is place a natural gas power plant in the corner of your city.

, Once there create a decent sized medium-residential zone and at least one medium sized park. Drag a power line from the plant to the neighborhood.

, Unlike Sim city 1, 2, and 3, you do not need to create every single building and rely on resource trade. Sim City 4 will cream you if you use this tactic. Instead you will rely on taxes. Although neighbor deals can be helpful you have to create a city to deal with. There are no already-made cities neighboring you. So you will need to open the tax menu and crank high, medium, and low wealth residential taxes to at least 8.5% and all wealth industrial to 9%. Move Commercial taxes to 7.5% and un-pause the simulation.

, Go to the city ordinance menu. First click ""legalize gambling"". This will add 100 dollars to your income. Then click the ""smoke detector ordinance"". I will explain that one later.

, This will help a lot.

, Make sure it has road connection, otherwise it can't create jobs and will be a waste of your your money. Now make a road connection above the power plant and create some agricultural zones. I know what your thinking but skyscrapers and big cities won't be here for a while. All of my successful cities started as cruddy industry towns or rural villages.

, Remember do not build civic buildings or water systems yet. At this point they are not mandatory.

, Your city population should have at least 350 residents before the next step.

, Do not make it big! Commercial zoning is very important, if it overwhelms the residents, it will be abandoned, but if it is ignored, it will never grow mid and high wealth office.

,


By now you have the mayors house and should have placed it in the neighborhood. It will attract mid and high wealth residents after a while. Now your income should be at least 500 away from your expense. And you should be pulling in some small cash now. Now lets build some civic. We can only afford one thing right now, so we don't break budget. On one side of the neighborhood build an elementary school. Look at the number of students. It should be far from the maximum capacity. Take the funding down to a point where the capacity is about 20 over how many students you have. Now on the other side of the neighborhood build one local library. It's funding should be simultaneous to the school. Leave it that way. Now expand the residential area a little more and build one more farm then let the game sit for a while.
At this point you should have a population between 850 and 1,450. Hopefully you've at least reached 1,000. You should have a house of worship by now and should have placed it near the neighborhood. Now expand your commercial center just a little same with the neighborhood and we should be ready for some new ideas.

, Build them near the commercial center. If you build near the power plant and industry, you will need to invest in an expensive water treatment plant. Only place the pipes under the residential and commercial zones. Once finished expand the dense industrial zone and let the game sit.

, They help your budget greatly. By now its time for another civic and that's a small fire station. Why, you may ask? Simple, your industrial zone should be blazing right now. Here, let me explain. Civics(and landfills/incinerators) are extremely expensive investments, unfortunately they will become valuable necessities. My opinion on fire stations and police stations alike; why invest when not needed? Don't protect fires until one is created. At this point your industrial zone should have caught on fire, create a small fire station near the industrial zones and take its funding way down. Even if the red ring doesn't cover the whole city, which it won't, the firemen will still drive out to the neighborhood. Back to smoke detectors, without this ordinance you would have to invest in fire coverage before water and education. Water and education are much more significant than fire coverage. Smoke detectors prevent most fires until this point in time. And by the way, by this point in time your population should be somewhere between 1,600 and 2,500.

, Remember to ignore Neil Fairbanks and Monique Diamond and that bunch because as a mayor you know who is best. And we know what the people want.

, You should be receiving the cemetery and a few high tech industries should be appearing remember patience and order. Hospitals and Police Stations won't be too soon in your future. Maybe around a 5,500 population just for one. Go hospital first, then landfill, police, and eventually around a 17,000 population you get a recycling center and an incinerator.

, Eventually you will have zero farms and an incredible demand for high-rise. Dense zoning will come for that and a full power/water system. Consider airports and private schools. Never except a business deal unless it's a casino. And make sure your casino has a police station nearby. Soon you'll have skyscrapers, landmarks, and 2% tax rates. I have to go, so make your urban utopia with your decisions now. Please ask any questions you may have and check out my suggested ordinances in the tip menu.

Call the headmaster, and be sure your Sims do not have anybody coming over or anywhere to be when he arrives, and try to arrange parties and other fun social activities on ANOTHER DAY.,
Have a clean house!,
Make sure your Sims themselves are well and prepared.,
Prepare.,
Lastly, if you are having trouble multitasking in order to be ready for the big man to come to your house, PAUSE THE GAME AND TAKE AWHILE TO STOP AND THINK.,
and to get yourself ten extra points make him go in the spa and drink coffee.,
If you don't want to do this the old fashion way...cheat.",How to Impress the Headmaster (Sims 2)," You don't want to throw a party and lose track of the time. Its also best to do this on a weekend day when no one is working.;
, I can not stress how IMPORTANT it is to keep your house clean. If it is dirty, or there are books, magazines, newspapers, or anything else in the way, he DOES notice. Make sure of this when you get the ""headmaster will arrive in one hour"" message. You should have both Sims or however many you have EACH do something unless they are away. For example, have a child or children pick up books and store them, and the mother do the dishes (it helps if you have a dishwasher because it is faster) a father scrub the counters, and etc.

, It doesn't really help if you're inviting the headmaster over, and your children are sneezing every six seconds, or the mom is so tired she falls asleep standing up, does it? Well ALL of your Sims stats apply in this part. Make sure your Sims are clean by giving them a shower or a bath, and make sure to dress them in there best clothing. Your Sims should take care of bladder needs a little while before the headmaster arrives, because you WILL be dining with him, and it could take awhile. Make sure your Sims have good energy levels also, we don't want them stopping themselves from going to sleep from lack of it, so have your Sims get a good night sleep the previous day. Your Sims should be happy and ready to attend to the headmaster.

, This will probably take a week but it will help. Let the mom build up her cooking skills. Also make sure she's practiced the meal she's going to make before so she won't burn it. Build up the dad's charisma. The more charismatic he is the better the conversation he can have. The more educational and expensive objects you have in each room of your house the better! Don't show the headmaster pointless rooms such as the bathroom.

, You DON'T want to rush this. If you do, he could leave early. And just try to turn free will on the ""off"" mode while he is there, because if it is on, you could have a great many many problems. It will help your Sim stick to the task, and not stop in the middle of it and wander off to go do something else like watch TV while the precious dinner is burning on the stove.

, and if you have no money to buy this then press control shift C and then type in motherlode until you have enough money.

, While you're in the neighborhood bring up the cheat bar and type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true then enter the family you want. When the headmaster comes over hit shift and click on him. Choose make selectable then go to his friends and pull up your relationship with him. Then make him unselectable. Go to your friends and pull up the relationship. Then have them do something and they become best pals.

Download a multiple-marriage mod.,

Have your sim meet other sims.,
Get your sims to know each other.,
Once your sims are in love, they can get married.,
Repeat with another eligible sim.",How to Have More Than One Husband or Wife on the Sims 2," A simple google search for ""Sims 2 Multiple Marriage Mod"" can lead you to some useful links. It would also be beneficial to find a mod that prevents your sims from experiencing jealousy, but that's really your call. After all, jealousy can make for some fun (or at the very least, interesting) gameplay. Make sure you've correctly installed the mod, and that you aren't going to break your game (or computer) by doing so.;
, Go to the Neighborhood screen and click on ""Create Sim."" You should go through this process as if you were normally creating a new sim. Its gender, appearance, or aspirations don't have an effect on whether or not the multiple marriage mod will work, so go crazy.

, You can either create them within the same household as the original sim, or separately and move them into your original Sim's house (as long as there are less than eight sims already living on the lot). Moving them into the same house isn't the only way to meet sims, though. If you have the Nightlife expansion, your sim can meet other sims through a matchmaker or during a night of partying out on the town. You can also have your sim visit a community lot during the day (like a gym), invite other sims to your house, or chat with sims on the computer. There are always opportunities to meet new sims!

, There are tons of social options in The Sims 2, from just chatting to telling dirty jokes. You can even make them flirt a lot, but be warned: flirting only works if your sims have a certain amount of social recognition for each other. But once they start flirting, it won't take too long for them to fall in love.

, If they're happy and in love, you can have one sim get down on bent knee and pop the question. You can have them move in first, if they aren't already living together, but once they're married they'll be living together anyway.

, You can go through this process as many times as you like, marrying as many sims as you would like.

Make sure you have demand for residential and put the game on cheetah speed.

",How to Get Skyscrapers in SimCity 4," You will not get any commercial skyscrapers at all unless you have an office population of at least 5,000 workers. Once you reach that milestone, you can build a stock market which attract large buildings.

, A good commercial area will be away from industrial parts of the city and have several plazas nearby, along with a high land value. Also be sure that the commute is okay. This means that there are residential areas nearby and it doesn't take long for Sims to get from their homes to the business area.

, Freeways are a good choice because they support far more traffic than other roads. It is definitely needed if your city has commuters from other cities. For shorter distances, like just across town, avenues work well also.

, Make sure you have high density zones, because taller buildings cannot develop on low density land plots. You will also need Hi-Tech Industrial zones in your region or city.

, Low taxes means less income, but more people will come.

, Building the power-plants in the middle of the city is a good move, because you can evenly distribute the power. You can also use utility lines if necessary.

, You do it by road, highway, train, any way you want, as long as Sims are able to commute between areas. If a zone isn't connected, your zones won't be of much use.

, That means it's time to build important buildings, like Fire and Police Departments, Hospitals and Schools, and anything else that will benefit your city.

, (Note: Landfills can really decrease the beauty of your city and are expensive. If desired, use recycling plants instead.)

, Your budget. Maintaining a balanced budget us key to keeping your city afloat.

, Try giving across the board tax cuts to make all Sims happy. Make sure to keep commercial taxes lower than the industrial and the residential tax. My current tax rate for the middle class home is 6.1% and middle class businesses are 5.9%. But industrial are averaging 6.9% - 7.2%. This allows more spending and creating jobs, helping the budget. I cut funding in half for education, and about 30% to hospitals. Roads spending should NEVER be cut! Never raise taxes just to increase the surplus.

If you want, think of a story to go along with your city.,

Finally, keep your societal values in balance.",How to Create a Great City in SimCity Societies," This can make for an interesting post on the SimCity websites. Prepare to make captioned screenshots so you can create an album of your city's evolution.;
, There are a few different methods in which you can design your roads and buildings. You can use a system of town squares, where you build a simple quadrilateral shape for your road, line it with essential buildings like banks and grocery stores, give the small district a name, and place an ornamental fountain or monument in the middle. Eventually, you can build up on these and create many different ""squares"" that are connected by subway. This eliminates a lot of carbon emissions, and is appealing to look at. This is a mere suggestion; keep in mind that there are many other types of layouts that you can use. You can even make one up if you want to.

, There is no cleaner way to supply your city with energy than wind farms. There is no carbon footprint, plus they are interesting to look at and make your city skyline look very sophisticated.

, While a Baroque fountain adds points to your total Prosperity, it can get in the way. Sometimes such a concept along the lines of ""too much of a good thing isn't very good"" is valid in this situation. One or two monuments in a three-square radius are pretty to look at, but if you place one everywhere you have extra space, they don't look as sophisticated; your city looks overdone.

, Tall skyscrapers can add an interesting effect, but if there are too many, your skyline can look messy.

, See what your city would look like to an actual person walking down the street. This will give you a better idea on what you do well and what you need to improve on.

, If you have a ton of Knowledge, but you are lacking in the Authority area, then the next time you have enough money to buy something, pay attention to that.

, Go to ""God Mode"" and begin shaping your landscape. Steep mountains and water cannot be zoned on. Remember that trees at this point are free, and also increase land value and health. Adding trees now will be very beneficial.

, Then zone some low density residential.

, Natural Gas is little more expensive to maintain but is well worth it as the pollution is much lower. Place this a short distance away from your residential zones and turn down its budget to fulfill your needs, plus 30% more (this will save you money). You should see a bit of development move in. The power plant only provides a few jobs, so growth will be small at this stage. This is normal though.

Place rails around the outer edge of the city. Put them on the inside of the power lines. Also allow them to connect to other cities surrounding your city.

, Do not add any residential zones. Instead of adding another power plant to this city, you can drag power lines to the edge of the town and create a neighbor connection. Accept the power deal that is offered to you. That way, you are buying power for a small price instead of maintaining your own.


You should see factories and other buildings develop very rapidly. This is because the demand for jobs in your other city is high because it offers only a handful of jobs. Demand will always ""flow"" between cities. They will work in this industrial city. Once development tapers off, save and exit to your region.







, Remove the small amount of industry you put there earlier. Most of your Sims now work in the industrial city. A very small amount still work at the power plant. Keep zoning low density residential until development tapers off. Once your residential city has a population of over 1,100 Sims, you can start zoning medium density. Make sure you provide those zones with water.

, A community of well-educated Sims attracts wealthy businesses to your Commercial city well and High-Tech Industry to your Industrial one. Add health care facilities to ensure your Sims live to ripe old age.

, As your population grows, demand for industrial jobs grows. And in turn, the industrial development will attract new Sims to your Residential city. Once you seem to have a strong pattern going between your two cities, it is time to create a new city.

Your zone will develop quickly., You should eventually add medium and high density commercial to your commercial city. This will attract offices and higher wealth Sims. The Sims will settle in your residential city and commute to your other two cities to work. Make sure you have good connections between your cities.

, By now, you should have several thousand Sims living in your Residential city. You will develop high-tech industry in your Industrial city. And once you have over 45,000 Sims working in your Commercial City, you will get skyscrapers.


At first, your industrial city will have the most workers. Your commercial city will not be far behind. On the other hand, you won't have too many workers in your agricultural city.

Then click on the door and select Lock and Everybody. You need your game fully updated to do this, if your game isn't fully updated or you can't get it to work simply go into buy mode and remove the door. Your victim has now been locked into the room., Have your murderer Sim now simply pull the lever, releasing the tomb mummy on your Sim's victim. The mummy will walk out and most likely curse the Sim with the mummy's curse, which will kill the Sim if not cured. If your Sim victim wins the fight or survives, simply repeat the process until they are cursed., Yes, sadly you do have to wait for this one, but they will die. What makes this murder is the fact your Sim's actively participating in the murder by pulling the lever that unleashes the mummy. This is a great way to have murder on your Sim, or simply get rid of the in-laws."

, This is really not so hard, since in the Sims 3, there is always an opening in the career of your choice. If it doesn't show up online or in the newspaper, just go to the site of the career to get the job.

, This may seem pretty obvious to you, but let me elaborate on this a bit more. If you work for hours during the day, and then do nothing to help your career in the evening, you won't get too far. You will succeed somewhat, but only with super long periods of hard work, which could be sped up by some experience in the required skills or relationships for that career.You should keep them helping their work constantly, especially for the ones you won't keep (This'll be explained soon.)

, You can move them out for free by selecting one of your non-favorite sims, using the option on their cellphone that says ""Move"", having the other not wanted sims move out with them, selecting the option that's labeled ""kick out"", and finalizing the decision by clicking on the check mark.

, Moving out of the place your sims will be living in currently, and then moving to a mansion may be what you want to do. Then, enjoy how good it feels to have worked so hard for your riches!

, After watching the intro, you will be asked to select a neighborhood, or to create one if you want to. If you have never played The Sims 2 before, do neither; click on the Tutorials button (the one with the two dice) and start familiarizing yourself with the look and feel of the game.

, You have 3 options: Pleasantview, Strangetown, and Veronaville. Pleasantview follows the story begun in The Sims 1; Strangetown is, like the name tells you, a strange town where all kinds of paranormal things happen- aliens, ghosts, mad scientists and so on; Veronaville is a neighborhood inspired by Shakespeare's plays, with its own Romeo and Juliet and other such characters. Choose the neighborhood that sounds the most appealing to you.

, You can choose to continue with an existing family, but creating a new one helps you learn faster. Create 2 adults for the beginning: a man and a woman. Creating children and teens require better skills at Sims 2, while creating elders restricts much of your options.


Choose a family name and a name for each of the Sims.






Customize your Sim's appearance. You can choose various hair styles, facial features and outfits for your Sim.






Choose an aspiration for your Sim. The most interesting feature of The Sims 2 is the aspiration system- while The Sims 1 was a quite boring, endless game (your Sims never aged, and they had absolutely no wishes and/or purposes in life), your Sims now have wishes they must fulfill in order to keep them happy. The aspiration is the most important part of the game- basically everything you do with your Sim revolves around it. There are 5 aspirations in The Sims 2.






Fortune- your Sim's wishes will be related mostly to buying expensive items and advancing in their jobs.






Knowledge- your Sim's wishes will be related to gaining skill points, studying aliens, seeing ghosts and so on.






Family- your Sim's wishes will be related to finding a significant other, having a baby, and keeping family members happy.






Romance- your Sim's wishes will revolve around having as much simultaneous lovers as possible, making out with as many Sims as possible, and so on. Warning: they fear commitment, so don't have them getting engaged or married.






Popularity- your Sim's wishes will revolve around having as many friends and best friends as possible, selling masterpieces and novels and throwing great parties.






Decide your Sim's personality. The way you place personality points will have a huge impact on your gameplay with that Sim. Your Sim can be sloppy or neat, shy or outgoing, lazy or active, serious or playful, grouchy or nice, and everything in-between. It's recommended to display personality points equally- 5 points per personality trait (the maximum number of points is 10). But even a better option is to display personality points according to your Sim's aspiration: for example, for Sims with the Popularity aspiration, you have to make them more outgoing and nice, while for Sims with the Knowledge aspiration, you have to make them serious and active.







, Families start of with 20,000 simoleons (Sim money), which will soon prove to be very little. However, this is enough for the beginning.

, Most pre-made houses already have the basics- a toilet, a shower, a fridge and a handful of other objects- but you will still need to buy other very important items like beds. Click on the ""buy"" button and choose the first items from each list.

, You can get your Sims jobs by clicking on the newspaper and selecting ""Find a Job"". For each newspaper delivered to you, you have 3 job options; choose the best paid one for each.

, Keeping them fulfilled means having your Sim do things so that their motive bars are always in green. A yellow motive bar means a semi-fulfilled need; an orange motive bar means a poorly fulfilled need; a red motive bar means a critically unfulfilled need. The needs a Sim has are the following:

Hunger- the most basic need of a Sim. If the hunger bar goes red, the Sim will die. To keep this need fulfilled, make your Sim eat by clicking on a fridge and selecting one of the options in there (except juggling with bottles; that won't help at all). Make sure your fridge is full most of the time.






Comfort- one of the easiest needs to fulfill. This need gets low when your Sim has spent too much time standing up. To fulfill it, just have your Sim sit down or lay on a couch or bed to relax.






Bladder- when your Sim needs to use the toilet, this need will turn red- that usually happens after drinking a lot of coffee. If it goes very low, your Sims will wet themselves- nothing very bad will happen, it's just that they'll remember the embarrassing moment...






Energy- the second most important need, after Hunger. A Sim needs energy in order to do something. Fulfill this need by having your Sim sleep or take a nap on a couch. When this need goes very low, your Sim will pass out.






Fun- your Sim's need for entertainment. Keep your Sims entertained by having them do something fun every now and then- watching TV, playing a game, reading a book and so on. Your Sims' Fun meter will go very low during work/school.






Social- Sims are social creatures; therefore, they need interaction with other Sims to keep this need in the green. Have your Sim talk to another Sim whenever this need goes down- see, that's why it's recommendable to put 2 Sims on a lot, when creating a family!






Environment- This need will automatically go up or down every time your Sim enters a new room. To keep it fulfilled, place decorations around the house, keep your Sims' house free of garbage, broken objects, vermin and spoiled food and make sure you place windows in each room.







, Each Sim has a list of 4 Wants and 3 Fears. Fulfilling a Want awards a number of Aspiration points (which can be used for acquiring some very fun stuff later in the game) and fulfilling a Fear subtracts a number of Aspiration points. When a Want or Fear is fulfilled, it disappears and is replaced with a new one. Your Sim's Wants and Fears influence the Aspiration meter- which goes up with every Want you fulfill and down with every Fear you fulfill. The Aspiration meter will go a little down every hour (while not subtracting any of the Aspiration points). Keep your Sim happy by fulfilling some of his/her Wants. A Want will look something like that: ""Meet a New Sim (+1000 Aspiration Points)"".


When your Aspiration Meter reaches its maximum level, your Sim will be awarded with the Platinum aspiration, which means that he or she will ignore the Mood meter (when your Mood meter is lower than half, your Sim will refuse to do anything that requires effort- like studying, for example) and will keep on doing whatever you want him/her to.






When your Aspiration meter reaches its minimum level, your Sim will go nuts and a psychiatrist will automatically come and help your Sim out, by raising his Aspiration Meter a bit higher.






Aspiration points can be spent in exchange of cool stuff like the Money Tree or the Elixir of Life.







, To be able to explore certain features of the game, your Sims must be rich; and simoleons come with jobs. Of course, there are also several cheats that help you get tons of money, but forget about them for now, if you want to learn how to play. Also, each job has interesting rewards- which can be also acquired with cheats, but it's more satisfying to know your Sims worked hard for their belongings, right? There are 10 promotion levels for each job; you usually start off at level 1. Each level has certain requirements, like skill points and family friends.


Skill points are displayed in the Job panel and are important in a large variety of areas. There are 7 Skills your Sim can have:






Cooking- this skill makes your Sim be able to cook more meals, and is also important in some careers, for example Culinary. It can be increased by cooking, studying Cooking (click on a bookcase for options), and watching the Cooking channel on TV.






Mechanical- this skill makes your Sim be able to successfully repair more items around the house, without being the victim of accidents. It is also useful in some careers, such as Military. It can be increased by repairing broken items and studying Mechanical.






Charisma- this skill makes your Sim more likely to tell jokes that other Sims laugh at; it's also helpful in many careers, such as Politics and Business. It can be increased only by practicing Speech or Romance in front of a mirror.






Body- this skill makes your Sim fitter, as well as being important in careers such as Military and Athletic. It can be improved by swimming, exercising at a special machine, exercising in front of the TV or practicing yoga.






Logic- this skill makes your Sim more likely to win a chess game. It is important in careers like Medicine and Science. It can be increased by playing chess or using a telescope (can be used at any time of day, but gains logic faster when Stargazing).






Creativity- this skill makes your Sim be a better painter, musician and novelist. It is also important in careers like Criminal and Business. It can be increased by playing the piano, painting or writing novels on the computer.






Cleaning- this skill makes your Sim clean stuff easier and faster; it's helpful in careers such as Medicine or Culinary. It can be increased by cleaning things around the house and studying Cleaning.






Family friends are the friends a member of the household has; in other words, even if Sim X isn't friends with Sim Z, but Sim Y, who lives in the same house as Sim X, is friends with Sim Z, then Sim Z will count as a family friend for Sim X.







, It can be really interesting and thrilling to take care of a child Sim. Build up your two Sims' relationship and make them love each other; then click on a double bed, make both Sims lay on it, click on one of the Sims while selecting the other one and choose ""Try for Baby"" from the list of options that appears. This is only possible for a male and a female; see, that's why beginners are advised to create a family composed of a man and a woman. Your female Sim will get pregnant and have a baby in 3 days. There are 6 development stages in a Sim's life:

Baby- That's how a Sim's life begins. The baby stage lasts 3 days, after which, every hour after six o'clock, a member of the household will try to ""Help with Birthday"". If they don't get there in time, you have to wait until they get it right. Buying a birthday cake is much easier and helps the baby Grow Up more quickly. A baby is not selectable, has few needs- basically all you have to do is feed him or her, make sure he or she gets enough sleep and change his or her diapers. The baby will instantly know all the household members, so meeting a member of the household won't appear as one of the memories. There are very few ways you can interact with a baby.






Toddler- this is where things get really complicated. A toddler is very difficult to take care of. When your young Sim reaches the toddler stage, there are a few things you must do. The first concern of a Sim parent is to teach their toddler how to speak, walk and use the potty- that's what makes it so difficult to take care of a toddler, as the young one is very stubborn and learns very slow. A tip for inexperienced players who want to keep themselves sane while growing a toddler Sim: acquire the special milk for toddlers that is found in a Sim's aspirational rewards list; that would make them learn faster, if the one who uses it has a high aspiration level. It's cheap enough, about 7,000 points. Next, do the training in this order, if your Sims don't have Wants related to training a toddler: first Teach to Speak, then Teach to Walk, and last Potty Train (potty training is the most annoying, as the toddler is often unwilling to sit on it and the toilet gets flooded every time you empty the potty). Parents with the Family aspiration will have Wants related to doing the training, so make sure you decide which parent does which training, so you fulfill their Wants. Warning: your toddler's needs go up and down very quickly. Last, if your toddler has been taught everything they need to know, buy them some toys that teach them skills- this way it would be easier for them to build skills. It takes 4 days for a Toddler to grow up.






Child- taking care of a child can be really tricky, as the social worker (the woman who takes the child away from you and sends them over to adoption) is very likely to drop by during this stage, if you don't make the best out of the child. Every day, from Monday to Friday, at 08:00, the school bus will come to pick up your child and take him or her to school. When they get back from school, they bring a notebook (their homework), which must be completed next day or the child's report card will go down (from -A to -B, for example); same with skipping school. The first thing you have to do is have an adult, teen or elder teach your child how to study; the child will finish homework way more quickly if you do. Also, don't let your child's needs go too low (especially Hunger and Social), or let them home alone, otherwise expect a visit from the social worker. Warning: if your children don't return from school in a good mood, their report card won't go very high (it's exactly the opposite of having a job- when your Sim has a job, the mood that matters is the mood they go to work in, not the one they come back in), so make sure they have most needs fulfilled by the time the bus comes. No need to bother about food and bladder- they'll satisfy them while at school. Instead, worry about the Fun need- it goes very low during school, so make it at least decent by satisfying it to the maximum before getting to school. You can do this really easily by having them view a painting several times- it makes them fulfill the need very quickly. The child stage lasts 7 days.






Teenager- Teenagers are a lot easier to take care of, since they can do most of the things by themselves (like paying the bills, cooking, having a job, taking care of younger children, having romantic interactions etc.). Yes, a teenager can get a job. Of course, it won't be as well-paid as an adult's job, and you only have three promotion levels, but having a part-time job will give your teen a big start in the same career as an adult, if you decide to keep it. The most important feature that comes with this stance in your Sim's life is the ability to choose an aspiration. From now on, all of your Sim's Wants and Fears will be related to that aspiration. Choose carefully! Also, a teen now has the right to unlock Aspiration rewards, which means all those aspiration points he/she earned by now can finally be spent! The Teenager stance lasts 15 days.






Adult- Adults can do pretty much everything. They are also the only Sims that can have babies. You'll have a lot of things to do with an Adult, but don't worry; you'll have enough time to do them- the Adult stance lasts 30 days. The main goal of an adult Sim is to get his/her Aspiration Meter as high as possible, because...






Elder- ... the days an Elder has left in the game depends on the Aspiration he/she grows up into. Elders can retire from their jobs and receive a daily paycheck that depends on how high did they get promoted during their Adult years. They are restricted from having children, but can still marry.







, If you like the game, you should know that there are a lot of expansion packs that add different features to the game. Here's a list of them:

University- Your Sims can now go to college! There's a new age for Sims- Young Adults, that comes between Teen and Adult. You have several new jobs to choose between. There are also a couple of new features- the Influence Meter (some Wants award Influence points whom you can spend asking Sims to do this and that for you) and Lifetime Wants, that, once fulfilled, award your Sim Platinum Aspiration for the rest of his/her life! New creature: Zombies.






Nightlife- Your Sims can now ride a car, go on dates, become vampires and all sorts of fun stuff! You can add a new neighborhood on the game, with lots of brand new community lots (no pun intended). There's the new Pleasure aspiration, that is a mixture between Popularity and Fortune. Your Sim can now change his/her Aspiration, thanks to the Re-Nu-Yu elixir. New creature: Vampires.






Open for Business- Your Sims can now open their home business, and being successful in it grants you a variety of perks that are useful in interacting with Sims. You also have the new Talent Badges (bronze, silver and gold), and you learn how to do new things in that particular field, based on the color of the talent badge. New creature: Robots.






Seasons- Your Sims can now enjoy snow, rain, heat and other natural phenomena! Make sure to dress your Sim appropriately for each season, otherwise face the consequences. Your Sims can also become farmers- they can plant vegetables, pick up fruit from a tree, and fish. New creature: Plant Sims.






Pets- Your Sims can now adopt cats, dogs, and lots of other pets! They can take a stray dog or cat inside, or adopt one over the phone. Pets are uncontrollable, but disciplining them can make them practically controllable. New creature: Werewolf.






Bon Voyage- Your Sims can now take a rest from the daily grind and go on vacation! They have three different destinations to choose between- The Far East, exotic islands, and the mountains. There's lots of fun things to do at each one. They can also take photographs of one another. New creature: Bigfoot.






Free Time- Your Sims now have hobbies they want to pursue! It may take some time until they discover which is the field they like the most. They can now sew their own outfits, build their own cars, and other fun activities. They are sometimes granted three wishes by a genie. No new creature.






Apartment Life- Your Sims can now live in apartments! They can only rent one, not buy one. There's also a new Reputation panel, that tells Sims their status among their fellow citizens. Exciting new feature: Witches and Spells! Your Sim can become a witch or a wizard. They have three options: the good, the bad and the neutral. They also have a spell book that allows them to make different spells. New creature: Witches.

Learn the different stages.,
Keep a mental note of each aging cycle.,
Take care of your Sims through each stage.,
Use cheats on the aging process.",How to Understand the Life Stages in Sims 2," A Sim can go through life starting as a baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult (if you have University), adult, and elder. During their life they can also experience pregnancy, death, and taxes (yes Sims do pay property tax when they pay their bills);
,

Babies = 3 days






Toddlers = 4 days






Children = 8 days






Teens = 15 days






Young adults = 24 days (University only)






Adults = 30 days






Elder = Varies; depends on their aspiration levels, etc.







, A huge responsibility of playing The Sims is making sure that your Sim succeeds in life and achieves a different goal in each life stage. A baby, toddler, or child that is not taken care of by other Sims can be taken away by social workers. A Young Adult can get kicked out of college if he or she gets below passing grades for two semesters in a row. An adult that misses work too much can get fired from their job.

,

To stop the aging process for all of your Sims in the active family, press ""Control"" + ""Shift"" + ""C"" simultaneously. Type in aging off and press ""Enter"". To resume aging, type in aging on.
To stop the aging process for individual Sims, press ""Control"" ""Shift"" ""C"" simultaneously. Type in agesimscheat on and click on the specific Sim.

When they are ready, get them to start checking other Sims out.,
Build a great relationship between the two, then propose for engagement and get married.,
Once you have enough money, either sell or put your Sims' belongings in their inventory, then have them move out to a bigger home with more bedrooms and more space to start a family.,
Get ready for your Sims' family but first choose if they adopt or do it all natural.,
Once the adopted Sim is given, take care for it and so on.,
Happy simming, simmers!

",How to Succeed Without Cheating in the Sims 2," If it's your first time playing, it is advised that you start out with just one person. Customize all their features, and dress them up. Then, head to the neighborhood.;
, Ones that cost somewhere below 15,000 simoleons are better, because they leave you money to spare on furniture.

,,,,,, If that doesn't work and your Sim is still single, call the matchmaker. If you give them a lot of money, they will find the perfect Sim for your Sim.

, (If it works out things happen)

, (Only do this if you want a family; if not, the rest of this is useless to you but it's still great to learn, so read on.)

, If they chose to adopt, you usually must wait if you want to style the adopted Sim's room based on gender or not, or take a wild guess. You can always change the style. Decide what age group you want to adopt from (Baby, Toddler, Child) and decorate the room from that too. Hint: If you get a baby or toddler, it doesn't matter on style.

, The rest is up to you.

,"
"
Learn about yourSims' needs.,
The types of needs are:


Hygiene is how clean a Sim is.",How to Take Care of Your Sims in the Sims 2," They need everything we do: Social, environment, bathroom, et cetera. If you don't have enough money, just type ""motherlode"" if you want 50 000 simoleons or ""kaching"" if you want 1 000 in the cheat box (you can pull up the cheat box by holding Ctrl+Shift+C).;
, To increase a Sim's Hygiene, buy a shower or bathtub and direct the Sim to bathe or shower. If the Hygiene meter gets too low, the Sim will stink, which is represented by green clouds by your Sims' armpits.
Bladder is how much a Sim needs to use the bathroom. To increase Bladder, buy a toilet and direct the Sim to use it. Sloppy male Sims can ""go"" in the plants. If you ignore the Bladder meter, the Sim will have an accident on the floor, which needs to be cleaned up, makes the Hygiene meter low, and makes the Sim's accident be gossiped about.
Hunger is how long it has been since the Sim has last eaten. To satisfy hunger, go to the fridge and cook or just grab a snack. If you cannot get food from the fridge, try ordering groceries. Be careful- if the Sim tries to cook and isn't very good at it, the Sim could start a fire. If the Hunger meter is too low, the Sim will die of Hunger.
Environment is how nice the Sim's surroundings are. Buy paintings or sculptures to increase your Sim's Environment meter. If your Sim's Environment meter is low, he or she will refuse to do things and wave his or her arms around. This is the only want that Children do not have.
Comfort is, obviously, how comfortable your Sim is. Comfort can be increased by sitting in a chair or sleeping in a bed. The more expensive the item was, the more Comfort your Sim gets from it. If Comfort is low, the sim will drop actions from its queue.
Fun is how bored a Sim is or is not. To increase Fun, have the Sim play a video game or play Red Hands with another sim. If the Fun meter is low, the same things will happen as with the Environmental meter.
Energy can be increased by sleeping in bed or napping on the couch. If energy is low, your sim will pass out on the floor. Coffee and espresso can also improve a Sim's Energy meter.
Social is just what it sounds- having social interaction with other Sims. To improve Social, you can talk to another Sim on the phone, do any interaction with a Sim in person, or Chat on the computer. If the Social meter gets too low, a Sim in a rabbit costume- called the Social Bunny- will appear and talk to your Sim until its Social meter is at least halfway.

To teach your pet a command, have a selected Sim click on the pet, then click ""Teach Command"".,
If you don't have time to teach your pet tricks, but still want them to learn, call an obedience trainer.,
To teach your pet a behavior, they must do something such as sniffing Sims, sleeping in the pet bed, sleeping in the Sim bed, or peeing on the floor.",How to Train a Pet in Sims 2 Pets," There are many different options, such as sit, roll over, and more. Click one, and your Sim will start to teach the pet a trick. A bar will appear above its head as it's learning. After it fills up, the pet has learned the trick.;
, On the phone, click ""Service"", then ""Obedience Trainer"". When the trainer comes, click on her and choose ""Purchase Training For ( pet's name).""You will have to pay 25 simoleons per session, and 75 an hour. The pet will be taught until 9 P.M., or when their needs drop too low.

, These things can be good or bad. If you like what they are doing, have your Sim click on the pet, then ""Praise for..."" to encourage that behavior. If you dislike the pet's action, do the same thing, but click ""Scold for..."" to discourage that behavior. As you continue to praise or scold your pet, they will begin to get an understanding of what to do. For example, if you scold your pet for eating pet food, they'll eat Sim food instead.

, This is not necessary, but if you must, don't apply loads of mascara or lipstick/balm/gloss. This will give them a more natural look, like the affect created with a simple hair style. It is recommend to use blush. Make sure it's not too dark, it should look like the tween has rosy cheeks, not like an old lady going to church.

, Clothing can be hard to choose when you are creating a tween. It is recommended to choose something that doesn't accentuate their curves or upper body. Tween girls are still flat chested and straight. Look for something that's not too grown up, or too babyish.


Stay away from baby blues and baby pinks, lavenders, and dresses unless a formal outfit. Clothing is supposed to match your girl's personality, so choose accordingly.

Adopting: Have your Sim call the adoption agency on their phone. The next morning, the social worker will arrive, and you will be able to choose whether you want a baby, toddler, or child.



 


Having your own child: You will have to make your Sims get pregnant by clicking the “Try for a baby” option.





;
, For infants, all that is required is a crib and changing table. Once your baby is a toddler you will also want a high chair and some toys. Children and teens need things similar to what adults have. You can find these things in buy and build mode, in the children section.

,

The first stage is the infant stage. This stage lasts about 2 days. There are not many actions that can be performed with infants. Elders, adults, and teenagers can hold infants. They can cuddle them or play with them. Infants spend most of their time in their cribs. They have to be fed, changed, and can be bathed in the sink. Infants don’t have wants or needs, so the most important thing is simply taking care of them and making sure they are clean and well fed.






The second stage is the toddler stage. This stage last 4 days. Toddlers can do much more than infants; however they require more work. Toddlers sleep in cribs, and can be placed in high chairs, where they can be served bottles or food. They can play with toys, and some of those can help them build skills. Toddlers need to be fed, bathed in the bathtub, and changed. They can be changed into everyday clothes and pajamas. Elders, adults, and teens can hold, snuggle, play with, and kiss toddlers. Children can talk to and tease toddlers. Toddlers can be taught to talk, walk, and be potty trained. These usually earn them aspiration points. Toddlers need to be played with and taught.






Toddlers grow into children. This stage lasts 8 days. Children go to school Monday-Friday. They can make friends and interact with each other, as toddlers can’t. They can participate in games and do homework. Children still aren’t old enough to care for infants and toddlers. Children must do their homework and come to school in a good mood in order to maintain good grades. They can go to community lots.






The last stage before adulthood is teenagers. When a child grows into a teenager, you can pick their aspiration, turn-ons, and turn-offs. Teenagers are a lot like adults. They can date, drive, and get part-time jobs. However they still have to attend school. Teenagers need to fulfill their wants in order to stay happy. For example, a teen with a family aspiration may want to care for their younger siblings, while a teen with a romance aspiration may want to have their first kiss. Teens can babysit their younger siblings.







, Children can be taken away by the social worker if their needs drop too low, they are left home alone, or they fail in school. Only the children who are failing in school will be taken away. Therefore, it's important that you feed and care for your kids. They need to do their homework and come to school in a good mood to get good grades. You can hire a nanny to help care for your kids. Nannies will clean up your house, feed and change your kids, and put them to bed. However, some nannies have been known to slack off, neglect kids, and even leave early.

Get promoted!",How to Reach the Top of Your Job Career in Sims 2," You could either go on the computer and select ""get a job"" or click on the newspaper and select ""get a job"". Either way works fine. When deciding which job to get, keep many things in mind. First, look at the pay. What would your sim rather have, a job that pays 120 simoleons each day, or 250? Also, look at what job your sim wants, if any. You can see this either in their wants, or lifetime want. Your sim will be happier, and will most likely want to reach the top of that career. Lastly, look at the skills you have. If you have high body skill, try the dance or military career. With high creativity, a culinary or artist career might be best for your sim. Here is the complete list of jobs:


Athletic






Business






Criminal






Culinary






Law Enforcement






Medicine






Military






Politics






Science






Slacker






Artist






Natural Science






Paranormal

Law

, You can tell when your sim works by clicking on the ""jobs & skills"" button when you select your sim. The days of the week highlighted in blue is when your sim works. To see which skills you need to gain, look in the ""jobs & skills section"". The skills you need to get promoted will be highlighted in blue. When you have free time, make sure you gain these skills, or else you will not get promoted.

, Family friends are people (nobody in particular) you must become friends with in order to get promoted. A family friend is NOT a relative, they're just another sim that is friends with you OR someone else in the family. To see how many family friends you need in order to get promoted, click the ""jobs & skills"" button. Beside a smiley face will be a number (+1, +2, etc.) That means how many additional family friends you need. It will also tell how many family friends you already have.

, To go to work, a carpool will arrive an hour in advance. Click on it to send your sim to work. If that sim is the only one, the game will automatically fast forward until they come home, unless there is a career chance card.

, In the previous step, I mentioned career chance cards. On some days, usually the first day of work, the game will pause and have a note come up. There will be a situation and 3 choices. One of them is to ignore. If you ignore the situation, nothing good or bad will happen. But the other two choices determine what happens. Sometimes your sim will gain or lose a skill point, get promoted or demoted, or even get fired. Everything is random, but just choose what you think is best.

, After work, a message will appear that says how much money your sim got from work, and if they got promoted. Get promoted by gaining skills, family friends, and picking the right decision on career chance cards. Keep getting promoted to reach the top of your career!

You will see a list of names. Pick your Sim to move to college.;
, Houses let you join a greek house but have expensive bills. Dorms have cheaper bills, but have more people and you cannot join a greek house. If your Sim was a teen at first, you will watch a short clip of that Sim growing up into a young adult. (Usually, the clothes they give you with be REALLY ugly. Look at the tips below to see how to get free clothes.) It is important to claim a dorm room. You may customize it and put in better items if you wish, but can't change the wall structure, windows, doors, etc. With a house you can change whatever you want.

, It is good for your Sim to go to class an hour early, so they won't forget later on. To do this, click on your Sim, then ""college"", then ""go to class"". Also, look at the skills highlighted in blue. These are important to gain, so gain these skills when your Sim has free time. The class performance meter is also very important. It tells you how well your Sim is doing in class. You can improve this by writing your term paper, going to class, doing research, and completing assignments. Try to get the red over the white line, or else your Sim must repeat the semester. If the performance is already filled up, gain more skills, and the performance can now be completely filled. You can even tutor someone else by clicking either on their homework or the other sim and ask then click tutoring

, There are 11 majors to pick from. They are Mathematics, Political Science, Art, Literature, Biology, Philosophy, Psychology, Economics, History, Drama, and Physics. Sometimes Sims want to declare a certain major, but not others. To declare a major, go on the computer, click ""college"", then ""declare major"". Each major has different skills your Sim must work on, so pay attention to the ones your Sim already has. You don't need to declare a major in your freshman year, but by senior year you will have to. Also, each major has recommended jobs to get if you take that major. For example, if your sim has the art major, they might want to be an artist or chef. Each of these jobs need creativity and cooking, which the art major has.

, The Final Exam is at the end of each semester, and a message will show up 5 hours in advance. You do NOT want to miss the final exam! Not going to the final exam will hurt your Sim's grade, and you might have to repeat the semester. Make sure you are prepared for it,and you can do so by filling up the class performance meter. An hour in advance, go to the final exam. You can do this the same way you make your Sim go to class.

The Get to Work expansion for the Sims 4 will allow you to choose careers (such as medical) that might bring you in contact with illnesses.
The Seasons expansion for the Sims 3 will allow you to change the seasons, making it easier for your Sim to catch illnesses, such as pneumonia and hay fever.
Late Night for the Sims 3 will allow your Sim to purchase junk food from a food truck, which will increase their chances of getting sick.
Pets for the Sims 2 will allow your Sim to get sick from an animal bite.;
, Your Sims' immune system will go down, making it easier for them to get sick in the first place.

, Make your Sim wear summer clothing (such as shorts, tank tops, and sandals) in very cold weather. This will work even in the Sims 2.

Make your Sim go to school and play with a sick kid.
Make your Sim kiss someone who is sick.

, Make sure that they are not close to a ladder, or they will get out before they can get sick. Keep in mind, however, that spending too much time in a pool can result in drowning. This will work if you have the Sims 3 Seasons expansion pack.

It will give your Sim a stronger stomach and make it more difficult for him or her to get sick from eating spoiled food.
Avoid the neat trait. A neat Sim will want to clean all the time, and it is harder to get sick in a clean environment.
Consider the slob trait. You will find that the house becomes dirtier faster with them around. A Sim is more likely to get sick in a dirty house.

, Your Sim will find this disgusting and get nauseous.

Consider nicknames for Elizabeth.,
Look through baby name books for the names that sound the most old-fashioned.

",How to Name an Elder Female Sim on the Sims 2," Anything that was first popular in Generation X or Generation Y (for example, Jennifer or Amanda) should be avoided. Likewise with any surname used as a first name, since females did not have those names at the time these Sims would have been born if they were real. Also, most two-syllable names (with the stress on the first syllable) that end with a consonant-vowel-N ending are too new for an Elder Sim woman.;
, Maybe one of them has a name you could use!

, Examples are Mildred, Bertha, Gertrude, Ethel, Maud/Maude, Wilma, Joan, Constance, Dorothy, Elvira, and Edna.

, These were popular in the early 1900s for girls. Some of the best for elderly women are Rose, Pansy (for elderly women who are in the Slacker jobs), Daisy, Myrtle, and Lily.(Do not, however, use the name Flower itself - that is a sixties name!)

, Mary, Ann/Anne, Ruth, Esther, and Margaret are examples.

, Patsy, Peggy, Molly, Dolly, Gertie, Sally, Betsy, Betty, and even Binnie are good choices in this category.

, However, Lisa, Liz, and Lizzie are too young for an elderly woman. Instead, try Bess, Betsy, Betty, Beth, or even Bessie or Elsie.

Learning the main lesson in film production.,
Choose your editing software.,
Prepare The Sims 2 for filming.,
Storyboard your movie.,
Let your story be the star.,
Script.,
Edit.",How to Make Sims 2 Movies (Advanced)," You need to work with all the components of your film to make sure you have control. Control over what is in and out of the shot. Control of lighting. Control of voice-over and scripting. Control is the key.;
, The most popular editing software brands come from three companies. Adobe, Apple and Sony. The Adobe route will mean buying the pricey Premiere Pro at over $1000, or the cheaper Premiere Elements at under $200. The Apple route which means going with Final Cut Pro (for Mac's only) at also over $1000. The final option is routing for Sony with Vegas Pro at about $700, or Vegas Movie Studio Platinum at under $50.] Premiere has been awarded a lot of praise from editors, but has some compatibility issues on most middle range AMD processors. Final Cut Pro has been also been recommended by editors, but only runs on Mac. Vegas is not so much talked about but is the cheapest and often the fastest way of editing.

, In all sets (lots) you build, make sure they are residential so that you can control the Sims on the lot. Sets can either be full buildings, or you can cut the room in half like on real sets and only have the walls that are needed in your shot. For all sets you build you must include: An Empty Room covered with Pure Green Floors and Carpet, A Few Mirrors for the talking animation (Practice Speech) and a selection of hacks for animations, actors (Sims) and props.

, Mise en scène is a French term that literally translates to ""putting on stage"". In film, mise en scène is all to do with how you frame the shot. Where you put your actors (Sims) in a shot, depending on if you're shooting in 4:3 (TV) or 16:9 (wide-screen), is hugely important. You can use particular geometric compositions (the way something is presented on screen) to make your piece physically more appealing to the eye. Such as the Golden Section and the Fibonacci Sequence. And most important of all draw down any visual ideas you have on to a storyboard, the second you think of them.

, Now since you're probably not going to have an A-List actor in your movie, the story will have to be the star of your movie. Now thinking up of a plot is not a learn-able process, the best thing for it is a bit of inspiration and lots of imagination. But when you think about how your movie is going to be seen. Imagine you are your audience and they they know nothing of the plot. They are going to be asking lots of questions. What's going on? Who's that? How did that happen? If your audience are asking these questions, get your characters to ask them, i.e If a fight has started and a character walks in the room and says ""What's going on?"" you can get your characters to answer the question. This prevents audience confusion and seems very natural but it mustn't be exaggerated.

, Unlike Storyboarding can be done is the edit, as when your Sims talk during filming nothing they don't say any real words. So often scripting Is not necessary, improvisation with the plot whilst voicing, along with practice and brainstorming, can be much more effective than a script. But if you are working with multiple voicing artists a script is important to keep control of your movie.

, In editing your story will come together more than in any other part of the process. It is the editing where you fine tune factors. Voice-over lip syncing is almost impossible but you can do it to a certain extent. Another great way to make add like to your movie is music. If your movie becomes boring the audience will not get bored because they are being entertained by the music. Its almost like a boredom safety net. More in depth guides to editing, look at help articles for your editing suite.

Sort of Step 1.,
Decide your plot, before you do anything else.,
Make your characters.,
Load up the game and make your set.,
Start filming!

,
Taking shots: Learn the basics first- Cameraman mode is brilliant.,
Movie making cheats:

,
Open the cheat box with CTRL + Shift + C. Here are some good codes

,
Motherlode- A must have.,MoveObjects on- Lets you position things easier

,
Boolprop SnapObjectsToGrid False- Removes grid for objects.,
Boolprop testingcheatsenabled true- Makes life easy.,MaxMotives- Stops you having to worry about a Sim's Needs whilst working

,
PlumbBobToggle- Stops the plumbbob showing.,
ShowHeadlines off- Removes thought bubbles.,
AllMenus on- Bloody hard to activate.,
Piece it together!

,
I use Windows Movie Maker.",How to Make a Sims 2 Music Video," Watch some videos. Jaydee has made a fantastic video for the song 'Helena' by My Chemical Romance. Look at what she does well. Watch a lot of videos, mainly amateur ones. What did you like about them? What didn't go well? It's important to note what makes the videos special.;
, Three minutes of a Sim playing guitar/singing can grow very boring, very quickly. I find that doodling characters on a piece of paper can help you to come up with something quickly. Also, try to make it fit the song's lyrics. Whilst this isn't necessary, it removes confusion and overall helps the music add to the video.

, I would suggest using Bodyshop for this. In Bodyshop, you can edit and re-edit, and there are a lot more options. Take a while to get your characters to look as close to how you want as possible. Make them unique- with no subtitles or voiceovers, characters can easily blend into each other. If characters don't look different to you but do to everyone else, it will become very confusing for the viewer. Stick to the minimum amount, and make sure you can tell them apart easily.

, Do not make a house! You want sets: groups of 2-4 walls with what you need and nothing else. Here's a good link to a set building tutorial:

,, Hit TAB to enter it. Your mouse will disappear, as will the Sim's information. Use the arrow keys to move around, the mouse to change angles and the X and Z keys to zoom in and out. You can get much more extreme shots, easily. Look for interesting or unique angles, but make sure you can see what's going on. The closer, the better! Never show plumb bobs, thought bubbles, the sky, the outside or idle Sims unless intended. Being able to see what you shouldn't distracts from the video.

,,, You need money for set building.

,, Good for sets.

, It can be dangerous, make sure you look up a boolprop guide before using it.

,, Must have!

, Also must have!

, It involves digging around in your system files a bit. But when it's on it's amazingly helpful. Google it.

,, It comes free with PCs. For more professional results, you can download other programs, but Movie Maker is pretty good. Make sure you cut out anything you don't want- if you don't want to see it, we don't!

Get the ""Resurrect-o-Nomitron"" from the Career Rewards.,
Kill your Sim.,
Have the living Sim use the Resurrect-o-Nomitron.,
However, if you put the bid too low, the Grim Reaper will just take your money for wasting his time and not bring the Sim back.

,
Watch as your zombie will appear in a cloud of red smoke!

",How to Make a Zombie on the Sims 2," This is the item from the Paranormal Career track. Open the cheat bar with ""





+





+





"" and type in ""UnlockCareerRewards"". This will make all the career rewards available. Place the Resurrect-o-Nomitron somewhere on your lot.;
, Make sure you have more than 1 Sim on your lot who know each other, so the living Sim can resurrect the dead one.

, Click the icon of the deceased Sims face and put in a bid of 998 and 4127 Simoleons. This deciphers how many skill points the zombie will have.

,,"

Make your sim(s).,
Move them into a lot with a BIG yard.,
Hold crtl+Shift+c.,
Shift click on your Sim.,
Put your Sim inside the house.,
Click on the NPCT Killer and hit ""Kill all townies"".,
After the townies spawn but before everyone starts dying, go into Build or Buy mode.,
Save all of the townies you like by moving them outside.,
Sit back and watch the show.

,
Move the gravestones in a nice order or a crazy array.",How to Make a Murderer on the Sims 2," You can make one that lives on their own, has friends or family living with them, a family of murderers or anything else you can think of.;
, You are gonna have a lot of graves on your lot in a matter of minutes, so don't think you can pull the ""Just a FEW gravestones in my inventory"". Seriously, dude, that's sick.

, Type in boolprop TestingCheatsEnabled true.

, Hit Spawn...\Npc and Townie Maker. It should look like a big, dead tree.

, Delete any ways outside.

,


A bunch of townies will spawn near your Sim and die of starvation. Please note that some of them will spawn outside your house and get away unless you have a BIG house, so you may have to do this several times.







, Move all of the children (usually two) outside so the Social Worker doesn't come.

, Don't worry, they won't call the police.

,, Put flowers in front of them if you like.

"
"
While in game, press Ctrl+Shift+C.,
Now, get inside an occupied lot.,
Click on the Servo (without holding Shift) and choose ""initialize..."" and then ""male"" or ""female"".,
If you don't want to cheat, you can build robots on the non-evil robot workbench.",How to Make a Playable Robot Sim in the Sims 2," Then, in the cheat box type in ""boolprop testingcheatsenabled true"" without the apostrophes. Note the lowercase and spaces.;
, Hold Shift and click on any Sim. Choose ""Spawn..."" and then ""New Servo"". A robot should appear next to you. If these options aren't listed, choose ""More..."" until it appears.

, This will choose the sex of your Servo. Females look just like males, except with a bow, eyelashes, and a dress for formal wear. A window with a text box should appear. Type in his/her name. <""BZZZ!""> Your Servo is powered up and ready to rock!

, Eventually your Sim will receive a gold talent badge, and be able to build as many servos as you want.

"
"
Put plenty of trees that can bear fruit on the lot.,
Infest the trees with bugs.,
Spray the trees.,
Repeat the steps.",How to Make a Plant Sim in The Sims 2," To do this go to the Build section, then to Garden Center, and select Gardening. Place any types of trees on the lot. Seven trees is often a good amount.


Don't put the trees in a greenhouse, or else the bugs won't gather.;
, Doing this is simple, and can be done in two ways.



Normally: Let the trees sit around for a few days. They should start to gather bugs.

Using cheats: Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C and type in boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true, and hit ↵ Enter. Then, infest the trees with bugs by shift-clicking them and selecting DEBUG - Infest with bugs. Afterwards, disable cheats by pressing Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C and typing boolProp testingCheatsEnabled false, and hitting ↵ Enter.

, Have your Sim spray the infested trees by clicking on them. You will need to have your Sim spray the trees at least 15 times to have a chance of making a Plant Sim, although it often takes more than 15.

, Your Sim must continue spraying the plants without a break, or it might not work. Once your Sim has sprayed the trees enough times, a cloud of smoke will surround your Sim and turn them into a Plant Sim!


If you ever want to make your Plant Sim a normal Sim again, all you have to do is call up the Garden Club by clicking the phone and choosing Service. Once they come, simply buy the Plantophic-C potion and direct the Plant Sim to drink it.

Go to Build Mode.,
You have 2 choices here.,
Make a family of 1 person and call him Zoey Zookipa.,
Let Zoey live his life in the neighborhood well.,
You will probably see messages like, ""You invited me to spend the night, but I'm leaving!"".,
Make a ""death area"".,
If you want it to get really wild, put stray animals in the zoo.,
Pretty soon, the Grim Reaper will show up.,
Or you could create another Sim, make Zoey have WooHoo with her, get pregnant with children (type forcetwins to have twins) and then put her in the zoo, along with the kids who you shall name Jenny and Maurice, no matter what gender they are.,
Have evil fun!

",How to Make a Human Zoo on the Sims 2," Make a big box with no door, windows, but in the middle there must be a staircase. Make sure it is not touching the walls. You can put paint on the walls, but the Sims will enjoy it more. You now have the base of your zoo.;
, You can put created Sims in or random Sims that walk in from the neighborhood. Random Sims are better because they all contrast. This guide shows it for random Sims but you can edit the steps to fit your style.

, Weird, but it helps. Give him a small, cheap apartment with some creature comforts, who says it has to look good?

, People will come to greet him, including your other Sims if you have any. Make sure the MoveObjects on cheat is turned on, then once you see somebody walking near your house, pause your game, click on them, and move them to the zoo. The mailmen always escape somehow, so don't even bother putting them in.

, Ignore them. Once a week, let another Sim from the zoo live with Zoey (if they develop a strong relationship with him, move them in to a nicer apartment) to experience creature comforts and then throw her back in to the zoo. Put one plate of food in the zoo once a day. Put the cheapest bed in but only one and it's only for once a week. No toilets or sofas or anything. It's cruel, but it's life.

, This is optional. Make a small box (as in tiny, not much bigger than the Sim) and if somebody gets on your nerves by giving you so many messages, put them there. They will die in a short time.

, Dogs like Rover and Spot will come more often if Zoey has a dog. Call the dog Bleh. Same with cats, but call your cat Cindercra. Tried and tested method, this zoo worked better with these names so just follow the steps.

, Let him do his job unless there is someone you want to save, then take them to Zoey's bed. They will heal.

, Call the adult Bobette.

Post the video on YouTube.",How to Make a Good Sims 2 Series," Make sure it goes with the theme. If its a comedy, then don't name it something dramatic. Name it something clever! It may take a bit, but when you think of ones you like, write them down then later on take a vote! Get a few other peoples opinions.;
, Is it going to be a comedy? A romance? Drama? Horror? Or maybe a mix of everything?

, This is optional, but is highly recommended, as Maxis Sims isn't that good compared to some good downloadable CC, such as CrAzYtHiNg, or something what is unique. Making unique characters for your series is pretty cool, as you can express yourself and your character Sims.


Maxis clothing and hairstyles are a bit dull. Try downloading some custom content to make your Sims stick out.







, Build a house, buy a house or download a house. If you buy a house, change it up and make it look cool!

, Be sure not to make too many characters, excess actors can clutter up the set and make it hard to keep up with all the stories.

, Bigger rooms can be easier to film in, but are harder to make look good and presentable.

, This will give your family the money required to move in to your set without having to move in to another lot and use motherlode.

, If you are new in making videos with the Sims 2, watch lots of other series and Sims 2 movies.


Using some of the YouTube tutorials might be helpful.







,, This will make the video seem more professional and well-done.

, Also change the camera settings to the highest possible, but keep the file quality to high, not high(uncompressed). Change the maximum recording time to 9999s.

, This is useful for smooth and professional looking camera movements. Consider putting parameters into your game.

, Make it interesting, and leave your audience with a question at the end of an episode, so you have a plot for your next show, and it excites your viewers! At the end of every season, get that question answered. Never do too much of the same plots, it'll get boring!

,, Make a folder for all the videos in your series.

, Post up a trailer for your series or movie. Get people excited.

, You may not like hacking and cheats, but making a film with them is very ""professional"" looking, as if you use the allMenus cheat (look on 'How to use the allMenus cheat on Sims 2 PC' for a detailed tutorial on how to download it) you can make your Sims do any type of option what they wouldn't have at that stage.-

Purchase The Sims 2.,
Explore Cameraman view.,
Plan out your series.,
Create your cat.,
Make 2 empty lots (the biggest size works best for sets), one for your Mains, the next for your extras.,
Begin filming!,
Download video and picture editing software from the web.,
If you are using subtitles for the video, have a fun, nice soundtrack to go with it.,
If you are doing a voice over video, pick voice actors with a personality and voice that fits your characters.,
Make sure you save often, while you are playing the game, and when you're making your movie.,
When you are done with your episode or movie, upload it to a video sharing site such as YouTube, Vimeo or DailyMotion and give a link to your friends.",How to Make a Machinima Series with the Sims 2," This article assumes that you already own the game, and know the basic game play.;
, This is found by pressing Tab. In this mode, you can discover lots of new angles, zoom in more, and discover more areas of the game. The camera controls are Q, W, E, A, S, Z, and X. This is extremely helpful, since you cannot see objects become highlighted when moused over, and the angles are much more creative then the basic camera. You can exit Cameraman by simply pressing Tab again.

, Make a list of main characters, extras, settings, the number of seasons you intend to create, episode titles, soundtrack, descriptions, etc.

, Make one family for your main characters, then your extras. Make them look different. Don't have a cast of all goths, punks, preps, jocks, nerds, etc. (unless the storyline has to do with a bunch of similar people).

, Then move your families in. Move the extras in first, give them a phone, and then move your Mains into the next lot. Then build the set. Play the family for a bit, then wait for your neighbors to come over to greet you. At least one of your extras will stop by.


Turn on testingcheats (see the Tips section below) and make one of the main characters greet them. Hold down Shift and click on the extra (we call this Shift+clicking) click on Make Selectable. Raise both relationships to at least 25 by performing friendly actions or by going to the Relationships panel of either Sim and dragging the relationship bar to the right.
When it comes time to record your scene, Shift+click the extra again and choose Make Unselectable, and then make one of your main characters say goodbye to everyone. Get a Sim to pick up the phone and call the same extra and choose Invite Household, choosing every extra you need. They will come over, and now you can make them all selectable.

,


Videos look best on Medium, High, and High uncompressed quality, and when the size is Large. Be warned: this can slow down your game when filming.

, If you have a computer with Windows Me, XP or Vista, it comes with a basic editor called Windows Movie Maker. If you have Windows 7, 8.1 or 10, you can download the Windows Essentials which will give you an updated version of Windows Movie Maker for those versions of Windows. On Mac, you will have a program called iMovie. For picture editing, you can get The GIMP, which is a free image editor similar to Adobe Photoshop.

, Use songs that you think people would like, and songs that will capture attention of viewers.

, Try to vary voice actors or voices, so viewers can distinguish between characters.

, The feeling you get when you lose all your hard work is awful, and nobody likes to have to start from scratch. Make sure that you turn off all cheats and that no Sim is on the phone when you save, or else you might corrupt your file. (Yes, you can corrupt your game by saving with Sims on the phone!)

, Make sure your description is appealing so that it attracts lots of other viewers. Remember that many people online will say bad things in the comments. Just ignore them. On YouTube, you can delete their comments and report the troll to YouTube.

All you need to do is hold the keys ctrl shift and C. You will see a white box, in which you will need to type: Boolprop testingcheatsenabled true


(If on sims3, testingcheatsenabled true) This cheat will enable you to drag needs up, kill sims, make them get pregnant and more!",How to Kill Your Sim in the Sims 2," Remove all fridges, phones, and anything else that can raise your Sim's hunger motive. Removing the phone might not seem necessary, but keep in mind that your Sims could use it to order pizza (or Chinese food if you have University). Your Sims will whine, cry, and yell at you for not feeding them; ignore them and wait. After they whine and cry for awhile, they'll curl up into a ball and die.;
, Get a Sim that is bad at cooking. Buy the cheapest stove, or even better, a microwave. Cook a big dinner and then let it burn away. For maximum effect, fill the room with plants and wooden furniture, and delete the door. Remember to remove any fire alarms, as this will automatically call the fire brigade. If all of your Sims are good cooks, buy the decoration that shoots fire. You can find it in Decorative/Misc. Simply place it adjacent to any item in the room, including your Sim.


Buy a fireplace and a heart-shaped rug. Place the rug in front of the fireplace and light a fire. Before long, the rug will catch fire. You can also buy a rug made of flowers, found in the Decorative/Misc. section.

, Make your vampire Sim walk outside during the day! They will use their hands to shield their face and turn to ash.

, If you have University, a Sim who reaches the top of the Natural Science career will be rewarded with a Cowplant. Neglecting to feed the Cowplant will make it attempt to lure Sims with its cake-shaped tongue and eat them. Typically a Sim will die upon being eaten, with a few exceptions (if their hygiene is very low, for instance).


After a Sim is eaten by the Cowplant, have another Sim milk the plant for a delicious, life-extending drink.

, If you have Apartment Life, your Sim has access to elevators. Make your Sim ride a broken elevator when their needs are low. They will walk out dizzy, then die.

, If you have Apartment Life, you can purchase a Murphy Bed (a bed that folds out from the wall). If a Sim with low motives sleeps in a Murphy Bed, it can fold in on them and crush them.

, The Sim is outside in a storm when lightning strikes him and he dies. No one goes outside because Max was mean...

, The nicest way to go. Grandma Mary is 97 and she meets the Grim Reaper and two lovely hula girls. The hula girls do a dance and Mary packs her bag, holds the Grim Reaper's hand and dies.

, Noah gets hit by hailstones as big as Soccer Balls. Noah dies and everyone wakes up and runs outside and cries. So sad.

, Milly goes and tries to fix the radio in a puddle of water that Jim was meant to clean up. She has no mechanical skill so she gets electrocuted and dies. Jim thinks she wet herself and slept so he cleans up the puddle and realizes she's dead.

, Get a pool with no ladder, just a diving board. Make your Sim jump into it. They will soon drown. Or, if you have Seasons, tell them to jump into the pool; you won't need a diving board. A relative can't plead with the grim reaper because they can't access the death site, so the drowned Sim has no opportunity to be revived.

, Create a family of about 8 Sims and just put them on a lot. No house, nothing else and just hit that fast-forward key until the grim reaper shows up. Once everyone's dead, exit, but do not bulldoze the lot. Place another family on the lot (feel free to build a house this time if you like). Do this often enough and you will have a lot full of urns and tombstones in no time. Living Sims can be scared to death by the ghosts.

, If you wait long enough, a satellite will fall down and crush your Sim. Note: this is neither a speedy nor efficient form of death and is about as likely as alien abduction at any given moment.

, After you've killed all of the other Sims, their ghosts may very well scare the living daylights out of your survivors.

, Put your Sim in a narrow hallway filled with rotting food/dirty dishes. Stepping on a tile with rotten food carries a small chance that a swarm of flies will engulf your Sim.

, Also, you can't die from a cold, but colds turn into pneumonia, which can kill you.

, Enable the movement cheat (type ""move_objects on"" exactly as it is seen here, minus the quotes, into the cheat box. The cheat box can be displayed by pressing Ctrl, Shift, and C at the same time) and, in Buy Mode or Build mode, use the Hand tool to drop your Sim into the room.

, Go through the menu until you see the spawn option. Click on it, then go to Rodney's death creator. A little tombstone will appear next to your Sim, click on it, and chose the way your Sim dies.

, Shift+click a sim, then click ""Kill"", then click ""Die by flies"". This will force death by flies. To do this to a townie you must first have the boolProp cheat activated, shift click on them and click ""Make Selectable"". Then you can kill them.

, This program comes with many of the methods listed above, such as ""Dying of Fright"", sickness, fire, satellite, so on and so forth. There is also an option to have your sim die of old age. Find it here. You must register for a free account first, however.

,, Hold shift and press your sim, press spawn.
It will come up with a large selection of actions. Press Rodney's death creator.
It will come up with a tombstone in your home.
Press the tombstone and there will be a variety of ways to kill your sim.
If you choose to delete this tombstone, you can sell it in the shop or simply hold shift and press force error.
It will come up with a large blue rectangle. Press delete. The tombstone will be gone. If you wish to do the need-dragging, you must go to a location on the sims, or reload the neighbourhood and go back to the home. You will then be able to drag the needs up!

If you are the only person who uses your computer, then your account is very likely the administrator account.;
, If you have the 4-CD version, insert the first disc in the set. If you have the DVD version, then just insert the DVD. The disc should start automatically.


If the disc does not start automatically, open Windows Explorer by pressing ⊞ Win+E and then double-click on the Sims 2 disc icon.

, During the installation you will be prompted to enter the CD key. This key is located on the insert that came in the case, or it is printed on the case itself. You will not be able to install the game without the key.

, Most users can leave the default installation location, but you can change it if you need to install the game somewhere else, such as on another hard drive.

, There is really no need to register the game anymore, as Sims 2 has long since been abandoned by EA. Registering will only put you on EA's promotional email list.

, If you are installing the 4-CD version, you will prompted to insert the next CD at a certain point of the installation. Eject the first CD and then insert the next one. Close the tray and click the OK button to continue the installation. If the program reports that the next disc has not been inserted, wait a few moments and then click again.

, Sims 2 came out a long time ago, and there have been several patches released since. Download the latest patch available for either the CD or DVD version, depending on which one you installed.


You can find the patches on popular download sites such as FilePlanet or popular Sims sites such as ModTheSims.
You will need the first disc or the DVD inserted in order to play the game

, Sims 2 uses a ""build-upon"" structure for expansions, which means they will need to be installed in a specific order. Taking stock of what you have before you begin will make installing the expansions much easier.

, Look at the list below to see what order the expansions will need to be installed in. If you have an assortment of expansions, but not all of them, install them in the order they appear on this list. If you don't install in the correct order, you will encounter errors when you try to play. If the base game that you installed was Sims 2 Double Deluxe, there will be some exceptions on the list.


University
Nightlife (Ignore if you installed Sims 2 Double Deluxe)
Christmas Party Pack
Open for Business
Family Fun Stuff
Glamour Life Stuff
Pets
Happy Holiday Stuff (Ignore if you installed Sims 2 Holiday Edition)
Seasons
Celebration Stuff (Ignore if you installed Sims 2 Double Deluxe)
H&M Fashion Stuff
Bon Voyage
Teen Style Stuff
FreeTime
Kitchen & Bath Interior Design Stuff
IKEA Home Stuff
Apartment Life
Mansion & Garden Stuff

, Insert the installation disc for the first expansion you have on the list above. Follow the prompts to install it.

, You will need to patch each expansion with the latest version if you want to run them on modern operating systems. You can download patches at ModTheSims or other Sims fan sites.Patch each expansion after installing but before you start installing the next expansion. This will help you keep track of which ones have been updated.

, Continue down the list, installing and patching each expansion you want to use. When you are finished, use the shortcut for the latest expansion you have installed to play the game.

, Sims 2 was not designed to run on operating systems past Windows XP, and will often run into issues on Windows Vista, 7, and 8. If your Sims 2 games and expansions work fine, then you can ignore this section. If you are receiving compatibility errors, changing the compatibility mode may resolve them.

, Make sure that you are right-clicking on the shortcut for the latest expansion that you have installed, as this will be the one you run when you play the game.

, In the Properties window, click the ""Compatibility"" tab.

, Check the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" box and then use the drop-down menu to select Windows XP (Service Pack 3). If Windows XP is not available, select Windows Vista.


Check the ""Run this program as an administrator"" box to ensure that your computer runs Sims 2 using the administrator account.

, Once you've set the compatibility settings, you can try running the game by double-clicking the icon as usual. The Sims 2 has a finicky relationship with Windows 7 and Windows 8, and there is no clear reason as to why it works on some machines and not others.

, There are a lot of reasons that Sims 2 might not be working, even after changing the compatibility mode. Sims 2 was not designed for modern operating systems, so your results will most likely vary.


Some suggest that using integrated motherboard graphics instead of a dedicated graphics card can cause it to fail.
Having a 64-bit version of Windows may cause issues, but it has been proven to work on some 64-bit systems.
Many people report better results with Windows 8.1 as opposed to Windows 8.If you have a powerful computer, you can install Windows XP on a virtual machine and then run Sims 2 through the virtual machine.

Decide on how many people will be using the bathroom.,
Decide on the size and shape.,
Put in walls and floors.,
Put in a toilet, sink(s), shower and/or tub.,
Add lights and decorations.",How to Make a Bathroom in Sims 2," Is it a downstairs powder room or a private bathroom in a mansion? Thinking about this will help you determine the size of your bathroom so you can fit more or less items. Powder rooms should be on the bottom floor, and a bathroom should be on the top floor. If your Sims will be having kids, make them have a separate bathroom upstairs, and a master bathroom for the parents.;
, Bathrooms come in many different shapes and sizes. You shouldn't make a bathroom smaller than 2x2. Make an outline of the walls. Feel free to add diagonal walls, and never make a box. This is because it simply looks boring. Too many diagonal walls, though, will probably just look weird.

, Usually tile or hardwood flooring works best, but really any floor will do. And for walls, tile is good for showering areas. Try paint or wallpaper for the rest of the bathroom. But, it's up to you. To fill the whole area, Press Shift and click on the floor or wall.

, The toilet should be close to the sink, but doesn't have to be right next to it. Putting the shower by the tub is a good idea, or use a shower/tub. As for sinks, you can use a vanity or pedestal sink. For a vanity, put in a counter with a sink on top. Pedestal sinks just need the sink, and can be found in the buy catalog in the plumbing section. Powder rooms don't need a bathtub or shower, but make sure that at least one of your bathrooms has a shower or tub.

, Wall lights and ceiling lights work best. For decorations, here are some ideas:


A towel rack by the sink
A plant beside the toilet
A mirror or medicine cabinet above the sink
A rug in front of the tub or shower
A statue or fountain by the entrance
A separate spa room
Diagonal foundation with a candle on top
A painting above the tub

Be strategic about where you look for possible dates. For example, if your Sim is interested in books, check at the bookstore or library.
The romance will go faster if a Sim has one of these traits: Charismatic, Friendly, Flirty, or Hopeless Romantic.A Sim with Commitment Issues or Unflirty will be a difficult partner, but not impossible.;
, If you want two Teens to start a relationship, there are a few things you should know first:Teens can start a romance with another Teen, but cannot get married until they both age to Young Adult.
When one teen ages to Young Adult, romantic interactions with the Teen will disappear. You can continue the romance once the Teen ages.

, To increase the odds of success and unlock new options, train your Sim's Charisma skill.Also keep an eye out for lifetime rewards that can make romance easier, such as Attractive and Never Dull., Select one of the Sims and have him or her interact with the other. The Sims 3 gives a large number of social options. Try starting with a few conversation topics, then move on to other positive Social interactions. You might have a few setbacks along the way, but it should only take a few meetings to become Acquaintances, then Friends.


Whenever you can, choose conversation options based on the other Sim's traits. A Vehicle Enthusiast enjoys talking about cars, and a Technophobe will hate talking about electronics.
Relationships decrease over time. Invite the Sim over the next day to keep your forward momentum.

, The ""Ask if Single"" option under the Romance option will have an effect even before you become friends. Try this early on so you know the other Sim's relationship status. A Sim that's already in a relationship is usually much harder to woo.


If you do succeed in breaking up the Sim's relationship, both Sims will lose a massive amount of relationship with the former partner. Decide whether it's worth it before you continue.

, Most Romantic interactions will have no effect until your Sims are at least Friends (about 40% of the bar).After this point, you can start making a move with these low-pressure options:Compliment Personality
Compliment Appearance
Flirt

, If the other Sim reacts positively, you'll see a message that he or she thinks you're being flirty. This is a good time to continue the Romantic interactions, but be careful. Going too fast can make the other Sim back out. Even if you move on to ""alluring,"" you might want to stick to the basic options for now.

, Once you've had a couple flirty interactions and your relationship bar has moved steadily upward, invite the Sim over again. This time, flirt until you get the ""alluring"" short-term context option. This unlocks new options:


Try setting the stage by gazing into the other Sim's eyes, embracing, or whispering into the Sim's ear.If everything is going well, try a First Kiss, Confess Attraction, or Massage. If the Sims aren't Romantic Interests yet, they should be after one of these succeeds.

, Now you know the basics of flirty interaction, and probably have a sense of what the other Sim likes. Try to repeat this every day, without jumping ahead too quickly.

, After a couple meet-ups, keep flirting until the context changes to irresistible. This will unlock new options that advance the relationship toward marriage.

, This ""irresistible"" option will make the Sim your Boyfriend or Girlfriend. Romantic interactions will be easier after this point, and you won't need to jump through as many hoops to unlock them.


After this point you should avoid flirting with other Sims, as it will hurt your relationship with your steady date.

, If you haven't already, start choosing options like Make Out and Leap into Arms. If you're near a bed or certain other objects, you can select Woohoo as well. Some Sims will Woohoo right away, while others are reluctant. It is not required to start a marriage.

, Eventually, this option will unlock during an ""irresistible"" context. You can propose as many times as you like, but spend some time building up the relationship between attempts.

, To get married instantly, select Romantic → Have Private Wedding. For a big celebration, have the engaged Sim use a cell phone to Throw a Party and select wedding.Once married, you can move the other Sim into your household.


T Generations expansion pack adds many marriage-related options and items. This includes wedding arches, wedding cake, and bachelor / bachelorette parties.

, This method doesn't just use cheats. It enables a special mode the developers use to test the game. This mode enables many extra interaction options, but using them incorrectly can break the game. Your save file might be permanently destroyed.

, There are two reasons to use this cheat:


You can make any two Sims Best Friends so you can get straight to the romance.
If you encounter the ""moving bug"" that freezes the game when you try to move a Sim into the house, this bug will get around that.

, Press Control + ⇧ Shift + C at the same time to open the cheat console at the top of the screen.


Windows Vista users may need to hold down the Windows key as well., In the cheat console, type in TestingCheatsEnabled true. Hit ↵ Enter.

, Now you can immediately make two Sims Best Friends. This should unlock early Romance options.

, If you're trying to get around the ""moving bug,"" hold down ⇧ Shift and click on the Sim you want to add. You should see new options appear in the menu. Select ""Add to active household.""


The other Sim must be in the house and not already married.

, As mentioned above, the testing cheats unlock options that can seriously mess up the game. Open the cheat console again (Control + ⇧ Shift + C) and type TestingCheatsEnabled false, then hit ↵ Enter.

Click the ""Game Updates"" tab on the Sims 3 Launcher and then click the ""Update Now"" button. The patch will be downloaded and applied to your game.;
, Using this cheat can cause glitches to appear in your game, so it's always wise to save before cheating just in case something goes wrong and you need to revert.

, You can open this at any time by pressing Ctrl + Shift + C.


If that doesn't open the console, some users have reported that the Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + C works instead., This will enable special menus when you Shift-click things in the game.

, You will not see the option if you try to edit your active Sim.

, Select ""Edit Sim in Create a Sim"" from the menu hat appears.


You cannot edit Pregnant Sims, Imaginary Friends, Ghosts, Vampires, or Mummies., This will likely take a few minutes.

, Be aware that doing this will occasionally cause glitches, as the game was not designed to support this. Not all of your changes will take effect when you finish, and your game may crash when exiting CAS.


Editing a Sim in CAS will reset it to the beginning of its age stage. For example, if you have a Young Adult Sim that's a day away from becoming an Adult, editing her in CAS will revert her to the beginning of her Young Adult stage.

, There will also be the options to purchase scrap metal, which you can do but a) you won't need scrap metal just yet and b) if you have Sims Pets 3, then you can adopt/buy a dog and get it to give up scrap metals.

, Your Sim's first creation will only be a toy and it will not sell for more than a few dollars, but as you invent more and more, your inventions will become wackier and sell for more! However, to power your extravagant inventions, you will need some scrap metal (which you can purchase at the workbench, or dig it up with a dog in the Sims Pets) to power your invention, or you will need a ghost (which you can catch with the ghost zapper, which you will invent eventually, or you can get a cat to catch them in Sims Pets) to power your invention.

, When you find one, click on it and collect it.

, The rarer the thing you collect, the more it will sell for.

, This method can be hit or miss as it is not really a skill that your Sim gets better at so it's basically your ability for this method, not your Sim's ability.

, If you have purchased a version of the game where you can control your pet (such as The Sims Pets 3 for PlayStation 3), instead of getting your Sim to teach the cat to hunt, simply click anywhere outside, select the Hunting... interaction and then select the Stalk Something interaction (it will be the only interaction on the list). If you can't control your cat in your version of The Sims Pets 3, just use the Teach To Hunt interaction often (note that if you use it too much your cat will probably get the Brain Hurts moodlet and you will not be able to teach your cat anything for several hours).

, If they did, sell what your cat caught (they will probably catch a beetle). The rarer the thing caught, the more the thing will sell for! As you probably figured, this method is just like the collecting method but it is much more efficient!

, This will dig a hole and you will possibly find something buried underground...

Frosty Hills






Sim Town






Crystal Falls






Summerville






Maple Hill






""your name here"" City






Your neighborhood's name





;
, Every Sims neighborhood has at least one of these, and your neighborhood probably does, too. Here are some community lot ideas for you to pick from:

Clothing Store. Includes a cash register, clothing racks, a cash register, etc.






Grocery Store. Has produce, a cash register, etc.






Pool. Has an indoor and/or outdoor pool. You may also include a gym if you want. Don't forget locker rooms!






Park. Includes garden items, benches, lakes, etc.







,, This is obviously a very important step. Make houses of all different sizes, from 2 by 3 to 4 by 4! If you're not very good at making houses, download them or use ones from the Lots & Houses bin. Also, use a variety of styles, like Modern, Club, and Colonial.

, What neighborhood doesn't have a few trees? You can put in street signs, rocks, trees, statues, and cool effects like a helicopter. But over-doing it can slow down your computer.

, Every neighborhood needs Sims, of course! You can customize their hair, face, clothes, and personality. Give them a name, and press the checkmark button when you're all finished with a family. They'll be in the family bin for you to move in.

Schedule the date.,
Pause the game as soon as the date begins.,
Keep the flow of wants going.,
Take advantage of places beforehand.,
Keep an eye on the meter at all times.",How to Have a Successful Date in Sims 2," Be sure that the two Sims do not have any plans (for example class or work). It's upsetting to forget if one of them has work at 9 pm when you start the date at 7:30 pm and you automatically get the ""1 hour"" warning for them to leave.;
, Use this time to see what both Sims want to do and accomplish in the date. Look at both of their needs ""dice"". If one of the Sims wants to make out, select the other Sim and put the action ""Make Out"" as one of their actions. As soon as this is successfully done, that Sim's dice will re-roll for other activities.

, Avoid having them move on to something else, for example watching TV. Cancel any self actions and have them concentrate on the date. If they are not interested in the date or cancel out your actions, call out the date immediately.

, Every Sim, at one point, wishes to ""dine"" with another Sim on a date. Have both of them in a restaurant setting before starting the date. Dining consumes a lot of the date time, so it's best to be there rather than trying to call for transportation at the last minute.

, The date meter determine how the date is. It always starts on ""okay"" and will go up and down depending on your Sims enjoys or dislikes the date. To have a successful date, you'll either need to finish the date as ""very good"" or ""dream date"". Achieving a ""dream date"" will make the Sims remember it as a memory. Their relationship level may also grow or drop on the result of the date.

How is your business doing?,
Restock, Restock, Restock.",How to Have a Successful Business on the Sims 2 Open for Business," There are many options for this. You can make a Flower Shop, a Toy Store, an Arcade, a Pet Store, a Grocery Store, a Nightclub, a Restaurant/Diner, a salon, a bakery, a Furniture Store, or a Bowling Alley. Be creative, and use your other expansion packs (if any) to your advantage. Figure out what skills your Sim has, too. Are they good at cooking? Then you might want to make them have a bakery. If they have Mechanical, you might want to make them own a toy business.;
, You can either make this on a community lot, or you can make your Sim have a home business. I recommend a home business for something like a flower or toy shop, but a community lot for a restaurant or bowling alley. If you are selling something, put the smaller items on shelves. And put a lot, too, because items sell quickly! Include a cash register for most businesses, and it's good to have a restroom. Put a green store sign outside the door so customers will know when the store is open. For a restaurant or diner, you'll need Sims 2 Nightlife.

, If it is a home business, click the phone, then business, then start home business. If they are going to work from a different lot, click ""purchase community lot."" You may need extra $$$ to buy a lot.

, After your business is open, customers will come and start browsing around (except for a restaurant.) It's good to help them find what they need, so click on a customer if they look confused. It's also good to be a pro at working the register, because if you are too slow, customers will get mad and leave. Don't worry, though, as time goes by you will get better at the register.

, If you feel that things are out of control and more people are needed, you can hire employees. Click on the phone to do this. There are good and bad things about employees. The good thing, of course, is you don't have to be two places at once, so while you are helping customers or restocking, they could be working at the register. The bad things are that you need to pay them, and sometimes they don't work. If you have a home business, however, you can have other family members work for you without having to pay them!

, You can check this by the giant thing in the upper right corner of your screen. It shows who is a customer, how much money you gained (or lost), who your employees are, and more. Look at it frequently so you know how your business is doing.

, When Sims buy things, more items don't magically reappear! To restock, there should be an X sign on the item that was there before. Click it to restock. Go to ""tips"" to find an easier way. :D

, Like the above, making a few friends before you get a job can make it easier (when you get Nightlife, don't turn down the request to go Downtown with strangers) For all you know, you might meet a potential soul mate.

, Working on your career for a time before you start a family means you can have a nicer, bigger house and more money if you decide to have kids. Making best friends before making a move on a possible love interest means the chances of your actions being rejected are lowered.

Consider turning off Story Progression.,
Eat at least three apples to conceive a boy.,
Eat watermelons for a girl.",How to Get a Certain Child Gender on Sims 31," Pregnancy only lasts 72 Sim hours in The Sims 3. If you hear music while the Sims are trying to conceive a baby, they succeeded.You can also tell if your female Sim is pregnant if you press ""Go Here"" and you have no options like ""Run"" or ""Walk."";
, Although unconfirmed, there's a rumor that Story Progression tries to keep your town's gender ratio balanced.In other words, if your town has more women than men, the game might force the next baby to be male. It's worth turning this off in the Game Options menu, just in case.

, According to the Prima strategy guide, eating three apples during pregnancy makes it very likely that the baby will be a boy. This does not guarantee it completely, but it's the closest you can get without downloading a mod.


To be extra safe, some people recommend three apples each trimester (first, second, and third day of pregnancy).However, others have said that more than three won't increase your chances.

, This works the same way in the other direction. Have the pregnant Sim eat at least three watermelons to make the chance of conceiving a girl very likely.


Ever since an early patch (1.3), the fruit will only work when raw. Eating cooked foods that contain apple or watermelon has no effect on the baby's gender."

Increase the odds of twins.,
Ask a medical expert to identify the gender.,

You can't guarantee it, but taking these steps makes a multiple birth much more likely:Get the Fertility Treatment lifetime reward for one or both parents (getting it for both is likely to result in triplets).
During pregnancy, have the mother read pregnancy books, watch KidZone TV, and listen to children's music. You may do all three at the same time.
If you have the Showtime expansion, wish for a large family with a genie, or drink a procreation elixir., Find a Sim that's at least level 5 in the Medical career track (Resident or higher).Have the pregnant Sim have a friendly conversation with this doctor and ask to determine the gender of the baby. You will get a popup saying that you are expecting a boy or a girl. This prediction is always accurate — but only for one baby.


The pregnant Sim needs to be visibly pregnant before this option appears.

, As described above, eat watermelons for a girl or apples for a boy. If you're lucky and end up with twins (or triplets), this increases the chance of getting the gender you want for the second child.


For example, if the doctor predicts a boy, eat melons to increase the odds of a girl. One baby will be guaranteed to be a boy, but if he has a twin, there's a high chance it will be a girl.

Meet people.,
Befriend people.,
Invite over a friend (in The Sims 3, not real life).,
Make them your girlfriend/boyfriend.,
Break up with them.,
You'll be so swamped with Lifetime Happiness Points, you won't know what to do!

",How to Complete the Heartbreaker Lifetime Wish on the Sims 3," When you first start up The Sims 3, you get to the menu. If you're already in a town, please get back to the main menu. Now, before you go on, press Ctrl+Shift+C on your keyboard. Type ""testingcheatsenabled true"" without the quotation marks in the box that appears. Now you can enter your town of choice.;
, If you already made the Sim you want to use, just skip this step. Here are some suggested traits:


Flirty
Inappropriate
Great Kisser
Commitment Issues
Mean Spirited

, Now that you have your Sim, you have two options; move them into a pre-made house, or buy a lot and build them a house. Pick one.

, Now that your Sim is totally ready, it's time to meet some people. If you want to do this the old fashioned way, go right ahead! However, there is a much easier way to meet people; you don't even have to leave the comfort of your home! (This will only work if the cheats are on.) Shift+Click on your mailbox. Click on ""Make Me Know Everyone"". Now go to your relationships tab. You should know everyone. Wasn't that EASY? Although, you should see the warnings.

, Again, you can go out and actually TALK to people, but the other way is easier. (With the cheats on) CTRL+Click on the bar underneath your relationship with people in the relationships tab. Now, while keeping the CTRL and mouse button down, drag your cursor to the right. Your relationship should go up. Further to the right, better the friend. Repeat 10 times.

, There's a chance that they could be in work at the time you call them, in which case you just invite over another friend, and/or wait until they're done with work.

, If you're inappropriate, you can kiss them right away, helping your romantic relationship with a huge jump. If not, work your way up to that point by complimenting and flirting. After the first kiss, complimenting, flirting and massaging are all great ideas. Once an option pops up under the Romantic choices that says Propose Going Steady, select this. If they like you enough, they'll say yes.

, It's time to be Mean! Under the mean options for interaction, it'll say, Break Up. Click. Repeat ten times with your other friends.

If your Sim doesn't have a trait that would influence a career, like neat, choose a job that is interesting to you, or maybe one you haven't tried before!.,
Make sure to show up at work in a good mood.",How to Choose a Career for Your Sim in Sims 3," The Sims Wiki Career Chart shows all the base game jobs in a table and the jobs linked with expansion packs underneath. Remember, not just Ambitions introduced new jobs!;

, Even if your sim has a lifetime wish that is not based on a career you can still choose a career where you can forward your wish(have the same skill required for the job as for the wish).

, For example, an evil Sim will want to join the Criminal career, while a virtuoso will want to join the Music career. Sims with at least 1 skill point in a skill can register at city hall as self-employed in that skill.

, Or you could just choose a job with a better pay.

, Most careers start off with you being in a good mood then building up skills. So along with a good mood, build up skills and you will be raking in the dough!

You can also take action to increase or decrease a Sim’s emotion. For example, you can stab a voodoo doll which resembles another Sim to stop your Sim from being angry. Or, you can take a thoughtful shower to make your Sim inspired.
Sims now can multi-task in The Sims 4. This allows Sims to have group conversations and also prevents the annoying situation of your Sim leaving a half-eaten meal on the floor to socialize with another Sim.

, The options menu on the cell phone, located next to your Sim’s small face icon, includes options for finding a job and traveling. Your Sim will need money, known as Simoleans, to purchase anything.


To get more money, you can get your Sim a job by calling job employers on your Sim's phone or by using your Sims' computer and searching for a job. Unless you get the “Get to Work” expansion, Jobs are unfortunately not playable. This means that you will fast forward time until the end of your shift unless you have more than one controllable Sim.
Alternatively, you can make money through hobbies and skills, such as selling paintings or writing books.
You can also zoom out on your map to travel to other locations and find more activities and Sims. Zoom out until you see the magnifying glass. Clicking it will let you travel to parks, bars, and the gym where you can meet new Sims.

, Go to 'Friendly' then 'Get to Know' to find out about them.

, You first start out as an Acquaintance to every Sim (that is not in your family). Simply do friendly things in the 'Friendly' option.

Also become Best Friends before doing the next step if your Sim itself has the Unflirty trait.

,, Some Sims like it and some don't. If this Sim doesn't like it, go to the 'Friend' option again and find 'Apologize'. However, sometimes 'Apologize' won't work and you will just creep the other Sim out. In this case, just do other social interactions until the Sim stops finding you creepy.

, Then click on that and see what this Sim says. There is a good chance the Sim will say yes.

, If you don't want your partner to be in your active household, skip the previous step, and this step.

, If the sim responds well, carry on using Flirty interactions (use different interactions each time - the 'Hopeless Romantic' or 'Flirty' trait will add more options to the Romantic menu).

, Click this. The relationship will hopefully change from 'Friend' or 'Best friend' to 'Romantic interest'.

, Wait until 'Propose going steady' appears.

If you're getting bored with the options in Sims 4, you can look for custom content, or CC.,
Once you find something you're interested in, make sure it's compatible with your game.,

, Most times, this file with be a .zip or .rar. You'll need a tool to extract these files, so make sure you have one handy.


It can also come in the format of a .package, the most commonly used format for CC. You don't need to extract this format as it is already extracted for you.

, If you look for an Electronic Arts folder in your computer, chances are you'll find a Sims 4 folder within it if you own the base game. Open up the folder and you'll find many, many folders and files that you don't need to worry about. Simply look for the Mods folder and open it.

Do a Teen Runaway Challenge.,
Create your own challenges!",How to Have Fun on Sims 42," Challenges are exactly what they sound like - they're fan-made creations that are designed to make your gameplay much more interesting and challenging. A challenge doesn't normally require anything special to do - just your imagination.

Decide what rooms you want in your house.",How to Build a Large House on the Sims 34," Bedroom, bathroom,and kitchen are all necessary for a sim's survival. But since you have enough money to build much more than that, you will probably want to.

, Try adding big windows so sims can see your awesome house from the outside. Make sure to add some windows on the side of the house that is facing the road, or else your house might look a little, odd. There are really no big rules for doors.

Pay attention to the items that will give you the best possible room score:


Floors and walls that are worth at least 10 Simoleans each.,
Pay attention to the following elements that will kill your room score.,
Break the ice with the Headmaster.,
Make sure you have a child ready at the gate to greet them at 5 pm sharp.,

Give the Headmaster a tour of the house.,
Watch for the results.",How to Get a Child or Teen Into Private School in Sims 2," The first element to the Headmaster Scenario is the tour of the House. This can potentially earn a maximum 45 points. How you win this scenario is by having the best possible Room Score.;
,
Plenty of lighting around the house. It doesn't have to be expensive lighting, the area just has to be well-lit.
Artworks within the house and trees and a well maintained small garden outside the house all help to add to your score. The environment score is very important.

, In extreme cases, this can lead the Headmaster in leaving the lot the minute he gets there. He doesn't even need to enter the house.


Unpaid or ignored bills.
Broken objects.
Weeds in your garden.
Unpainted walls or a room with no roof.

, Some examples include a hot tub, the Myshuno game, or a bar. These things are bonuses and will make your score go up higher. You have to get the Headmaster to do these things with you.

, You have one hour to greet the Headmaster or they will leave. When he arrives, you have six hours to reach 90 points to win the scenario.

, The best meal that has worked are pork chops. Salmon is also a very good choice. Even if your Sim has all cooking points and is able to make lobster thermidor, it is a highly flammable dish and for most of the time, if you're not careful, can catch on fire. Start making dinner about 30 minutes before the Headmaster arrives, so it will be ready.

",How to Care for a Big Family on Sims 3," You know that at 8:00 the kids will go to school, so set an appropriate time to get up and make breakfast. Remember that the adults can get up a bit earlier to make dinner while the kids savour the last few minutes in bed. Set a good time to eat dinner so that the family is not left snacking all night long. Five o clock is nice. Make sure you have a meal whenever anybody is at home––your family will undoubtedly become unhappy if you do not make meals.;
, It makes things easier if the pets can quickly access their food at any time.

, Quit buying silly things like pools and cars for a while. It may help if you have high chairs for the toddlers so that they can stay there at mealtime. You may need dining tables so that the family is not standing around eating each day. Think about what you need.

, A penny saved is a penny earned.  In order to afford new things, you need to save on things you don't need. Save up for that spa instead of spending every last penny on it and then having none left.

, If you know your Mom has to stay home to look after the kids and animals, it would not be wise to get her a job and call a babysitter. Instead, get Dad a job and the teenager a part time job. Or, get the Mom a profession as a babysitter, so she can work from home. Remember you can reverse this and have a stay-at-home dad.

, They won't be happy if you forget to give them a TV or some toys for the kids. You can afford to get the kids ice creams and take the adults to the spa.

To master EVERYTHING there IS to know..You should watch some Youtube Videos.,
Watching Youtube videos on Machima, can be really helpful.,
Plan out a storyboard.,
Once you have your storyboard done, and your Sims moved in the house, everything they need.,
DO NOT USE FRAPS.,
Act.,
Fix it up!,
Put subtitles or voices if your adding any sound to it.,
Watch it over, make sure it has no mistakes!",How to Do the Mastering of Sims 2 Machima," Remember to NEVER copy off anyone's videos. It may be related, but you should twist a couple things.;
, It gives you a perfect idea of what to plan

, A storyboard is easy to make, just open a word processing program. Microsoft Word wouldn't really work, because it freezes too much, but if you're comfortable with it, it's fine. Just remember to save. What you need for story boards will also be put in materials file too. Plan out what kind of movie its going to be. Is it going to be freaky and scary? Or Funny and weird? Will it make sense? Is it a true story? Plan the characters. Is it just you and your family? Is it some random friends or neighbors? Is it just some classmates coming over? Is there a murderer? Plan out which house you're going to use. Try using a large house that costs a lot of money. There's a simple money cheat I love doing. Motherlode. (Without the period) just press Ctrl and shift, and c at the same time and type it in. Place your characters in a cheap-o- house when you made them, use the cheat, save, and move them out. You can use the cheat as many times as you want, so its perfectly fine to be rich! Don't forget to also use half the money share for items you're gonna buy in the house. Color the walls, floors, and other things around the house. Just decorate! Make sure it looks like what your story's about otherwise it will be like this: o. O People are gonna think that O__O Instead of XD! Make sure it makes sense! Unless it's a weird...Movie...Don't forget to write what's going to happen too!

, Build relationships. If you want a girl to fall in love with a boy in your movie. Talk and chat, crack jokes and once they become friends do a friendly hug. Then go to other options like romantic hug and kisses, even a crush is REALLY good to begin with. If you want a sim to hate another one, just get into fights, argue, brag and annoy! Do stuff people hate! Then you can get cooler options like fight, gross out, slap and shove! Its really amazing what you can do in the Sims 2! You can download cool things in Mod the Sims 2 and the official Sims 2 Site, like custom hair and clothes..Even pets and homes!

, Fraps will record EVERYTHING on your screen. Including the options, and the mini bars at the bottom. Always use the Sims 2 camera recorder which can be used by clicking Tab or finding it on the lower left corner of your screen. Make sure you zoom into the characters or it will be really crappy quality. If your recording everything, then explain to the viewers, it was really crappy and you couldn't do a thing about it, or people will lose interest and watch something else.

, Use the camera for about 1 minute or 30 seconds, whenever it closes when you don't want it to, whatever the Sims are doing, click PAUSE! Then click play and record again. Remember to access the video folder: Go to My Documents-EA Games-Sims 2 Double Deluxe-Movies

, Windows Movie Maker is really good and simple for Machima like this. You can edit, take out parts and put really cool effects. Its installed in your computer in the first place, just like for everyone else! Access it by: Start-All programs-Acsessories-Windows Movie Maker. To become the master of Windows Movie Maker, its best to play and explore around first, unless you already know how.

, Music can also be put. It doesn't matter if you're recording sound in the Sims 2 and you don't know, just mute it when your editing it, and put music and text, or just your voice.

, Then upload it to Youtube or other broadcasting sites. Remember to explain in the description and write everything the characters are saying just in case they can't hear/see it.

Take a cooking class.,
Watch TV.,
Buy recipes.,
Make your Sim a natural chef.,
Take all cooking opportunities.,
Make the same dish more than once.,
Grow your own veggies and fruits.,
Clean up after yourself.",How to Become a Level 10 Chef on the Sims 3," While this might seem like an enormous waste of time, it's a very easy way to get a free skill level in cooking without doing any work whatsoever.  Remember that you can only take this class if you have very little or no culinary experience, so don't wait!  Learn!;
, This step is a lot of fun, because not only will it make your Sim happy and boost their mood, it will give them cooking skill! Just remember to turn your television to the Cooking channel and watch your Sim's skill level rise!

,  While it is annoying to visit the book store a lot, when your Sim has enough skill to buy recipes, it's always smart to buy them. The more dishes your Sim can cook, the faster and more efficiently they can make more food and gain skill level.

, This will help your Sim to gain skill level much faster, and it will allow your Sim to 'kick it up a notch' on some recipes you make, which makes Sims enjoy the meal much more.  

, Even if the reward is only Simoleons, your Sim will gain more skill than normal if you take a cooking opportunity.

, If your Sim makes a dish that everyone seems to like, making it three or four more times in a week will greatly improve the Sim's skill and that dish will be magnificent, improving your Sims' moods and even keeping them from becoming hungry longer.

, This will make your recipes taste better and your Sims' moods will soar!

, Sims will become disgusted and not want to eat if there are dirty dishes all around the house!  Some Neat Sims will even go ballistic!

Decide what kind of house you will have.,
Now start designing where each room will go using the free wood in the third flooring tab.,
Build your walls along the edges of the different wood colours.,
Start to place the doors and windows.,
Style the walls and floors.,
Begin to add the furniture.,
Don't forget to add lighting!,
Have room for a garden, even a small one.,
Go back through the whole house and change, remove or add anything that you think will make the house look better.",How to Build a Cool House in Sims 3," Will it be one story, two, or more? What sort of style will it be? Will it have a basement? Who will be living in this house? What sort of colour themes will your rooms have? You have to consider all this things and more to build a really cool house for your sims.;
, Will your sims have an art studio? A big kitchen? A gym? Think about their skills and wants. Make each room have a different coloured floor. Don't worry if this looks rubbish or you make a mistake, the wood is free so you can keep trying until you get your base floor plan perfect!

, If your house will have more than one floor, then once the first level is done, map out which rooms will be upstairs using the same free wood trick as earlier. Try to make as few mistakes as possible with the walls, because they cost more to build than you will get back for destroying them. If you accidentally delete a wall, you can press Ctrl Z and it will undo your last action.

, You should already have a vague idea of what sort of design you want for the overall look. Try to place the doors and windows around that theme. You can add arches instead of doors for a more open-plan feel, or just cover the place in windows. Don't worry if your doors and windows don't match; you can always enter the style editor, then drag the colour of the one you like to the one you want to change.

, You can choose a design from the wall coverings, or create your own. Try to tile the bathroom and maybe the kitchen area, and decide whether the bedroom will have wall-to-wall carpet or a wood floor; it depends on your preference. Make the styles of both the walls and floor harmonious for each separate room. It will look better in the long run. And don't put down some carpet in a patch of wood floor; it looks ugly and there is a better way of doing it.

, Think about your sims tastes and the overall design of the house, this will help the interior and exterior work together to create a beautiful house. Try to make the furniture match; don't just go for the most expensive items. Make the furniture harmonious with the floor and wall colours, you can always recolour them.

, Your sims need to see at night, and will get negative moodlets if they are in the dark. But make sure you don't add too many lights, because this will add on to your sims bills, and will be bad in the long run.

, These can be used as places for your sims to relax or fish, up their logic or gardening skills. It's generally a place of peace. And a few plants can make you house look beautifully set in the landscape. A few things that you could do would be to place some sun loungers and an outdoor barbecue. Adding a pond means that your sims can fish, and an outdoor chess set helps them to improve their logic. You could add a driveway and a car space if you want.

, Maybe you can add a few paintings, or some potted plants and clock.


And that's it! You have finished your sims 3 house!

Breed your dogs.,
When it's time, your female dog puts out a random number of puppies with a graphic flourish.,
You will get a message listing the number of litters and a reminder to name them.,
A new litter will result in the the whole household getting the 'New puppies' powerful positive moodlet.

,
Sims looks at puppies and (either autonomously or user directed) say Awwwwwww.",How to Breed Your Pets on the Sims 3 Pets (Pc)1," With Sims, not every attempt results in pregnancy. But when your dog becomes pregnant, you get an on-screen message informing you. Another way to tell is if when pregnant, the interaction 'Try for baby' will not appear until after the dog has had her litters.;
, The pups will have some traits and markings from their parents or grandparents. They might also exhibit other random traits and markings. Puppies might even inherit the ability to do some tricks, if their parents or grandparents know some.

, To do so, click on the puppies and click the name pet interaction.

,, This results in the positive puppies moodlet.

Breed your cats.,
As with dogs, cats retire to the privacy of the 'pet' house to conduct their courtship.,
As with other pets, cats don't make a huge fuss.,
Kittens and puppies start eating solid food as soon as they are born.",How to Breed Your Pets on the Sims 3 Pets (Pc)2," Fortunately, cats never accidentally have kittens. Just as with dogs, you must deliberately breed your cats. Also, as with dogs, you need a doghouse on your lot before you can breed. That's right, a doghouse - well, technically, they're pet houses. But cats don't get their own private parlors of armor.

, When they emerge, the female cat has a chance of being pregnant. If so, you will get a message telling you to prepare for kittens.


When the cats are mates, ensure that their relationship bar is full. When it's full, and you have a pet house nearby, press the ""Try for kittens"". Get ready for kittens.

, They just pop out a few kittens in a sparkly flourish. You then get to name the kittens.

, Prepare to fill the bowls more often now.

Breed your horses.,
They enter the box stall and the action is blocked out.,
After a few day the mare drops the foal and you can name it.,
You can also get a foal by breeding the mare at the equestrian center and have her bred there.,
Raise your new foal.,
Foals don't like being separated from their mothers, nor do mothers like to be separated from their foals.,
What happens if a foal is permanently separated from its mother by sale, adoption or death?",How to Breed Your Pets on the Sims 3 Pets (Pc)3," You have several options when it comes to breeding horses. First, you could create a male and female horse and optionally set them to mate in edit relationships, which starts their relationship at a higher level than when you started. Then you need a box stall on your lot. Without a box stall, horses simply can't breed. If you have a pair of opposite gendered horses with a high enough relationship and a box stall, you can direct your horse to 'Try for baby'.

, You can see the typical shower of hearts around the horses. Just as with Sims not every try for baby results in a baby. Keep trying in till you get the message telling you the mare is pregnant.

, The foal will typically show characteristics of one or both parents. If the parent horse was trained, there is a chance the foal will inherit some of the relevant ability.

, This results in a foal for the household. Offering a male as a stud will results in money, not a foal.

, The new foal becomes playable member of the household. Foals have the same needs as horse expect, but they lack a thirst need. For foal, hunger and thirst are both fulfilled from either nursing from the mother or being bottle fed by Sims.

, They each gain negative moodlets from separation, lose their socialization quickly and generally are not happy until they reunite.

, The foal will miss its mother until it gains a friend or higher relationship with a household mare or ages up.

Choose a haunted house to play.,
Make your Sim study until she/he reaches level 10 of the cooking skill and level 7 of the fishing and gardening skill.,
Get your supplies to start.,
Buy the Ambrosia recipe book and make your Sim read the entire thing.,
Fish for the elusive deathfish.,
Obtain the rare life fruit.,
Using all the ingredients, make the ambrosia.,
Wait until the ghost appears at nightfall and move the ambrosia to a kitchen counter.,
Wait for the ghost to turn back into a human with an explosion of light.",How to Bring a Ghost Back to Life in Sims 3," The Crumplebottom household is a good place to start because Agnes Crumplebottom lives in a house with a ghost called Erik Darling and she also has a plentiful amount of cooking skill already, which you need to bring a ghost back to life. If you're really serious about doing this, then use the 'testingcheatsenabled true' cheat to add angler and natural cook to your sim's traits to make it easier to find ingredients that you need to resurrect a ghost.
, This can take a while, but if your sim has enough happiness points you can purchase a 'fast learner' reward that makes increasing the skills easier., After you have reached the appropriate skill levels, you are ready to begin the actual hunting for ingredients. Make sure you have enough money for the recipe book; if not, use the 'motherlode' cheat. You will need:

An Ambrosia recipe book (requires 12,000 simoleons and level 10 cooking skill)
1 death fish (requires level 10 fishing skill and death fish fishing book)
1 life fruit (requires level 7 gardening and collection helper reward (optional))

, Keep the book safe after you have read it as it cost you a hefty 12,000 simoleons., The fish are most likely to be caught in the graveyard pond between midnight and 5AM. Angler sims do not need bait to catch the deathfish, and they can fish at any time of day in the graveyard pond. Make your sim reaches level 7 of the fishing skill and read the book that reveals the bait for deathfish. You will actually have to catch the rare angelfish to use as bait to catch the deathfish so read the angelfish fishing book and use an alley catfish bait to catch the angelfish to catch the deathfish. Phew!, The life fruit is a glowing pear that can restore one day of the Sim's life if eaten. Unfortunately, they are as uncommon as the deathfish. If you reach level 7 of the gardening skill and find a seed around town, especially around the graveyard (Life fruit seeds are labelled 'Uncommon Special Seeds') then you should be able to grow the plant. You also get the life fruit as a reward for reaching level 7 of the Science career or as a reward from an opportunity at the EverFresh Delights supermarket. This is possibly the hardest ingredient to find because you just have to chance upon the seed, but if you get enough happiness points and purchase the 'collection helper' reward it should help you find it., Store the completed ambrosia in the fridge as leftovers and wait until nightfall.

Make sure none of your sims eat the ambrosia and use it up. Imagine having to find the ingredients all over again!

, If you can move his/her gravestone indoors, do it. You don't want the ghost wandering about outside and wasting time. Click 'call to meal' on the ambrosia, but make sure none of your sims eat some before the ghost gets some first. That way, no one will get in the way of the ghost on the way to the plate.

If you wish, you can let some of your sims eat the ambrosia. When eaten, the ambrosia will restore the sims age to the start of that life stage (eg. If a sim is an elder close to the end of his/her life stage it will be as if he/she had just turned into an elder) adds 75 mood to the sim for a week and restores hunger to full.
Remember, ghosts go back to their graves at 4AM if they are not distracted and are forced to go back to their graves when sunlight comes (5-6am).

, It should be restored to the age that they were when they died.

If you want, use the 'testingcheatsenabled true' cheat, hold shift, click on the newly resurrected ghost and click 'add to active household' to move the resurrected ghost in.

Spend some time in other places around the city.",How to Be a Teen on the Sims 3," You will be picked up at 8am, so wake up at 7 am and school ends at 2pm.;
, Teen is a perfect age to start a love as with generations you can have prom.


If your teen Sim is in love, ask them to go to prom together. If the crush says, ""Yes"", you will encourage social and relationship levels.
You can make your own special dress in teen formal wear, but be careful, since you can get into a fight about the same outfit. You can also get prom pictures and win prom king and queen.

, You can get a part-time job and earn money, as it is only part-time you will not earn as much as an adult in full-time jobs. Think, as this as pocket money places to get a part-time job is Mausoleum.

Choose the right traits.,
Give the Sim long hair.,
Choose your clothing.,
Look for hippie-suited custom content.,
Turn off Free Will.,
Have a small home.,
Decorate inexpensively and colorfully.,
Bike or walk, don't drive.,
Go into Music, get a part-time job, or make your own money.,
Enjoy nature.,
Be peaceful.",How to Be a Hippie on the Sims 3," Good traits for hippies are:


Artistic
Green Thumb
Loves the Outdoors
Technophobe
Vegetarian
Animal Lover (comes with Pets EP)
Avante-Garde (comes with University EP)
Eco-Friendly (comes with Ambitions EP);
, Stereotypically, hippies have long hair, but if you prefer you can give them whatever hairstyle you please. Consider giving a man facial hair (a beard or perhaps stubble).

, For a female hippie, consider a long skirt or shorts. T-shirts and jeans work for either gender. In the way of shoes, go barefoot or wear flip-flops or sandals. Use Create a Style to give their clothing bright, vivid colors and patterns.

, You'll find a wider variety of potential hippie clothing (as well as décor) online. Try Mod the Sims (requires an account to download) or one of the many Sims blogs you'll find around the net.

, If you use Free Will, your hippie Sim will do whatever they please, which might mean some non-hippie things.

, One of the ""starter homes,"" affordable from the beginning of the game, will suit the purpose well. If you prefer to build your own houses, make it humble and possibly dated-looking.

, Put up posters and paintings. Customize furniture in Create a Style to give it a hippie flair. Try to use candles instead of electric lighting. Exterior-wise, have a lot of trees and flowers.

, Purchase a bicycle and bicycle rack for your Sim so they don't have to use a taxi or car to get around. It's bad for the environment! You could also get around on foot, although a bicycle is faster.

, Scientific experiments? Military? Big business? None of the careers in The Sims 3 are great choices for a hippie, except for Music. The part-time job options are also good. If you'd rather not have a job at all, make money playing guitar in the park, painting, or harvesting plants. (You'll only see good profits when you have high skill levels.) If you have Ambitions, any one of these can be an official career.

, Hang out at the park or in your yard. Start a garden outside your house. Visit the beach and swim in the sea. There are many ways to enjoy nature in the Sims.

, Don't get into fights when you're around town, and try not to get into arguments, either.

Have the alien reproduce.",How to Be Abducted by Aliens in the Sims 3," Aliens are not included in the base Sims 3 game. In order to encounter them, you will need the Seasons expansion pack.;
, Aliens have a chance to visit each night between 12am and 4am.The easiest way to increase the odds of an abduction is to keep your Sims awake during this time, and keep them on their home lot.


It's possible that Sims who are outside in the yard are more likely to be abducted. Set up activities for your Sims outside and have them visit each night.

, Buy a telescope in Buy mode. Have your Sims interact with it to ""Stargaze"" or ""Look Through"" to increase the odds of an alien abduction the same night.If a Sim has a few points in Logic, she can use the ""Search Galaxy"" option, which might increase it even more.

, Keeping space rocks in your lot increases the odds of an alien visit, but it's possible that actively collecting rocks or keeping them in the inventory is what adds to the chance of an abduction that night.Rarely, you can find space rocks using a telescope or just noticing them on the ground, but using Lifetime Points to get the Collection Helper will greatly increase your ability to find these.


If you have the Pets expansion, dogs may occasionally find space rocks as well.

, When aliens do eventually decide to abduct someone, sparkly lights will appear over a Sim's head. That Sim will start to ""Investigate Mysterious Anomaly"" and move toward an alien spaceship in the yard, at which point he or she will be abducted.

, The ""Abducted"" moodlet will typically last several game hours, after which the Sim will return. Non-occult male Sims sometimes get the ""Unexpected Weight Gain"" moodlet immediately after returning, which means they are pregnant. If you are trying to get a male Sim pregnant, save before the ""Abducted"" moodlet wears off, and reload if the moodlet wears off without being replaced by ""Unexpected Weight Gain.""

, If a male, human Sim is abducted and becomes ""pregnant,"" an alien baby will be born 48 game-hours later. You will be prompted to make a decision, and can either send it back to its home world, or raise it yourself. Despite the human father, the baby will be 100% alien.It can be raised as an ordinary baby would, but will grow up into an alien with special powers.


Non-human Sims and female Sims cannot have an alien baby from an abduction.

, Between about 12am and 4am game time each night, aliens have a chance to land in your yard. Keep space rocks outside your home and use a telescope to increase the chances of this happening.


Smashing pumpkins may give you a tiny additional chance., Pay attention during the game night, and wake up your Sim if you see an alien. Interact with it to befriend it. Once you have encountered an alien, you can contact it at any time as you would any Sim.

, Make your Sims friendly with the alien, then invite it to move in to your household. Once the alien is in your household, you can control it as you would any Sim. Each alien begins with level 10 logic and level 7 handiness, as well as additional benefits described below., Instead of the energy motive, aliens have ""Brain Power,"" which is recharged using the self-interaction ""Restore Brain Power,"" or by consuming space rocks. This resource can be used for a variety of powers:Interact with other Sims to restore energy, learn their personality, or mind control Sims from other households.
Interact with any broken object to quickly repair it.
Interact with gems or metals to upgrade them into more valuable items.

, When an alien joins your household, it will come with a ""Galaxa Space Car."" This lets you travel between two locations instantaneously, summon a storm, or abduct a friend and bring him to your home lot.A Sim with enough Handiness can perform two upgrades:The laser upgrade allows the car to invade other households, shooting lasers that singe off clothing.
The space travel upgrade allows Sims to embark on space adventures. These ""disappear"" your Sim for a while, and give you text updates describing the adventure and result.

, You can use your Alien Sim to sell alien secrets at the Military Base, steal from the Science Lab at night, or start a part-time career as an Alien Test Subject at the Science Lab. The test subject job may give your alien Sim a negative ""nausea"" moodlet.

, Aliens and Human Sims can ""Woohoo"" together and make children. The child will have part human and part alien DNA, with the exact amounts determined semi-randomly. Any Sim with more than 20% alien DNA may have alien powers, which is extremely likely for the first generation or two.These powers might only show up once the baby grows up, however.Even supernaturals like Fairies & Werewolves can reproduce with aliens. The children will have a mix of alien and supernatural features, but no alien powers.

, This is an option which is given to you on your cell phone. When you click on the option, wait until your Sim finishes talking and then a tab should appear. The tab should have various options from ordering a pizza to calling the police. For this article you will want to choose Adopt a Child which is simple and free.

, Here is where you will need to select an age and gender. You can choose from a baby, a toddler and a child. Babies need more care and attention whilst toddlers more independence, but still require feeding and nappy changes like babies do. Children are completely independent.

, You'll need to set up a bedroom for the new baby, toddler or child. The bedroom should be fairly big so that you can fit all the necessary furniture inside. For a baby and toddler you'll need a crib for them to sleep in, some toys for their fun, a high chair to feed them in and possibly a potty chair too. Children only need a bed to sleep in and toys for fun.

, When the baby arrives a Sim will give it to you in a basket whilst a toddler is held and a child will walk into the house on their own. From there you will need to decide on a name for the new family member. After naming your child you are done. Make sure the new member fits in well!

, If your family loves sports, dress them in shorts and t-shirts. Call your family names according to the genre as well. For example, our sport-crazy family could be called the 'Wimbledon' family, and they could each be named after famous tennis players - Rafael, Roger, Serena and Venus.

, For the Wimbledon family, they would be born under Aries, Sagittarius or Cancer, the active star signs, and their aspiration would be either popularity or fortune.

, Roger and Serena, the parents, for example, would have turn-ons and offs to match each others looks and current fitness level - high, in this case.

, The Wimbledon family would be moved into a house with a large garden and a home-gym.

, Feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner, and an extra snack, if they get hungry. Remember that your Sims will have to work off those extra snacks! Direct your family to have baths or showers every morning and night, to keep them smelling fresh. If they have just exercised, an extra shower can be added. Make your child and teenage Sims to do their homework, and don't let them be late for school! Make sure one of your adult Sims has a job, to keep the money rolling in. Make friends, direct your Sims on dates and treat them by fulfilling their Wants.

Then, the homework will disappear and you won't have to make the child study anymore. The grades will go up per day just like you were making them do their homework. The only downfall is that you have to do this every day, but it's the easiest way in my opinion. Especially since the children have a low FUN gauge after they've been at school all day and it's hard to make them do their homework.

",How to Care for a Pet in Sims 2 Pets," There are a variety of pets to pick from.


Dog
Cat
Bird
Wombat
Fish

There are many ways to do this. If you want a cat or dog, you have a choice. You can either make a family with a pet, or adopt one from a pet store. If you want a bird or wombat, you can find one in the buy catalog. If you want a fish, they can also be found in the buy catalog. Give your pet a name (except for fish). For cats and dogs you can customize the type and color and other things like that.

;
, Cats and dogs are the only pets that need items, since fish, wombats, and birds already come in a cage/tank. Here is a recommended list of items to buy for cats and dogs:


Food Bowl
Bone (dogs) or scratching post (cats)
Pillow
Bed/Doghouse
Litterbox (cats)

, Play with it constantly, and give it love. Even birds and wombats can be a great friend. Loving your pet is definitely part of its care.

, Dogs and cats can be selected, so it's easy to tell when they need food and other things. Pets cannot be told to do actions (without cheats); they usually just do their own thing. If they're hungry, they automatically eat. Birds and wombats have think bubbles with signs of hunger when they need food. Just click on them to feed them. With fish, it's much different. Just feed them every day or so.

, Have the owner click on the pet and click, ""teach command"". These pets can learn ""come here"", ""sit"", ""play dead"", ""speak"", ""shake"", and ""roll over"". Cats can also learn ""use toilet"". Have fun teaching your pet new commands (my personal favorite is play dead). Birds can learn to talk, but wombats and fish can't, of course.

, There are 7 good behaviors, each with an opposite. These are the behaviors:


Housebroken/Yardbroken-teaches pets where to use the restroom.
Eat Pet/Sim Food-teaches pets where to get their food.
Playful/Hostile-teaches pets to be more outgoing and fun.
Clean/Filthy-teaches pets to be clean.
Respectful/Destructive-teaches pets to not destroy furniture.
Stays off/Goes on Furniture-teaches pets to stay off furniture.
Calm/Disruptive-teaches pets to be kind to other pets and Sims.

, For example, if your dog decides to chew on its bone and not a sofa, praise them. Do the opposite for bad behavior.

, There are three career tracks for pets-Security, Showbiz, and Service. Go on the computer or look in the newspaper for job openings for your cat or dog. Your pet may need to learn commands before being promoted. There are still Career Chance Cards for the pets, and every day your pet works, they will get money added to your household.

",How to Care for a Cat in Sims 2: Pets," How else can you do anything? You can either make a new family with a cat, or adopt a cat with an existing family. Just note that if you adopt, you cannot pick the colour, breed or personality.;
, Here is a list of everything you need: Food bowl, Cat bed, Litter tray and toys. Also, get a scratching post. If you don't have one they will probably ruin all your Sims furniture.

, It costs, but not much. If you have a glitch like I do where then they are hungry they won't go to the food bowl, you will have to go into buy mode, drag the bowl over and click play. When they finish, you have to go into buy mode.... you get the idea. Just repeat it.

, Unless you want messes everywhere in your Sims house, toilet train them!

Have fun and remember that creativity is key!",How to Build a House in the Sims 2," The most important things to consider are the size of the family and how much money you have. A house with 2 people would most likely be smaller than a house with 8 people, but that's the creator's choice. Each family starts out with $20,000, however with some money cheat code (motherlode), you can have up to $999,999,999 at a time. Also, think about if you want a garden, pool, backyard, etc. Make a sketch or ""blueprint"" of what your house is going to be like.;
, Bathrooms are generally smaller (unless it is a public bathroom) and living rooms tend to be larger. Have bedrooms for each Sim, unless they are married or in love. Teenagers, children, and babies/toddlers get their own room unless you want them to share.

, Lots range from very small (3 x 1) to very large (5 x 6). Just remember that you can create two and three story houses, so don't choose a huge one for a small family.

, To some people, using foundation is much easier to create a house with. Drag over the area you want the house to be located. Include any decks and porches you want to include on the ground level. Lay a driveway and/or garage before lying foundation. If you want to have a garden or a front yard, start the foundation a few tiles away from the mailbox area.

, Using the wall tool, outline the physical shape of the house, leaving any decks and porches you want outside of the walls (note that having a foundation requires steps to get into the house, so leave a small porch for the front door and any other doors!)

, Using diagonal walls makes for an aesthetic structure, but remember most items cannot be places on a diagonal wall.

, Windows add ""environment"" to a Sim's mood. Make sure that you have a door to each room, as you can also use arcs in living rooms and kitchens. Style your house with glass doors on study rooms or offices.

, Try to choose colors that would match in real life, such as brown tile in the kitchen, wood deck outside, tan carpet in the living room, or just go wild and mix everything in one room!

, Put couches, TVs, bookcases, or arcade machines in the living room, add a trash can, an oven, a fridge, counter tops, and a telephone in the kitchen, and put toilets, sinks, and showers in the bathroom.

, There are two ways to do this: you can use the full staircase tool to place a staircase, or you can use the mini staircase tool. To use that, go up a level and place floor squares where you want the staircase to reach on the second floor, and then go to the staircase tool, choose the type of stair you want to use, and place your cursor over the landing. This will not work if there is not enough room to construct the staircase.


Place the exterior walls for the second floor. Second floors can by dynamic, since you don't need them to match the first floor. You can also place decks on the second floor.

, You will need to place floors in all of these rooms as well. You can place a simple wooden floor in the rooms you wish to have, then edit them later.

, You can use the auto roof maker, or you can go in and customize your roof with different shape. You can always go back and change the color and shape later.

, Lay out some tile or gravel, put out some nice chairs, buy some exercise equipment, and set up a garden or some trees. You may even want to build a greenhouse.(If you have Seasons) If so, build a room and put some gardens in there and maybe fruit trees.

, Place barriers where necessary for decks and porches. You should also use the step tool to place staircases where they are needed. Dress up a garden using the flowerbed fencing.

, Be creative with the lights considering what you want the theme of the room to be. And stop with the boring ceiling lights. Experiment with wall lamps, table lamps, and maybe some floor lamps.

, Use split levels, or bridges, maybe add a swimmable lake! The Sim's houses are designed by YOU the way YOU want it to be! Most importantly, it's okay to go crazy with your house. As long as the sims are able to get into every room, and have what they need, you can go wild with the house!

Just make sure that there is a pool in your neighborhood, whether it's a pool in their backyard, or a community pool. To make your sims go swimming,click the pool, the ladder, the diving board, or a slide (with Sims 2 Seasons EP) and they will get in. As sims get more body skill, they will be able to do more advanced tricks off the diving board. Some are really cool!;
, All of these can be found in the buy mode catalog under ""Hobbies"". Teenage and older sims can go on all of these things.

, Your sim will need st least three body skill points to perform this action. When they do, click on your sim, then ""Do yoga"". As sims get more body skill, they can do more and more yoga moves. One is where they balance their entire body on their finger! Sims must be at least a teen to do yoga.

, This requires Sims 2 Apartment Life EP. Children and older can jump rope. Just click on the sim, then ""Jump rope"". You can also select the difficulty: Easy, medium, or hard. As their body skill gets higher, your sim unlocks medium and hard.

, With sims 2 FreeTime EP installed, your sim can dance on the ballet bar. Like the treadmill and bike, the ballet bar is located in the hobby section of the buy catalog. Just click the ballet bar, and then select ""do exercises"". Your sim will start to dance! Even kids can do it!

, Also included in Sims 2 FreeTime EP, your sim can play a sport. They can play basketball or soccer. For them to play, go to the buy mode catalog and the goal and basketball hoop will be found in the hobby section. Children and older can play soccer or basketball. For basketball, click the hoop, then ""shoot hoops"". For soccer, sims can play alone or with someone else.

, This means both roller skating and ice skating (Sims 2 Seasons EP must be installed). Just buy a roller rink or ice rink in the buy mode catalog under ""hobbies"". Note: They are very large, so make room! however, each rink comes in two sizes, but even small is pretty big. They are also expensive! To make your sim skate, click the rink, then ""Skate"". Children and older can skate. Sims can also perform twirls and jumps (and sometimes they fall!).

, What happens is the first hour, there is a really small chance of them being abducted, the second hour, the chance gets higher, the third hour, higher again and so on. However, if they stop for any reason and then start again, the chance of abduction goes back to the first hour.

Pick Alpha or Bravo team.,
Know your map.,
If playing with clan and it is possible, use Vent/Skype.",How to Master Search and Destroy in Combat Arms1," Alpha players will try to plant the bomb while Bravo players will defend the sites. This makes some gear/weapons more suitable based on what team you are playing in. But naturally you need to practice both Alpha and Bravo playing at some point in order to become a pro at this mode.

, In this mode it's very important that you know every common camp spot and every possible hideout on the map you are playing. Therefore it might be advisable to play the maps couple of times in Elimination mode so you get to see everything on it.

, This makes it a lot easier to communicate and organize your attack/defense. Also if you are killed and there is only one team member still alive you can tell him the enemies last known location.

"
"
Buy gear for the game.,
Buy weapons for the game.,
Pick a strategy.,
Plant the bomb.",How to Master Search and Destroy in Combat Arms2," This can be kinda hard sometimes as you don't know what the Bravo team has equipped. But generally speaking speed is good. It allows you to make a fast run when the round starts before Bravo has managed to organize their defence. It's also easier to run between the bomb sites and confuse your enemies so they don't know where you're actually going to plant the bomb. Couple of suggestions:


Light vest/Reccon vest. It gives you 10% vs. 15% more speed, first one is available for GP at rank SFC2 and second one can only be bought with NX regardless of your rank.
Military bandana/Cyclops bandana. Boosts your speed with 5% vs. 7% extra, military bandana can be bought for GP at rank CSM 4 and second one is NX only.
Specialist. Hawk and Viper provides most speed (16% vs 15% boost) and can be bought with either GP (if you are a high rank) or NX otherwise.;
, Advice for which guns to bring is harder to give as you probably have personal favourites. However it is advisable to at least bring one long range gun (assault rifle with good aim or a sniper rifle). This can be useful if Bravo players are camping the bomb sites and you need to take them out. Here is an example setup:


Primary weapon: A nice SMG such as P90/PP-19. This is reliable in close combat and can also be usable at mid-range if you attach a sight.
Secondary weapon: You won't use your pistol most of the times so bring whatever gun you like.
Melee: Same goes for this one
Support: Nade. Mines are pretty much useless when you play Alpha, if you have the possibility (due to rank/NX money) you should buy M69HE or the nade pack consisting of 2 standard nades.
Backpack Slot A: Assault rifle or sniper rifle. As for assault rifles G36E or L85A1 are favoured by the author. When it comes to sniper rifles it depends on whether you like bolt action or automatic rifles, if first case I suggest buying a L96A1 and in second case the PSG-1 is decent.
Other guns(rocket launcher/specialist etc): It should be mentioned that a LAW/RPG rocket launcher or M32/Minigun if you are using Hawk/Viper can be pretty devastating to the enemy. However most of the times you will be kicked and if you play with your clan it can gain a bad reputation for using noob weapons so I suggest you don't bring any of them.

, If you are playing with your clan you should already have agreed on a strategy so everyone knows where they should go and what they should do. It is advisable that you split up so couple of players go to each site (there are always 2 bomb sites you can plant at). But when you play in public rooms everyone pretty much do what they want so here are a couple of suggestions:


Go with the crowd. Most of the times a number of players will run to one site and if you like sniping from long range/don't want to go alone then it can be a good idea to follow them. You can stay at the back of the group and take down targets in front of you - however be careful against backreapers.
Go where you are needed. If one player goes to a site and the rest of Alpha goes to the other site you will probably be more useful as a backup to the lonely player.
Go on your own. If you like close combat then this is the best strategy, as most of the Bravo team probably are covering the bombsites you can try to sneak upon them (this is especially good on Short Fuse by running into the house rather than to the sites) and then spray against any enemy you spot.

, This is the point where some of the players has been killed and hopefully your team has been able to secure one of the bombsites. It's time to plant the bomb so if none of your teammates do so then it's up to you! Newbies should keep in mind that bombs are planted by standing in the light up site area, press 6 and then hold left mouse button until it is planted. When this has been done there are some important things to consider:


Guard the bomb. If everyone in Alpha is killed, Bravo can easily defuse the bomb. You need to make sure that Bravo doesn't start defusing until it's less than 7 seconds until it goes off, as that's about the time it takes to defuse it.
Find a decent spot to camp. It should be close to the bomb so you can see it or easily check whether someone has started to defuse it. If there are several players left in Alpha make sure that you have every entry point to the bomb covered so Bravo players doesn't backreap you.
If you are the only player left, distract the enemy. You don't need to kill them but merely prevent them from defusing the bomb. This can be done by shooting against them, most of the times they won't dare to defuse it as they cannot guard themselves while doing so.

"
"
Camp if you still got time.,
Plant the bomb.",How to Master Search and Destroy in Combat Arms3," If there are a number of Bravo players alive (at least 2-3 or even more) you will die soon enough by running around. Instead try to take out a couple of players so there are less people that can bother you while you are planting and later camping the bomb. If you play with your clan and has Vent/Skype, try getting some help from them on where the enemy was last seen.

, Regardless of whether you managed to kill some enemies you need to plant it before time runs out or your team will lose. Carefully approach one of the bombsites and make sure it's clear/take out any enemy before planting. If you are up against only 1 or 2 enemies and are wearing speed gear it can be a good idea to approach a bombsite, spray a little against the enemies and then run another way to the other bombsite and plant. That way they will probably stay at the other site until they realize you planted it which prevents you from getting killed while planting. After you planted it the same thing as mentioned before applies, camp and distract enemies from defusing. If you brought mines and still have them it's a perfect opportunity to use them. Carefully plant them around the bomb before leaving the site - if you are killed and get lucky the defuser will trip on them. If not, they still have to waste couple of extra seconds to blow them. Be especially careful for backreapers when you are solo.

"
"
Buy gear for the game.,
Buy weapons for the game.,
Start strategy.,
Mid-time strategy.,
Defuse the bomb.",How to Master Search and Destroy in Combat Arms4," Speed gear was recommended for Alpha but not for Bravo. The vests come at a cost and that is lower protection, when you play Bravo you will be camping more and therefore it's a bad idea to decrease your protection. Here are a couple of suggestions of what you should wear as Bravo player:


Normal vest/gear. Provides you with the normal protection and speed, you can buy Military or Cyclops bandana to gain a little speed boost.
Assault vest. Gives you a 10% protection boost and a 3% speed boost, combined with a bandana it's a nice solution. NX only though.
Heavy vest/Tanker vest. First one is available for GP at low rank and gives you a 15% extra protection with a 10% drop in speed. Tanker vest is NX only and supplies you with 17% extra protection at a cost of 9% speed. The huge speed drop on those vests can be balanced by using a Cyclops Bandana that increases speed with 7%.
Specialist. Viper/Hawk/Scorpion offers you normal protection with a nice boost in speed, especially if you buy Viper or Hawk.

, The advice on guns for Bravo is about the same as for Alpha, a SMG and a AR/SR rifle is useful overall and if you are a fan of G36E series you could buy that and use as primary weapon with a sniper as second weapon. Example:


Primary weapon: Your favourite SMG/AR (P90, PP-19 etc are smg's and G36E/L85A1/M416/FAMAS/Aug etc are ARs.
Secondary weapon: Any pistol does the trick
Melee: Same
Support: This one could be mines or nade/s depending on what you prefer. Mines are useful as they can be put at entrances etc and can help guarding a site while nades are really useful if you are solo/there are more Alpha players than Bravo players left and you need to clear a site. Choose whatever you like.
Backpack Slot A: Same as for Alpha, a AR or an SR.
Other guns/spec/etc: Rocket launchers and spec weapons such as auto-turrets, claymore/hornet mines and M32 can also be very useful when playing Bravo. However same thing applies here, most people doesn't like specs and you should consider whether to use it if you are playing with your clan/don't wanna be kicked from the game. You might consider getting a medkit though if you bought a specialist - it can be very helpful if you have to solo some rounds.

, When the round starts you should quickly plant any mines/turrets if you brought these. Naturally they should be put close to a site so chances are the enemy trips on them. Avoid common spots as door entrances and try to put them where the enemy is most likely to not see it. Sometimes it can be a good idea to put exactly at where Alpha will plant the bomb. Then pick a camp spot. As I said before if you are playing with a clan you should have made up a strategy and practised it so everyone knows what to do. If playing public, keep your eyes on where the other players are and make sure none of the sites are left unguarded. If you are camping a site alone you should also watch out for backreapers from Alpha.

, If you didn't outnumber Alpha huge from the beginning or are facing a noob team chances are some of your players are killed by now and holes in the defence is opening up. Carefully keep track that both sites are guarded and if all teammates at one site are killed you should immediately rush there. If you are lucky you come just in time when they are busy planting the bomb and can take out couple of Alpha players. Be careful though if there are several of them - someone is probably covering the player planting the bomb. If you hear that the bomb has been planted it's the same procedure, hurry over there but be careful. If you know the common spots which are usually underneath stairs/behind boxes you might be able to finish off the Alpha's that are guarding the bomb.

, It's done by standing next to the bomb, place your sight at the bomb until you see the ""Press E to defuse"" message and then do so. Regardless of whether you are alone or have teammates with you it's advisable that you carefully exam the bombsite before defusing the bomb. Make sure that no enemies are around still camping and also look out for mines. More than once a whole Bravo team has been killed by some idiot tripping over mines planted around the bomb.

Keep an eye on both sites.,
Be quick when the bomb is planted.,
Defuse the bomb.",How to Master Search and Destroy in Combat Arms5," If it's a small map you should find a spot where you can easily check both sites for enemies and if it's a large map you should run between the sites every now and then. Most of the times you will know what site they are planting at - for example if you are camping one site and the other teammates are camping another and you see that they are killed you know that enemies are at the other site and will likely plant there.

, Unlike a solo Alpha player which can merely distract the enemies once he/she planted the bomb you actually need to defuse it and chances are high you get killed while doing so if there are any enemies left alive. This is why it's important to predict what site they will plant at as you only have 30 seconds once the bomb is planted. As for Alpha, if you have clan members available through Vent/Skype they might be able to help you. Quickly get there and if there are several enemies look at the common camping sites and try to take them out.

, If you are running out of time (you need at least 7 seconds to defuse the bomb) and there are still enemies alive you have to take the risk of getting killed because otherwise your team loses anyway. Check so there are no mines around and then hold your thumbs while defusing.

, If you are on Combat Arms a lot, you know how frustrating it is to have some guy on the other team that kills everyone on your team at once...with a knife! Hacking will most certainly get you banned, and they won't give you a second chance! Besides, if you hack you will be kicked out of the game room and you won't get any EXP or GP. There is no point in hacking.

, If you accidentally shoot a random spot in a wall and all of your opponents die at once, report the bug to Nexon IMMEDIATELY. Exploiting a bug/glitch on purpose for your own gain is as serious as hacking.

, You still get XP and GP, no matter what!

, If you are kinda bad with grenades, don't buy a load of grenades! Buy a few grenades and experiment with them.

Do not bring it into Power Surge as it's almost always medium-ranged combat.,
Do not over-estimate the accuracy of the gun.,
Always scope while counter-sniping.,
Often go into Papa server.,
If necessary, get the G36E Valkyrie for permanent before Friday 3 December at 11:00PM PST.,
If all else fails, and you just can't cope with the scope... get the scope mod from MPGH.net to fix the scope.",How to Be Good with the G36E in Combat Arms," It's best to play in maps like WaveRider, Two Towers, Junk Flea, Death room, Pump Jack, Gray Hammer, Ghost town, Road Kill, Snow Valley and Brush Wood.;
, It's 90% accuracy, but the scope will only hit at the top of the circle in the middle.

, Be aware that the L96A1 has the same accuracy, and it has a lower-magnified scope.

, If you go into papa server, the G36E suddenly becomes overpowered.

, It's on 40% sale for Black Friday, so it's 15,000 NX instead of the usual 24,900 NX.

, Nexon deliberately made it that way due to it's over-rated accuracy.

"
"
Know your way around.,
Wait until the 20-second timer stops and then you can camp in a place of your choice.",How to Master Quarantine Mode in Overdose in Combat Arms1," This is extremely vital, because zombies are faster than humans, if you don't know where you are going, you can easily get infected. Moreover, there are two ""safe rooms"" when the humans need to survive for another minute (explained later). You need to know those places as well as potential hiding places. Unlike Death Room, the map is very complicated, so you are going to have to play over this map several times in order to get the ""feel"" of how this mode works.

, Since two of the places are going to be grouped by humans, it is somewhat likely that one of them is going to appear as zombies and then they can infect everyone around him.

"
"
Go to the office.,
Go to the security camera or ""box platform."",
Hide in your desired area.,
Carry an incendiary grenade, shotgun, or sniper with you.,
Carry a claymore with you.,
Make sure that you can tell apart from Host Infections and the other ones.,
Equip and wear these weapons or clothing to get the best results:


Head: Black Beret or Military Bandanna, if you have NX, purchase a Cowboy Hat
Face: Doesn't matter, but gas mask helps
Vest: Light vest
Uniform: Doesn't matter, urban could be effective and as long as you don't wear arctic camouflage
Backpack: Standard, this does matter as other backpacks slow you down
Weapon: MUST BE LOW RECOIL!!!!!",How to Master Quarantine Mode in Overdose in Combat Arms2," Press M on your keyboard to show the map. The office is the southwest room where it is the easiest to camp out. It also has a safe room in which before the door is unlocked, there will be a 10-second alarm notifying you (this is also for the other safe room which if you look up (if you are in it), is actually an elevator).


If there is a zombie that appears in the office, then you can go to the crate room, or cargo room. A platform is there so you can camp there, but the larger entrance makes the platform more vulnerable. The elevator is actually safer because there are bars, unlike the office which is glass and also a window to the side.;
, The box is indeed safer, and there is only 1 way of getting there. The security camera is harder for the zombies to get to you, but an item on the wall has allowed the zombies to step on that and infect the human that way. Unfortunately you cannot climb on the box platform with a heavy vest, and specialist armor is recommended if you do.

, There are many areas that are good hiding spots, but more experienced players will check each and every one of them, so be careful! These are all the hiding places:


The barrels near the main building exit
The ""waterfall,"" the place where water leaks out of the pipe
The box (northeast corner), where if carefully placed, some new people can be unaware of you
A pillar in the crate room (most pillars work), where you are at the edge and below the main platform
The space between the box platform and the entrance to the platform: this has been the most effective
The ""south"" wall near the small (there is a bigger one) tunnel where it connects the crate room with a place to the office (stairs), you are least seen if you put your body up against this side of the wall
The pipelines near the main tunnel that connects to the crate room directly to the stairs, in which if carefully placed, zombies can only see you if they take the path from the stairs to the crate room (keep in mind that the stairs do NOT lead to this tunnel, although a bio-chemical tunnel does lead to this)
The small room near the pipelines, this in fact is right next to it and is a secondary route if the main route to the office is blocked from zombies (which they will most likely take); you must hide in the corner where you are surrounded by lockers in order to achieve the best results
The lower elevated corner at the edge of the crate room; zombies can only see you from the center of the crate room, and not from the big room that leads to the stairs that leads to the office

, Shotguns and snipers can actually push the zombies, while normal guns can only push it a little bit. If you have NX (Nexon Cash), buy a flamethrower, because it does normal damage and extremely effective against zombies when you are in a safe room. They will try to break the glass (or bars) to try to get in, and you can just burn them to death with it. Incendiary grenades do normal damage and if thrown into the right place, it can be effective. Also, the M32 Grenade Launcher is the most effective weapon in this mode for this map, as at the pipe to the office is usually crowded with zombies, you can just fire away. You only have 6 grenades, so make sure that you hit the zombies directly or at least very close to them.

, This is only accessible if you are a specialist. 1 claymore can have the potential to kill one infected right from the start! However, the zombie must have 225hp or 300hp, or else it will only damage the zombie a little bit.

, Host Infections have a gray face, while the other zombies have this blood-stained face. It is very important since Host Infections have more sprint stamina and thus can travel farther at the maximum speeds.

, M416 with Itech Reflex Sight works beautifully, and so is the M416 CQB. A weapon with a scope is useless except a sniper.
Pistol: Doesn't really matter, as long as it has a good fire rate and has many bullets.
Melee: Doesn't matter
Support: M69HE frag grenade
Backpack slot A: M67, Flamethrower, M32, Heartbeat Detector, Medkit (not recommended unless you are running around in the crate room), Sat. scanner, or an RPG-7.

"
"
Take advantage of your 375hp and awesome stamina.,
Follow at least one person, if not many.,
Let some of the comrades go to the office, others to the crate room, and still others (including you) scour the building for any people that are hiding.",How to Master Quarantine Mode in Overdose in Combat Arms3," The Host Infection are the strongest ones and most likely to get the most kills. Zombies that get infected only have 300hp and their stamina is weaker than the Host.

, The risk is actually worth it, whether you turn out to be a zombie or they turn out to be a zombie; perhaps none of you (likely) would be turned to zombies. Since if they become a zombie, and you being the first to get infected, it is likely you will get more kills than the other ""weakened"" zombies.

, If you become an infected after the 20 seconds, right before that you should check the map (press M on your keyboard).


Note 1: Even if you don't become a zombie, you can see which two or one persons has disappeared so you don't accidentally follow their route. If you do become a zombie, go to the places where the humans are hiding. After most people have been annihilated from their hiding spots, then you can crouch towards the main group.
Note 2: The Host Infection actually have a longer range of infecting people, although very few people have noticed this before due to the lag on their computers.

"
Assess how strong they are.,
Check if they have seen you.,
Try to surround them.,
Once surrounding them, remember, that if you surrounded them without them knowing, you should be able to kill one or two before they open fire at you.

,
Retreat...,
Go back to your group and stay with them.",How to Take on a Superior Group in Counter Strike," If you are alone and the group consists of 4-5 (rifled or stronger) individuals, you may want to leave them alone and run away. and check for more inexperienced signs, for example, if you are in a courtyard , and they run out blindly, they are most likely new and are sniper bait.;
, If they haven't seen you, they aren't looking for you. However, be wary that even if they are not searching for you, they still will be on their toes, so don't be surprised to walk into a barrage of fire when you walk out to take that shot. common signs of them seeing you are more packed formations, and them looking everywhere quickly.

, And always get to know a map before playing as some maps have passages that look like they may surround them, but instead empty out right into their crosshairs.

,, I dunno how many times I can say this, I know it's tempting to go back and get your kill count up, but as you realize, now they are ready for you, and waiting or sending search parties.

, There is safety in numbers.

Practice.,
Choose maps that are big so you can use a variety of tactics.,
For short maps, use submachine guns with extended magazines.,
Pay attention to strategy, particularly when attacking.,
Use your teammates to your advantage.,
If you buy a specialist, make sure to play Quarantine Regen or Fireteam, as they work best for these modes.,
Don't use weapons that will get you kicked.,
Research your weapons and choose only the best.,
Consider buying some NX to get some good guns in the game.,
Equip guns with a sniper scope.,
Practice in Papa Server.,
Do not buy mercenaries.,
Watch videos online for reference.,
Buy a Modular Backpack.,
Buy Smoke Grenades.",How to Be a Pro in Combat Arms," The more you play Combat Arms, the more you will get used to the controls, the guns, and the maps.;
, Oil Rig has a lot of options to go for, unlike Death Room, which only has 2 routes.

, These weapons are best for close-quarters combat. Some of these guns have a lot of recoil, making it more likely to get a headshot.

, For instance, avoid shooting into a group of enemies unless you have cover, as they will most likely all turn and fire at you. Rather than shooting, consider using a grenade or an RPG to deal area damage to all of them. Sneak up close behind your enemies to get a better shot, and then shoot fast before they can turn. When you see close-range gunfight between several players, stay back until either your enemies or allies are all dead. This keeps you from getting killed/wasting ammo and also allows you to pick off any weakened enemies easily.

, Never be the first person to enter a room. Let your teammates enter first, so you don't get hit with the brute force of the enemy's gunfire. Then, if your teammate has died go in while the enemy is reloading to catch them off-guard. Hanging behind your team can also help you avoid any traps, as your teammate will set them off first.

, Don't try to use specialist for Elimination, as many Elite Moderators will kick you and you can only use up to 2 weapons in addition to your primary.

, Avoid using Specialist, Dual Scorpion, Orthus, Minigun, Semi-Automatic Snipers or gas/flame in Elimination, unless you are an ELITE moderator.

, For example, for sniping, equip Steady Hand (ability) and Shapka (headgear) so you have good and undisturbed aim as your scope will stay still for some time.


For any gun you consider, first go to YouTube and search ""Combat Arms (name of gun) review Baxstar."" What Baxstar thinks, is what it is.

, Remember that they always make the GP versions weaker than the NX versions.

, For no-sniper matches, these guns work well for long distance: XM8, M417 SB, REC7 RANGERS, G36E, AUG A1.

, In this server the recoil is decreased and you face less challenging players. It is also a good place to practice quick scoping.

, They always cost way too much and do not do almost any help.

, UCD's Top 5 Players and Baxstar reviews give you great strategies as well.

, This backpack gives you a total of 4 more weapons to carry.

, Although many people say it does not work, they are wrong. For Quarantine Regen it helps you get away from zombies, and for Capture The Flag it does not let the enemy see you when you get their flag.

"
"
Run as soon as the game starts.,
Stick with at least one member of your team always.,
Arm yourself good weapon like the ""Para"" machine gun or a semi automatic sniper rifle.,
Get to an unreachable higher ground.,
If the server is running with a no reload plug in.","How to Survive in Counterstrike 1.6 ""Zombie Infection Mod""."," A random person is always infected when a round starts, and he/she could already be right in front of you.;
, Remember, this is about survival, not competition!

, Remember: zombies don't die easily, and they can regenerate.

, You'll need some cooperation with your teammates by forming a human ladder. This factor should buy you more time to stay alive, however zombies can still get to you if they pile up high enough.

, Buy the non automatic shotgun to your advantage. One shell impact can help repel the zombie away from you along with an inflicting amount of damage.

Make sure you download Surf maps for CS: Source. Maps for other versions of Counter-Strike will not work.
Look for maps designed for beginners or practice, as these will have more forgiving ramps and easier routes so that you can get the hang of the surfing mechanics.;
, Open your file explorer and navigate to the following directory. Place the BSP file into the folder to add it to your list of available Source maps:

, Once you've copied the map to the correct location, start up CS:Source and select ""Create a Server.""

, This will limit the game to local players only, which will prevent random people from joining and messing with you while you practice.

, You should see your new Surf map listed here. It will have ""Surf_"" before the map name. If you don't see the new map, make sure that you've placed it in the correct location.

, Click ""Start Server"" to load the game and your Surf map. It may take a few moments to load.

, You'll need to adjust a few settings in order to surf properly. These are the same settings that community Surf servers use, so you'll be able to practice under normal conditions.


If the console doesn't appear, open the Options menu on the Main Menu, select ""Advanced,"" and then toggle ""Enable Developer Console"" on.

, Enter the commands below to adjust the server physics to allow surfing:sv_accelerate 10

"
Understand the basics.,
Hold .A or D while on the angle towards the apex.,
Aim your mouse towards the bottom corner of the angled surface.,
Move back towards the upper corner before jumping.,
Press .Space to jump to the next surface.,
Hold .A or D while in the air, depending on your direction.,
Never press .W while surfing.,
Try to hit the next ramp in the upper corner nearest to you.",How to Surf in Counter Strike Source2," Surfing in Counter-Strike is accomplished by sliding down angled surfaces, using gravity to maintain your speed. You'll be required to jump from surface to surface to navigate the map. You'll be using the A and D buttons to stay on the angle, and the mouse to steer.

, Every time you're surfing an angle, you should be hold either A or D, whichever key is the opposite of the slope. For example, if you're on an angle where the upper edge is on your right, and the lower edge is on your left, press and hold D to push yourself towards the apex. This will keep you on the surface so that you don't fall off.This is the essential motion for surfing. You always want to be pushing the opposite direction of the angle you're on to counter gravity.
A basic way to remember this is to use this simple diagram: D/\A


, This will increase your speed, allowing gravity to work in your favor.

, After moving towards the bottom of the ramp, quickly aim towards the upper corner and climb back up before jumping to the next surface. You are essentially making a wave motion for each surface you hit (start high, move low, and then move back up high before jumping).

, When you reach the end of a surfing surface, press Space to jump and move to the next angled surface. Try to jump at the last possible second to maintain your speed.

, Hold the key that matches the direction you're going in mid-air

, While it might be tempting to press W to ""move forward,"" this will actually slow you down. You'll get all the speed you need by moving along the angled ramps.If you need to stop mid-air, or slow down on a ramp for some reason, press S. Otherwise, avoid this key was well.

, This will give you the most space to surf downwards to the bottom corner of the far end of the ramp. Hitting the right entry spot for the ramp can be essential for maintaining a high speed.


Be careful when lining up your approach, as hitting the edge of the ramp will likely kill you from fall damage.

"
"
Adjust your game settings.,
Avoid big air.,
Look for shortcuts and corners you can skip.,
Use shotguns if you want to attack other players.,
Block other players by stopping in front of them.",How to Surf in Counter Strike Source3," The settings you entered above are great for practice, but pro surfing servers will use much less forgive settings. Once you're familiar with how surfing works, change the sv_airaccelerate 800 value to sv_airaccelerate 100. You can decrease it in increments until you reach 100 so that you can get used to the slower air acceleration speed.

, Big jumps may look cool, but they'll kill your forward momentum. If you're trying to get the best times, you'll want to stick to low jumps to clear the space you need while maintaining your speed.


The longer you hold Space, the higher you'll jump. Try to just tap it to clear the gaps you need to get over.

, The one time big air can come in useful is if you've found a shortcut you can use or a part fo the map you can skip. This almost always requires a very high speed so that you can make the jump. Not all maps have skippable sections.

, The M3 shotgun is one of the best weapons to use while surfing, as it stays accurate even while moving quickly. It's meant for close range, so try to use it on players using the same surfing ramp as you.


Not all servers allow you to use guns and attack other surfers.
Try to avoid automatic weapons, as the accuracy will be terrible. The same goes for single shot snipers, as you'll never get an accurate shot while moving.

, You'll lose all of your momentum as well, but this can be a good tactic if you've already messed up your jump. Be aware that not all servers look kindly on blockers, so you may get kicked if it's against the rules.

Be Patient.",How to Snipe in Counter Strike," Different snipers have different preferences, but the most widely preferred sniper rifle is the AWP (Arctic Warfare Police) for its high power which results in a one-shot kill almost every time but remember that it is very hard to shoot when the enemy is near to you. Alternatively, you can choose the semi-automatic sniper rifle, which boasts increased fire rate at the cost of power.;
, Each map has its own set of vantage points and sniping locations. Choose a location that provides good cover, but a wide view of the battlefield.

, Your team provides good suppressed fire, so utilize it. While your enemies try to kill your teammates, you can snipe them from far behind. Remember to stay behind, as snipers tend to get killed quickly in the heat of battle.

, After you spawn, equip your side arm to reach your camping position faster as most sniper rifles tend to slow you down considerably. Ideally, you should choose a sidearm with good movement rate and damage.

, The more time you take to aim, the higher the chance of your opponent killing you.

, Ideally, you should try to escape to a vantage point, but if there's none nearby, try to get to your closest team member. When you are far enough, snipe your enemy.

, As a sniper, every second is precious. If you waste time panicking, your enemies will most likely spot you and kill you.

, Most sniper rifles in Counter Strike take time to reload, being bolt-action. Immediately get to cover after you shoot.

, Don't stay in one place too long! This gives your enemies time to organize a strike to take you out.

, Hone your skills offline by playing against bots of increasing difficulty.

,,, A sniper isn't a soldier who runs or jumps into a battlefield. In fact, you have to try to stay out of the battlefield as much as you can. Your rifle gives you the advantage of shooting from a distance. So don't get too close to the enemy. Wait until someone walks by, and shoot. It's not exciting, but you can get a lot of kills without dying.

Long Range



Develop your reflexes.,
Medium Range


You can use the above method when encountering a target at medium range, but depending on how far/close from you he is, you can fire more bullets.,
Short Range


Although many people would advise against it, controlled and disciplined spraying is a very effective method of killing short range.",How to Shoot an Ak 47 or M4A1 on Css," You have a much better chance of scoring your headshot if you can move your crosshair onto your target faster.

Fire in bursts of 2 or 3 with an AK, and bursts of 3 or 4 with the M4.

Put recoil to good use. At extremely long distances, it is best to aim for the upper chest. Not only will your target suffer the damage from a bullet to the chest, the recoil of the second or third shot will usually take his head off.

Use the strafing method. The strafing method is where you fire 2-3 shots with your rifle, then strafe either left or right a short distance and then fire again. Making sure you maintain your aim, rinse and repeat. Try not to be too predictable, strafing left and right alternatively will make you an easy target. Try strafing in sporadic, unpredictable patterns.

Do not crouch and stay still. Despite your aim being steadied when you are crouched, you are made an easy target. If you want to crouch, try using the popping method - strafing normally until you are about to fire, and quickly tapping the control key. While you are descending into a crouch, fire a bullet or two off. This is a fast, accurate and effective way of killing long range.;
, With the AK and using the popping method, you can afford to shoot 4-5 bullets.

, The M4 is certainly better suited for spraying than the AK because of recoil pattern differences.

Do not 'spray 'n' pray'. When you are spraying, do not panic, and keep your aim controlled. Depending on how close your enemy is from you, you may want to aim slightly lower than the head or body to compensate for recoil.
The AK47 Spray pattern jumps upwards quickly in a backwards ""7"" shape after the second uncontrolled shot making it a good weapon to spray at the knees or feet close range to pick up a headshot.

",How to Play Counter Strike Source," The game, like the original Counter-Strike, takes time to master. The more often you die, the more often you try to learn from your mistakes.;
, Grenades are last priority as they are easiest to learn.

, If you are capable of holding a positive score, (10 kills, 5 deaths) you should move on to the next difficulty. However, it is not recommended to go against very hard bots, as they seem to know where you are before they see you.

, Try your skills on other players and see how you do. Don't be discouraged if you die too much, or fail to have more kills than deaths. Remember, practice makes perfect.

Always grab a good pistol for close range, like a deagle or dual elites.,
Aim for the head.,
Grab a good primary weapon, like an SMG, or maybe you want a shotgun, or for experts, a sniper rifle.

Aim for the head, and always keep your gun at head level.",How to Survive in Counter Strike Source," You need a good internet connection (1mb/sec) and at least a Pentium D or Core 2 processor with at least a 128 MB Graphics Card (256+ recommended). You should also have at least 1 GB RAM to minimize lag. You'll find that as your system improves, so will your score.;
, If you aren't on the winning team, disconnect and rejoin on the other team. (Note: This tactic, when the teams are unfair is called ""stacking"". Team stacking is not only unfair, it is considered cheap and will earn you hate of many of the decent players. Most servers these days auto team balance, so even if you team stack, you will be automatically switched to even the teams.) Team stack is also known as ""Lame join"".

,,, Spend at least $30 on a pair of headphones ($40 if they come with a mic).


For example: You hear the footsteps of the last enemy that you need to kill. All of your teammates are dead, and so are his. You can use sound to your advantage and lay an ambush along his path, or hide and come out behind him.

, Jumping around a corner at the right second, or even better, waiting for someone to run past you will increase your odds dramatically.

, Not all guns fire in the same way. Spend some time on an empty server and shoot the wall to become more comfortable handling them. Never hold the trigger! Shoot short busts of bullets.

, The time it takes to raise your weapon is enough for someone to get a shot in at you.

Download and install the game.,
Open Steam and log in.,
Look out for the ""Latency"" of a particular server, ideally, you want this number to be as low as possible, giving you the best possible (glitch/lag free) experience.,
Wait for the server to load, some servers take longer than others, depending on how many additional tweaks (music, lights, other game effects) that server has.,
Chances are you will join a game that's already underway, if so, you'll have to wait until that round finishes, until then you will spectate (i.e.,
When the round starts, press ""B"", this will bring up the gun menu.,
A brief note on weapon choices.,
Movement and strafing is what gets most people confused.,

A few miscellaneous words of advice.,
From personal experience, how you're feeling emotionally can affect your game play enormously.,
That's pretty much it, have fun playing the game, it's extremely satisfying and challenging in ways that many games are not, and there's ALWAYS a bigger fish.

",How to Play Counter Strike," This can be done by downloading Steam (containing the game engine that runs CS and its servers) free from the official website (look on google). Once installed, CS:Source can then be purchased through Steam.;
, Then click the ""Servers"" button from the Steam menu. Wait a while for the massive list to appear. In Counter-Strike, each of those servers has a different game playing. The current map for each game, the number of players and whether the server has a password, are all shown in the servers window. Double click a server to join.

, You'll also develop favourite maps as you play and develop your style. Along with different maps come different game modes; one example is death match, where the emphasis is on getting many kills in a row, each new kill will raise you up to a better weapon in many cases. Another game mode is demolition (a.k.a. de_) where the terrorists can either win by killing all the counter-terrorists or by planting and detonating a bomb, which the CTs can try to defuse.

, You'll know when the loading is nearly done because the screen will say ""Sending client info..."". Then the fun begins! You'll first have to chose a side (Counter-Terrorist or Terrorist), each have slightly different weapons and spawn at different locations in the map.

, have the point-of-view of another player). Clicking the left mouse button can switch between players to spectate and space-bar allows you different spectating views. These are all default controls.

, At the start of every round in CS, you'll need to buy your toys to play with :) It may seem long at first but there are a few tricks, you can re-buy what you bought last round automatically (though obviously not if you have just joined a game) and the menu can be navigated and the guns chosen using keypad numbers. Soon it will become a reflex and take no more than 2 secs to get 'locked and loaded' as they say.

, There's no hard and fast rule here as everyone has a different style of play, but pretty much everyone agrees that on CT, the M4 Carbine is pretty accurate, on T, the AK is powerful but needs control to manage the recoil. Other guns have their own personalities (wow that's sad?) so you'll just have to get in there and find out for yourself!

, It needs a quite accurate coordination of the W,A,S,D keys and the mouse. The mouse controls where you look and thus where you shoot and is the most important skill for your hand to master. The mouse sensitivity can be adjusted in the in-game options menu. You want to start off low and increase the sensitivity as you get more comfortable with the CS environment.

, This goes for all weapons - especially rifles. CS is rather realistic any more than 2 or 3 shots becomes a spray, a spray is bad because it is not very accurate. Fire a few shots at a time and squeeze the bullets out, don't rap hard on the mouse button. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast, remember? Generally, you should aim for the torso or head. If you do feel inclined to spray (and trust me there are times when it just ""happens"") aim at the feet, then you might have a chance of nipping his head. Stick to the 2/3 shot principle and you'll go very far.

, You can chat by voice, by typing, and for tactical commands, you can use the in-game pre-recorded commands such as ""Go, go, go!"" and ""Cover me!"", which no-one pays much attention to, generally speaking :)

, Don't camp (wait in a corner/shadowed place and shoot people that walk past), it will get you killed faster by people who play that map often and it will just end up making you more frustrated. Also, try to get a sense of your team's abilities and try to add something different to it: for example using a Scout rifle and sniping at the opposition. Grenades are useful in tight situations and for disposing of cornered rats (careful, they bite).

, If you're feeling irritated or annoyed then you're not likely to play very well. The best attitude to try to maintain is happy-go-lucky, taking things as they come and shooting everything that moves!

For example, you shouldn't choose, say, an AWP. If you're a counter-terrorist, a good gun is the M4A1. It's a rifle named Carbine something. If you're a terrorist, you'll want the best SMG or the AK47. Either team can use shotguns or the machine gun, but they're often frowned upon by many people. Experiment with the guns and try to find one you're good with for either team and either situation. You want to have the gun and be ready by the time the timer finishes counting down. If you're a counter-terrorist, put the silencer on if the gun has one.;
, Flash bangs or regular frag grenades will do. This way if an enemy tries to pop in your base, you can flash them, back up, and kill them when they're recovering. The game begins. Make sure you're facing the wall with a blue rim on the top.

, Don't shoot right at the beginning. It shouldn't be a stare-off, but you want to let them shoot first, unless they're not shooting until you do. Once they shoot, with the earbuds on, strafe left or right until the firing sound is coming from straight in front of you.

, Look for missing blocks around you to determine where they are. If you see a whole portion missing, it probably means they're standing over a ledge, waiting for you to come through. Don't just run into that. Stay underground and shoot out enemies over the blocks in the middle (An easy way to get headshots).

, Try to be in there within 45 seconds after the round starts if you plan on rushing that round. You want to be sure that your gun isn't making too much noise for them to hear you.

, Do a quick look around to make sure there aren't any people who will get a headshot on you. Make sure the only ones in there are teammates.

, Careful, though, if you're playing with campers, they can get you from very... unexpected angles. Make sure that when you come up from holes, you come up looking in logical angles to ensure that you shoot first.

, If you have, spectator the enemy to see what they play like.

The recommended way to do this is to play deathmatch, as it gets you used to the types of guns that you will be playing with. Casual is also a good option, as it gets you used to the type of playing you will be doing in Competitive, a bomb scenario with limited money.


Consider getting Prime Matchmaking. This requires you to level up to level 21 and activate a 2-step verification with a phone, however you will meet fewer hackers and ""smurfs"" this way.
Casual also allows you to learn the main routes to get to the bomb site, meaning you will have more knowledge for the map.;
, This may seem counter-intuitive, as slower spinning means slower reactions, however the added accuracy is worth it. Since most guns can give a one shot headshot, accuracy is everything. For best results, find out how far you need to make your mouse move to do a full 360. Your mouse should move about 25 cm. If you are only moving 5 or 15 cm, a drastic change is needed


If your mousepad isn't big enough, a bigger one may be necessary, there are many places to get a 36 by 42 cm mousepad.

, Audio is a huge part of the game, and you can hear some sounds across the map, so you can determine where the any is even if you aren't near them. Coming with a good headset, of course, is raising your audio levels. Since you cannot predict how loud other people's microphones will be, you should keep the chat volume semi-low, and put the environmental sounds high

, Each of the main weapons has a definitive pattern in which their bullets go. You don't need to do this for every gun, just with the main weapons, such as an AK-47, M4A1-S (or M4A4), along with the SMG of your choice, the p90 is recommended.


You only need to learn the first 6-7 bullets, as they are the only bullets that change vertically, the rest go left and right randomly, however with it going up, you need to know how far to lower your weapon to get optimal headshot range.
Consider downloading a practice map off the workshop, they can be a good way to warm and practice your shots.

, Spraying is not a very accurate way to spend your shots, the more effective way to shoot is shooting in short, controlled bursts at long to medium range. The only reason you should spray is if the enemy is very close and you cannot possibly miss them.

, There will be time in the game in where you will need to use sub-machine guns or shotguns, such as on an anti-eco when your opponent is saving. You will need to know how to shoot with these weapons and kill people quickly so they will not be able to kill you and steal your gun. Be aware of how to spray with these guns, or how to use each shotgun. In most cases, you are able to run-and-gun with these weapons, so don't be afraid to change your style when using these weapons., When you are just walking around, don't have your crosshair near the body or feet, have it at about head level. Reason being, if you see an enemy that surprises you, you don't have time to get your gun into position then fire, you need to be able to get the first shot off right then.


If you type ""cl_showpos 1"" into console, then it tells you what Y coordinate you are related to the head, 0.00 being head height.

, The best way to do this would be to go into a private match game, then look in the top left and see what each place you travel too. However, some places are not consistent with the game, such as on cache, where the right side route to A is not called ""Corridor"", but rather ""Squeaky"". You can pick this up pretty fast in competitive.


In addition, you should know common economical call-outs. A ""full-save"" is where your team buy absolutely nothing, to save all your money for the next round. This is uncommon, most often seen if CT's win the first round, buy, and lose the second round. A ""half-save"" or ""half-buy"" is where you buy with about half of your money, so what you buy depends on your money. If you only have two or three thousand, buy armor and a pistol such as the P250 or Tec-9. If you have 5-6 thousand, you can consider buying a lower tier SMG or an SSG. An ""anti-eco"" round is a round in which you know the other team will be saving, so it would be unwise to buy powerful guns like AKs. As such, you should buy armor better at dispatching unarmored foes, such as the Mac-10 or UMP. A ""full buy round"" is a round in which you spend all or most of your money for this round, buying utilities like smokes and flashes.

, As clearly shown by their ranking, they are the best at what they do, so they can probably be trusted when watching what they do. If you can watch what these people do in certain positions on maps, odds are if you play similarly in the same position, you can do much better in that position. Along with this, you can learn some more unique grenade placements or places to boost., If you have to find new, random people with different skill levels each game, you aren't going to play as well. The people you play with might not even be able to talk, or just be griefing. If you can get a team of people that you know or get to know, your team can start doing better. This means that you know exactly where each person is going to be each round, and you can count on them to be where you expect to be, as well as you know how well that person can play, so you can guide them if needed., You can't expect to call a ""Cat Rush to B"" for example without ever talking it over with your team what that means. Go into each map, and talk over who is going to do what in whatever play you call. For example, if you call a ""Cat to B"" on Dust II, you can have one member watch mid, one throw a smoke to Lower Tunnels, one to peek to site etc. Your team will be a mess if you all just run in to site spraying everywhere., Every player should know what they are going to do that round and where they should be. An overlook of each type and who should play is below, but keep in mind these are not concrete roles. You may need to change up who is your support or lurk player if the other team keeps easily picking them off, or you may need to change your IGL if they aren't calling good plays.'

In Game Leader or IGL is the one who calls the plays. They can also be any of the other roles, as this is only really during the beginning of the round, and the rest is watching your and the other team's economy to make sure you know what to do next.
The entry-fragger. This player's point is to be the first one who goes into confrontations and gets the damage. Getting kills is good, but not absolutely necessary, as their main roles is to do significant damage onto lots of people so that the support player can mop up the kills, as well as get the information as to where the other team is. This person should always be given a rifle, even if they cannot afford it, and will die a lot with few kills, so their scoreboard rank may not be the best.
The Support. This person follows quickly behind the entry-fragger. They have 2 main roles. They are there to provide utility to the entry, by flashing them in, providing a smoke if they need to get away, or watching their back while the fragger rushes in. The other role is to clean up the people the fragger has tagged. The person needs to be accurate, maybe even more than the entry-fragger, as the support needs to be able to hit the shots, as if this player dies, you have few people left that can easily kill them.
The AWPer. As the name suggests, this person carries an AWP and uses it to either pick long or hold angles. Before that, they need to understand the economy. The AWP costs 4750 to buy, which unless you win every round including the anti-eco without dying, isn't going to be in a lot of people's price range, so they are going to need to save a lot in the first few rounds. This person, instead of buying a M4 or AK in the anti-eco, will often buy a FAMAS or Galil to save money. If they are on the CT side, they often won't buy a helmet or grenades either, to save even more money. Once they have an AWP, this person looks down mid, or the middle of any map. This is not only to get kills, but to see how many people are going to each site as well. This information can change your strategy depending on how many people are going to each site.
The lurker. This person is one who goes alone, walking, to other parts of the map to try to catch people rotating to the bomb, or from site to site. This person normally excels in the mid to late round game, as people are either rushing to get to the bomb, or rushing to get away from it, not checking every corner.

, If the round starts and people are standing in spawn just waiting for someone to lead them, you give the CTs valuable seconds to get set up and just wait it out. You have to have maximum coordination and preparation when taking a site, and everyone needs to be on board. Even if you aren't the one who normally calls bomb sites, but you notice that the pre-round is ticking away, you may need to make a decision and call it., Your ultimate goal should be to get the bomb planted through any means necessary. Even if you lose the round, it may be a win economically. Knowing this, everyone should rush the bomb site, picking up frags wherever you can, but rushing the bomb plant. After planting the bomb, you want to waste as much time as possible. In the first round, odds are there is only one, if any defuse kit on the CT side, meaning they are going to need a lot of time to get the bomb defused. If you can get the bomb planted, but still lose, you get an extra 800 each on top of the 1400 from losing a round, as well as a 300 bonus for whomever planted the bomb., Knowing that if you won, you have the economy in your favor, and vice versa for the CTs, your strategies should differ. If you won the pistol round, odds are you will probably win the next one, however do not get cocky. The CTs will probably save the next round, meaning you should have a light buy with good anti-eco uses. What this means is, since the CTs are saving, they are probably not going to buy armor, this allows for guns with low armor penetration, but high damage or fire rate to become extremely effective. Two good examples of this are the MP9 and the Nova shotgun. These offer a high damage output against unarmored opponents, as well as gives you a hefty kill reward, with 600 and 900 for SMGs and shotguns respectively, but be wary. If the CTs manage to win, especially by killing all of you, your economy is essentially gone for the next two rounds, forcing you to save. Get the bomb plant off and watch out for CTs going in for a sneaky defuse!

If you lose the pistol round, but planted the bomb, make your goal to be able to buy fully in the third round. You cannot buy effectively the second round, so it's wiser to save all your money, saving a smoke or two, as you will get a combined 3500 from losing two rounds in a row. You will also have an extra 800 from getting the bomb down, bringing your total to 4300, which is enough to buy armor and a helmet, an AK, and quite a few grenades, like a smoke or a Molotov and a flashbang. For this round, focus on getting the bomb planted and stealing a few guns. Everyone should be a in wolf pack, save the lurker, maybe, and go for picks while rushing on a bomb site. If you kill one, take their rifle and try to keep it until the next round, as you will benefit your economy when you don't need to buy a new gun. Get the bomb down early, as the extra 800 will give you a full set of grenades, or even the AWP player an AWP to look mid with, provided they don't buy armor. Losing this round isn't a huge deal, as you can buy on the third round regardless, but it would be a nice bonus.
If you lost the pistol round and did not get a bomb plant, you need to force buy. Since you received 1400 from losing, and whatever, if any, money you had left from the pistol round, the only supplies you can buy is armor and a pistol, preferably the Tec-9 or P250, due to their one shot capacities. You need a win here, otherwise you will be saving for 2 more rounds, which are hard, but not impossible to win on. You need to get early kills to pick up rifles, as they will be your saving grace when defending the bomb site. Plant the bomb if you can, but don't take unnecessary risks in doing so. Getting the win is everything, and since most people will have pistols, saving isn't that important except for the armor. Losing here sets you back miles, forcing you to save for two more rounds at least.

, If you've won the first 2 rounds, you have a decision. You can stick with your weapons, or upgrade to a ""full buy"", which means buy AKs. If you know the CTs cannot do a surprise buy, which is buying FAMAS on the third round, because they had bought the second round, stick with your guns. If you think they might buy weapons, buy up yourself. This is similar to counting cards in blackjack, you need to know where the money is and who has it. If you can predict what the CTs will do based on their economy, then you can also plan accordingly.

If you lost the first round, but got bomb planted on the second round, this is you chance to make a come back. Buy up armor and AKs, and grenades if you can afford them.
If you lost both rounds without a bomb plant, you will have to save.

, This is where the economy starts to go into a predictable pattern, if one team wins, the other has to save and will most likely lose again. They then get another attempt to take back the win and force the other team to spend more money, and eventually try to save. You need to keep an eye on the CT economy here, as they need to spend more than you. The M4A4 and M4A1-s cost 400 and 200 more respectively than the AK, and they also need to buy defuse kits. Your goal should be similar here, take bomb to a site, clear the site, and try to get bomb down if it can reasonably be done.

This is where people can start buying depending on their roles. The AWPer and buy his AWP, support and lurker start buying up on grenades, as well as the lead player can start buying his flashes. Knowing where you are on your team will determine what to buy here.

, You are trying to defend the bomb site at all costs from a defuse, and if that fails, defuse it as fast as possible. The bomb gives a huge economic boost for the Terrorists, so you don't want that to happen. You want to stop the onslaught of terrorists, but keep your encounters long range. The USP-S is a one-shot headshot from any range towards unhelmeted opponents, and terrorists cannot buy helmets first round. Split your team up, 2 going to each bombsite, and one going mid.

There are some exceptions to this rule, such as on Cobblestone, in which you will probably want to consider putting 3-4 people B site, as it is an easy and common site for T's to take, and is nearly impossible to hold with just 2 players on the pistol round.

, As soon as you can see what site the Terrorists are pushing towards, call it out for your team to rotate. You want as many players as possible defending the site, and the sooner you see bomb coming to a site the sooner they can get there.

Be careful not to over-commit to a bombsite. In higher-level play, the T's may rush 2-3 players one bomb site to force you to rotate, and then send the bomb and the remaining players to the other bombsite. Until you can see bomb on the minimap, don't completely abandon a site.

, If you won the pistol, odds are you'll win the next one too, but if you lost, you are in dire straights. If you won, the Terrorists will need to save, and they absolutely need that bomb plant. You need to stop that at all costs, so buy the anti-eco weapons with high damage against unarmored opponents and high kill rewards, such as shotguns and SMGs (excluding the p90). You, again, have to stop that bomb plant at all costs. If they get the plant down, they can buy AKs the following round, and you will have competition for a point. However, if you can stave off the plant, the Terrorists will need to save again.

If you did not win, you are most likely going to lose the next few rounds. You have to save up more than the Terrorists, as their supplies cost significantly less than yours. You mainly are looking for a few kills that will force the Terrorists to buy armor again, wasting their economy, and sneaking a weapon or two away if you can. You can try to buy light the third round, with Famas and SMGs, however if you lose that round, you have to save again until round 5. Your main goal is to be able to buy fully by the 4th round.

, If you lost, this is just another save for you, and if you managed to stop the bomb plant from happening, this is another save from the Terrorist side. If the Terrorists got the bomb planted, however, this is the first round both teams can buy fully. This is the first ""real"" match of skill, as both teams are fully bought with rifles. You need to win this, otherwise its back to saving for you. Stopping the bomb plant would be quite beneficial to you, however is not absolutely necessary, as if the Ts lose 3 in a row, they only get 2400, not enough to buy an AK, even with the bomb plant., This is where the game stabilizes and becomes a pattern, win, get an easy win, go against a rifle match, save, and so on. This is where buying Defuse kits and grenades is not optional each round, you need to have at least one defuse kit on each bomb site, as you will lose rounds stupidly because of this mistake., The Midgame is not a defined point, but rather when the economy has ""stabilized."" The midgame lasts until the very last round, and even into overtime. This is where neither team buys ""light"" or ""eco"" weapons when the other team saves, as money becomes slightly less important, but still vital for a game. This is where both teams can buy fully for at least a round, and be able to half-buy Famas or Galil the next. From this point, the game begins to become all about studying patterns and knowing what the other team will buy., The point of every round in the midgame is, as you might expect, to get points. This might seem to be common sense, however, remember in the early game where sometimes your role was to simply force the other team to save the next round. This is not to say you shouldn't try to force the team to save, as it guarantees the enemy team will be under gunned, however, instead of just focusing on getting the bomb down, for example, focus on getting it to explode. Don't rush the game on either side at this point, you can afford to plan carefully and move in when completely ready., If you just won two or more rounds in a row, and you know the other team had just fully bought armor, rifles, grenades and etc, then you can make a safe assumption that they are probably out of money and are going to have to save. This is not change how you prepare for a round in the midgame. You don't throw your weapons away to buy SMGs or shotguns, as even if you do get a few kills with them, you will take a net loss, as the next round you have to throw that gun away and buy a rifle, as they will be fully armored by the next round. This knowledge is simply a luxury that lets you take a few more risks, knowing an AWP probably isn't around the corner., This is where you are in a scenario where you are extremely unlikely to win, and you have something that would be a fallacy for your team or beneficial for the opposing team for you to lose. For example if you are a CT, the bomb is planted, you are the only member and the other team has full members, you most likely won't win that. If you have no armor and just a pistol, who cares? Rush in and try to get a lucky headshot, you can cost them armor and a rifle, and if you do die it's only a few hundred dollars in their inventory. However, if you have full armor, an AWP, and grenades, well it would be stupid to waste the thousands you have trying to clutch, so just hide in the back of the map and wait until the round is over and you can have teammates support you., Guns like an AWP watching mid or having a 3 smoke set-up to run into B site as a terrorist, are viable options Worst-case scenario is you have to save and then go back with a buy the round after that. Consider buying utilities like defuse kits as a team instead of one or two people, as looking around for a kit can waste precious seconds when needing to defuse a bomb., This was already briefly talked about, but you shouldn't be rushing into bombsites or rushing the Ts anymore. Each play should be carefully called with information from people watching. If you notice that the CTs stacked B, head towards A, slowly killing unaware players on your way to the bomb site. If you notice the Ts are rushing B, start rotating and watching to see if it's a fake. You shouldn't be going for meaningless strategies like a bomb rush even though you know will die, or trying to stick a kitless defuse, play patiently and collected in these rounds., You need to know what each person is going to buy, who is going to defend what site, or what site you are pushing onto. You cannot expect to win games without proper synergy and support from teammates, as you cannot defend or take a bomb site with 2 players on it, and the other 3 going to the other. In the famous words, teamwork makes the dream work., You need grenades to take a bomb site in the later rounds, especially on the Terrorist side. Whether it is to block off 2 players lines' of sight to the bomb or to do some extra damage to the opposing team, you will not be as successful without grenades to aid you. You also need to know places to throw these grenades that will help you without putting you in unnecessary danger. Spending some time in a private match or casual game can help you practice these., This is where you can see part or all of an enemy before they can see much of you. A great example of this is on Dust II, on Long A. From the CT side, one can look around the corner to Doors and easily watch and the enemies entire body if they are there, however someone in the Doors will only be able to see a side of the CT, making the CT a much harder target to hit. This is just about knowing where you can be and look. Another thing to know is if you are covered from angles. For example, if you are watching long from Site A on Dust II, you can go back as far as you can, and people coming from Cat won't be able to see you., These should be predetermined, and known by each player. If you are an entry-fragger and you pick up an AWP, don't keep it, give it to the player who was playing the AWP. This also will affect what you buy, as support and lurk players will typically buy more grenades than the AWPer or Entry-Fragger., If you lose a round in the mid-game, it isn't a good idea to full buy again unless you can afford it with plenty of money. If you are low on money, don't be afraid to save for a round. It is better than buying low-power weapons, and then losing all your money the next round. Similarly, if you know the other team is going to need to save the next round, plan your play accordingly., This is where you either constantly criticize your teammates for actions that weren't their fault or teamkilling your own players. This isn't to say telling your teammates what they did wrong is bad, but it is to be done in a constructive way, not to tear them down. After all, this is just a game, there isn't a need to get worked up about it. Just focus and have fun during the experience, and you won't cause too much trouble."

START FAST.,

In war- based games, you will want to get a recon team or aircraft to scope out enemy positions, and see what kind of army they are preparing, so you can counterattack with the perfect units.

Obtain Strategic Points.,
Understand the Doctrines.,
Take Cover!,
Upgrade.,
Use Resource Management.",How to Play Company of Heroes," In each game you play you will need to expand from your base and capture strategic points. These are vital as they will supply your army with Manpower, Munitions and Fuel. Not only do these points supply you with resources, they also increase your population cap for every sector secured by your forces.

Note. All sectors on the map must be secured within your own territory, otherwise you will not receive supply.



 

;
, Before each single player and multiplayer skirmish, you will be asked to select one out of three different doctrines. Whichever one you choose will ultimately decide how the game is played, as each is different to their own. To be able to utilise the assets available, you build up experience overtime, by building and killing enemies. For example purposes, as the Americans you can choose one of the following three:

Infantry Company - Ideal for defensive styled strategies, the infantry doctrine supplies the player with access to off map artillery and Ranger squads. Both of these unlockable assets excel at defeating enemy armor as well as being effective against infantry.






Armor Company - Although sporting the most powerful assets available to the Americans, it is also the slowest. Assets such as being able to instantly replace tanks lost on the battlefield over a period of time give a huge bonus to your army. Reinforcements are also available in the form of an M26 Pershing Heavy Tank, the perfect tank killer for the Allies.






Airborne Company - Perfect for raiding operations behind enemy lines, the Airborne doctrine relinquishes assets such as Paratroopers, who can be dropped behind enemy lines for sneak attacks. Or if that wasn't enough, a P-47 Recon aircraft can be outfitted to perform strafing or bombing runs at the players discretion.







, Like in real life, if an enemy machine gun is set up in an ideal spot to ambush infantry on a clear road, the chances of the infantry pulling through without losses are slim. Therefore when advancing it is important to utilise cover for exposed troops. The cover system works in a colour code, Green meaning the squad is in excellent cover, Yellow being moderately good cover and Red meaning not in cover.


If a squad is caught in a firefight without cover, their icon will flash yellow meaning they are being 'Suppressed' which also means they are trying to engage, but not effectively. If they continue to be suppressed the yellow flash will turn red, and a notice will appear above the squad saying 'Pinned!' which means they are not engaging and will likely die soon. Fortunately you can give the order to retreat to the selected squad. When they are retreating they become uncontrollable, and run back to your HQ with a speed and defense bonus.

, As you play the game you will most likely notice that certain units can be upgraded to maximise their effectiveness. American engineers for example can be given minesweepers and flamethrowers, the latter being deadly to infantry and occupied structures. Some Upgrades are timed, such as AP Shells for the US M1 57mm AT Gun, which fires armor piercing rounds for a short duration, which is lethal to enemy tanks.

, Literally everything you command will rely in some way on your resource pool. Which is why it is important to hold strategic points to allow a constant stream of resource to gather for your army.

Understand the difference of micro and macro, and be able to identify the three most basic strategies.,
Prepare for the game by adjusting some settings in the User Interface.",How to Play Age of Empires 31,"


The Rush is one of the simplest strategies around, but there is quite a lot of risk involved with it. With the rush the player sacrifices the economy in order to build an army before the enemy has any way to counter it. Because the rushing player sacrifices so much of his economy for an early attack, a failed rush often results in the victory for the other player. The most famous is perhaps the Zergling Rush from Starcraft. Rushing in AoE3 is very hard because the defending player can garrison all his villagers inside the town center and build some anti-rush forces for a small fee.
The Boom is quite hard to do, as it require the player to balance economic growth and military investments. The idea is to keep military investments at a minimum through the first parts of the game, building up the economy until the point where you can overpower your opponent with superior forces through upgrades. A single misstep, though, and your forces might be outnumbered and defeated in the early parts of the game.
The Turtle, or Turtling as it's called is a defensive strategy as the name suggests. The player invests only in a small force and builds more static defense like towers. When turtling you focus on economy and defense, not building an attacking force.
Macro is the term given to any gameplay that benefits the player in the long term. Expanding your base or taking map control are examples of macro. Macro is to micro as strategy is to tactics. With good macro you will always have a good army and plenty of resources.
Micro is the opposite of macro, and refers to moving individual units. It is most often used about military units. Good micro is an essential skill, and it can make your troops a lot more effective. It is a skill that must be practiced, but there is a good amount of techniques that can be learned. One example is ""dancing"", where a player takes a ranged unit, fires at a melee one, moves away and fires again. Repeating this process, the melee unit won't be able to land a single hit on the ranged unit.

, You should choose to have the list of players enabled, which allows you to see which age your enemy is in and how many trading posts he has. The game score also indicates how well you're doing compared to the enemy. In addition, make sure you can see additional information about how you distribute your villagers. This way you can see how many villagers are working on gathering resources at any time.


Start a normal Skirmish game and select one computer opponent. You should be able to beat the computer on the difficulty Hard without too much trouble if you're familiar with the interface and the game. It does not matter what civilization you choose; what you read in this guide applies to the whole game.
The map you choose is of great importance. Avoid water maps because it complicates the road for victory. Also, to keep things as straight-forward as possible avoid maps with choke points. You may want to select ""Record Game"" and thus be able to review your own game and figure out what went wrong in case you should lose.

Focus on collecting as much food as possible as soon as the game starts.,
Select your explorer and start exploring.,
Make 2-3 villagers gather wood, and consider making a market.,
Build your economy related buildings away from the enemy, and your military units toward him.,
Keep your villagers hunting as close to the town center as possible as it offers protection from harassment.,
Advance to the Colonial Age when you have at least 17 villagers.",How to Play Age of Empires 32," Gather at all the crates first, and build a house to support the villagers that will pop out. Then focus on hunting or gathering berries. You absolutely do not want to build mills until you've exhausted all the natural resources. You should also start creating villagers from the very beginning, and you should have continuous production of them until you choose to age up to the Colonial Age. So make sure you have enough food.;
, You want to locate the enemy base as soon as possible. He will probably be as far away from the edge as you are, so circle the entire map at that distance from the edge. Discovering the enemy's location is not too difficult. It's also useful to assign your explorer a number. To do this, select him and press control + (number).

, Wood is very precious at this stage of the game, and building a market won't benefit you immediately. You will, however, have a stronger economy later in the game. If you don't build a market you will have your barracks up sooner.


One thing to keep in mind while gathering resources is to spread your villagers around, thus reducing risk. As an example, you can mine from two goldmines instead of one. This does require some more attention to detail, though, and it can be harder to protect your villagers in case you're being attacked.

, This way your economy will have some protection while your troops won't be obstructed by buildings. Build close to the town center and build towers for protection.

, While hunting you'll gradually scare animals away from your town center, but you can avoid this by hunting from the outside and towards your town center. By using a couple of villagers you can scare groups of animals towards your home base for more security. You can also consider building a tower/outpost/blockhouse later in the game to support your hunting if it's a long way from your home base. If attacked, simply hide your villagers inside and if the enemy persists, bring in your troops. Doing this also increases your map control and can help you notice enemy advancements.

, For more skilled players 15 villagers is more advisable but beware for you must know what you are doing economy wise if you chose this strategy.

"
"
Start building your barracks immediately.,
Keep producing troops while raiding the enemy villagers.,
Expect an attack around this time.,
Notice what type of playing style you have.",How to Play Age of Empires 33," If possible, you should also send a shipment with military troops. As soon as your barracks are built, start building troops. When you have an army of 10-20 men including your explorer, go for an attack. This attack is far from the final blow, but it can be really decisive.
If you've done a good job of scouting, you might be able to locate the enemy's villagers. At least some of them are likely to be hunting out of reach from towers and enemy forces. Raiding these will give you an advantage. First of all, villagers cost resources so just by killing a few villagers you can force your opponent to spend money on something else than military troops. Second, a dead villager doesn't collect resources, you can add all the resources a villager could have been gathered to the loss. Thirdly, you're denying the enemy player resources. Hopefully he will retreat his villagers and in this period of time he will, of course, not be able to gather resources with those villagers.
Note that this isn't a rush. It's called harassment and its purpose is not to defeat the enemy base. Therefore, keep your troops alive and do not attack buildings. In fact, you should ignore towers and trading posts. With some luck and skill you will be able to take the lead at this point through a stronger economy.

, Many players are unable to focus on both building their home base and engaging in military operations, and it is simply something that takes practice. The buildings you need the most at this point are the market, if you hadn't already built it, and the stable. You can expect your population to go up, so try to stay ahead of the curve and build houses.

, Instead of going for the very early harass, you could wait for the enemy to come to you. When he attacks you, take out his force with the support from towers etc and immediately go for a counter-attack.

, You may wish to age up again quickly, or if things are going well, keep producing and sending units. If you feel that you can produce units faster than the enemy can kill yours even with you sitting in his base, do just that. Build one more barracks and pump out troops as fast as possible. You might also be able to take this path to victory if you're able to take down the enemy barracks. If your enemy is aging up, you want to age up as well in most cases.

"
Try to respond to your opponents' building and counter his units.,
Try to macro up regardless.,
Get your fortress up as soon as possible.,
Do not feel limited by a population cap of 200.",How to Play Age of Empires 34," However, as the game progresses, it becomes harder and harder to give advice. As an example, if your opponent builds three stables you should make a lot of pikemen to counter cavalry. But the number of strategies you can use at this point is so large that it's impossible to say that something is wrong to do.

, The later units become more gold-demanding (especially artillery), so an extra plantation is a good idea. Also, you should be exhausted for natural resources at this point, so if you still have villagers hunting half-across the map, pull them back and build a mill instead. If you're low on wood, consider some extra gold and use the market to buy wood. But it's not cost-effective, so only buy wood when you need it badly (for buildings or ships). With units, you should be able to find an alternative without a wood-cost.

, Be offensive with the placement of your fortress, but don't overreach yourself. If you can't back up your fortress with forces at a few moments notice you risk losing it.

, Remember that units not fighting are a waste and that upgrading units is more effective when you already have them. Likewise, don't upgrade units if you don't have any. Beyond the Fortress Age, the idea of the game is to basically keep producing troops and tech-ing up. Cards are your friends. Your card shipments are incredibly useful. Somethings such as forts and military units have to wait for there are many more useful shipments. Increasing your speed time of infantry and cavalry is very useful and needed. Make a deck that suits you but have many essential cards such as crates of wood, food, or coin or many improvements to give you an advantage against your opponent.

Reboot your computer.",How to Increase Frames Per Second in Counter Strike," Lowering these will result in an uglier game, but it will perform much, much better. Most players will get significant FPS gains from making the changes in this section, and won't need to worry about the more advanced sections below.


Click the Options button in the CS:GO main menu. You'll find this at the top of the screen.
Select Video Settings. This will open the video options for the game.;
, Lower all of the below settings to their lowest settings, then play your game and see what kind of frame rates you get. You can then raise settings one at a time until you reach a good compromise between graphics and performance. Details for each setting are explained below.

, The resolution is the number of pixels that the game renders on your screen. A higher resolution will result in a crisper image, but at a cost to performance. Lowering your resolution will have one of the biggest impacts on your FPS.


Choose 1600x900 or 1280x720 if you usually use 1920x1080. This will keep the same aspect ratio. The image will be blockier and a little blurrier, but you should notice a major increase in smoothness.Avoid switching to a 4:3 aspect ratio. While this will give big performance boosts, you actually lose part of the viewable area. This puts you at a disadvantage while playing the game.

, If this is enabled, your performance will be decreased in an effort to save your laptop's battery life. If you're going for maximum framerate, plug your laptop in and disable this setting.

, There are several effects and detail options in the ""Advanced Video Options"" section. Generally, turning these down or off will always result in a performance boost, though the gains you experience will vary depending on your system.Shadows can be particularly taxing on your computer, so lower ""Global Shadow Quality"" if you can stomach the results.
Lowering the ""Effect detail"" option will help prevent you from slowing down during chaotic firefights.
Lowering the ""Model / Texture Detail"" option will help with older graphics cards, but will not make as much of a difference if its your CPU causing problems.

, Anti-aliasing is a process that smooths out edges in the game, making them look less jaggy. Anti-aliasing can be very computationally expensive, which means it will drag down your FPS. If you don't mind things looking a little rough, set Anti-Aliasing to ""2x MSAA"" or turn it off. This will give a big performance boost.

, Motion blur is designed to make movements look smoother at lower frame rates. Since you're gunning for a high FPS, you don't need this enabled. Disabling motion blur will improve performance and make it easier to see what's going on when you look around in the game.

, Make sure any programs that are obviously open, such as Word or your web browser, are all closed before starting CS:GO. Closing open programs will help free up RAM that CS:Go can use to improve performance.

, Your torrent programs can be easy to forget, as they typically minimize to the system tray. If you're actively downloading a torrent, both your connection and your FPS will suffer. Check your system try to see if your torrent program is downloading in the background.

, If you have an antivirus program that takes a lot of resources like Norton or McAfee, consider turning it off while you play Counter-Strike. You won't receive viruses through the game, so you can safely disable it while you're playing.


Consider installing a lightweight antivirus instead if you need to disable it often. Windows comes with Windows Defender for free, which is an adequate protection against most viruses with a minimal performance footprint. See Turn on Windows Defender for details.

, You may have malware running in the background on your computer, eating up your resources without you knowing. Running regular malware scans will help keep your system clean and free up more power for games.


One of the most effective malware scanners is Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. You can download it for free from malwarebytes.org. See Remove Malware for details.

, The Steam Overlay appears when you press the shortcut keys for it, and allows you to access Steam features while in game. This can cause performance problems for older computers, so you can turn it off.

, This will open the Steam preferences menu.

, This will open the overlay options.

, This will disable the Steam Overlay for all of your games, including CS:GO.

, The Steam Overlay will no longer load, potentially improving your performance.

, You can add special commands to CS:Go that modify it when it launches. These commands can help optimize performance.

, This will open a new window.

, Another new window will open for you to enter launch options.

, You can paste the following code exactly for the best performance gains. If your computer is dual-core (most modern computers are quad-core), change -threads 4 to -threads 2:


-novid -high -threads 4 -nojoy +cl_forcepreload 1 -nod3d9ex

, When you boot up CS:GO, the intro video will not load, the game will take high CPU priority, it will run across all four cores of your processor, joystick support will be disabled, maps will preload, and Alt+Tab ↹ will work better.

, If you haven't updated your graphics card drivers in a while, you'll want to get the latest version. Updated drives can make a big difference in performance, especially for older cards. You can figure which drivers you need by opening the Device Manager.


Open the Start menu or screen and type ""device manager"" to find and open it.

, This will show all of the graphics adapters that you have installed. You will likely only have one or two items listed here.

, The ""Display adapters"" section will show the current model of your graphics card. If you have an Intel and an AMD or NVIDIA entry, you can ignore the Intel entry. The model of your graphics card will be listed after the manufacturer (i.e. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670)


When you have two adapters listed here, one if for your motherboard and the other is for your graphics card. The motherboard graphics will almost always be Intel, and is not used if your monitor is connected to a graphics card from NVIDIA or AMD.

, You'll be able to download drivers directly from the manufacturer's website. Below are the driver download sites for the major manufacturers:


NVIDIA - http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx

AMD - http://support.amd.com/en-us/download

Intel - https://downloadcenter.intel.com/


, Use the search function or the automatic driver detection feature on the driver website to find the correct download. All of the major manufacturers can automatically detect your adapter and download the correct drivers for you.


Most driver installers are about 300 MB in size, and may take a little while to download.

, After you download the driver installer, run it from your Downloads folder to begin installation. The installation may take a while, and your screen may flicker or go black during it.


Decline the installation of any driver management software like GeForce Experience, as these typically just make your games run slower when they're open.

, If you're playing on a laptop, you'll get the best performance if you are plugged in. This is because your system will automatically throttle itself if it is running off battery to help make the battery last longer. This is great for word processing, but terrible for gaming., Your power-saving settings may be holding your hardware back, even if you're plugged in. You can change these settings from the Control Panel.


You can open the Control Panel from the Start menu. In Windows 10, right-click the Start button and select ""Power Options"" to skip the whole Control Panel.

, If you are in Category view, click ""Hardware and Sound,"" then ""Power Options.""

, This will reveal the ""High performance"" option.

, This will prevent your laptop from throttling your hardware while playing the game, which may increase your performance. Make sure to keep the laptop plugged in, as you'll lose battery quickly.

, Visit http://www.coderbag.com/Programming-C/Disable-CPU-Core-Parking-Utility and click the link at the bottom of the article to download it. This utility will ""unpark"" your idle CPU cores, potentially giving your game a serious performance boost.


This only applied to computers running Windows 7 and earlier. This behavior changed in Windows 8 and 10, making this process irrelevant.

, Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desktop or Documents folder and run the UnparkCPU.exe file inside. Confirm that you want to run it when prompted by Windows.

, This will check to see if any of your CPUs are currently in ""Park"" mode.

, All of your parked CPU cores will be unparked, allowing your system to access their full potential.

, You'll need to reboot in order for the changes to take effect. Once you reboot, load up CS:GO to see if there's a noticeable difference."

, Sound is the most important factor in CS. By listening to footsteps, you can know when to start walking silently (default - shift) or to crouch and hide in a dark area. Pay attention to the type of footstep sound: there are different sounds for gravel, wood, cement, and steel.

, There are leagues for all different skill levels. Most of the really competitive teams play in CAL or CEVO. Most games are played in a 5 on 5 format on select bomb defuse maps. There are other, less competitive leagues, but most serious players don't lend them any respect.

, Scrim a few times per week if possible. It will make you better at strats and prepare you for live games.

Learn about how long it takes for you to get from your spawn to specific places.",How to Improve Your Skill in Counter Strike2," When you are turning corners, jump and duck just in case anyone planned on you popping out. This strategy can work well against snipers, but in an enclosed space, it is always best to move quickly and always make sure to aim at head level unless you know the opponent is crouched.

, Hipfiring is an excellent way to improve your accuracy and reduce recoil and spread. It also prevents Sniper Rifle Scopes from blurring out while moving and makes you slightly harder to hit.

, Taking on a group of players by yourself can mean certain death except for the best of CS players. Try to make sure that your teammates aren't trying to use grenades before you go around a corner because you might be asking for a flash in the face!

, If you're moving, you will miss and have to wait until you can fire because your next shot can be deadly.

, For example, if you know how long it takes for a CT to get into lower B tunnels, then all you have to do is listen. Or, if you hear some footsteps, you can take appropriate measures to ensure that you don't die helplessly.

Sidearm: Desert eagle (it is the most powerful pistol)






If the map is a closed one which involves close range fire, choose a good assault rifle,shotgun, smg or machine gun.






Do not use SMG, machine guns and shotguns if the range is big because they are not very accurate. Use assault rifles or sniper rifles instead.







, Most upper level players disable it because it makes aiming a lot easier with rifles and the deagle.

, Do this after buying your weapons/armor. If somebody is camping you can flash him out or grenade him out.

, If you throw it straight in front of you, it will blind you as well. Always throw flashbangs on corners or, after throwing it, hide behind a wall or obstacle and make sure it doesn't come in your view.

, Pinpointing an enemy with sound is very helpful, but there still remains the problem of having to remove that threat. There are options like flashes, grenades, and peeking the player in a one on one situation, but overall your best bet is to take the opponent out without risking yourself or wasting a flash or grenade that you may need later.

You can usually suppress the enemy by throwing a grenade every minute or so. One strategy is to crouch by a wall that connects to a tunnel with and open ceiling. Being so close allows you to hear everything on the other side as if you were right there, so when you hear footsteps close in the tunnel, throw your flash bang and spray down the tunnel. You can also fake flash people with smokes. Helps a lot when you need it. Worth a shot if you only have a smoke left.;
, Call that you're throwing it.

,, 2 shots at a time from the AK or the m4a1 will guarantee accuracy.

, The most effective way to shoot without getting killed is to always be moving but pause for a split second to pull the trigger when you have your shot lined up.

, Accurate shots are always more effective... why spray and hope the fifth or seventh bullet recoils up to the head when you can dink them with the first or second bullet? It takes practice to perform but it's worth it.

, Crouching is good if you get behind someone and don't feel like aiming for the head, or for hiding by short boxes or what have you. It takes time to crouch, time to stand back up, and makes you slow if you're in a firefight, and you have to readjust the height of your crosshairs if you want a headshot. Crouching does not change the accuracy of the first few shots fired, it only lessens recoil. If you play properly, recoil will be less of an issue.

, You will get headshots fast if you only have to adjust the side-to-side. It becomes more timing and less aiming when they step out into head-level crosshairs and increases your reaction time by a good clip. Very effective strategy!

"

Do not use up all of your money every round.,
Avoid the spam areas or the places in the map where most deaths occur.,
Don't spray!,
When using the AWP, always stop or crouch just before shooting as shooting while moving with the AWP gives you NO accuracy!

If you're in a pub, try sticking around with the best player on the team.,
Do not talk with other players, unless it is working as a team to get the objective done.",How to Improve Your Counter Strike Gameplay," Every good player goes two or three rounds without buying a single thing. This saves money to buy a better gun. If your team wins, that's even better for you! If you're ranging between $0-$1,500, do not buy anything. You want to save money until you have at least $3,000. If you're a CT, you always want to buy a defusal kit first. You can always use the extra points/money. It's perfect for those times you wish you had the kit. They're not expensive, you always have enough for one!;
, If you do not have a decent gun, there is no need to get into a gun fight. It's best to avoid being detected. Camp when necessary, don't camp around if it's not strategical! That only bothers the players that are dead. If you're left with a few players, walk. Most players will just keep running along and expect to hear everybody. If you walk, this increases your chances of getting the first shot. Wear headphones and listen to sounds! Listen to footsteps, grenades, and gunfire! Think smart. Don't jump out too early, sneak around! Maneuver around boxes/walls to avoid them from seeing you. This works well with CT's. Hide in a bombsite, and wait for them to start planting and them come out of your hiding spot to shoot them. They won't have enough time to get a gun out. Be sure to stay covered, if possible. You need to avoid flashes! When climbing ladders, crouch. It doesn't make as much noise.

, Aim precisely and always shoot for the head! If you're in a situation where you see the enemy, but they don't see you, don't spray or shoot around. Wait for that perfect headshot. If they don't see you, take advantage of that time to get a precise shot. Practice your aiming and don't take too long to shoot.You wouldn't want to just hold on fire button, you should get used to tapping it. Move the mouse in the opposite direction of recoil. This prevents it from kicking around as much.

,, If there's not an experienced player, try to stick with the team. You can't really find good team work in pubs anyway, but it's best to be with a group than to die alone. Oh, and try not to stack the teams. It only annoys the people on the server. Play smart and don't try anything stupid. If you're a CT on a bomb map, stay at the bombsites. Don't waste time in the Terrorists' spawning area.

, Don't act immature or complain if you die. Learn to accept the fact that there are people better than you. It's about the fun. There's no need to attack other players verbally. It just makes you look like an idiot. If you're gonna say something, just say it inside your head and try to correct your mistakes. You get better over time, lots of time. It takes years to get good. Once you're experienced, try joining CAL with a clan.

, If they are attempting to shoot you through a door, they already know you are there and there is no hope in running. Wait for them to run out of ammo then pop out and shoot them.

, As mentioned before, headphones are the recommended way to listen to Counter-Strike as you play, but turning off music and playing in a quiet environment helps, too. Getting a microphone is a MUST for Counter Strike as it is much faster than typing and allows you to warn teams of danger.

Your job as a Counter-Terrorist is to either kill all of the terrorists before they plant the bomb or defuse the bomb after it has been planted by the terrorists.


You will know when the bomb has been planted because the announcer will state ""bomb has been planted.""
You will also know when it has been planted because of a timer in the corner of your screen indicating when the bomb will explode. Once the bomb has gone off, you will lose the match.;
, There are two places where the bomb can be planted by the terrorists: Site A and Site B. You will need to pay attention to the minimap or what your teammates are saying over the in-game chat.


The map will show you how to get to the planted bomb. It will be clearly marked on the map.
Your teammates may also post in chat or which site the bomb has been planted.

, Most maps in the Counterstrike games are fairly simple, with clear markings directing players toward bomb sites. In addition to the in-game map, the walls in the game are painted with arrows pointing toward bomb sites.


Follow your teammates if you get confused. Chances are they are going to the same place as you are. It is also better to show up in force to the active bomb site, so try to keep up with them.

, Carefully enter the bomb site while keeping a close lookout for terrorists. The terrorists do not want you to defuse the bomb, so eliminate any the instant you see them.


It is best to strategically and slowly enter the bomb site. Do not run in guns blazing unless you are incredibly confident in your reaction and aiming skills.
Coordinate with your team before entering the bomb site. It is best to strategize with your teammates and assign certain roles so that it is not complete chaos once you enter. Decide on who will be defusing the bomb and who will be eliminating enemies. Strategizing beforehand will give you an edge over the opposing team.

, The bomb will be on a large container somewhere within the bomb site. You will hear beeping which increases in volume the closer you are to the bomb.


The bomb is a timer and a number pad attached to dynamite. Look for the colorful wires which mark the bomb

, If you haven't changed it, this is the key you want to press. After E is pressed, you will see a meter in your screen start to fill up. Once the meter is full, the bomb is defused and your team has won the match.

,Crouching forward along the left-hand side of the projector table, blast the remaining two chairs towards the wall, trying to get them as far left as they will go (aim at the top-left-most parts)

,
Once you are lined up behind the first chair and the right hand doorway (the one furthest from the pair or hostages), shoot it through the door.

,
Stand up & run behind the remaining two chairs you shot against the wall.,
Shoot these chairs into the threshold/doorway, blocking the way in/out.,
Ignore them & run to the left hand side of the room again, near the hostages, so that you are behind the left-hand side of the projector screen wall, able to view both inside the cabinet room bottom-left-hand corner to the cabinet room hidey-camp-pos, and the entrance to the door you just blocked at the right.

Strafe across the doorway, aiming head-high, making sure that you are at least in line with, or behind the line projector screen wall.,
Repeat steps #21 & #24.

,,,,,,,,,,,, By the time you are in position to shoot them into the threshold, you should have automatically reloaded.

, At this point you should encounter a CT turning right around the corner of T-spawn, if their rush is a complete success.

,, Three stacked cabinets aren't necessarily the best result, but you won't have time to worry about that now, as long as there are cabinets in front of the door. If the door isn't *totally* blocked, you'll still have a fair chance of hearing an intruder. However, you will have less time to prepare your flashbang if a CT is able to run straight through the cabinet arcade.

,, That CT will invariably try to jump, or shoot their way through either barricade, unless they encounter resistance from your teammates.

, Cabinets & chairs make totally different sounds when they are moved/come in contact with something. The lighter scraping sound you will recognise from chairs moving across the carpet. If its cabinets you hear, go to #24. If it's chairs you hear;

, You need to make sure that the flash goes off at least level with their field of vision, and as close to them as possible. If the flash explodes behind them, they will only be partially blinded. You should have used the projector screen wall to screen yourself from the flash, by moving right, behind its width-side.

, Normally, CT's will be wary of any Ts hiding in the dark, behind the projector desk & chairs, and will be aiming around there. That is dependent upon the proximity of your FB hit, however. If they are only partially blinded, they *may* go behind the projector wall to your left, but you can't afford to risk being flashed by yourself in that instance.

, If you threw your FB right, anyone in the doorway should all be blind (and possibly stuck in the barricade) Or retreating (with the barricade partially intact). If there is no-one visible there, turn and cover your back. Any partially-blinded CT who took to your left from #21 should be @or near pos#15, covering the hostages, or worse, circling around the projector screen wall to shoot you in the back. If you think that this has happened, sprint to pos#15, and then to the dark corner along the wall of the hostages. Crouch. Wait for them to reappear near the hostages - they may possibly think the room is empty and enter the cabinets room, also.

, Make sure you have collected any items dropped by kills.

, If you hear the cabinets going then it's safe to assume that a CT has already breached T-spawn. If you have any FB's (Flash Bang's) left, they should already be pin-pulled & ready.

,, This will help temporarily screen you against any insurgent CTs at the far side.

Keep training villagers.,
Advance to the Classical Age through a minor god who grants you improvements that benefit the type of soldier(s) you plan on training.,
Choose from your two options:


Start rushing if you really want to take a risk.,
Research more improvements.,
Attack if you wish to do so, at any time.,
Fight until one person loses in the Mythic Age.",How to Excel at Supremacy in Age of Mythology," There really isn't any point in playing against the computer unless you want to practice. You can play online at http://www.voobly.com/;
, The following is what you may want to do.

, The citizen (hero) is about the equivalent of four Greek villagers.

, Get enough so that you have nine (if you're playing against a human online) to seventeen (if you're playing against computers with others. Do this if the level of difficulty is Titan). You'll also need six (if it's against humans) to nine (if its with humans as allies against computers) for wood and gold (nine for each resource). If you're Greek, you may want to get three to four to pray at your temple for favor.

, An example would be worshipping the Norse god Freyja if you plan on training cavalry since her improvements help that type of soldier.

, Rushing is when you do not train any soldiers and attempt to advance quickly to the mythic or titan age. Then, you can research Secret of the Titans for a titan gate to build. Then, you would start your military. Also, since this is supremacy, you can win by building a wonder which allows you to win automatically in about ten minutes as long as it is not destroyed. An alternative to building a Titan Gate would be building a wonder. However, that would attract enemies even more and they would never stop attacking your wonder until it is razed.
If you don't want to take the risk, remain in the classical age for a while. Build some (that doesn't mean one or two) military buildings and attempt to train an army. Also, build ten houses and try to build two more town centers. In addition to that, train a ton of villagers. You should have at least thirty for a slow, but steady resource flow (Atlanteans should have about ten regular citizens). Following train about thirty or more troops or until your population is filled up, you're safe - at least for a while. Research all the improvements you can and advance to the Heroic Age.

, If your enemy has attacked while you're in either the Classical or Heroic Age, you need to replace the fallen soldiers until your population is full or you again have thirty or more soldiers. Once most or all of your improvements are completely researched, and you have an army, advance to the Mythic Age.

, You'll never know when you catch your enemy off guard! Also, if you want, you can try to prevent enemies for building a town center on top of a settlement(s). If your enemy has built a wonder, a good way to destroy it is using long ranged siege weapons (such as the catapult if you're Egyptian). Do the same if your enemy is trying to complete a Titan Gate.

, Supremacy is mainly a battle between who can gather more resources and convert them into an army faster or who can get enough resources to build a wonder.

, Saddle the horses and remember to close the gate after entering and leaving to keep them from escaping.

, Put fences on the corners, then build a layer of stone or bricks on top of it. The reason for this is so the roof will not light on fire if it is struck by lightning. The roof also helps prevent your horses from being struck by lightning.

, The recommendation is 10 buildings (if you're Greek), fifteen (if you're Egyptian), 10 (if you're Norse) and 10 (if you're Atlantean). Egyptians will need more buildings since their soldiers are weak.

, Focus on destroying their town center and houses so as to decrease their population. Don't ever forget to use siege (Heliopolis work very well with over 600 hit points and 27 crush attack).


Kill your enemy's villagers! The less they have, the slower their resources come in and the faster they run out of resources. Also, they can build less. The only exception would be when your enemy is Norse.






Make surprise attacks! Try building on all the corners of the map in addition to the center. Most people never suspect an attack from behind or a base in one of the corners.







,, Wall up your town, build walls to the center of the map. Wall up settlements that you want to claim. Wall your enemy up! Just don't barge into your enemy's town attempting to wall it up. That would be a very serious mistake.

, One of the most dangerous mistakes is to forget to gather them. Although it seems that you'll never run out of resources, you eventually will (unless you play the beginners' maps that being with TW which stands for total war. Those maps are easy to play on).

, Of course, this isn't necessary, but it brings these important rooms close together, which allows the walking distance for your creatures to be minimized. By building them close to your heart, and not building out to far initially, you prevent yourself from stumbling upon large areas of lava or water, which the enemy can easily cross using bridges and attack you.

, This allows creatures like Bile Demons and Demon Spawn to fill up your ranks. Once these creatures have created their houses in the Lair, send them immediately to the training room to whip them into shape and to increase their power.

, To do this, simply drop an imp next to an unfortified wall and they will do the task.

, Creatures like Warlocks, whose speciality it is to study in the library for spells, should be allowed to research. But a good choice would be to send at least two of them to train.

Don't stay in one place during open long distance gunfights.,
When you surprise an enemy from the front and they start spraying at you, be mobile and try to get around them.,
Surprisingly, it's actually easier to outrun their spray when you're closer to them.,
When your enemy is reloading, shoot, when your enemy is moving and and bursting, you move and shoot at them.,
If you're out in the open, you're fair game for snipers and a lot of other things.,
When the opposite team starts rolling out the smokes and flashes, make sure you've got a retreat point you can maneuver to when you're blind.,
You're less likely to die if you stick together with your team.,
Don't be a coward.,
Give help to your team-mates.,
Know the maps that you play, and know the likely camping and sniping spots.

,
Be ready for anything.,
With an m4a1 without a silencer you can shoot 3 bullets at a time while moving.",How to Be Harder to Hit in Counter Strike," Move from side to side, strafe around and fire short 1-3 shot bursts at the enemy's head when you stop shortly between moves. It's never a good idea to stay in one place for a long time during fights, it will make you an easy target.;
, Crouch, dance back and forth, jump on top of them, even switch to your pistol to increase your movement speed temporarily, do whatever it takes to avoid the gunfire.

, It allows you the ability to run around them quicker. Why circle strafe 5 yards (4.6 m) when you can strafe 1?

, Know how to counter their tactics. Consider utilising your knife when they are reloading, or even when they are shooting at you - a single ""stab in the back"" can take tens of points off their health.

, Use cover during fights over long distance, move back and forth between cover and burst shooting. Just make sure to change up your pattern so they can't figure you out.

, When they start kicking in the front door after they flash you, you don't want to be out where they can pick you off. Make sure your retreat point isn't too obvious either. When you can't find any retreat points to go to, it comes down to keeping mobile. Dodge back and forth, run and crouch when you stop, even bunny hopping will be of use sometimes.

, It's easier to take on a threat when you've got people watching your back. Just make sure you're going with the right group. You can't count on a squad of n00bs to watch your back, make sure to stick with the more experienced players.

, It's okay to run away from certain situations, but if you run away from everything, it's going to come down to either you vs. the entire other team, or you vs. that grenade bouncing your way.

, Your team will last longer this way, and hence keep you alive too as a benefit. Plus, if you cheap out on your team, there will likely be quite a few team kills aimed at you in the coming rounds.

,, If you keep alert and think of the enemy's movements and tactics, you'll be less likely to be surprised by somebody jumping out at you with an AK spraying or a flash bouncing your way.

, It's incredibly accurate like that and can dodge the bullets of your opponent.

Change up your style.,
When reloading and in a gunfight struggle, just pick up another gun asap.,
Remember to closely pay attention to your spray, with AK you want a 2 shot burst, with the mp5 you just want to tap on their head 1 shot at a time at a distance, if it's close just spray at Headshot level...

,
Sometimes if you miss with the AK, a sporadic spray can still get the target, lower your aim to make up for the recoil, try lowering it at an angle towards the direction the enemy is running.

,
When playing at long distances against awpers, make very small strafing motions back and forth.,
Don't always jump around corners, it makes you an easy shot for an awper.

,
Sometimes come out of a corner halfway, not even enough to peek it, the awper will see your arm and try to shoot, then you can pop out on his recoil.

Look for less obvious cover.,
Plant the bomb in open areas so your team-mates can cover it.,
Save some flashes/nades to hold off the counter-terrorists.

Talent.",How to Be Great at Counter Strike Source," The monitor position above your head is better for your back, below your head level is better for your eyes. Try to be comfortable and not slouch. Some people play better when sitting upright and far away from the keyboard, with arms extended, some don't. Find a comfortable position for you.;
, Get used to moving around with the w, a, s, d keys, and shooting with the mouse. Find a mouse sensitivity speed that you like, and stick with it.

, Even if you have used the default config, and that's what you're used to, try to see if you can make some keystrokes more efficient for you. Using low sensitivity is more accurate as you can move with greater precision. Turn off weapon auto switch, turn on weapon fast switch. Turn off Vsync, mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration. Fix your rates, for a high bandwidth connection: rate 25000, cl_updaterate 101, and cl_cmdrate 101 is good... You can tweak your config if you have a slower computer

, This is important so that you know where you're going, anticipate where the enemy will go, and to know strategic spots. If you are new to a map, join a server with 0 players, and just explore around. Once you are familiar with a map, play in a server with other players. Notice that you can easily predict where the enemy might go now.

, On servers where you start with $800, It's recommended that you buy a Desert Eagle, the 2nd to last pistol on the menu. It is the strongest pistol there is, and a few carefully aimed shots will defeat your enemy. Once you have enough cash to purchase other items, you will have a wide variety of weapons to choose from. Try buying an AK47 if you are a terrorist, or a Colt M4A1 if you are a counter-terrorist. These guns are pretty precise if you aim, and are strong. If you have extra money left over, buy flash grenades, which will help a lot in game, and HE grenades, which can be very powerful. A lot of people ask ""Well, should I buy armour?"" It could probably keep you alive for a few shots at most, but in some cases it doesn't help. If you are in a server that starts with $16000 every round, then definitely buy the full kevlar and helmet armour, HE grenades, flash grenades, smoke grenades, desert eagle, rifle, and all that stuff since you have nothing to lose.

, This sniper rifle is so special that it gets it's own step. The AWP is indeed the most powerful weapon in the game, since shooting the enemy anywhere above the legs results in an instant death, while shooting at the legs results in 82-86 damage. The AWP will be hard to learn how to use at first, since it makes you walk a lot slower, its slower to move, and it's slower to scope. Practise using the AWP by going to AWP only servers, usually servers that being with the name awp_. Try awp_india v2, as it is the typical AWP map that everyone loves, but there will no doubt be pros that will keep killing you before you can even figure out how to use this weapon. If that is the case, join a de_dust 2 server with lots of people, and just practice moving the AWP around and scoping. Practice zooming in, shooting, and immediately moving away. Also, use the qq technique, in which you press the q button twice quickly, which basically switches the AWP to the 2nd weapon, and back to the AWP again quickly, faster than right clicking out of the zoom and zooming in again. This is essential if you want to become a good AWPer. AWP-ing is also a lot about quick reflexes, and muscle memory. These you can't really train without practice so just practice a lot.

, As mentioned earlier, you should play with the mouse sensitivity that you are used to at all times. Know how far the crosshair moves when you move the mouse a certain distance. That way, when you see an enemy, you will know how far to move your mouse to put the crosshair on the enemy. Always aim for the head at all times, especially if the enemy is far away. Depending on range, certain guns like the ak47 and desert eagle are instant headshots even with a helmet. Without a helmet most guns will be a one hit kill headshot. However, for very close range combat, spraying and praying (holding down the fire key and randomly firing in the general direction of the enemy) can do the trick, but is mostly based on luck. Crouching and standing still while shooting are the most accurate, while moving and jumping while shooting are the least accurate.

, Bounce flashes towards the ground for a short throw and quick peek around a corner, clip it right near the edge... that gives them less time to escape (like if you had bounced it off the inside wall.. they get too much warning)

, Sometimes throw a smoke, bounce it and then jump out at the same time... they'll think it's a flash and turn around....

,, After the nade hits, pull your gun out immediately and start shooting... they'll most likely still be retreating your nade and you have an open shot.

, If a player is getting a lot of kills on the opposite team, he's probably working the same angle over and over and you'll easily be able to devise a plan to kill him, perhaps using a flash or smoke grenade that you can now use effectively.

, If you're playing someone good, they will figure out what angles you like pretty fast. It's best to switch between many different styles of playing and hiding places to avoid becoming predictable. When you're saving, often buy smokes to defer the AWPers.

, You may not have time to reload before being killed so it may be more effective to just find another gun.

,,, There is a good reason why: when double scoped with a gun, strafing targets are really hard to hit. You're barely moving left or right, just moving an inch or so back and forth... people forget that when they have an AK out, and they move back and forth several inches, making them an easy target.

,,, Try to observe the map, use every piece as an obstruction for your protection, sometimes even a thin palm tree can block all the bullets you need.

, Sometimes throw a smoke in front of where you're planting, and where you predict the enemy might be, that way they can't see you.

,, If you rush a or b, know exactly how close the opposing team can be if they rushed it too, from the closest possible spawn they could have.

, Finally it comes down to pure talent. All the above points will make you an informed player but never a great player.

Know about the spitters.,
Know the hunters.,
Know the boomers.,
Know the smokers.,
Know the jockeys.,
Know about the chargers.,
Know the tanks.",How to Play with All Infected on Left 4 Dead 2," Spitters are best for spitting on a group, separating, and and heavily damaging the weakest players.


Before they get to the place you're staying, spit on the group to separate them. When they kill you, block the path to the safe house with your acid puddle!
Spit on downed survivors to further damage them, and keep healthy survivors away.;
,


Hunters are returning Infected from Left 4 Dead 1, and they are best used as stealthily as possible, until you have to pounce, hence the name Hunter.
Upon pouncing, the farther the distance you pounced, the more impact damage it does, while the height doesn't matter. Yes, it will hurt the survivors more on impact! The maximum amount of impact damage is 25, and the minimum is 1.

The best way to get 25 damage is stand on a building, pounce, and hit. The taller the building, the better! Taller buildings allow you to leap farther and get more airtime. Of course, this requires a ton of practice and skill and steady aim, but it's worth it!


If you get pushed off, but the survivors can't kill you right when you get pushed off, either for the reason of an attack of Hordes, Chargers, or any bigger distraction, it's best to leap away. They can usually deal with these distractions faster, then when you pounce, usually that's right when they get done, you get about 10 damage on one survivor. Hunters will do 5 damage per second when on a survivor. It may seem small, but Spitter acid and bile can speed up the process.

, Boomers are returning Infected from Left 4 Dead 1. They have the unique ability to blind survivors and summon Hordes. Boomers are supportive types.



Never go full on assault on a survivor, hide and puke, and wait patiently for your puke to recharge.
When you die, you blow up, launching pus and bile everywhere. It can still cover survivors, and summon hordes. This is good if your right around a corner, surprising the survivors, and they forget to melee you away, and they get slimed.

, Smokers are also returning Infected, and they have the ability to forcibly split up a team with his tongue.


A new ability he has is to pull survivors up buildings or walls. This way, survivors can't melee to save the constricted one; they have to shoot that very small tongue of his. Smokers should hide and then pull the last one to delay the team and hurt the survivor.
If the smoker gets the survivor all the way toward him, he starts punching them. If an object blocks this process, the tongue will squeeze you to death, dealing 10 damage per second. Constricted survivors must be saved quickly, or they will be in capped or even die. Smokers are great at pulling the last ones down to their death, or separate them from the group at No Return spots.

,


Jockeys are best at separating Survivors. They do better than Smokers. Smokers are meant to kill the survivors quicker than the Jockey. Jockeys will ride their victims, until they are incapped. They also perform well at No Return spots. Jockeys should hide and grab weak or far-away survivors, and separate them. While the Jockey is riding, it may look like he is humping the survivor, and he has been nicknamed Hamper by the survivors and players.

, Chargers are great for ambushing. With a little steady aim, they can pull the survivors away, and throw the survivors out the windows on the Hotel chapter of Dead Center.


Chargers are a little better at going kamikaze, and staying out in the open, but don't do it too much or you'll get killed.
Waiting behind corners and separating the survivors is a good strategy. Spitter acid and Boomer bile speeds up his damage. He pounds the survivors into the ground every 2 seconds, and does 15 damage per slam. They cannot be melees out of the grip; only shot or burned.

, Last but not least, this big brute is the only Infected that can stay out in the open easily.


He has 6000 health on Normal. He is a nightmare on expert.
The AI Director randomly chooses an Infected player to become the Tank.
The best strategy is to light him on fire with a Molotov or Bile Bomb him, and then shred him with assault rifles or shotguns. A tank can never keep up with a survivor with green health.
Survivors should keep their team healthy when this brute comes into play. He can throw rocks at you if he is out of punch range. Each punch does 25 damage. This means that, with just 4 hits, you're incapped! Infected can help the Tank by grabbing safe house runners or deserters attempting to run away from him.

Begin a single player campaign on easy.,
Move around your team wisely.,
Select a precise weapon.,
Use Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs sparingly, and only when necessary.,
Stay calm and do not panic.,
Melee pinned survivors free from the grips of smokers or hunters instead of shooting them off.,
Finish the entire campaign with zero friendly fire incidents from anyone in the survivors.,
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics if you're successful and you will see that the Safety First achievement has been unlocked for 30 gamerscore.",How to Unlock the Safety First Achievement in Left 4 Dead," Playing single player campaign with three AI survivors is preferable to playing an online campaign with other people, as the computer-controlled survivors rarely have friendly fire incidents. The best campaign to select for getting this achievement is Blood Harvest - the wide open forests means that there are less points where the survivors are confined together like in the No Mercy campaign.;
, When in front of your team, crouch so they can shoot over you (the computer controlled survivors are good shots and will not hit you if you are crouched). Crouching also improves your aim, making it easier to aim past team members. Generally, if a survivor is near you, be aware of yourself and not put yourself, or them, in the line of fire.

, The main cause of friendly fire is the weapon you are holding. When attempting to unlock this achievement, avoid picking up the shotgun (which has a wide spread of fire) as they are more likely to hit a passing survivor. Instead, pistols and the sniper rifle are ideal for unlocking this achievement due to their precise aim and slow firing nature. The assault rifle and uzi are good as well, but only if you're going slow. You should be going slow if you're trying not to shoot up your teammates.

, These explosives have a wide range of damage and will usually injure nearby team members if they are not thrown far enough away. These explosives can also set off other exploding canisters nearby, causing further damage, so be aware.

, If the horde attacks, resist the urge to unleash a flail of bullets in all directions. This will probably lead to you hitting one of your own team members. Instead, calmly melee the horde away from you, shoot what you can safely and let your team mates finish the rest off. If you have time, back off from the situation and pick the rest of the horde off. Whatever the case, a cool head will prevail.

, Attempting to shoot the special infected which has pinned the survivor may lead to you accidentally shooting your own teammate, so get close to them and free them manually before they take too much damage.

, If you are not sure if you have unlocked it (if the message saying you've unlocked it doesn't pop up for example), then wait for the final credits to show how many friendly fire incidents there was during the entire campaign and who did them. If it shows any, then you'll have to try again.

, It is represented by a sniper rifle pointed away.

"
Find a group of teammates who have rounded skills, but can excel in certain situations.,
Don't all use the same weapons, this will handicap the team in certain scenarios, and could cost you one of your teammates.,
Stick together, the game engine sends more zombies after players who run from the group, and you won't want to be constricted when you are far away from your friends/saviors.

,
Cover all doorways and entrances, the last thing you want is zombie attacking you from behind, because someone didn't cover their entry point.

,
When clearing a building, or anywhere, be sure to look around all of the doorways, and check inside the rooms, you never know if something will be stood behind the door, and attack you when you are not aware.

,
If you are moving altogether, make sure that anyone at the front is crouching, you don't want to take friendly fire whilst you are being swarmed.

,
If you are the first person leading then crouch as this allows your team mates to shoot over your head at enemies.

,
When facing more dangerous enemies, be sure to use the following tactics:


Tanks

These are giant mutated zombies, they will stop at nothing to reach you, and they will also throw objects at you.,
These are the available weapons found in safe houses and in between them.",How to Work Well As a Team on Left 4 Dead,";
, be sure to know what sort of area is up next, and the enemies you will be facing.

,,,,,, On harder difficulties, they can have as much as 8,000 health. Be sure to run while shooting, but be careful of teammates. On harder difficulties, it is usually good to light up a tank with a Molotov in the long run.


Witches

You will know when you are near these by listening for a crying woman, Switch off your flashlight, and don't engage her and just keep going, if you do aggravate the witch, she will usually attack the one who aggravated her, and knock them down, keep firing at her until she hits the deck.


Boomers

These enemies will vomit on you and attract the horde to you and any others who were vomited on. You will also be covered in vomit if you blow up a boomer that is too close to you. Make sure these guys are a bit away (shove them away if necessary) before you kill them.


Smokers

These enemies will constrict you, stopping you from attacking, and you will be slowly dragged towards them, the best way to combat these is to have a teammate kill them while they are constricting you, causing them to release you. You can also shove a teammate to get them untangled without hurting the teammate themselves.


Hunters

Hunters will jump large distances, and pin you to the ground, kill these as quickly as you can, as you really won't want to be pinned down during a swarm.



, There are two tiers of weapons, nearly always found with those in their tier. The first tier is the weapons you find throughout the first few safe houses, and the second tier weapons is usually found in between the safe houses as well as in the last 1 - 2 safe houses.


The first tier weapons are :

Pump-action Shotgun. This is your standard powerful, short range, wide burst weapon. Best used in room clearing, and close quarter combat. This shotgun holds 8 cartridges with 128 cartridges in reserve. This will kill the infected in one shot at close range, or injure many infected at moderate range. It becomes almost useless at long range. A trick involving all shotguns in Left 4 Dead is that while reloading the cartridges you can melee attack, which will not affect the reloading of the shotguns.
Submachine gun. The SMG is a fast firing but less-than-moderately powerful weapon. It is useful for things like crowd control and taking out the infected at a distance, which the shotgun cannot handle. 6-8 bullets will take care of an infected. The SMG holds 50 rounds in a clip with 480 rounds in reserve. The bullets spray very fast and will hold off the infected but as it lacks penetration and power, it cannot take on a full mob of infected.


The second tier weapons are:

Assault Rifle. The M4 is a more-than-moderately powerful automatic assault rifle like the M4A1 in Counter-Strike, best used to take out swarms, and special infected at a distance. This assault rifle contains 50 rounds in a clip with 360 rounds in reserve. This weapon is rather like the submachine gun although it will spray slower but makes up for it in power. 3-5 bullets will usually drop an infected. This weapon has also more penetration than the Submachine gun so it is also more versatile than the submachine gun. Replace the Submachine gun with this if you found one.
Hunting Rifle. This gun is incredibly powerful. One shot at an infected will drop it. It is useful to picking off enemies from a range as it is equipped with a scope. This weapon has 15 bullets in a round with 180 rounds in reserve. This is not you average sniper rifle but more like an extra powerful assault rifle with a scope. This also has unlimited penetration for the infected, so use this wisely.
Automatic Shotgun. This shotgun is as powerful as the pump-action shotgun and fires just as fast as the hunting rifle. This gun can kill mobs of zombies by yourself. However like all other shotguns, the drawback is that you cannot kill ranged enemies. This shotgun holds 10 cartridges with 128 cartridges in reserve.


Secondary weapon

Pistol. Pistols can be used akimbo (one gun, two hands on it) or dual wielded. One pistol will hold 15 bullets per magazine. Dual wielding allows a high magazine capacity (15 x 2 = 30)which means less frequent reload but it will also take longer to reload your guns. The higher magazine capacity of the dual wielded pistol will also be very useful if you are on the ground as it allows you to kill much more infected with the extra bullets. The pistol has unlimited ammo which is useful in picking off small amounts of the infected, saving your primary ammo for a more intense situation. Be sure to pick up a second pistol if you can.


Grenades, or a more adept name, throwables. You can only have one grenade with you at a time. These can be found at the final safe room or when exploring. If you explore more then use often, but if you explore less then use these sparingly.

Molotov's look like beer bottles with a rag hanging outside. When it hits the ground it will start a fire which spreads in a small area. This is very useful for cutting off areas, although some zombie will still run through the fire, Do not use this assuming you will be safe from enemies coming through a doorway.
Pipe bombs are what they sound like, a section of pipe with some small lights on the top. When thrown they will beep and emit a small red light which attracts the ordinary horde. They will attract the horde from everything, including boomer’s bile but will not attract specialist infected or infected when it is already attacking you. This is especially useful when an incoming mob is out to get you. It is also very useful for the finale when you have to get to the escape vehicle.
