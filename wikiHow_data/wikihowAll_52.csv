Pistols have infinite ammo and have 15 bullets per magazine; when you dual wield pistols, you have 30 bullets per magazine. You will use pistols if you are knocked down by the zombie hordes.


Always pick up the second to dual-wield when you find it. More bullets to fire. Crouching increases accuracy, to the point where the pistol becomes effective at considerable range.
Using the pistol where possible allows you to save your precious primary ammunition for when you really need it.;
, There are 2 types of shotguns. The first is a basic pump action 12-gauge. It holds 8 shells total, and has to be pumped after every shot. The second shotgun is a 20-gauge Riot Shotgun with 10 shell loading capacity. It automatically loads another shell into the chamber after firing, and is very quickly ready to fire again. Excellent for close range combat, especially in swarm situations.

, The Uzi has a 50 clip load with a fast rate of fire, it is good for swarm situations but you can easily be knocked down when out of ammo. The M16 is faster and stronger and should always be found if you prefer automatics. Dully noted though, both these weapons consume ammo very quickly, so make your shots count.

, These are similar to the Heavy's minigun in TF2, the minigun can take down swarms of zombies in rapid succession when used. Keep your firing rate broken up though; continuous fire will overheat the turret, and then you are open for attack and are likely to be killed quickly by the Horde.

, This weapon, with 15 slot clip, can kill normal zombies in one hit to the head. The rifle has a zoom-in feature and preforms superbly in long range combat. With this weapon you also have the ability to shoot through more than one zombie in a successive line.


For example, if there are three zombies standing in a row, one shot with the rifle will kill them all.
Also, you are able to shoot and kill zombies through doors, some walls and other items that are blocking the zombies from direct fire from another weapon.
Its downfall is close range combat- this weapon does not perform as well in close range combat as some others do and during close combat with infected the scope feature of the rifle is rendered useless.

, The first is the Molotov cocktail. This grenade can leave a wall of fire that will kill zombies surprisingly fast, but not immediately (flaming infected may still run at you until death), excellent in swarm situations. Aim well though; if you throw it too close to home, you and teammates around you will be incapacitated or damaged heavily.

, Apart from the mini-gun, the pipe bomb is probably the best device in the game. Once thrown, almost every infected in ear shot will swarm the pipe bomb. In any given scenario, pipe bombs can be used to clear an area completely of infected before entering it.


But be aware; when engaging a witch, do not throw it directly at her. This will result in simply pissing the witch off and then she will charge toward you and away from the bomb about to detonate, thus having no effect at all, except for a wasted pipe bomb and a witch beating you.

, All items and weapons can be used to bash the infected. Bashing knocks infected back, giving you time to aim or reload, or buying you time if swamped by the Horde.


It can be used to knock a hunter off a pinned ally chest, and bashing an ally who is caught by a smoker's tongue will free them.
It can also be used to get the attention of a Tank attacking a friend.
Melee attack should also be used to push a Boomer back when it is attacking so that the survivors are not slimed when the Boomer is killed.

, The Infected are normally found walking and are quite weak most of the time, but in huge numbers the Infected are the most deadly foe in the entire game. They are provoked by physical combat, gunfire, use of flashlight, and appearing in their line of sight. When informed of your presence, they will be fast and agile but still can be taken down easily.


The Infected can swarm in massive numbers, even 100 at a time, which encourages you and your buddies (be they AI or human) to stick together. In these situations, the Infected can be difficult to cope with as they usually will come from 2 or 3 different directions. There are a number of different ways to stop the infected, but the best are pipe bombs, Molotovs and fortifying a position and holding the Infected back.
A large horde will sometimes be preceded by dramatic music and the distant sound of screaming.

, These are a special type of Infected. Boomers can vomit on the survivors, attracting swarms of Infected. When Boomers are killed, they explode, forming a cloud of pus and bile, thus also attracting swarms of the Infected.


The best way to deal with them is to shove them away then when they are at a safe distance and kill them.
They are surprisingly fast at random moments, and will quickly barge into rooms, vomit on a survivor, and walk out. Keep this from happening by listening out for their belching and gurgling noises, and the occasional heavy footsteps.

, These are a special type of Infected. A tall Infected that can wrap its tongue around the Survivors and drag them away from their team, the Smokers are typically quite easy to kill but once they have your teammate in their tongue, you need to save them. Fast.


The best way is to kill the Smoker is to melee the player wrapped up, which stops the Smoker dragging the Survivor. Then, take a few pot shots at the Smoker until it explodes into a smoke cloud.
The smoke cloud it leaves is a minor obstacle; it distorts your vision slightly and causes your team to cough loudly.
You can tell if a Smoker is nearby by their hacking cough and raw-throated scream.

, These are a special type of Infected. Hunters are a dangerous type of Infected. They will leap at you at quick speeds and pin you to the ground. When they do pounce on a survivor, the Survivor that is pinned will incur heavy damage which will lead to incapacitation and then death unless a teammate helps them of course.


It's a good idea to melee them off your teammate as quickly as possible, especially if you don't have a good gun in your hands. But make SURE you kill them while they're staggering or they will simply pounce on you again.
Hunters can also be stopped by a survivor meleeing them away when they are pouncing. This prevents the Hunter from pinning you and stuns it.
It can then be killed easily while it is stunned.
You can tell when one is around by the vicious screaming and growling.

, These are a special type of Infected. Witches are commonly found in areas where Survivors will NEED to go, making them a real pain and hard to avoid. The Witch is incredibly dangerous, she can whack down survivors in one hit and on expert difficulty can kill in one hit.


The Witch is found crying on the floor when found, and if you are clever, you can avoid the Witch and prevent your team fighting her, but there are some situations where you must kill the Witch to proceed (e.g. on a staircase). The witch will always attack the person that provokes her.
The best way to deal with her is NOT to deal with her, just let her be and turn your flash lights off. If you HAVE to kill her and are equipped with a shotgun, aim for the head. One well placed shot to the head can kill a witch instantly if all of the pellets hit, thereby avoiding any damage she may deal you or your team. If you do not kill her instantly or are equipped with one of the other weapons and she chases you, keep out of her range and aim for her head. If she reaches her target, she will kill him (Expert) or incapacitate him (any other difficulty).

, These are a special type of Infected. The Tank is an absolutely massive Infected and is the strongest foe in the game. He is about twice the size of the Survivors, and on Expert difficulty, he is particularly hard to kill. He can pick up blocks of concrete and cars and throw them at you, as well as knocking you away with his giant arms. There is no way to avoid fighting the Tank at all; he will see you and immediately attack your team.


The Tank is quite easy to take down if most or all of your team carry assault rifles. Rapid fire at the Tank using these weapons can take down a Tank in a matter of seconds. Dual pistols are also good weapons to use against a Tank. Another great tactic against a Tank is to throw a Molotov to set him on fire which will drain his health more, but keep in mind that in Campaign or Survival modes, this will greatly increase the Tank's running speed. In Versus you should always try to light the player Tank on fire, as it will actually DECREASE his speed a little.
You can tell if one is coming by their thundering footsteps, the ominous music that precedes them or their distinctive roar.

, First, learn to use the first-aid MedPack, which heals you to at least 80% health, but can give you a little more if you heal with already high health. They can also be used to heal teammates. Lastly are the painkillers, which temporarily give you health which will slowly deplete, but will help for a time. Best used in 40-65% HP.


MedPacks are found at the start and the end of each map and are also found (rarely) in areas of the map. Use these puppies when the end is near (25% health or below).
Know when to heal. Only use your Health Pack when you desperately need to, use pills if it's not serious or you need to boost your health in order to run faster.

, Always be moving, if you stay in the same area for too long the Infected will come and kill you, especially on expert.


Don't hoard health packs or pills if you're doing well. Share them with others, as even a weak player is a fourth gun, and you need all the guns you can get.

, The key to L4D is to work as a team. Move together, shoot together and share together. If you decide you want to go ""I Am Legend"" with the zombies a Smoker or Hunter will find you and pick you off easily.

, If infected begin charging at you, and you are reloading, melee them back, back up, and reload. Then open fire.

, Crouch when you are approaching swarms (this is assuming you have no molotovs or pipes) and continue to spray the zombies. Crouching makes it easier for people behind you to shoot and steadies for less recoil when you shoot.

, If you are new to Valve games, choose easy difficulty. If you are new to Left 4 Dead, choose normal. After one game on normal, play on advanced for a while. Then when you feel confident, go expert. Don't rush yourself: you're taking your time to master the game!

, Remember, zombie swarms and special infected can come at any time, so always be alert.

Remember that Left 4 Dead is all about survival, no matter what mode you're playing.,
Choose one of the Campaigns from the main menu.,
Test out the controls on the opening screen.,
Pick up the Medkit and nearby weapons in the opening location.,
Stay together at all times.,
Move through the levels as quickly as possible.,
Prepare yourself in advance for hair-raising Crescendo Events.,
Understand the layout of a typical L4D2 level.,
Know that the items, enemies, and timing will change every game.",How to Play Left 4 Dead 21," The L4D games are about staying alive -- not killing a big boss, saving the world, or racking up a high score. No matter what the mode, you objective is to stay alive for as long as possible. With that in mind, there is some general advice that will help you through any situation:


Always keep moving. A standing target is an easy one to hit.
Work together with all 3 teammates -- never go off alone.
Conserve ammo and supplies, only using when necessary.;
, From the start screen, choose ""Campaign"" and start with ""Dead Center."" If you've never played shooting games before, set the difficulty to easy and hit start. Campaigns are single-player games that give you three computer-controlled teammates (AI) to help you fight through the zombies.


It does not matter which character you choose. In the game they all work identically.
If you're with a friend you can choose ""Split-Screen"" as well. This is a normal campaign, but two of you can play together on the same mission with 2 AI teammates.

, The first location you arrive at, in every level, is always free of zombies. This gives you the chance to learn the controls if you're not used to them yet. While they are different on every console, you can easily check the controls in the start menu. To do so, hit ""Start"" and navigate to ""Controls."" This screen will show you what each button or computer key does. The very basic controls that you must know include:


Move and shoot.
Switch weapon.
Reload weapon.
How to shove.
How to use items (on yourself and others)., At the beginning of every level there are several Medkits, which are thick, rectangular red packs, and several weapons. Head over and pick them up. On the first level, they sit on a table right next to the door.



Pistol: Your automatic first weapon. Pistols are weak but accurate and, most importantly, have unlimited ammunition. If you find another one on the ground, you can pick it up to dual wield them, effectively giving you double power, shots, and firing rate.

Medkits: Medkits heal your character completely. You can also use them to heal teammates. You can only hold one at any time. You should always try and have 2-3 Medkits, at a minimum, in your party.

Melee Weapons: Katanas, baseball bats, chainsaws, crowbars, and other melee weapons attack in a wide swath in front of you, often killing Infected instantly. They are good options in the early difficulties, and, with the exception of chainsaws, can be used infinitely. They replace your pistol.

, This is the number one piece of advice you need to follow, in any game mode, to survive L4D2. The game is cooperative, and while it may be fun to run off and act like a hero, more often than not this will get you killed. One mistake can leave you stranded and turn your team of four into a team of three. The best way to survive is as a unit. So stick together, watching each other's backs at all times.


The importance of teamwork cannot be overstated. The game will punish players who head off on their own, and so will your teammates., Zombies will spawn even if you are standing still. They are not set in place and waiting there, in the same place, like most other games. Therefore, the longer you sit around, the harder the game is going to get. You need to be constantly moving forward, sticking together and clearing rooms before moving on. If you see side rooms, set two people at the door, then quickly send the other two in to look for supplies or guns.


Whenever you need to open a door, push a button, or otherwise trigger an event (usually noted on the screen), tell your teammates and give them a chance to heal, use an item, or reload. Then move forward as a team., At the end of some acts is the ""Crescendo Event,"" an enormous, incredibly difficult finale that requires you to complete some task or survive for a certain period of time. In the first level, Dead Center, this occurs when you need to fill the car up with gas. There will be a long, eerie silence. But once you start filling up the windows will shatter and an enormous Horde will descend upon you. Before starting a crescendo event, heal up, find all your supplies, and make a game plan with your teammates.


All crescendo events will be noted to you by a ""!"" icon on the screen.
Some of these events, like the car in Dead Center, only end once you've completed your objective (ie. fill up the car). You can't just sit there and wait it out because it will not end. Pay attention to the dialogue and objectives to end the rush as soon as possible., When playing L4D2, you can choose a variety of different modes. All of them, however, are built on the same foundation: You have a setting, such as a mall, rainy town, or carnival, and there are 5 Chapters in each setting to survive. Each chapter is it's own level, which is often begins with ease before getting progressively more difficult. At the end of most chapters is a big event you must survive, and at the end of each setting is usually the most difficult challenge seen so far. As you play through each game mode, note where the major events and challenges fall, helping you stay better prepared next time you play.


The basic objective of the game is always ""move forward."" Levels are more or less linear, and your challenge is to make it to the end.
When in doubt, save your items. The levels will only get harder.
At the end of each chapter is a safe house with supplies, medkits, and ammunition. No zombies can enter it until you open the door, so this is a perfect place to catch your breath.

, Left 4 Dead 2 has a hidden AI Director that adjusts the game based on how you're doing. This means that you can't assume you'll get the same items or challenges each time you play. You need to be constantly adapting. If you decided to use a Medkit early on, assuming you'll get another one a few rooms down based on your last play-through, you'll be sorely disappointed when it doesn't appear. Even the number and intensity of enemies will change from game to game. You need to focus on the present moment if you want to succeed.The Director can even change the route you must take to succeed. You must play to your current situation, instead of trying to figure out one perfect strategy for each level.

Listen for growling to avoid dangerous Hunters.,

Handle the bosses with fire and teamwork.",How to Play Left 4 Dead 22," Your basic zombie, Infected, are fast-moving, easily killed generic zombies. Their power, however, comes from the fact that they attack in swarms. There are two types -- ""Mobs,"" which spawn behind you and hunt you down, and ""Wanderers,"" who stand around until you run into them. When in a group, they are called ""the horde.""

, Big, fat behemoths, Boomers call attention to the horde. If they puke on you, you lose vision and all the Infected immediately attack you. To defeat them, shoot from a distance, or shove them away and then shoot if they get too close. When they die, they explode, puking on everything around them, so only kill from afar.


They burp and gurgle, revealing them from a distance if you're listening.

, Lanky female zombies, Spitters shoot acid on the ground that hurts everything it touches. They also create a puddle of acid when they die. Dodge their acid and shoot from a distance.


They make wet, spitting sounds.

, They run in a straight line, pinning anyone in their path and knocking over objects in their way. If they get you against a wall, they deal massive damage. Put as many bullets in them as you can, and if they charge, move to the sides to dodge them.


They make loud grunting sounds like The Hulk might sound.

, Long range killers, they grab people with their tongue, drag them in, and beat them to death. If you get caught, a teammate can shoot the tongue, freeing you, or the smoker, killing them. You need to have teammates around to fight them. You can also use shove to free a teammate. When you get caught, you have 2 seconds to find the smoker and shoot them before you lose control of your character.


They cough and wheeze, but usually strike from a distance to hide. They are usually up high.

, Massive damage dealers, they pounce on you and start slashing. Your other teammates must shoot them off you before you can get up. They are fast, dark, and hard to hit. If you hear one, bunch up back to back and get ready to shoot.


Hunters make a menacing growl right before they get ready to attack.

, Little and fast, they jump on a character and control them, making you walk over ledges or behind walls, dealing damage the whole time. They are generally easy to kill, but if they get on your teammate, you need to be sure you shoot them, not the teammate.


Their signature cackling laugh makes them easy to hear in advance.

, There are two boss characters in L4D2 -- Witches and Tanks. They come at specific locations, and they can kill an entire team if you're not careful. When handling them, concentrated fire is always the answer. You need to focus on them before anything else, as they deal far more damage than any other Infected.



Witches: If you're lucky, you can avoid most of them. They sit, crying until you wake them with gunfire or a flashlight. If you see one, turn off the light and try and creep around them. If you can't, use your first few shots to kill them as they wake up, aiming for the head as a team. Rifles to the head are your best bet.

Tanks: You'll need fire to kill a tank. If you have a Molotov, hit them immediately - tanks on fire die in 30 seconds without any bullets. As you do, move around a lot to dodge them, surrounding the tank as a team and shooting continually."
"
Use items effectively in tense situations.,
Understand the advanced weapons.",How to Play Left 4 Dead 23," Aside from weapons, there are other items available for pick-up, most of which should be reserved for tense or serious situations.



Pain Pills: Gives you a temporary boost of health, though it will disappear after some time. This is incredibly helpful, however, for final events, where the extra boost saves a Medkit and gets you through the challenging events, allowing you to heal later fully.

Adrenaline Shots: Provides a small health boost, and boosts your running speed. Most importantly, it keeps you from ""flinching,"" which is when you are temporarily unable to shoot after being hit. Use them right before huge moments, or if you need to get to a teammate to save them quickly.

Bile Bombs: A grenade that causes all regular zombies to flock to the spot where it fell, ignoring you. If you throw it on another Zombie, the other Infected will attack them instead of you.

Pipe Bombs: Like bile bombs, these cause Inflected to leave you and flock to the spot where you threw it. After a few seconds, as the infected crowd the spot, the bomb explodes, killing them all.

Molotov Cocktails: Explode on impact, and leave a temporary lake of fire that hurts all Infected and humans that walk through it. Great at creating walls against the hordes of dead, and essential against the monstrous ""Tanks.""

, There is a variety of items and weapons available in Left 4 Dead, each with their own pros and cons. When you start out, you will only have access to a small variety of them, but more powerful weapons and items will appear as you progress.



Shotguns: Coming in chrome, pump, and automatic options, shotguns are great options in close quarters. They deal a lot of damage and have a wide spread of fire, but they are inaccurate at long distances. Use them in hallways and other tight locations.

Rifles: Powerful and accurate at long ranges, they are almost useless in tense, swarming situations because they take a while to aim and shoot. But they are great in a group and can clean up long-range, incoming enemies while the rest of the team waits patiently for them to reach shotgun range.

Automatic Weapons: Submachine guns, M16s, and their ilk are your bread and butter. They have good power and a high rate of fire, allowing you to mow down medium and close range enemies. When in doubt, choose automatic weapons.

Keep your distance whenever possible.,
Predict the ""flow"" of the hordes by learning how they spawn.,
Use choke-points and high ground to your advantage.,
Conserve ammunition whenever possible.,
Don't use medkits until necessary, usually after incapacitation.,
Crouch whenever possible.,
Know the strengths of each Infected on Versus mode.",How to Play Left 4 Dead 24," Especially on the harder difficulties, melee weapons will only get you killed. Instead, stay back and pick off enemies from afar. Use your shoves to keep some distance, and, whenever you're in the open, use a pistol or rifle to thin the herd before they get too close.

, Left 4 Dead is a constantly shifting game, and Infected will appear in unexpected places. Zombies spawn at various points, and they are on a timer. Special Infected like Hunters and Smokers can appear anywhere but usually, come with a horde of Infected to cause maximum damage. There are, however, ways to predict when enemies are coming:


Pay attention to the music -- it will start to swell and get tense as enemies build up out of sight.
Turn on subtitles. You can often read things like, ""coughing sounds"" or ""noises of the horde"" in advance, making it easier to predict incoming groups or specials.
Know the three stages of an attack. Build-up, as the music swells. Peak, when the big group descends on you, and Rest, after you've defeated them and have 1-2 minutes to relax., When in crescendo events, or if you just need to catch your breath, choose spots with limited entryways (like rooms with only 1-2 doors or windows) or high areas where you force the enemy to bottleneck. Bullets pierce enemies and hit the Infected behind them, meaning you can mow down large groups quickly and conserve ammunition. Shooting down stairs, ladders, and in doorways can make big crowds much, much easier to handle.


Still, keep moving when possible. Holing up for too long drains supplies and can leave you open to attacks by Boomers and Spitters.

, Ammo is your lifeblood, so don't go draining it. When enemies are at a distance or are easy to deal with, switch to a pistol or melee weapon. Running out of shotgun shells during an intense moment can cost you your life.

, Medkits are valuable and should be used as such. After your first knockdown, your vision becomes monochromatic (loses color), and you move slower. This is the time to use a Medkit. Otherwise, stick to pain pills and adrenaline whenever possible.


If you're approaching a crescendo event and have less than 40 health, now is the time to use your Medkit., Crouching increases aim and is essential if firing at incoming enemies. Whenever you can, crouch and fire, then get up and move as you go. In muddy areas, like ""The Parish,"" you actually move just as fast crouching as standing, so the benefit in accuracy has no trade-off. In the mud and swamps, crouch the entire time., In Versus mode, four players get the chance to play as Smokers, Boomers, Hunters, and more while fighting against four other human players. Playing as Infected is practically its own game, but the best advice is to think about all the ways you've died as a human. What sorts of attacks stranded you from teammates, caught you off-guard, or otherwise dealt more damage than you could handle?


For the best results, use your teammates to coordinate attacks together. A Boomer can vomit, bringing in zombies that allow a good Spitter to trap pressured players in a corner, for example.
Use surprise to your advantage. Let them run to you and hit them when they're distracted.

, ALWAYS have 1-2 team members carrying an Auto/Combat Shotgun or at least a pump shotgun. To cr0wn, you point a shotgun at her body at point blank range and shoot. Contrary to FPS belief, aiming at the body is easier since she has 1000 HP and a point blank shotgun does a bit more than that. It is very important to make sure all the pellets hit.

, On expert, she will kill a survivor with ONE HIT, regardless of their health.

Scout out your opponent's location with a probe (usually the one that builds your first Pylon at 7 psi).,
Build a double gate proxy close to their choke, but far away enough so that they cannot be seen or hit by Siege Tanks (Terrans will lift their Barracks to spot for their Tanks).,
Pump Zealots from your two Gateways, and make sure to build more Probes and Pylons back at base.,
Rush the Terran with around 6-8 Zealots if he did wall in.,
Pick off the SCV building a Factory, if it is not finished yet for some reason.,
Kill as many SCVs as possible and keep the SCVs away from the minerals as long as possible.,
Tech up and build up if your proxy fails and the Terran has Tanks and Vultures out (Goliaths soon).",How to Rush With Protoss in StarCraft1," Against Protoss, a Terran will usually wall off, so if you decide to scout later, your probe may not be able to get in their base.;
, The proxy should be a Pylon with two Gateways; do not build Cannons or a Forge, they will only slow down your rush and will be useless against Tanks. Also make sure the Terran's scout will not be able to find your proxy easily (away from the usual scouting path).

, If the Terran did not wall in for some reason, rush with 3-4 Zealots. If you micro your Zealots properly, you should be able to overwhelm an early Terran. When Terrans are rushed this way, they will pull about 8+ SCVs off minerals in a panic to be a meat shields for their Marines. Make sure you micro your Zealots past the SCVs and go straight for the Marines. Keep pumping Zealots and mop up the Terran before he can get Vultures or Tanks.

, Focus attack the Supply Depot and ignore Marine fire. The Terran should pull around 5 SCVs to try to fix the Depot, but your Zealots should do too much damage to stop it from falling. Once the Depot falls, try to push through the SCVs and Marines. If you can, micro around the SCVs and eliminate the Marines.

, If you can force the Terran to cancel his Factory, even better! You do not want Vultures dancing your Zealots. If the Terran did manage to finish the Factory, go straight for his SCVs in the minerals. A good Terran will bunch up his SCVs on one mineral patch and attack at once. Just pull your Zealots back until the SCVs have spread apart again. Then try to pick off a few. If you know that your opponent scouted your proxy and is rushing your main with Vultures, wall off your main's choke with Pylons and a Forge if you can so that the Vultures won't get in.

, Do anything to set your opponent's economy back. Keep pumping Zealots and tech to Dragoons. Once Dragoons are out, you should be able to finish off the Terran, if your Zealots have not done so already. The whole point of the rush is to catch a Terran with only Marines and SCVs before he can get Vultures.

, You're at a heavy disadvantage now. Upgrade Zealot speed and Dragoon range as soon as possible. Expand or try to tech to Carriers. Either way, losing your double gate proxy will limit your macro capacity, putting you at a disadvantage, even if the Terran lost a few SCVs.

, It's best if it isn't seen, but being spotting won't do too much harm.

,,, Your opponent will most likely bunch a few probes on one mineral patch and try to ""jump"" a probe or two between your Pylons. His probes will then attempt to kill your probe. If he does, your rush will fail. Your opponent will also likely attack your Pylons with all his probes. Grab your Probe and prepare to build a Pylon in the exact same place as one that is about to fall. Do not let the enemy Probes get in and kill your Probe.

Build drones constantly.,
Scout early and often.,
Build up your macro.,
Always watch your army composition.,
Upgrade your troops.,
Know your map.",How to Play Well As Zerg in StarCraft 2," Drones are the key units of the zerg arsenal, as they gather vespene gas and minerals, as well as evolve into the zerg buildings, such as spawning pools, hatcheries, roach warrens, etc.;
, Scouting allows you to find your opponent as well as gain knowledge of their building plans for further on into the game. Sending a drone or even a team of 2 zerglings should be good for scouting. Overlords are options, but are very slow, and if they are caught on the battlefield by a couple of marines or stalkers, will not escape, which will also damage your supply room.

, Macro is focusing on your economy and the ""late"" game by aggressively expanding and making drones. To build up your macro, work on building expansions as early as you can. As Zerg, depending on the scouting information you receive you will want to adjust your strategy accordingly. For a forge fast expand, you are safe to go 3 hatch fast expansions by the 5 minute mark, but for a 4 gate, 3 rax or early pool push you will want only your main and natural expansion fully saturated (sometimes less depending on timing). After repelling an early push, you will want to expand, and as a rule of thumb you always want to keep one base ahead of your opponent, except Vs Zerg. Set these hatcheries on hotkeys 1, 2, and 3 to jump back and forth between them, or as some of the pro players do, hotkey a queen with each hatchery in each slot, ie: 1, 2, 3 and jump back and forth between them, always trying to not miss an inject. Use the ""S"" key to select larvae and the keys for building units like zerglings, roaches, etc. Learn to constantly jump back and forth between bases, because this will help you manage your expansions. Another helpful hotkey is a Location hotkey (Ctrl+F1, F2, etc) where you can jump back to a specific location on the map.

, This is, perhaps, what sets a pro gamer aside from an amateur one. Zerg's nature is to be responsive to what is happening in the game. Many games are lost by not adapting to what the opponent is doing. Roaches and hydras are back to being the bread and butter of Zerg in HOTS but for example, if your opponent is going heavy Colossus, you must switch to Corruptors, or Vipers. A lot of Zerg players get comfortable going hydra/roach and often forget to tech to tier 3 (Brood lords and Ultras). This too can be a costly mistake.

, Upgrades will make your units faster and stronger and will give them better armor. Upgrades are researched at Evolution chambers. Often times you will only have the chance to upgrade one type of unit (melee or range) so you must decide early on on your strategy.Whether you will eventually get Ultralisk, then melee will be desirable even if you are using ranged units at the time.

, Blizzard keeps a map rotation every couple of seasons. Knowing the lay of the land will give you a great advantage or disadvantage during the game. Upgrades are specially important on maps where resources are hard to get or are limited."

Learn to handle Dragoons.,
Use High Templars well.,
Take advantage of the naturally cloaking Protoss units.",How to Play StarCraft Well Using Protoss," Though they can be bulky and clumsy in tight spaces, Dragoons can take care of most enemy units with relative ease.


To increase their effectiveness, upgrade their attack range at the Cybernetics Core, and send a few zealots to soak up the damage.
To deal with mass Zerglings without zealots, a weakness of Dragoons due to their explosive damage type, have two groups of Dragoons. When the Zerglings attack one group, have that group run around your other group, which attacks the Zerglings. If the Zerglings switch targets, do the same thing with the other group. However, a more experienced player will have more units and will attack both groups at once.
Dragoons can also ""dance"" with Vultures well. If you've upgraded your Dragoons' range, the enemy Vultures will take heavy damage. However, beware of Spider Mines, so bring a couple of Observers with you.;
, The High Templar may be the most powerful unit in the Protoss race, if they are used right. Research Psionic Storm and upgrade their energy capacity. Hallucination is also quite useful in assaulting islands.


Use Psionic Storm to cripple an attack force. Due to its large area of effect and large amount of damage, Psionic storm will kill basic units in one or two seconds. Also, High Templars with upgraded energy capacities can cast three Psionic Storms without having to rest.
Something else to note about Psionic Storm is that it negates all effect of armor.
When you have to assault an island base, you can use Hallucinate on your Shuttles or Arbiters to protect them. Each High Templar can use Hallucinate two times, so that gives you four copies per Templar. Eight hallucinated units will soak up all of the anti-air, ensuring your units' safety.

, Two Protoss units, the Observer and Dark Templar, are constantly cloaked, which make them ideal for spying or scouting. Just be careful around detectors.


Keep an Observer at possible expansion points to watch the enemy's movement. If you are able to build Observers early enough, you can actually fly them into your opponent's base before he surrounds it with detectors.
Dark templars can be used to attack early expansions that have no detectors or small groups of units. A single Marine can be killed instantly with a Dark Templar. You can also throw a couple of Dark Templars into an attack force for extra attack power.

Practice!",How to Not Suck at StarCraft 2," Especially for players new to StarCraft, this cannot be emphasized enough. The campaign is designed to expose players to the new StarCraft 2 units and show them their strengths and weaknesses. Aside from the main story, there are several single player training missions designed to introduce one to key concepts of gameplay, such as micro, counters, and specialist units. Ten hours spent in single player would be well spent (it has an awesome story) and will save you tens of hundreds of frustrating online matches.;
, All three races are well balanced (see Balance Bitching in tips) stick to that race, even though you will lose a lot at first. Protoss, Zerg, and Terran all have completely different play styles, find one that suits you, and stick to it. For example, a Zerg player cannot win with one expo, he must spread his economy quickly and maintain a mobile army. Terrans, on the other hand, can turtle more and still be will matched. In general, Zerg is an aggressive race, and Terran is more defensive, and Protoss is in the middle. That's not set in stone, though; there are extremely aggressive Terran strategies such as the 11-reap-marauder.

, When doing placement matches, don't use cheese. If you get ranked low, don't worry. The placement system will automatically adjust the level of opponents you face. If you cheese, then you may get a really good rank to brag about, but you won't stay there.You will hate the game because your win rate is 30/70. Just play your best and you will be matched against opponents well-suited to your skill.

, Play lots of matches. Custom games such as Battlecraft, Micro Arena, and Marine Arena can help you practice important skills like counters and using terrain to your advantage.

Your opponent may already be rushing your base, so even if you scout out your opponent with the attack unit, it will most likely be too late, unless you plan to rush too and have a multitude of units at your base.;
, If he is, for example, expanding his territory rapidly and not producing a units, try to gather up a large force and rush his bases before he can gain the upper hand by controlling most of the resources and climbing up the technology tree faster than you. Another example is countering your opponent's units. Every unit can be countered. For example, Firebats are cheap, but powerful splash damage units that are excellent against Zealots and Zerglings.

, Your opponent assault your mineral workers, which cripples your income. Build a few defence turrets to protect your workers.

, As soon as your opponent gives you a chance, expand to an unoccupied base. Defend your expansions well. When these expansion are lost you lose numerous tactical advantages. You lose vision of the map, the ability to quickly reinforce your army when in enemy territory, and you lose the ability to choke your opponent units.

, Place the units with a ranged attack behind the melee units. This will minimize the time melee units take to access battle. Also, spread your combat units out so that any enemy unit with splash damage attributes will not damage too many of your units.


Learn Hotkeys to increase APM (actions per minute) in order to micro-manage effectively and do more things at once. Pressing 'm' in the Barrack will produce a Marine for example, that is much faster than locating a Barracks and clicking the ""Train Marine"" button. It is also faster to have production building (Hatcheries, Barracks, Factories, Gateways, etc.) hotkeyed so that you can produce during combat. Instead of taking your focus from battle to build units at your base, for example, you can hotkey you production buildings and quickly and effectively produce units while fighting your opponent.

, Do not jam your base, but do not leave it wide open. Try to get in a cannon for every 1 or 2 buildings. Also, if you really want to, you can block up your cannons by putting buildings on each side. For the Terrans, doing this is really important since they have weak units. For every 1-2 building, have a bunker, and sometimes a tank. Every 2 bunkers need a missile turret for detection against cloaked units. For Zerg, this is not as important, since you can get Sunken and Spore colonies, which are pretty cheap and good. But in Zerg, always be sure to keep producing drones, as they will be needed.


On the other hand, it seems better to have mobile units than stationary defences. It is easy for your opponent to find a way around your packed defences and get to the mineral fields. A reaver drop (a reaver dropped off by a shuttle) is devastating if you haven't got any mobile attack force to pull back and defend your workers. The only good reason to put some cash on stationary defences early on in the game is when playing terrain against Protoss. They are the only way to detect Dark Templar's, until you can get science V's out (although the com-sat add-on to the Command Center may provide a more flexible, if temporary detection system).

, Air units are ideal for this job. They are almost all fast, can fly across water, and usually have strong anti-air attacks. Wraiths (can also cloak), Scouts, Mutalisks, and Valkyries are highly recommended. Destroying even one Overlord can greatly hinder your enemy in unit production, and will force him or her to morph another Overlord. This could delay an invasion for several minutes while you bolster your own forces.

, By doing so you can stop numerous things. You can stop photon cannons from firing, production buildings from producing and destroy a tactical advantage your opponent has.

, If your opponent only has workers produced, his only choice is to use at least two workers to kill your worker. Don't let your worker die, retreat. Before the two or more workers start gathering resources again, attack with your worker. If the enemy does not respond, build something in his base, but don't finish it, because that would just waste resources. Instead, if his workers attack your building or your worker, cancel the building right before it dies. Therefore, you regain the resources you spent and caused your opponent to lose income by distracting several workers at the cost of only one for you. As a bonus, your worker gathers intelligence about your opponent's base.

,, Interceptors are cheap to make and are automatically repaired upon the return to the Carrier. This tactic renders the enemy's defences useless. A human player will most likely attack the actual Carrier, because when the Carrier is destroyed, all of the Interceptors die too.

,, If you can, surround the enemy with mines and use hit and run tactics unless you outnumber them by a large margin.

, This involves 3-8 tanks with siege mode, and with supporting fire e.g. Marines and Goliaths. Most people have about 6 tanks with about 20 Marines and 5 Goliaths. Wraiths and Science Vessels are needed sometimes. All you do is siege your tanks and keep moving closer and closer to him. If a unit such as a Zergling gets near your tanks, just use your marines and Goliaths to kill it.

, Burrow them in at one of the following places:


Burrow your unit on the best spot where the central building (Nexus for Protoss, Command Center for Terran, and Hatchery for Zerg) can be placed. This spot is as close to the minerals and Vespene geyser as a central building can be placed. If your burrowed unit is on that spot, the enemy's expansion will be delayed and that can be a cue to attack the enemy's main base, for most of the enemy troops will be at the expansion.
Another choice would be to burrow the unit (more if you'd like) near the expansion site, so that your unit's vision can reach most of the base. This will provide you with intel as to the enemy's position, base defences, and troop number. Be careful; once the enemy has set up the basic buildings, defensive measures will be established, which means that detectors will be in place, endangering your burrowed units. The best solution to this problem is to uncover your units as soon as the central building is finished (so the enemy cannot cancel the building and receive a refund) and attack any nearby units or the central building.

,, Your opponent might be forced to kill the unit or send it alone to your base. Another trick is to parasite critters, as few players bother to kill them.

,, This is really important because if they are killed, it can stop your unit production dead in it's tracks.

, Your main hatchery isn't enough. If you have a large main base, try to get at least 3 hatcheries in it. On every expansion, depending on the size, get 1 or 2 hatcheries.

"
"
Position the Arbiter somewhere safe (probably your main base) and hotkey it to 4 (Right above the recall hot key).,
If you are against Terran, quickly put Observers in all of the bases on the map, but far away enough to be unseen from a ComSat.

,
Station a Dark Archon right under the Observer.

,
When you see the sparkle marks of a comsat OR and SCV/Drone in the base, quickly mind-control it before it starts building.

,
Quickly press 4 (or whatever you hotkeyed your Arbiter), and recall the SCV into your base.

Terran is the most mechanically demanding race, and they are best for slowly pushing and strong defense and walling-off. Terrans are generally the most inflexible in their build, and they have medium unit cost.






Protoss is generally regarded as the easiest to learn, with a balance of mechanics and strategy. Their units are generally more powerful but also more expensive. They have a medium level of army mobility and map control.






Zerg is the most strategically heavy race, and therefore is more difficult for newcomers. They have a highly flexible economic structure with a need for high map control and many expansions. Their units are generally weaker but less expensive.

The Zerg are insect-like aliens meant to stage large-scale attacks. The Protoss, an advanced race of warriors, are slow but powerful. You only need one Protoss combat unit for every two to three Zerg and Terran units to win a battle.


""Units"" refer to the tiny characters that play different roles in your army. Some units can attack, while others have special abilities that can turn the tide of battle when used at the right moment.;
, Minerals are currency that pays for things like buildings, units, and upgrades. At the beginning of every game, you find yourself at a base that consists of a building, four workers, and patches of blue crystals called minerals. Left-click one of the workers, then right-click a mineral patch. Your worker will automatically begin harvesting minerals.


""Workers"" and ""harvesters"" refer to units able to harvest minerals. Each faction has one worker unit. The Terran worker is called an SCV, the Zerg worker is a Drone, and the Protoss worker is called a Probe.
You can select multiple units by clicking and dragging around a group of units.

, ""Town hall"" is a general term used to refer to a Terran Command Center, Zerg Hatchery, or Protoss Nexus, primary buildings where you train workers and other unit types. Training workers differs depending on the faction you choose.


Terran: Left-click the Command Center, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click SCV.
Protoss: Left-click the Nexus, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click Probe.
Zerg: Left click a larva, one of the worm-like critters crawling around near your Hatchery. Click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click Drone.

, Every unit, building, and upgrade has a resource cost associated with it. You can view resource costs by clicking your ""town hall"" (or a larva if you're a Zerg player), clicking Build, and hovering your mouse cursor over the unit you want to build.


Your resources are represented by three counters in the upper-right corner of the screen: one for minerals, one for gas, and one for supply, or the number of units you can support.

, Your worker units do more than harvest resources. They are the only units able to construct new buildings that give you access to more powerful units, upgrades, and more. Constructing buildings varies with each faction.


Terran: left-click an SCV, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then select a building to construct. Begin construction by clicking on a stretch of clear ground. If the building silhouette glows red, you cannot build on that patch of ground.
Protoss: left-click a Probe, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then select a building to construct. Protoss players can only place buildings within the blue circle, known as a power field, than emanates from Pylon buildings. The first building you construct should be a Pylon.
Zerg: left-click a Drone, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then select a building to construct. Zerg players can only build on the creep, the purple, slimy carpet that surrounds your Hatchery. When construction begins, your Drone transforms into the building you chose. You'll lose the Drone, but no worries: Drones are cheap, so just build another one.
Buildings you can construct are shown in color, along with their resource costs. Grayed-out buildings cannot be built until you build their pre-requisite buildings. You can read pre-requisite requirements by hovering your cursor over a grayed-out building in the Build menu.

, Near your town hall and mineral patches is a geyser emitting puffs of green fumes. That's a Vespene geyser, and you can assemble a building overtop of it to harvest Vespene gas, which you need to pay for certain buildings, units, and upgrades. Each faction uses a different building to harvest gas.


Terran: Select an SCV, click Build, then click Refinery. Place the Refinery overtop the Vespene geyser.
Protoss: Select a Probe, click Build, then click Assimilator. Place the Assimilator overtop the Vespene geyser.
Zerg: Select a Drone, click Build, then click Extractor. Place the Extractor overtop the Vespene geyser.

, Once you've built your Refinery, Assimilator, or Extractor, build four to five workers, select them by left-clicking, then right-click the Refinery/Assimilator/Extractor. They will begin harvesting gas and continue until the geyser is depleted.

, Right clicks perform different actions depending on what you click. For instance, selecting a unit and then right-clicking on the ground orders the unit to move to that position. Right-clicking an enemy unit causes your unit to attack.

, Each faction starts the game with one building that lets you train combat units. To train other types of combat units, build other types of buildings.


Terran: left-click an SCV, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click Barracks. Place your Barracks on an empty patch of ground. When it's finished, click the Barracks, then click Marine. The Marine fires its weapon from medium range and is cheap, so train lots of them and attack in large groups.
Protoss: left-click a Probe, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click Gateway. Place your Gateway within a Pylon's power field. When it's finished, click the Gateway, then click Zealot. Zealots are slow, but deal tremendous damage. Two to three zealots is enough to attack twice as many Terran Marines or Zerg Zerglings.
Zerg: left-click a Drone, click the Build button in the lower-right corner, then click Spawning Pool. Place your Spawning Pool anywhere on the creep (slimy purple carpet). When it's finished, click one of the worm-like larva crawling around near the Hatchery, click Build, and click Zergling. Zerglings are extremely fast and come in pairs. Build up swarms of them to overrun your opponents.

, You can think of supply as food: armies need food to function. Check your supply, shown in the upper-right corner of the screen next to your supply of minerals and Vespene gas. As usual, the three factions increase supply in different ways.


Terran: Select an SCV, click Build, then click Supply Depot. Place the Supply Depot on any open patch of ground.
Protoss: Select a Probe, click Build, then click Pylon. Pylons generate power fields and do not have to be placed inside a power field to function.
Zerg: Select a larva in front of your Hatchery, click Build, then click Overlord. Overlords are mobile units that cannot attack, so don't leave them unguarded.

, An amazing pioneered by (name) basically used the fact that Lurkers can only kill what their spines touch, and that Marines/Lurkers attack times, if known, can be exploited.

, It basically means you put about a half of your army on the frontline and defend with it, and the other force away from the base, able to strike the backlines of enemy's attacking army. This is helpful, because your units (especially those with tough pathfinding, like Dragoons) don't have to dance around at the backlines because they don't have enough room to maneuver. It also doesn't let your enemies escape from the battle. Speed upgrades are helpful in doing this (Zealots, Zerglings), and if you are Zerg, you can burrow your units on the flank.

,, It's good to send Dragoons to harass your Terran enemy by blocking any SCV scouting attempts or Vulture mine harassing attempts, but it becomes foolish to let those Dragoons die on mines or after Tanks get their powerful Siege upgrade.

While your town hall's construction is underway, assign another worker to build a Refinery, Assimilator, or Extractor overtop a Vespene geyser.
Establish a defensive perimeter to protect your town hall while it's under construction.
Once the town hall finishes construction, train workers and saturate those minerals and geysers.

, The more expansion bases you control, the more minerals and gas you have at your disposal. Take care not to stretch yourself too thin, however. Don't expand into a new base unless you have the means to defend it.

, You should never have more than 1,000 minerals at a time. Spend your minerals and gas on units, buildings, and upgrades to increase the strength of your army.

Use SCVs to repair damaged buildings.,
Remove an SCV from construction if it's in danger.,
Use Supply Depots as defensive walls.,
Assign Medivacs to travel with groups of combat units.,
Build a Barracks just outside an enemy base.",How to Play Starcraft 23," Buildings that take damage can eventually collapsed if left untreated. To repair a building, select an SCV, then right-click a damaged building. Assign more SCVs to repair a building to patch it up quicker.

, An SCV must continue working on a building in order to construct it. However, you can order the SCV to retreat if it comes under attack. Simply select the SCV, then press Escape. The SCV will halt construction and can be moved around. When you're ready to finish the building, select any SCV, then right-click the building.

, Supply Depots increase your supply, but you can also use them as makeshift bulwarks. If the only way into your base by ground is through a chokepoint, build two or three supply depots side by side, then build a Bunker behind the Depots and fill it with marines. Any hostile units will have to tear down your Supply Depots to reach the marines firing at them from the safety of the bunker.

, Medivacs serve two purposes: they shuttle units in and out of battle, and they automatically heal wounded units within a certain radius. Build two or three and include them in each group of combat units you create.


Load units into a Medivac by selecting up to eight units, then right-click the Medivac.
The fastest way to defeat your opponents is to cut off their income channels. Load combat units into a Medivac and fly around the perimeter of an enemy base until you spot their line of workers harvesting minerals. Drop your units right in their midst by selecting the Medivac, right-clicking the ground near a mineral patch, and clicking Unload.

, Use one SCV to scout the map until you find an enemy base. Don't go inside. Instead, construct a Barracks, pump out Marines, and send groups of four to five into the base. You may not claim victory, but at the very least, you'll pose a distraction.

"
Overlap pylons to extend power fields.,
Put Probes back to work after warping in a building.,
Use fewer units to attack.,
Cast the Sentry unit's Hallucination ability to confuse and distract opponents.",How to Play Starcraft 24," Smart players will target your Pylons before going after other buildings. If your enemy forces manage to destroy a pylon, all the buildings within its power field will cease to function--unless, of course, you overlap pylons to extend power fields.

, Unlike Terran SCVs, your Probes do not need to tend to a building during construction. In fact, Probes don't ""build"" buildings; they warp them in. Once your Probe initiates the warp-in process, you can assign it to other jobs, like resource gathering. The building will appear on its own.

, As a Protoss player, your strength lies not in numbers, but in brute force. Two or three Protoss units are equal to twice as many Terran and Zerg units. Build up contingents of four to five combat units, then attack to keep up pressure on your opponents.

, The Sentry unit has an ability called Hallucination that creates illusions of combat units. To you, hallucinations appear translucent, but to your opponents, they look real. They cannot inflict any damage and they die quickly, but you can use them as decoys to keep your opponents busy while your real combat units wreak havoc.

"
Expand your creep to construct more buildings.,
Build two to three Hatcheries at each base to generate more larvae.,
Use Banelings on clumps of enemy units.,
Harass enemies with Zerglings.",How to Play Starcraft 25," Remember, the Zerg can only place buildings on creep. Expand your creep by building Hatcheries and Creep Tumors.


Building two Creep Tumors within the same radius causes your creep to expand faster.

, All Zerg units must hatch from larvae. Larvae come from Hatcheries, and each Hatchery generates three larvae. Build a minimum of two Hatcheries at each base to build up your forces quickly.

, Banelings are tiny glowing combat units that explode on contact with hostile forces. One Baneling can wipe out a small group of weaker units like the Terran Marine.

, Zerglings are arguably the most cost-effective unit in the game. They're cheap, and you get two Zerglings from each larva. Pump out a steady supply of Zerglings and send them around the map to scout out prospective expansion locations and harass your enemies.

Make sure that no matter which race you are playing that you are constantly building workers.,
Learn what to build and have a basic plan.,
Your initial target goal is to keep your minerals below 500 while building your army and expanding bases every three or four minutes.,
In order to do the previous step more quickly, it is good to learn how to hotkey and how to hotkey well.,
Learn army compositions.,
Scout early and often.,
Avoid becoming supply blocked.,
Expand.,
Practice good macro and micro.",How to Improve Your Skills Playing StarCraft 2," Try to avoid having to queue them up, as this clogs up resources which you could be using on other things. Just keep building them one at a time, as often as you can. A good income is key to winning games at any level.;
, There are many YouTube guides which give you a basic rundown of what a general good end goal is for a base. For Protoss, for example, you want to start out with a Gateway or two and then go towards an Assimilator then a Cybernetics Core and work towards a second Nexus. While you are getting your second nexus built up it is good to research warp gate and go for 8 Gateways, a Forge, Robotics Bay and a Twilight Council. You can build into Stargates or whatever you want after that, but have a basic plan. If you don't have a plan you'll get slow. All players have plans. Once you get better the plans get changed more often into strategies that will run smoother. You don't know these other plans because you haven't tried any on your own yet. You also don't have the experience, so playing Starcraft 2 won't initially be a game of adaption to different strategies by the opponent. At first it will be adapting your own strategy to become more efficient and powerful. Not necessary but you should probably stick with a single race and branch out later., Maintaining these three goals (low unused resources, building armies for attacks and expanding bases) will help you with APM. If you can perfect this step you'll be good for Platinum. The biggest trouble with players is an inability to macro., There are good YouTube videos on this. You don't need to be bogged down with everything. Just learn to hotkey a few key buildings (Nexus et all, barracks et all, upgrades). Learning how to hotkey drastically improves your speed and will probably double your apm by just hotkeying those few first buildings., Once you learn different army compositions and good counters you can learn to adjust your strategy on the fly. This is the core of Starcraft 2 and any strategy games. This is, besides probably microing, the biggest part of learning how to become a pro in Starcraft 2., This not only provides you with map control, but also allows you to analyze and anticipate what your opponent is doing and counter effectively. Try to send out an early worker (or even an overlord as Zerg) to both find your opponents base and see what kind of early units they may be building.

, Keep an eye on the supply limit of your army up at the top right of your screen, and continue to anticipate when you are going to need extra. Build pylons, supply depots, or overlords accordingly.

, Your initial resource patch is only going to sustain your army and your base building for so long, and the extra resources provided will give you that much more of an edge. Make sure to provide some sort of defense for the new expansion, whether that means parking your army in front of it, or building some static defenses (such as photon cannons, spine crawlers, or bunkers and missile turrets). Move some extra workers from your main base to the new expansion in order to saturate it more quickly.

, In Starcraft, there are two terms associated with the control of all your commands in the game. Micro refers to the command of individual units, whether it be moving your army into position for an attack or sending a worker towards a potential expansion location. Macro is the act of creating new units and buildings as well as managing your economy, like queuing up some marines, creating a barracks, or sending extra workers to mine vespene gas. In order to win games you need to find the delicate balance between the two. Try your best to split your attention between building back at your base, and making sure your army is not neglected during attacks.

",How to Nuke Your Enemy in Starcraft," This will allow you to build Nuclear Silos and the Ghosts that deploy your nukes.;
, A Nuclear Silo is an add-on for the Command Center. You cannot have both a Comsat Station and a Nuclear Silo on the same Command Center.

, They cost 200 Minerals and Vespene Gas, and 8 supply points. They take quite a while to build, so you should do this before you actually want to nuke anything.

, Without a Ghost your nuke will be useless. When your nuke is ready the ""Nuclear Strike"" command will be available.

, Usually your enemy's main base will be too heavily defended to sneak your Ghost in close enough to nuke it. So consider attacking a resource base (or multiple resource bases) to weaken your enemy's economy.

, Select the ""Nuclear Strike"" command and click the target structure or area. All the players will be notified of the imminent nuclear strike by an audio and visual message. A flashing red dot will appear over the target. This allows your enemy to locate your Ghost and kill it before the strike can be completed.

, The nuke will detonate over the area and severely damage or destroy the units and structures in the area.

Watch your allies to get ideas for different mazes.

,
On most maps there are small enemies that can run through the gaps of two sunkens.,
Don't make walls.,
There is only 1 kind of wall that can be used in certain maps such as the common 10 way map, it is a diagonal wall that separates between the 2 spawns or either way on the middle position.",How to Improve StarCraft (Sunken) Defence," There are many types of mazes and things you can put in each.


A trap, the bulk of your enemy forces will fall here and stay here for a while until finding the hole in your maze and trying to run through.
A maze that will keep your enemy running around so they can be attacked more.;
, Divide your enemy up and attack the one that is farthest in your maze using a concentrated mass of units.

,, Block these gaps using cheap units and then test to see that nothing gets through using a ghost/ling.

, If your enemies encounter a wall and have nowhere to go because the opening is too small then they will move backwards. When they get to the last square of where they spawn then a trigger activates and you lose the game. Walling is stupid and will cause a loss.

, This wall works because instead of blocking the enemy and making them stuck and stop moving (where they may start attacking your defence) or turning around, they get deflected off to the sides but will always be trying to go through your defence and thus you should never lose (except to air mobs). If done correctly this is the ultimate defence but in the end you will just be building the same defence over and over again taking away some fun of the map.

Begin building an army of Goliaths.

, Also, once your base is defended build lots of marines and make a rally point northeast of your base,do this with your factories too.

,


Lift it off and have it move on top of Norad 2. At this point you should restore Norad 2 to full health. construct a star port with observation tower where the barracks used to be (it will fit).
Lift off buildings and land them according to which buildings you need to produce units. Build a few drop ships and about 7 or so wraiths. Once done get the wraiths to attack the sunken colony ahead of the ramp.

Understand the Druid’s Power.,
Play Druid Cards.,
Play Neutral Cards.,
Play Legendary Cards.",How to Win Using Druid in Hearthstone," The Druid’s power is focused on acquiring early access to high tiered minions and spells by gaining additional mana early in the game. Malfurion may not have a weapon like the other heroes but his minions have unique effects – effects that give you options depending on how a duel is going on.


The Druid can have an early advantage as it allows him to summon minions such as the Chillwind Yeti (a 4/5 minion) as early as turn one. Make sure to use this incredible power to your advantage.
Mulligan for cards such as Innervate and Wild Growth if you want to take advantage of this power.
Shapeshift is Malfurion’s hero power. It adds one armor and attack to your hero. This is very useful in destroying minions, especially early in the game, with one life (HP). This can be more effective when that minion only has 1 attack since this will not damage Malfurion because of its acquired one armor.
Spells like Wrath and Power of the Wild have two effects each. These cards will give you options on which effect you would like to activate when you use them. It is like having two effect cards in one!;
, Playing aggressive using the Druid deck can be very effective considering its ability to acquire additional mana early in the game. That being said, there are minions and spells that work well with this ability if you wish to battle the aggressive way.


Try to have Innervate on your first set of cards. This will start the ball rolling for you since this card will allow you to summon more minions.
Keep your Savage Roars ready for board clears. Its ability to add two attacks on your characters will surely come in handy after you have a couple of minions on your side. And yes, even Malfurion himself will be affected by this spell.
Spells like Power of the Wild or Druid the Claw can be handy for they are spells that actually summon an additional minion. If you have enough minions already, you can use Power of the Wild’s other effect to add 1/1 on each of your minions and attack.
You might want to add Naturalize, Starfall, and Starfire for destroying threatening enemy minions, especially those pesky taunts. Swipe can also save you from being outnumbered.
Keeper of the Grove can help you silence those taunts that block your mass attack. Not only that, it has an optional effect to inflict two damage. Wrath has the same effect only, it has 3 damage. It can also damage just one but will allow you to draw one card. Very handy if you’re running out of cards in your hand.
Another dual effect card is Nourish. This card can actually be a life saver for it allows you to draw 3 cards or acquire two additional mana.

, Cards that have staying power and that allows you to have dominance in the board is priority in choosing neutral minions. This will prepare you for your surprise charge attack.


Creatures like the Imp Master and the Violet Teacher can provide you easy minion summons for they automatically provide you with token creatures. This works best with Savage Roar when your side of the board already has enough number of minions to attack.
Argent Squires can be perfect for an aggressive approach because of their divine shields. They surely have staying power compared to other one cost minions.
Acolyte of Pain can also be handy for this cards forces your opponent to allow you to draw an extra card. Very useful when you are waiting for that boost card such as Savage Roar.
During the end game, expect to see powerful minions from your opponent. Cards such as Big Game Hunter and Faceless Manipulator can be great equalizers. Time your use of these cards for they might save you from being dominated.

, There are three legendary cards recommended for building an aggressive Druid deck.


Ragnaros is an obvious choice since it has a sure 8 damage on each end turn. In case of multiple targets, Keeper of the Grove can easily silence it and make it attack directly to the enemy hero.
Alexstrasza can either save your HP from reaching zero in no time or instantly reduce your enemy’s HP to 15. Yes, it can easily set a hero’s HP to 15 just like that. Follow up a charging attack after you set your opponent’s HP to 15 and it might be a sure win for you.
Ysera can supply you an extra draw for each end turn. Mind you, the cards that Ysera draw are unique and are very powerful! Particular cards that you should watch for are Ysera Awakens, Laughing Sister, and Nightmare.

Continue to defeat heroes.",How to Unlock Heroes in Hearthstone," During the tutorial you will play as Jaina Proudmoore, the Mage class. Once you have completed the tutorial objectives you will have unlocked Jaina. You can then use Jaina to unlock other heroes. Each hero unlocked also unlocks a different style of play.;
, After you finish the tutorial you will be taken to the “Main” screen. Click on the “Practice” button. This will take you to the “Practice Mode” screen where you can battle against other heroes. Each time you successfully defeat another hero you will unlock that hero for use in other play modes.

, All of the heroes have different abilities, and knowing what they’re capable of can help you decide who you want to fight next.Malfurion Stormrage, the druid, has the power to shapeshift and increase a minions armor and health, he plays primarily through his minions and many of his basic minion cards have taunt.
The hunters Rexxar and Aleria Windrunner are good to use with decks that primarily have beasts in them. Their class ability is to do two direct damage to the enemy hero.
The paladin Uther Lightbringer has an endless supply of 1 / 1 (1 damage / 1 health) minions he can place on the board with his hero power. His minions are balanced and many have the ability Divine Shield, which will completely ignore the first attack regardless of strength against it.
Priest Anduin Wrynn is hard to kill because of his ability to use rather large heals on himself and his minions. A unique ability the priest has is to use the card “Shadow Form” to change the nature of his hero power from a heal spell to a direct damage spell.

Valeera Sanguinar, the Rogue, is adept at using very cheap cards to defeat her opponent. She even has a few cards that cost no mana crystals to play. Her hero power is the ability to equip herself with a 1 / 2 dagger.
The shaman, Thrall, has the ability to summon random totems to his aid. These totems can be healing totems, damage totems, or buffing totems. His deck is comprised of spells and minions that are used with his totems to do very quick and large amounts of damage to his opponent.
The warlock Gul’dan has demon minions at his disposal. He also has a interesting game play mechanic different than any other hero. He can use his hero power to sacrifice his own life to draw cards. He can use this ability to gain a rather large hand in the early game and use that hand to dominate the playing field in the mid game.
The warriors, Garrosh Hellscream and Magni Bronzebeard, are adept at defensive abilities as well as tactical use of direct damage. They have the ability to increase their armor using their hero power, and also have many weapons they can equip within their decks. It is hard to get through their defenses in order to land an attack.

, Once you have defeated another hero you can then use that hero to battle others in “Practice Mode” and are not required to continue to use Jaina. Switching up heroes as you play in “Practice Mode” will help you to understand how each plays, will grant that hero experience, and will unlock new cards for that hero’s class specific card deck.

, As you play through the “Practice Mode” you will find that each hero uses a different technique. Sometimes changing to a different class will help you defeat your opponent more easily. Keep trying different classes of hero and card combinations until you have defeated and unlocked all nine heroes for play in your regular games.

Understand the Mage’s Power.,
Play the Mage cards.,
Use Polymorph if a threatening minion is standing before you.,
Play neutral cards.,
Play Legendary cards.",How to Win Using Mage in Hearthstone," Being a heavy spell user, Jaina can easily bypass enemy minions on the board and inflict direct damage to the enemy hero directly. Just the same, her spells can also halt and destroy dangerous enemy minions with her fire/ice spells.


Jaina’s hero power is called Fireblast. This ability is very useful in inflicting damage to anyone! Unlike weapons or Druid/Rogue skills, this ability bypasses taunts. It also does not inflict damage to Jaina when hitting a minion with attack power.
The mage has lots of spells that have area of effect (AOE) such as Flamestrike. These spells are very powerful that it can wipe out an entire set of enemy minions with at least 4 heath points (HP). Not to mention if you have a minion on your side of the board which boosts spell damage.
Mage minions also has lots of freeze effects that halts enemy onslaught until you draw that AOE spell card to clear the board.
Mage decks can be aggressive, but it is mostly known to be a control deck due to its AOE spells. It can easily set the board into your advantage. Use these AOEs when you have lots of enemy minions so its use can be maximized.;
, The Mage cards mostly consist of spells that clear the board or weaken strong enemy minions. This is useful so that as you attack the enemy hero, there’s no big threat on the enemy side that threatens Jaina.


Frostbolts and fireballs are quick damage spells that you can deploy. These four cards are already 18 in damage altogether. Use this to reduce your opponent’s HP or simply destroy an enemy minion. Frostbolt has an extra effect of freeze that disables an enemy hero from attacking as well.
Use the Mage's most powerful spell in Hearthstone – the Ice Block. Not only does it save your HP from reaching zero, but it gives you immunity for the rest if that turn! Accompanied with Counterspell, the Mage can easily put the opponent’s plan into a halt after countering one of its essential spells.

, The minion will be now reduced to a just 1/1 sheep.


The only Mage minion that is almost an automatic addition to the deck is the Water Elemental. It just costs 4 mana and with a whopping 6 HP. Try using the Chillwind Yeti as it can also be a good option for this slot for a 4/5 minion.
Use the Flamestrike and Blizzard for the AOE spells. They may be high cost spells, but they are really worth it! They can easily obliterate enemy minions in one turn. If not, the Blizzard has a special effect that freezes enemy minions in one turn that prevents them from attacking the following turn.
Getting cheap spells like Mirror Image and Arcane Blast are easy to deploy since they just cost one mana each. Their cost is small compared to how they impact the game. Use the Mirror Image to instantly gives you two taunts, while the Arcane Blast inflicts 2 damage to enemy minions that can be increased when you have a minion that boosts spell damage.
Mana Wyrm and Sorcerer’s Apprentice are also essential minions to add to your deck since they are low cost and has good synergy with spells. The Mana Wyrm gains one attack each time you use spells (including the mana coin) and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice reduces spell cost by one making spells such as Arcane Shot and Mirror Image zero cost!
Pyroblast inflicts 10 damage for 10 mana. Using this will likely be the best finisher that you’ll have when using a Mage deck. Keep this in your hand until the time is right.

, The minions included in the neutral side are composed of minions that can help add damage to spells and prevent your opponent from dominating the board.


Heroes such as Rogue and Warrior relies heavily on weapons. These weapons can be a headache, especially if they start to destroy your minions on the board. Adding Acidic Swamp Ooze on your deck resolves this issue - activate its battle cry, which will let it destroy the enemy weapon.
One of the favorite small drop minions is the Knife Juggler and why not? It has a decent 3/2 stat and it fires a damage every time you add a minion to the board. This works well with Mirror Image since for a price of one – the Knife Juggler gets to fire two knives to enemy characters. Same principle works with Violet Teacher when it summons a 1/1 minion every time you cast a spell.
One of the minions that has high survival rate is the Harvest Golem. You have to destroy it twice to totally get rid of it. You can also add Argent Commanders to your deck since it has charge and divine shield. Again, you cannot destroy it in just one attack. Additionally, it has 4 attack!
Azure Drakes can easily boost your damage spells and it also has a draw battlecry. That’s two powerful effects in just one card. It is also a decent minion even when silenced since it has a solid 4/4 stat
Since Mage decks are heavy on spells, adding a Gadgetzan Auctioneer could be a good idea. This minion can easily fill up your hand with cards with its effect which is to draw a card each time you cast a spell. Very handy when you find yourself running out of cards.

, There are a lot of legendaries that can work well with Jaira. The exclusive legendary that you can use though is Archmage Antonidas. You can also consider using Alexstrasza for that instant HP enemy depletion.


Archmage Antonidas simply gives you an infinite supply of fireballs – literally. As long as you cast a spell, he will give you a fireball spell. Very powerful especially during the end game!
Imagine deploying Alexstrasza in the field setting your enemy HP to 15 while you have 2 Fireballs and a Frostbolt at hand. Do the math! Your opponent is defeated on your next turn unless he heals himself.

Pick the right legendary.",How to Win Using Warlock in Hearthstone," Hearthstone is an online TCG (Trading Card Game) that puts two players against each other on a card duel. This game does not go too far from other TCG games but it has some special rules of its own.;
, In order to win the duel, a player must deplete his opponent’s health (HP) to zero.


You will not lose if you empty your card deck; instead, your HP will deplete slowly on your each turn.

, Both players will have their own hero ability, which they can use by clicking on the hero ability icon at the right side of their hero icon.

, Hearthstone cards are divided into three categories: minions, spells, and weapons. All these cards have their corresponding mana cost, which determines if a player can summon or use a certain card.

, For your minion to attack the opponent, simply click on that minion and direct its attack to its target, may it be to an enemy minion or directly to the enemy hero.


Same thing happens for using damaging spells; just choose the target of the spell and its damage will be dealt to that target.

, The name of your hero is Gul’dan and is obviously fond of demon minions. His strength relies on rapid drawing of cards due to his Life Tap ability. He can really be an annoying opponent especially at the early parts of the game due to his ability that enables him to possibly summon lots of minions at once.


Use Life Tap early in the game to take advantage of the chance to fill the field with minions. Life Tap enables you to draw a card in exchange for 2 HP and 2 mana. Don’t worry about your HP since your opponent will be busy killing off your minions first.
Life Tap drains your HP so know when to consider to stop using it. Maybe when you reach about half of your HP, you can already consider pausing from Life Tapping since it could drain your life faster. Of course this depends on the current state of the board. If you’re in advantage—by all means, continue summoning and attacking your opponent.

, Warlock deck has two major play styles: one is the Zoo and the other one is the Handlock. Both play styles are proven to be effective and legendary Warlock players use these play styles to reach high ranks with Hearthstone.


Zoo deck simply means using minions with small cost as often as you can. In other words, bombard the enemy with enemies! These minions may not be that strong but there is surely strength in quantity. Imagine 3 minions on your side of the board on your first turn. Now that’s board dominance!
Handlock deck is somewhat the opposite of the Zoo deck. This play style truly shines on the later part of the game. Why? Because your key minions in applying this play style costs high. These minions’ costs can be decreased, however, by some factors. Molten Giants for example cost one less mana for each damage your hero has taken.

, As mentioned earlier, Gul’dan’s minions are primarily composed of demons. Focusing on the most popular Warlock deck, which is the Zoo, here are the minions that you should add to your roster:



Voidwalker – This costs just one mana and has taunt. Very good for defending your hero early in the game.

Flame Imp – Another one dropper with a whopping 3 attack and 2 HP. Be warned though, it deals 3 damage to your hero when summoned.

Doomguard – This demon will really hit your opponent hard! It has 5 attacks and 7 HP! It may cost more compared to the other demons and you need to sacrifice two random cards to summon it but it has a charge ability that is proven to be a good finisher for Zoo.

, Non-Warlock minions should also follow a certain qualification. First, it has to be low cost and secondly, it has to have a strong staying power. Meaning, it should at least stay on the board for 2 turns; having buffing ability can be a plus, too.



Argent Squire – Talk about staying power. This one minion has a divine shield when summoned.

Young Priestess – This minion adds one HP to a random friendly minion at the end of each round. That being said, this minion buffs your low cost minions’ HP and that helps in making your minions’ survival rate on the board increase.

Knife Juggler – Its ability to damage a random enemy character when you summon a minion really helps removing weak enemy minions before even declaring an attack. It can also hit the enemy hero directly with its ability; so that surely is useful when confronted with enemy taunts.

Dire Wolf Alpha – This one dropper increases minions’ attack adjacent to it. Really a good buffer.

Harvest Golem – This is a go-to minion if you want a solid staying power capability. This minion automatically summons a 2/1 Damaged Golem after being destroyed.

, For you to pull off the Zoo deck play style, it is important to understand that its key features are minions with small cost. Meaning, spells can be a little less important in this kind of deck. However, removal spells can be proven effective for Zoo as well and there’s a couple that you can add to your arsenal.



Soulfire – This spell damages any character for 4 points and the cost? ZERO. All you need is to sacrifice one card from your hand and you can already activate it. This is best in destroying enemy minions with 4 HP and below

Power Overwhelming – This spell adds 4 to a minion’s attack and HP for just one mana. Imagine playing this with Doomguard as a finisher. Catch is, after that turn, the buffed minion will die. Horribly.

, Unlike other heroes, Warlock deck does not really require legendaries to win. This is so because most of the most powerful legendaries cost a LOT. Some legendaries could actually be considered, granting they’re drawn at the right moment.



The Black Knight – This legendary can instantly destroy a minion with taunt. This will be very useful when your opponent suddenly placed a strong taunt minion in front of you.

King Mukla – This not-so-popular legendary could actually come in handy IF drawn early in the game. It is a 5/5 legendary for just 3 mana! But there’s a catch—after summoning, you’ll give your opponent two bananas (spell cards that increases a minion’s attack and HP by one).

Leeroy Jenkins – Of course, the ever popular 6/2 legendary with charge should fit just fine in a Zoo deck. A good finisher especially when paired with Power Overwhelming.

, Start summoning the Blademaster hero. While the Blademaster is being created, send your last Peons to build a few Barracks. While this is happening, upgrade you Great Hall.

, From the Barracks, create a few Grunts to protect your town. At your War Mill, select any of the upgrades. Make sure you check back often to keep upgrading. Now select your Blademaster. Upgrade him so he has the ability 'Windwalk'. This allows him to be invisible and run faster for a short time.

When you start you have 5 peons, quickly grab one and send him away from the rest, while he's moving start training more peons, and then start the other 4 mining gold.,
Assign your peons.,
You will notice that your barracks and burrow will finish building at the exact same time or very close to it, immediately start making a grunt.,
As soon as the 2nd grunt comes out you will notice your altar as well as 2nd burrow will finish building, start training your hero of choice.,
Be prepared for a lot to happen at once.",How to Rush With Orcs in Warcraft 3," The one you sent away, have him start building a BARRACKS, not an altar.;
, The first peon that comes out builds a burrow. The next one goes into mining for a total of 5 at that point. and the next two peons go to collect lumber. Stop making peons at this point, you should have 9 total.

, With one of two peons now free, start building an Altar and with the other build another burrow as soon as you have enough lumber which is very soon at this point. As soon as your 1st grunt comes out, you will have just enough to make another...well go head and make it.

, Keep making grunts. At this point its up to you what you wanna do with the one free peon. You can build a lumber mill, another burrow, or a shop to buy potions, up to you.

, When your hero finally comes out, your 4th grunt will also come out at the same time. Notice how everything happens at the same time. Anyway right about then it will turn to night and you can:


Start creeping with a decent size army
Start your rush. 4 grunts with more on the way is ahead of the game at this point. Everyone else with the conventional build order will only have a hero and maybe 2 units at this point.
Take your Blademaster and Wind Walk into an enemies base to scout it out and see what he's doing. If no one is there start killing his workers. When his army comes you Wind Walk again and make a decision to retreat or bring in the rest of your army and fight.


If you're playing 2v2 and you and your partner both know this strategy, its damn near unbeatable. 8-10 grunts and 2 heroes in one base at the first break of night = win. Good combo for heroes are witchdoctor or Far Seer getting wolves or Flamespitters.

Make sure you have all your heroes lvl 2+ before you engage your enemy.,
Best units to have with tri-hero is basically casters (sorceresses because they slow things down and it is also good go have some priests because they heal your units).

,
When you do engage your enemy start off with your MK (mountain king) with a hammer to any weak units/heroes they have.,
While you are tanking with the MK make sure you are healing him with your paladin and attacking their units with all your units selected.,
Now is the time to hero target.,
Try to avoid red or dying units.",How to Micro in Warcraft 3 Reign of Chaos," Or at least try to. Also works with all lvl 1.;
,, Immediately switch to your paladin and cast Divine Shield. Send your MK in first to ""tank"" or take all the damage.

, It is also a good idea to use Blizzard where most of their units are killing them a lot faster. Make sure you are healing your units with your paladin. And make sure you are not targeting their hero at all. When you killed all his units he only has his hero.

, Good thing to do is to use your MK's Storm Bolt to stun him, surround him with your units and attack him. He is stuck and can only TP.Counter. Attack their base and finish that person off now.

You can choose from one of these decks or click the left arrow key at the bottom of the screen to choose from among the basic decks for each hero.


It is not recommended that you enter ranked matches using a basic deck. If you have not created a custom deck yet, return to the main screen and click “My collections” to build your own custom deck.

, At the top of the screen on the right hand side you will see the buttons to choose between Casual and Ranked matches. Click on the Ranked button, then click Play Ranked.

, In order to raise your rank in Hearthstone you must first begin by winning matches in ranked mode. You will begin at rank 25 and increase based on your number of wins. For your first win you will receive a star above your player icon. This icon will change as you achieve higher ranks.

, After you win your second match you will get a second star above your player icon.

, This will change your player rank from 25 to 24. You will have a new rank icon which can be seen on your friend’s list, your battle tag, and in versus mode when playing against friends.


It is important to note that different ranks have different star counts and you must earn all stars in a rank to move on to the next rank. As you progress through the ranks the amounts of stars (wins) needed to increase to the next one increases.

, When your rank reaches level 20 you will begin to lose stars if you lose matches. Prior to rank 20, losses do not remove stars. Once you have achieved Rank 20 you cannot drop below that rank regardless of how many times you lose.

, Up to Rank 5 you will receive a winning streak bonus for every three matches won. This means the more you win in a row the more bonus stars you will get. Once you reach Rank 5, this mechanic is no longer available to you and every match becomes vital to increasing your rank. Your winning streaks will carry over from session to session.

, In order to rank up you will need to play regularly during a season if you want to place high in the ranking. The more you play the more likely that you will win and gain stars and ranks. So keep playing and winning!

",How to Play Quake 3 Well,"


Never use the gauntlet unless you are completely out of options! In free for all, it can be used for getting a lucky kill or trying to get a head start in a machine gun duel.






Use the machine gun to sap your opponents armor and HP or to finish off extremely weak enemies at long distances, but switch from it when you get better weapons.






Use plasma in relatively small areas such as corridors to deal a large amount of damage in short time. It's most effective on low- ping servers where you can hit a lot of shots after each other. It's the gun with the highest damage per second in the game.






Shotguns are usually most effective within close range of the target, but are preferably used to ""shave"" damage at long range. Each pellet does around 10 damage, so when you're moving fast, it can be a good way to deal consistent damage.






Use rail guns for long- range combat. Really useful for hit- and run strategies.






The rocket launcher is the primary weapon of Quake. Learn it, love it.





;
, Get headphones or large speakers and turn the volume up, so you can hear when someone is approaching or spawning. Headphones are preferable. This will give you the head start when intercepting your enemy.

, If you see more than 2 or 3 enemies attacking you, try to escape and deal with them one at a time. Strafing, or sidestepping is an advantage as it may confuse the attacker.

, Bonus items around the arena can be used to an advantage, such as health packs and Quad Damage power-ups. Pick these up wisely and use their benefits effectively; try not to waste the 30 seconds of power that Quad Damage can give you and make use out of it sustainably.

, When frozen in team death matches, spectate opponents and as soon as you are melted, hide or approach to wherever your opponent is heading or camping to intercept them.

",How to Make Maps for Quake III Arena," This open-source software platform allows you to make maps in the Quake III Arena game.


Learn to use it. You may also want to experience yourself with brushworking, texturing, compiling etc. after learning the basics in GtkRadiant's manual.;
, You must not leave bland, large surfaces with nothing in them. Put lamps, structure, other deco, even singing space monkeys if you ever need (actually, singing space monkeys are too loud).

, Add minor details like small curves, wall details and add player and bot clip brushes to simplify navigation.

, In the menu ""Bsp"" there are some compiling options.


Consider ""Full Final"" if you want a beautiful map, ""Fast Test"" if you want to compile quickly or  ""Full Test"" for the moderate of the two.
Then go to ""Edit --> Preferences"", go to menu ""Other --> BSP Monitoring"" and disable BSP Monitoring. And go to menu ""Bsp --> Compile AAS"". In case you're wondering, a BSP is a compiled vectorial map and a AAS is a file with the navigation data used by bots in the game.

, Start Quake III Arena and hit ~ to enter the console then type:


""sv_pure 0"" to be able to run non-packaged maps and
""devmap yourmapnamehere"" to run your map (cheats enabled for development purposes). Replace yourmapnamehere with the name of the map you saved.

, Before the final release, there are forums like Quake 3 World where you can share your map in a beta version to get critic attention, so you can improve your map with base on what people say.


The map is located in ""Quake III Arena\Quake3\baseq3\maps"" where you installed Quake III Arena. Share only the .bsp and .aas, put them inside a zip file and put that zip in a file sharing service like MEGA or Dropbox. Then share the zip's link with others.

, While you are following your suspect, open your console and type ""/record"" (to stop recording, enter ""/stoprecord""). A good demo is at least five minutes long, but many streaming services require a longer demo for certain bans (for example, PBBans generally requires a ten minute demo for wallhacks). This will serve as evidence if somebody wants to appeal your ban.

, This is most helpful if you suspect somebody is using wallhacks or chams. To take a PBSS, open your console, log into RCON (/rconpassword <password>), and type ""/rcon pb_sv_plist"". You'll then see a list of all the players connected to your server. Take note of the player's slot number (the leftmost number). Then type ""/rcon pb_sv_getss <slot number>. To review your PBSS's, go to the /game/pb/svss folder in your server using FTP. Taking good PBSSes will be discussed in the next section.

, Below is a great example of a multihack that contains all of the most common hacks:



http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG9uw3jFDmo&feature=related

Here's a brief description of the various hacks seen in this video:

Aimbot. An aimbot ""snaps"" the player's aim from player to player automatically. The aimbot in this video would be referred to as ""full snap"" because it moves from head to head instantly. A ""humanized"" bot will move between targets more slowly and inaccurately.
Wallhack. A wallhack allows the player to see nearby players through walls. The server doesn't return the position of players on the whole map, so the effectiveness of a wallhack is limited to nearby players.
Chams. Chams are any kind of visual that could not be produced by the unchanged game itself. These include player information, enemy spawn timers, and rocket cameras.





, Use the pb_sv_plist command and write down the last eight characters of the player's GUID. Go to the PBBans homepage and click on the MPi (if you have a PBBans account) or the MBi. Enter the GUID in the text entry field, then select ""GUID"", ""Exact Match,"" and the game name from the drop down menus. Check ""Show Linked GUIDs"" and ""Alias Tracker."" It is up to the server owner what criteria constitutes a ban. The most common criteria are an exact IP match and a common alias between two GUIDs. PBBans also has a similar tool.

Use the gold you have earned to play in the arena again.",How to Get Gold in Hearthstone," When you open the game after making your way through the tutorial, you will be presented with three daily quests. These quests will be refreshed every day up to the amount you completed the previous day. They will grant you various amounts of gold upon completion., You might receive a quest to play the Druid three times and a quest to win three matches. If you play the Druid while you are working on winning three matches, you'll get more done in fewer games.

, After you have completed the objectives of any quests that overlap, finish up any remaining Daily Quests. This method will ensure that you get as many quests done in the least amount of time., There are many achievements that you can acquire just through playing the game. For instance, every three times you win in Play mode you will be awarded with 10 gold. This is not a successive win requirement but can be achieved cumulatively, meaning you don't need to win three in a row to get the bonus.

, Some achievements you can earn are one-time bonuses. These achievements can give you anything from a special card back, mounts or in-game items for other Blizzard games, or Gold! The achievements can be associated with a recent expansion or with a real time event like the E3 conference, or even just a part of the core game.Some known achievements that earn gold are - Level every hero to level 10, collect all cards in the basic sets, collect every expert card, win 1000 games in Play mode, and defeat all the expert heroes in Practice mode.

, Check the news on Blizzard’s website to see if expansions or events come with new unlocks or special quests. Sometimes new ways to earn gold are revealed and the best way to know when this happens is through Blizzard’s website dedicated to Hearthstone. Another way to find out new events is through the game launcher., Even though the Arena costs money to enter, the rewards far outweigh the cost. You will have the opportunity to earn gold based on how many wins you get while playing. You will also have the ability to unlock new booster packs and legendary cards, and even gain cards from expansions you might not own. It is a great way to earn gold and expand your collection while you are at it.

, Whether you want to play more rounds in the arena or buy new booster packs, spending your gold is a great way to get more gold. Once you have spent your gold on new packs you will be able to complete more achievements with ease.

, Odds are that as you do this you will get better and better at winning in the arena. The better you are at winning, the higher your loot value will be at the end of an Arena session. This will ultimately mean more gold from your wins.

, Space them far apart so that the splash damage won't effect them.

,


Use footmen/grunts and get right under the air units if there is more than one of them. Hopefully this will cause them to end up attacking each other.
Change sides of the air unit so that your units won't get damaged as much. Move to one side, attack once, move to the other, attack again, and so on and so forth. Because ground units have no delay in their commands, unlike the air units, they can move much quicker than them.

,


Use the Slow spell to slow down the air units even more.
Use Death and Decay/Blizzard to kill them even more easily.
Polymorph works on air units. It kills them instantly, but leaves no annoying critter behind.
Death Coil is great for use on Gryphons/Dragons, especially if your death knight was damaged previously.
Haste will allow your units to outmaneuver the air units even better.
Flame Shield combined with the footman-under-air-unit method is even better, because even if they don't attack each other (including when there is only one), it still damages it, and if there is only one, it can't do anything about it as long as you pay attention.

You should then build an Arcane Tower in a position where it can access all your peasants but also has a reasonable range to hit enemy units on the outskirts. Every other farm should either be built in a scouting position around the map, to protect towers, or in front of your Altar, as it is your most fragile, exposed building. Every other building, the Arcane Vault, Arcane Sanctums, etc, should be built at the back of your base or they risk destruction. It is recommended to put the Arcane Vault near your entrance, so you can swiftly access potions and such when you need them.;
, Less footmen allow for faster Arcane Sanctums, keep that in mind. Get a Beastmaster as your second hero as soon as you hit Tier Two and construct your Two Arcane Sanctums.

, Assault his buildings that are being constructed. Delaying him will prevent him from getting the counter-units for your double Arcane Sanctum assault. It is okay to use your Town Portal here, as you will not need it if you do everything correctly.

, Reach 48 food with footmen, sorceresses and priests in a 2:1 ratio.

Bring six militia and construct a lumber mill with the remaining two peasants while you head to the orcish base.

, Upgrade all towers into guard towers. The militia have now reverted back into peasants, so order two of them to build two scout towers, and set the remaining four on Auto-Repair.

, Micromanagement will determine the winner now. The orc is likely to bring his peons to aid him--ignore them as they deal very little damage. Your guard towers will go up and the Orc player will be overrun shortly after.

Know who your best 'heroes' are.,
Last hitting and denying creeps in your lane are obligatory.,
The goal of the early game is to gain more experience and or money than your lane opponents and to protect your carry if he lanes with you.

,
The goal of the midgame is to protect your carry, to kill the other team's carry and to push towers.,
Creeps can be pulled onto the lane to save hp and to deny entire creepwaves to the enemy.,
Kill stealing is not advised.,
Try not to override the duration of stuns cast on your enemy.,
When the lanes collapse try to carry a TPscroll with you at all times.

,
Before trying to gang somebody a main target should be selected.",How to Play the Perfect DotA Game1," Certain heroes neither require nor enhance team play. They are not suited for competitive DOTA.


Armlet is a suitable choice for most dps oriented StrHeroes.
It is the ""Carry"" hero's privilege, duty and burden to farm for his items. If you are not playing the ""Carry"" hero, farming up items should not be your primary objective.

The carry's stats should be better than your own. Else you failed at protecting him.


Everyone but the carry is obligated to buy wards. The wards should be placed so as to ensure safe farming for the carry in jungle and at lane.

, Last hitting means you hit a creep just once. Last hitting also gets the carry to farm faster by not pushing the lane to far. In case a push is needed hit the creeps at full life and last hit the others.

,, Team fights for towers should only be fought if a tower can certainly be destroyed.

, Use with care. Creeps attacking a tower can be pulled behind it by using the attack command and running away. All creeps should be pulled behind it and spells may be used if necessary to kill catapults.Care, this is an old map.

, Not so much because it matters who gets the kill (except for the carry - who should if possible get the last hit), but because the application of a spell can be vital for your escape in the case of an unexpected retaliation from enemy heroes. The same spell used for killing in an unnecessary fashion may have come with an income boost, however, this advantage will be dispelled if you and/or your mates fall victim to a counteroffensive. Most ultimates should be used immediately when encountering the enemy. There are not many situations where an ultimate is wasted.

, It is best to wait and apply your stun after the initial disable has worn off.

,, Either the most dangerous or the weakest opponent should be selected. The target should not have a reliable escape mechanism. Everybody should focus on this target. If something goes wrong and the main target will inevitably get away a new target should be selected as soon as possible. Watch out for you teammates in this case.

Orc: The peons can hide in the burrows and use it as a defensive building.
Night elf: Can harvest wood without harming the trees and the buildings can uproot to defend themselves.
Undead: The graveyard provides corpses that are good for necromancers and ghouls, also one builder can create an entire base in under 20 secs {Not including the time it takes to actually build it}.
Humans: Workers can help each other build a structure unlike all the other races.;
, Have workers harvesting wood and gold and have a few houses ready so you can start building up forces.

, (Are they going to rush or are they going to defend and counter?) After a while of building up forces, you can either attack or wait.

, You can do many different attacks, but most people just do 3 types of attacks the most:

, Get all the units close to base and attack from the front or send in the forces one by one whenever a previous force was sent and they now need help. This is in case your enemy has a way out of the attack, like using zeppelins.


Create a bunch of melee, then create a bunch of ranged units and try to get more range than melee. Once you've done this, you can attack. Set up the ranged outside of the base. This way, they can stop any zeppelins from getting away. Get the melee and the heroes to attack the base. If you can, get a few tanks(Units with siege type attacks or heavy attacks). send in more units if needed.

Establish your goals.,
Unlock cards.,
Solidify your strategy.,
Choose your Hero.,
Add class specific cards to your deck.,
Add neutral cards to your deck.,
Play against the computer.,
Play against other players.,
Fine tune your deck.",How to Build an Effective Hearthstone Deck," Before you even begin to build your deck you need to establish some guidelines. First and foremost is deciding what kind of deck you want to build. Then go into the crafting menu on the deck building screen and look at each class and the cards possible to unlock and build your deck with.;
, Each hero comes with an unlockable basic deck. When you play different heroes in practice mode you will unlock the core cards associated with that hero. By doing quests and playing in other modes of the game, you can expand your card library for any given hero. Having more cards at your disposal means that you will be able to build stronger and more effective decks., Now that you have a good idea of what cards are available and unlocked, you can see what possible strategies you can use more effectively. For instance you might have wanted to build a high damage deck but have unlocked cards that will create an amazing healer deck. Don’t be afraid to switch up your strategy for building an effective deck.

, You have a good idea of what you want to accomplish. Now it is time to choose a hero. In the deck building screen after you click the New Deck button on the right hand side, a screen will pop up with all the heroes. Click the hero of your choice. This will begin the deck building process., Look at the cards you have available to you with your chosen hero and select cards that complement your strategy. You will want to choose most of your cards from this section. Remember that you can choose more than one of a type of card.

, Once you have chosen all your core cards, look over the neutral cards and fill out your deck with complementary cards. It is easy to overlook cards because this is usually the largest list of cards in your collection. Read each carefully and choose cards that work well with your strategy and the cards you chose from the core class cards.

, You will want to test out your deck against the various other classes in the game before taking on player opponents. This will give you a good idea of how it will fair against the basic strategies of each class. This is important because you will learn the strengths and weaknesses of the deck while also earning experience for your chosen hero.

, After you have spent some time playing in Practice mode, take your deck and put it to the test against players. A suggestion is to play in normal matches and if you do well, then try it in the ranked matches.

, Now that you have a good indication of exactly how well the deck does against players as well as the various other classes, go into the deck creation screen and fine tune it. Examine any new cards you may have gotten during testing and try out new combinations. Repeat the process until you feel comfortable that your deck can handle anything an opponent has to throw at it.

A common strategy is to have a ""solo mid"" hero.,
Each Lane setup should have a reason: Different reasons can be: The carry has to be protected.",How to Play the Perfect DotA Game3," Mid lane is especially good for soloing since both runespots are near and the river can protect a hero from harassment here.
It is possible to have two solo lanes if someone levels up in the forest by killing neutral creeps. This can only be done by heroes with special abilities, i.e. Lycan, Furion, Axe, etc.
A second solo lanes means that probably one hero has to lane against two heroes. Again only some heroes are capable of doing this. Lich is especially good at this.

, This means the late-game carry will be protected by a babysitter.

Ganker heroes commonly have certain skills that enable them to perform this task.,
Ganking also gives rise to ""powerplay""-situations, which enable the destruction of enemy towers.

, Visit Get DotA and click on ""Download"" on the ""Latest Map"" half of the screen. Save the file someplace you have access to it easily.

, The maps folder is located in your game's directory.

, The latest patch will automatically be downloaded when you log in.

, Choose a game from the “Custom Game” list. It should say DotA, then the version, and the various game modes.


The most common game modes include:

""-ap,"" which lets you choose any hero;
""-em,"" which makes the game easier;
""-ar,"" which gives each player a random hero.


If you’re just beginning, you may want to try the random hero choice for a few games so you can familiarize yourself with several of the characters. If you already have a good knowledge of one hero, you’re probably better off choosing that hero. If it is your first game, however, choose an easy hero to play, such as Skeleton King, who has the ""Reincarnation"" ability which will bring him back to life when killed.
To choose a hero, click on one of the buildings you see, or ones in the opposite corner of the map, and you will see a list of all the heroes you can choose from. Select one of these or type ""–random"" to get a random hero.

, Start by finding what type of hero you have: Strength, Intelligence, or Agility. Generally, you can tell what kind of hero you have by looking at which stat is the highest.


You can view the stats by clicking your hero and looking to the right of the unit portrait. Based on this, look through the shops, and buy items that will boost these skills. In the beginning, you should stick to the Female Human's shop or the shop nearest to the fountain, which contains the ""Boots of Speed"" item. The Boots item is absolutely essential to success, as it allows your character to move around more quickly; when in trouble this is exactly what you need. If you’re not very good, you may especially want to stock up on defensive items like Bracers.
Some items combined together make more powerful items. These combinations are called recipes. Later in the game you will start buying recipes, which are found at the other shops. To get these items, you must buy all the items listed in the description. If the recipe does not cost gold, it means that you just need to accumulate the items in the description, and you don't need to buy the recipe itself. A recipe's power is dictated by the shop it is found in. Going from weakest to strongest, these shops are: the Human Peasant shop, Orc Peon shop, Night Elf Wisp shop, and Undead Acolyte shop.
As you progress you will also need to buy items that are more designed for your hero. The best way to find what these items are is to ask other players in the game. However, many players may prove to be of very little help, and might harass you until you get fed up and leave the game. The best idea is to simply ignore such people and persevere until you do not require the help of other players.

, Click the symbol of the Red Cross in your character's menu, look at your skills, and choose the one you think is most useful.

, A lane is the path where the computer controlled monsters, or creeps, will run down and attack all enemies in their path. Try to get into a lane with an ally and follow their example. You will get gold for each creep you kill, and you will automatically get gold over time. (You will get a lot more gold over time in Easy Mode than non-easy mode.) To maximize your gold, don't attack creeps constantly, watch their health gauges carefully and time the last hit to get gold.


When fighting in a lane, the goal is to stay and get experience as much as possible without having to go back to your base and heal. You gain experience points by being in the vicinity of a kill, so you can stand back behind your friendly creeps and then attack the enemy creeps, while your creeps are taking all of the damage.
If you end up alone in a lane, don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are inexperienced and the opponents in your lane are just too good for you, explain to your teammates that you are new, and they will probably help you. You may be able to get somebody to switch lanes with you if your lane is being pushed, or somebody may team up with you in your lane.

, The main problem for beginners in DotA is that they are bit confused about what to do during team battle. There are many playing styles but these are the the most important and commonly known. Other styles will come with the gaming experience.



Ganker. These types of heroes usually have with high HP (hit points) and powerful area spells. They can take a lot of hits and do a lot of damage too. A hero like Axe is one of them.

Carry. These types of heroes are supposed to get killed for the team. They are usually active from the mid game to the end. These heroes have a lot of damaging spells and attacks. Heroes like Phantom Lancer are Carries.

Supportive. These types of heroes are very important in a game. They support the team-mate (especially the Carry) to get kills and not to get killed. Dazzle is an example of a Supportive hero.

Babysitter. This type of playing style is usually required when the Carry is having trouble getting kills. Hence, a Babysitter's duty is to help the Carry get kills until he is able to farm by him.

, Use your skills on heroes to weaken them, and then call for a gank, or gang kill, where your teammate(s) come from behind the enemy hero and you both attack, hopefully killing the enemy. When an enemy is killed, you pick up their gold.

, The towers in the lanes are very powerful; don't mess with your opponent’s towers. Instead, let your creeps damage them little by little. On the other hand, if your hero is weakened, you may be able to stay alive by staying very close to your tower.


Move around a little bit so that you can always stay behind the tower. As enemies approach, they’ll have to deal with the tower instead of you.
If, however, 3 or more heroes or creeps are ganging your tower, move away. You may just need to go back to home base.

, Once you have a good amount of money from killing creeps/heroes, ask your teammates what they recommend you buy. Then go back to your base and buy that item/recipe. The right choice of items for your hero can make the difference between life and death, so don’t just buy things randomly.


Different conditions call for different items. During a group fight, if your team mates are getting killed by a single hero who seems impossible to kill, you might decide to make ""Orchid"" or ""Cyclone"" or ""Hex."" Then you'll be able to buy some time to gather all your friends around the enemy hero and tank him or her.

, Towards the end of the game, you’ll want to earn as much experience (from kills) as possible, so you should try to kill heroes. Of course, you should still kill creeps if you are behind everyone in levels, and if you need money. Remember, DotA is a team game—help your team in any way you can.

, The ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy’s base and their main building (The Frozen Throne or the Tree of Life). As you destroy the enemy’s barracks, your creeps get stronger, so this should also be a priority.

Before you choose a hero, see his strength, agility and intelligence.,
You can choose a hero from these three clans which have agility, strength and intelligence as their special attributes.

,
Now here's a secret, For an agility hero you should increase its agility to max and for an intelligence type you need to increase its intelligence and similarly strength for a strength hero.

,
Now here is something you should know.,
Make a note of all items available in dota and make sure to study them and know what each item does.

,
Get items to increase your mana and Hp regeneration and of course to increase your special attributes.,
Here are some items that you should make for an agility type: boots of speed or arcane boots, butterfly or manta style, ethereal blade and for melee heroes make radiance(optional).,
For an intelligence type you can make: Guinsoo or dagon and aghanims for your ultimate improvement.,
For a strength hero you need to increase Armour,damage and attack speed so make Vanguard, mjolnir, buriza and assault cuirass.

,
Remember to choose items according to the situation, for instance: An enemy hero is on verge of death but it has mini shadow walk(blink) because of which it always escapes out.,
Practice with computer before you go in a real battle with your friends.",How to Play DotA As a Beginner," These three factors are the keys to success.;
,,, For a hero increasing its inherent type by 1 will increase his damage power by 2, and an increase of 7 in his strength will increase his armor by 1. So choose items carefully while keeping these combinations in mind. You can look for these facts in the stats window by hovering your mouse over your stats.

,, Some heroes have very low life in the starting game, so in order to manage your health get Hp items and also items like Tango, bottle or other healing salves to increase your health instantly.

, Get Buriza or Mjolnir to become even more powerful, this actually increases your damage and speed.

, You can also make Shiva's guard to kill the escapees.

,, In this case you need to buy Kelen's dagger to make sure you kill it. You can also use it to escape from ganging or other situations.

, But remember: real games will be quite unpredictable so always be on your toes.

Make a Shovel.,
Make a Pickaxe.,
Make Torches.,
Gather Food and Water.,
Dig deep.,
Avoid making a big room.,
Mine Ores, Coal and Minerals.,

Use Cobblestone to mark your path.,
Make a digging site ASAP.,

Make an entrance and exit.",How to Mine in 7 Days to Die," The Shovel is a tool used for digging the first layer of your mine and destroying ground blocks like dirt. It can be found randomly in the game, or you can craft it. To create a Shovel, you need two types of items: 3 Sticks and 4 Iron Ingots.


After gathering the items, press I to open your craft window and then click Shovel to see the highlighted pattern of the tool you're about to make. You will need to place the materials in the correct spots to create the basic Shovel shape.
At the lower left side of the window, place the 4 Iron ingots into the bottom box (forming a 2x2 box).
Add the sticks horizontally from the upper right of the craft window.;
, The pickaxe is the main tool used to dig deeper layers with tougher blocks made of stones, ores, metal and other minerals. A mere shovel can't break these blocks easily, and trying will just lower its durability. To make a Pickaxe, you need 4 Iron Ingots and 3 Sticks.


Press I to open your craft window; select Pickaxe from the list to activate the highlighted pattern of the tool.
Following the pattern, place the Iron ingot in each box.
Line up the three sticks horizontally over the highlighted pattern.

, Zombies spawn in dark areas, including mine tunnels. It's important that you place a lot of torches in your mineshaft to avoid this. To make a torch, you need 1 Brown Grass or 1 Cloth Fragment and 1 Stick.


Press I and put the Stick in the middle and then add the Brown Grass or Cloth Fragment right above it.
Torches can be placed against the wall or on the floor. Sometimes it doesn't show that it's burning, but rest assured it still generates light.

, While you're underground and digging, your Hunger and Stamina will decrease as time passes so it's important to have enough supplies before you jump into a long excavation.

, Zombies can dig through the ground. To avoid being invaded by Zombies, you will need to dig deep until you can no longer hear anything from the surface.


You can create a ladder for your climb up to the surface, or simply make stairs using the blocks you have from digging.
A good spot for your mineshaft can be in the basement floor inside the house; it will protect you from hordes and giant bugs.

, Mining a huge room, just like in real life, has a chance to cave-in that could possibly kill you. Make sure to leave support pillars; a simple stone block is enough to protect your room from collapsing.

, Use the pickaxe to destroy the blocks and pick up ores, coal and other minerals as you dig. Remember to drink water; a high stamina and low thirst makes your character dig faster which saves a lot of the durability of your tool.

, This alternative way will help you dig easier, saving you from using so much food and water, but using it is riskier as the chance of having a cave-in is quite high. To make TNT, you need 7 Papers, 1 Plant Fiber and 2 Gun Powders.


You can find Plant Fibers around the world. To create a one, you need Yucca Plants and Brown Grass
Paper can be crafted from a book; place it in the center of the craft window. You can find paper in the world too, mostly in rubbish or trash.
To create Gunpowder, place 1 Potassium Nitrate Powder at the center of the craft window then 1 Lump of Coal above. Both items can be found through digging.
Except for crossbow, shooting TNT with any weapon will detonate it. It is recommended that you stand a good distance away from it before detonating since TNT causes a lot of splash damage.

, Mining can get disorienting, so try laying down cobblestone as you go to clearly mark your path in and out. You can then mine off to the sides of the path you created.

, To survive, gather food and water and then jump straight to digging. In multiplayer mode, especially with Friendly Fire switched off, players tend to kill other players to get their loot; ammunition and weaponry will be hard to find. You will last a lot longer if you create a good underground bunker.


Make sure to block up your entrance to avoid other players from discovering your hide out.

, Explosives such as Tin Land Mine and Pipe Bomb are good weapons. You can throw pipe bombs at players or zombies, while the tin land mine is a ground-based explosive which can be strategically placed on any flat surface except water.


Tin Land Mine: You need 1 Scrap Metal, 1 Gunpowder, and 1 Candy Tin Can. To craft, just place the three materials in the middle of the craft window from top to bottom, scrap metal, Gunpowder and candy tin can, respectively.
Pipe Bomb: You only need 1 Plant Fiber, 1 Gunpowder and 1 short Iron Pipe. Short Iron Pipe can be found in air conditioners or can be crafted from Forging Iron. To craft a Pipe Bomb, place the Gunpowder in the very center of the craft window, Plant Fibers above it and the Short Iron Pipe below.

, If you plan on spending a lot of time underground, you should consider having to openings to your mine. While this can be a little more difficult to defend, it can greatly increase your chance of survival if one entrance is blocked.


Use land mines to defend the exit you are least likely to use, and make sure that it is well-disguised.

Buying and selling requires patience, timing, and the ability to know the Aura Kingdom item prices.
The Auction House is best for items that are not rare, as you will not lose out on profits due to the 10% commission.;
, Click the NPC to open the auction window where you can see the list of categories, including the item quality, option for prices, keywords, and level range. The Auction House, AH for short, is used by many players in-game.


If you're planning to have an item listed for auctioning, keep in mind that you will be charged 10% of your listing price upfront. You will not get this money back even if your item doesn't sell, so make sure you're listing at a fair price.
Items in the auction will remain in the list up to 24 hours. If the items are not sold during the time frame, they will return to the owner.

, As mentioned, buying and selling is a good way to earn gold quickly in the game, but you must have the knowledge of the market price to avoid hurting your profit.


To purchase an item, click the Purchase tab, found at the upper-left of the auction window. Choose what item you're going to purchase by clicking the type under the category, then type in the name of the item under the keywords (make sure that the first letter is Capital), and then hit Enter.
You can browse the list by pressing the next button that can be found at the bottom part of the window until you find your desired item. Click on the item and then hit Purchase. The item will go straight to your mail.
Remember to buy low, sell high.

, Open the auction window by clicking the NPC and then pressing “Your Auctions” at the upper-left side of the window. This is where you’ll see the list of items you're selling, the item name, time left, and the price. To sell the item, drag it to the empty box at the upper left of the window or right-click it from your inventory. You have to set the price and make sure you will get a good profit out of it to avoid losing money.


10% of the listed price is paid upfront, and you don't get this money back even if your item doesn't sell.
Confirm all the listing settings by selecting the ""List Item"" button. Your item will be listed for sale and the displayed fee deducted from your current gold; now you have to wait until someone purchases your item.
You cannot sell items that are already character bound. You can check whether the item is bound or not by hovering the cursor over the item.
When an item listed for sale is sold, you will receive a mail with the profits. Click on the letter icon on the bottom left-hand corner of your minimap to open your mail window. Once in the mailbox, click on the letter to open it and the press “Take” to get your gold. The same thing applies for items that aren't sold. Opening the mail will place the unsold item back in your inventory.

Sell items using trade chat.,
Sell items by setting up a stall.",How to Make Money in Aura Kingdom2," In the chat screen, you have probably noticed that people use the trade chat for buying and selling items. Many people choose to use the trade chat channel because you can avoid the 10% Auction House fee by dealing directly with the interested party. This is the best way to sell rare items for maximum profit.


You can also use trade chat as an additional channel to vend off your gears while you're sitting with your stall up. It sometimes work in your favor to pick up items for cheap.
It's important to show your items to your customers in the chat so they can see the added options and stats of the product. To do this, open your inventory, move your cursor over the item, hold the Alt key and click the item. The item will be automatically linked in your trade chat.
If you're going to buy an item from the trade chat, you can click on the item they have linked to see the stat. Message them if you're happy with it, and plan on where to meet to do trading.

, If you go to the market in Navea, you can set up a stall to sell your items out of. Head to Navea City then into the market area. Press B to open your inventory window and then click on the ""Open a Stall"" button. This will bring up a window that resembles the auction selling window.


You get to see the empty box where you put the item and then give a price. Aside from that, you also get to customize the name of your stall for other players to know what you're selling.
To open a personal stall, your character must be at least level 20.
The best way to do this is to use another computer and character to act as your merchant, or simply leave your character on AFK when you're not doing any hunting.
Setting up your own stall allows you to set prices without having to worry about the 10% Auction House commission.

Get to level 65.,
Get good treasure hunting gear.,
Get treasure loots from bosses.,
Conquer dungeons.,
Run the best dungeons to get rare gear.,
Do your daily quests and go fishing.",How to Make Money in Aura Kingdom3," You'll want to be at a high level when you are farming for gold, because this will allow you to enter all of the dungeons in the game instead of just some of them. You can reach level 65 within a week of playing if you maximize your leveling.

, If you're not too keen on buying and selling, the best way to get items you can sell is by looting them from dungeons. Wearing gear with a Loot Rate Drop % increases the chance of obtaining both the quality and quantity of items in each dungeon run. In addition, you can also get a 5% bonus when you join a level 5 guild.


Getting the Loot Drop stat from the Envoy Path also increases the chance and stacks with the percentage of your Loot Drop gear. If you get all the Loot Drop stats, you will get a total of 8% drop increase from Envoy Path alone, so make a good use of it.
Loot Rate Drop % cards can be purchased from the Cash Shop; these also stack with the percentage rate drop from your gear, including the Envoy Path.

, Treasure loots appear every time you kill the last boss of Hell Mode dungeons. There are also chances that treasure loots appear after you get rid of other bosses. These treasure boxes will give you either a normal loot, loyalty points, rare items, and even costumes.


Obtaining better loots from the treasure box is also affected by the loot drop rate you have. If you use a Treasure Charm (will give you higher chance of a good drop every time you kill a boss), boss monsters may give you higher-rank loots, which can be sold for a higher price.
Treasure Charms can be bought from Item Mall using AP and loyalty points. These will increase the number of drops you get from bosses that drop unidentified items. There are three levels of treasure charms, which add 1, 2, or 3 drops.
Treasure Charms can also be obtained randomly from daily fame quests.

, While you're hunting for rare drops from dungeon bosses, keep in mind that dungeon grinding will also give you gold and silvers. Easily put, simply cycle through the Hell-level dungeons of the top 5 dungeons within your server, and then work on the hard versions when you have more time to play.


Conquering dungeons will give you silvers for killing monsters. This alone can earn you a significant amount of money.
You can also sell the green-tiered equipment monster drop at the Auction House for lower prices.
Sell the crafting materials you obtain per dungeon raiding for additional profit.
Bosses also drop materials used for crafting equipment and weapon. If you don't need the materials, sell it for more profit.

, You will want to maximize the gold earned per time played, and to do so you will want to run the most lucrative dungeons. Some of the best dungeons to get rare loot are Miner's Steppe (Hard), Other World: Helonia, Temple of Eidolons, and Other World: Skandia.


These dungeons do not usually give money, but instead give you rare drops that you can sell to other players.

, Doing your level-appropriate daily quest gives you a chance to obtain yellow weapons; these fetch a good price if it possesses 130% rate.


With the new patch, the fishing feature also gives good drops but requires starting capital (for gears and bait). Nevertheless, fishing is a good alternative if you don't have time or are too exhausted to do dungeon raiding.

You can only refine in Navea City.

, Click the name of the item you want to craft in the crafting list; you will be shown the requirements needed for refinement.


You need to have the base equipment, which can be bought from NPCs or found in dungeons. Base weapons used can be either a green weapon or higher to craft better weapons.
If you're still below level 60, it's best to hunt for weapons rather than use gold to buy them for refining, which will be replaced by higher-level weapons in the future.
Gemstones and ores can be mined by using a pickaxe on ore deposits found in various maps. The pickaxe can be bought from a grocer in any town. Refining materials start dropping in level 30 dungeons or can be purchased from the Auction House.

, All the equipment in the list requires refining core. The recipe is already in the refining list, but you need to pay a huge fee to learn it. Once you have learned the recipe, create the item by clicking it, and make sure you have the materials needed.


Click Refine to start creating the core. This too requires a fee.
There are different cores for different categories of items.

, After you have created the core, found a base weapon, and harvested any additional ores and gemstones, you are ready to refine the item. Make sure that you have your materials in your inventory before you start, and then press Refine to start creating the item. Refining also requires a fee.


Check the stats first before refining. You lose the original materials when you refine, so ensure that the refining process will actually benefit you.
The difficult part of refining is having enough gold for the fee. The recipe itself already cost 40–60g, depending on the level.
A refined item will have an additional descriptive word attached to it that will give it a bonus effect.

, Each recipe starts out with an Expertise Rating of D or E. As you use the recipe, the Expertise Rating bar will fill up to reach the next level. Ratings go from grade E to D, to C, and up until grade A.


Grade D rewards 100% of the stats for the item, which means the ratings increase the chance to craft better equipment stats for the item up to 130% ATK Bonus.
The more you refine the same equipment, the more points you gain until the grade level up. The higher the grade, the more chance of obtaining a perfect weapon for your character.

The Cactakara Forest questline involves giant fighting robots, ancient civilizations, and a quirky side-character who gets a change of heart due to your good graces. Each quest has clear conditions, and with the auto-complete function, it would probably just take you a couple hours at the most if you don’t pause to mess around. In lieu of spoilers, the questline ends when a plan of yours falls short, and you’re prompted to head back to Navea.;
, If you just speed-completed the quests, chances are that you may have not met the level conditions. Level 40 is the minimum level requirement to get a subclass. You might have reached Level 40 at this point, but if you haven’t yet, it’s time to kill some monsters! The highest-leveled ones are around the Rarnor Falls, where your last few Quests took place. Sarpas and Caustic Sarpas are around level 40, which makes them perfect to grind for your EXP needs.


You can also tackle Daily Quests from NPCs, missions from the Mission Boards in town, or even use the Monster XP Books you most likely found or received while exploring.

, Once at level 40, it’s time to head back to Navea. You most likely remember it from the end of the Crescent Hill questline. The easiest route to Navea is by going to a nearby Warp Portal. It’s a pagoda-like structure with a decorated teardrop-shaped blue crystal floating above it. Click the large floating crystal and you’ll see a selection of places to go to. At the very top is Navea; click the city name.


Warp Portals can be found on the world map as a blue wing icon in a white circle.
If you still have some errands to run in Crescent Hill or fancy the long route, head back to Brevis. Go through the portal to Crescent Hill, then when you’re ready, just head on northwest until you see the giant walls and gate.

, Navea is a huge sprawling city, so it’s easy to get lost if you didn’t spend some time exploring the place earlier on. Head to the northwest section of the city. Use the map on the upper right of the screen to navigate until you see the huge building, then enter the portal in the front of the large doors.


You can also take the portal to the church instead. It’s found in the Trade District, just directly east of the fountain. It’s a circle on the ground with a glowing gold symbol floating above it, and if you’re close enough, it has the label “Portal to Church.”

, Report to the Bishop to fulfill the Quest conditions. After receiving the reward, you get to read some more exposition about the story and the setting of Aura Kingdom. He’ll then prompt you to head to Andre.

, It’s the huge courtyard around east of the church, and when you enter it, you’ll see loads of knight NPCs training in the grounds. Look north from the gate, and you’ll see a huge building, a wide set of stairs, and a quest marker! Go up the stairs, and get hit by a wave of familiarity as you speak to Andre, the lead Templar himself!

, He’ll say some admittedly unflattering things about you, but after a while, you both get into the meat of the conversation: training you to wield a secondary weapon, otherwise known as a Subclass! A short cutscene will trigger afterwards, but when that’s over, you can finally get yourself a Subclass!

, You have free choice between the classes, but certain classes have skills for you to unlock with your main class. For Guardian, you can find the Duelist (Dual Blades), Ranger (Bow), and Ravager (Axe) have some skills you can unlock. They’re unlocked in your Envoy’s Path, so feel free to mess around with it and take the skills you need!

Find a player to marry.,
Find a Shrine of Mara.,
Initiate the Ritual of Mara.,
Wear the Ring of Mara.",How to Get Married in Elder Scrolls Online," To marry another player, either you or the player you are going to marry must own the Imperial Edition. Alternatively either player could purchase the Imperial Edition Upgrade, which counts as a DLC add-on to the standard edition of the game.;
, Getting married is a two-sided process. You can marry absolutely any species and gender, although they must be from the same faction as you. You’ll need to find another player, either by meeting them in the world of Tamriel, or via somebody you know in real life who also plays the game. The player you would like to marry will have to follow you through the rest of the marriage process.

, There are a number of Shrines of Mara located around Tamriel. You’ll need to be in close proximity of a shrine to initiate the marriage ritual. There is a shrine in each starting town that players enter after completing the Wailing Prison tutorial zone. The second shrine is located in the second major city players will come across after leaving the tutorial. Each faction has two Shrines of Mara, which can be found in the locations below.


Dominion: Vulkhel Guard, Auridon and Elden Root, Grahtwood
Covenant: Daggerfall, Glenumbra and Wayrest, Stormhaven
Pact: Davon’s Watch, Stonefalls and Mournhold, Deshaan

, By purchasing the Imperial Edition, you’ll be rewarded with an item called the Pledge of Mara. This item can be used to initiate the Ritual of Mara with another player whilst standing near a Shrine of Mara. Once you and your partner-to-be are standing in front of a Shrine of Mara, the player who owns the Pledge of Mara can place their crosshair on the other player and use the “E” key (PC), “A” button (Xbox), or “X” button (PS4) to begin the ritual. The next player must then press the accept button that appears on a pop-up prompt after the ritual has begun.

, Once accepted, both players will perform a marriage animation. After the animation is completed, the Ring of Mara will be added to each player’s inventory. Players are now married, but they can equip the Ring of Mara at any time to activate the 10% experience bonus. This bonus will only be applied when both players are in a group and are wearing the ring. Interestingly, you can be married to up to two people but only if the two people send you the marriage request. In any other case, only one marriage is possible. Unfortunately a divorce option is not available, so remember that a marriage in ESO truly is for life!

Find your suitable mouse sensitivity.",How to Get Lots of Kills in PlanetSide 2," Picking and focusing on one favourite class will allow you to master all of the class's aspects and different weapons. With this approach, you can gain a certain understanding of their respective abilities, finding something that suits your gaming style, rather than bouncing around from class to class. The available classes are:


Light Assault
Heavy Assault
Combat Medic
Infiltrator
Engineer
MAX;
, How you play will depend a great deal on your environment:


When in the open, play using RPGs, tanks , aircraft and sniper rifles (long range weapons ).
In close quarters, light assaults can be used to flank enemies. Heavy assaults with their over-shields activated are guaranteed to win most one-on-one battles.
You can use engineers to place turrets at key locations, like a door, to get a huge number of kills (provided someone watches your back).

, Having teammates in all different classes will benefit everyone.


Medics can revive and heal you.
Engineers can resupply your ammo.
Infiltrators can keep you safe from a distance.
Light assaults can cover your flanks and provide suppressing fire.

, Using vehicles can be extremely profitable and you should learn how to make good use of them. A perfect place for you to do that is the VR map, where you can test all weapons .

, This will help you re-acquire the feel of the game before you launch yourself into a 300 men battle., Most people set their sensitivity too high resulting in a lack of aiming. A good default would be that a 360 turn takes about 20-30cm movement of your mouse.

You should also familiarise yourself with in-game terms, weapons, tactics and so forth.;
, Get to know how strong you need to be to kill a monster. For example, in the game Runescape, a character can be level 82 and beat a level 100 monster. Always fight the strongest monster you can beet. This will maximise the amount of experience points you receive.

, You can grind monster in a particular area, you can raid bosses or you can even fight real players (PVP). In some games you even gain XP by doing peaceful stuff like cooking and fishing!

, Not training regularly will hinder you from advancing in the game. Set aside a little time to train f. ex. your combos..

, In all MMORPGs there is a currency (most often cases gold) used to purchase items within the game. These items can be weapons, armor, potions, mounts, pets etc. Buying better gear enables you to fight tougher enemies.

, In many games, there tend to be prize fluctuations. For example, If there are too many similar items on the market, prizes tend to lower. When the items quantity lower during other times, the prize of course lowers.

, You don't want to miss out on special in-game events. You have a chance to get something that can later be extremely valuable.

, This makes level grinding much more enjoyable. You can go from a level 50 to 60 without even noticing it! Time flies when your having fun as they say! Some games even have clans and friend list. So use it to your advantage!

You can also use Monster XP Books, normally acquired by completing quests of all kinds or by buying it in the online store with real money.;

, Head to the church, which is found in the northernmost area of city. You can also take the portal to the church instead of walking. It’s found in the Trade District, just directly east of the fountain. It’s a circle on the ground with a glowing gold symbol floating above it, and it takes you just south of the church itself.

, After you enter the church, go up to the Bishop and click him. Press “Continue” in the dialogue options as he reveals some more storyline exposition, and wait until he prompts you with a quest. Accept the quest, then leave the church.

, After the enlightening conversation with the Bishop, head to the Barracks, which is at the far northwest of town near the church. Look for Andre up the steps of the building.

Hunt for King fish.",How to Fish in Aura Kingdom," Fishing rods hold different stats while some require a higher tier for you to use them. You can buy fishing rods from Anglers Anonymous Merchants such as Ken in Navea (X: 274, Y: 404) or Alyssa in Ventos (X: 468, Y: 202).


Only basic rods are available for purchase. You can find advanced rods in crates you can receive while fishing.
You can get basic fishing equipment for free by completing Fishing Quests.;
, Different fish require different types of bait. Each fish drops different items, such as fishing equipment and even rare costumes. You can buy bait from Anglers Anonymous Merchants. You can see which type of bait you need for the fish you want by looking at the fish's description.


White bait costs 18 silver. You will be able to catch White and Blue fish with White bait.
Blue bait costs 35 silver. You will be able to catch Green fish with the correct Blue Bait.
Green bait costs 67 silver. You will be able to catch Orange fish with the correct Green Bait.
Orange bait can only be found or received as a quest reward. By doing your daily fish quests, you may receive orange bait as reward. If you have enough tokens, you can buy the bait from the fish merchant for 50 tokens, or you can simply fish for orange fish. They sometimes give orange baits as drop.
Doing fishing quests will also reward you with rare baits.

, This is optional for lower-level fishing, but is absolutely essential when going after the bigger fish. There are a variety of different styles and Tiers of fishing equipment, and they all provide bonuses to fishing specific types of fish.


Fishing equipment also increases your gear’s durability, line strength, reeling speed, rod strength, and decreases the stamina of prey.

, If you don't know where the fishing spots are in the map, open your map by pressing M and then look for the white fish icon.


Different maps in the game give different levels and types of fish. The higher the level of the map, the tougher and higher tier equipment needed to fish.
If you plan on fishing at a level 45+ map, it's advisable that you get a better fishing rod, bait, and equipment.

, After choosing a fishing spot, head to it and stand on dry land or shallow water. Click on the Fishing icon in the water to throw out your line. A circular window will appear on your screen with an image of a fishing line. There are three different fishing modes available:


Passive - This is the default fishing mode. As soon as you cast out your line, your character goes into Passive mode, and will automatically pull in fish until you are either out of bait or your inventory is full. This is great for farming equipment such as the Green fishing set. You cannot catch Orange fish in passive mode.
Active - In this mode, you control your rod. To do this, once a fish takes your bait, click the fish icon in the circular window to start reeling. See the next Step for details on how to fish in Active mode. Active Mode is time-consuming and has a greater possibility of bandits appearing.
Semi-Active - In this mode, you will control your rod whenever you desire. For instance, if your indicator shows that a weak fish caught your bait, you can leave it to passive. If the indicator tells you that you caught a powerful fish, you can take control to successfully catch it. This mode is still time-consuming, and bandits may still spawn.

, This is the only way to catch valuable Orange fish, so it pays to start practicing early. The goal is to keep the moving bar in the blue area to avoid damaging the durability of your rod. There are a few things to keep your eye on during Active fishing:


Target Durability - This is the fish's ""health"". When the bar empties, the fish is caught.
Fishing Equipment Durability - This is your ""health"". When the bar empties, your line will break and the fish will get away.
Fishing window - This is where you click to start Active fishing, and displays an image of the fish in the water. Click here to reel the fish in.
Fish slider - This is located to the right of the Fishing window. As you fight the fish, the slider will move to the left and right. Clicking and holding in the Fishing window will move the slider to the left, releasing it will move it to the right. Try to keep it in the Blue section to lower the Target Durability. Both the Red and Orange sections will lower your Equipment Durability, and the Orange section will heal the fish.

, Fishing while in a party will double the tokens gained. It's advisable that you have only one other player in a party to avoid killing each other's Bandit spawn. Bandit spawn gives you tokens that can be used to buy lucky bags.

, When you're just starting out, you'll only have some basic fishing gear. While you can use this to start catching fish, you'll want to upgrade quickly in order to get the good stuff. An easy way to get these upgrades is to AFK fish using the Passive method.


Purchase about 500 Blue worms as bait.
Clear out your inventory. You'll want as much space as possible before you start AFK fishing, as you'll stop as soon as your inventory is full.
Start fishing. Your goal is to get as many Blue boxes as possible. These can contain Green fishing gear, which will give you a significant boost in stats.

, When you're active fishing, bandits will occasionally appear when you catch larger fish.


Penguin Bandit - This purple-colored Bandit spawns whenever you catch a big Green fish. When killed, Penguin Bandit will drop a token that you can trade in Navea. A Lucky Bag from a Penguin Bandit will give you a chance to obtain a Tier 2 Penguin Bandit set or Orange ingredients.
Nymphet - This pink-colored Bandit appears whenever you capture an orange fish. Once killed, Nymphets will drop tokens that you can trade for a lucky bag. Lucky bags from Nymphets contain yellow ingredients and a Tier 3 Nymphet set.
Nebuchadnezzar - This blue-colored Bandit spawns whenever you capture the legendary King Fish. Once killed, it will drop tokens that can be used to purchase a Lucky Bag containing a couple of yellow ingredients and a Tier 4 Nebuchadnezzar set.

, To increase your fishing stat, you need a proper fishing gear, which can greatly help you in capturing King fish. To successfully choose a good stat for your character, you need to understand their uses.


Line - Line stats determine the safety zone of your reeling bar. Fishing gear with high Line makes your blue safety zone in the slider wider.
Rod - All fish have strength; the higher the strength they have, the longer it takes to have their Durability reduced to 0. Fishing gear with high Rod stats shorten the time needed. It's advisable that your Rod stat be at least 10 points higher than the King Fish's strength.
Reel - Fishing gear with high Reel gives you control to the movement of the bobber, which is good against fish with high speed. If you're going to capture King Fish, make sure that your Reel stat is much higher compared to your prey. The hardest King Fish to catch is the Crystal Lobster since it possesses a speed of 610.

, The King Fish is a legendary fish in Aura Kingdom. Hunting it is a global event where any players can participate as long as they have a high-tier fishing set and the required bait to capture the fish. Most King Fish baits are acquired by doing daily fishing quests or can be purchased from the Fishing NPC using your tokens. When the King Fish event is active, a yellow fish icon will appear on your map, indicating the King Fish's location.

Always be creating villagers.,
Learn how to develop your economy in a normal match.,
With regards to your scout cavalry, it is important to scout during the Dark Age.",How to Win in Wonder Race in Age of Empires 21," Not only should you be doing this during a conquest match, it is especially important that you do it in this mode, because the villagers are going to make up your entire population (with the exception of the scout cavalry). If at any moment that your town center(s) aren't creating villagers, you are not playing the game right.;
, This is crucial in order to win. Conquest (normal) is generally the easiest and the most common mode to play. The ability to beat a hard computer 1 vs 1 will greatly improve your chances of winning in Wonder Race.


You should follow the steps in that article for the Dark Age and the Feudal Age. Thus, this article will pick up with the Castle Age.






During the Feudal Age, you should build a blacksmith and a market. However, since a blacksmith only has military upgrades, you shouldn't bother with it after you have built it.






Additionally, you should use your market to trade resources. Do recognize limits, as trading too much is not wise.







, It is this time that you should be searching for your various food sources, most importantly sheep and boars. However, since scouting is primarily used to know where and what your enemy has, you may disregard your scout during the Castle Age. You should still assign a hotkey to it, e.g. Ctrl-1, for later use (see step 2 of the below section).

"
"
Create villagers.,
Scout out with the 3 beginning and scout to find your sheep as fast as possible.,
Here as an approx build list: Villager 1 - food, Villager 2 - food, Villager 3 - food, Villager 4 - food, Villager 5 - food, Villager 6 - food, Villager 7- lumber camp, Villager 8 - wood, Villager 9 - wood, Villager 10 -Lure boar, Villager 11 - Build a mill, Villager 12- berries, Villager 13 - berries, Villager 14 - lure boar, Villager 15 - berries, Villager 16 - wood, Villager 17 - wood, Villager 18 - food, Villager 19 - food, Villager 20 - food, Villager 21 - food.,
Explore with your scout.,
Create villagers as soon as the chance comes by.,
Research Loom when you need to.",How to Win in Age of Empires II1," Villagers are key to a great economy. Villagers gather resources which can be used to build, create, and research stuff later on in the game. The trick is to have enough villagers to support what you are trying to accomplish at the time.;
, These sheep should then be moved under the town center so the villagers have an instant drop off point and don't need to run to drop the food off. Six villagers is the optimum to have on sheep at any one time. It will insure constant villager production. You should now use the next created villager to build a lumber camp and the next 2 villagers should go there too. The berries should be close to the town center, the next 2 villagers should be sent to berries as well for a total of 4. You then want to send some more villagers to wood and a few more to sheep, remember to create one or two far before you click to feudal.

, Here is it explained a little better in a condensed video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtukDHXy9GU&list=PL891DE10D2EFEA2E6
, Number him 1 by pressing Ctrl + 1. That way, you can quickly go to him by simply pressing the 1 key. Start by exploring the black areas around the explored area. Since you need to know the map, the scout is vital. Start by scouting around your base in a circle then when you have found everything you need, 6+ sheep, gold, stone and at least one decent lumber site start scouting for your opponent, a good starting point is directly across from you.

, You shouldn't drop villager production unless you are going full aggressive, or have 120 villagers (In 200 pop)

, A good player won't research loom until he is about to go feudal. However, if you don't have the food to create a villager it can be a good time to do loom. Also if your boar is far away, or the game is laggy it can be a good idea to get loom before you lure it.

Watch for the terrain. A Town Center is one of those buildings that require flat land for the plot of land it takes up, and many land maps just simply don't have flat terrain all the time. In fact, you will find that the terrain pops up in otherwise ideal places to put your Town Center.






Additionally, don't waste too much time searching for a place to put your Town Center. If you can only put it near a forest, or a gold mine, that's okay, as long as it is near at least one resource. The main point of the Town Center is to create more villagers at a faster pace. Placing it near resources just makes it more efficient for the villagers that deposit their resources at the Town Center.






Once your second Town Center has been built, build more Town Centers during the Castle Age - at least one more. Remember: you should always, always be creating more villagers! But also realize that it is not always wise to deplete all your food into villager creation. As long as a few villagers are in the queue, you are fine.







, Houses are needed to support your villager population. If at any time you have reached your temporary population limit, you can kill your scout cavalry to make room for one more villager. This also allows more time for your villagers (preferably lumberjacks, never farmers) to build a few more houses. This is a one-time use.

, The technologies are found at the Mill, Lumber Camp, and Mining Camp, respectively. Heavy Plow makes your farms last longer. Bow Saw increases the lumberjacks' efficiency in cutting wood, and eases the reseeding queue a bit.


If you have the resources and at least two mining camps, you can research Gold and Stone Mining at the same time. Gold and Stone Shaft Mining will be available to you in the Castle Age. Don't research them yet; allocate your resources elsewhere. When you have a lot of resources, you should research Gold Shaft Mining, and then Stone Shaft Mining.






Also research Wheelbarrow in your first Town Center, if you have the resources. This is optional for now, but you should have it researched by the time you research Imperial Age. Handcart will be available after researching - do not research it yet.







,

Again, military should be left out of the game. Any military buildings (except the blacksmith) or units created are resources wasted that could have been better used to improve your economy.






Build more farms around your other Town Centers. Also build farms around your mill (unlike other modes, this is recommended as the villagers are safe). Have your villagers chop wood near your new Town Centers. Allocate villagers to mine gold and stone (gold especially, as you need 800 gold for the Imperial Age).






Building more and more farms is extremely important, but it is for your benefit to reseed in the mill to avoid having to manually reseed farms.







,

In conquest mode, wood becomes less and less important as the game goes on, due to the increasingly important gold, as well as food. This is not the case in wonder race.






Since there is no military in this mode, do not build a castle! The stone should be saved and used for the wonder. Instead, build a university and monastery, the cheapest (375 wood total) way to satisfy the building requirements. None of the buildings have to be placed anywhere strategic, as long as it doesn't hinder your resource harnessing.






None of the upgrades in the university is helpful, so don't research anything there.






Do not create monks either. Monks cost gold, which is crucial for the 800 gold for the Imperial Age and the 1000 gold for the wonder. Monks can pick up relics, but relics are a slow-steady way of collecting gold. The cost of the monks (100 gold each), coupled with their slow walking speed, makes it not worth the investment.







, Research the Imperial Age using your first Town Center (as the land will have already been developed).


Brute forcing is discouraged. This is due to the idea of (at least nearly) having the required resources to build the wonder once you reach the Imperial Age. If you trade resources just to get the required resources for the Imperial Age research, then you will fall behind. The idea is similar to the Feudal Age. Just as you want a quick Feudal Age, you will want as short time as possible between hitting Imperial Age and starting to build your wonder.






During Imperial Age research, research Handcart. Allocate some villagers (that are still being created in your town centers) to gold, as well as stone.







Important: Around 30 seconds after reaching the Imperial Age, you should have 1000 of wood, gold and stone to build the wonder. It's okay if you have to wait longer, it takes practice.







"
"
Continue to create a few more villagers.,
Don't upgrade.,
Build the wonder!",How to Win in Wonder Race in Age of Empires 23," Your villager population should be exceeding 80, ideally reaching 100. Roughly 30 should be on gold, 25 on wood, 20 on stone, and 25 on food. As food isn't one of the requirements for the wonder, you can create as many villagers as you would like to (not that many of them are going to be particularly useful).

, Since the objective one you get into the Imperial Age is to get 1000 of wood, gold, and stone, upgrading of any kind is discouraged.

The point of upgrading is to provide a long-term advantage for your villagers. The villagers work more efficiently, but it does not easily provide a short-term solution to any resource shortage. Because the wonder needs to be built as soon as possible, as the game goes on, upgrading becomes less and less effective.







, Have as many of your villagers build the wonder. There is enough space so that about 40-50 villagers are able to build it simultaneously. If a bunch of villagers are just standing there, unable to find space where there is some, select them and click next to the place where there still is space. Your other villagers can do whatever they would like to. Double click any villager in the middle of your city to select the most villagers at once.


There is nothing else to do other than wait for your villagers to complete the wonder and to hope that you build it first (in a close race)!

Create more villagers and add 2 to wood and 1 or 2 to forage bushes.,
Build a blacksmith and/or market.,
Research Horse Collar (in the mill) and Double-Bit Axe (in the lumber camp).,
Create 2 more villagers.,
Build a mining camp near gold, not stone.,By now, you should have
At least 15 villagers
A scout
At least 650 food
Mill
Lumber camp
Mining camp
At least 100 wood
At least 200 gold
200 stone
Blacksmith
Market
Loom, Horse Collar, and Double-bit Axe researched

,
Wait until you have 800 food.",How to Win in Age of Empires II2," The sheep should have run out by now,so you can start to explore the other places including the enemy and your allies. You should now have at least 4 people on wood by now.

, Blacksmiths cost 150 wood each, and markets cost 175 wood each. The thing is that markets are slower to build, and blacksmiths has a lot of upgrades for the military later on that you can use.

, They are good upgrades for the economy.

, Build a farm after you build the market. Farms cost 60 wood and cost 60 wood to reseed. It is better once you hunt deer somewhere farther away from the town center. Each deer stocks up to 140 food, and there should be at least 4 of 'em there.

, You don't need stone in the Feudal Age, so get gold. Have 2 villagers go on gold. You need 100 more gold to advance to the Castle Age. The Feudal Age should only take about 7 or 8 minutes. You need 800 food, 200 gold, and a blacksmith and a market to advance to the Castle Age. If you have extra wood, build a barracks farther to the enemy. On top of a cliff is best because infantry can't get up there by climbing.

,, Then you can advance to the Castle Age. Keep exploring with your scout. By now, you should have at least 50% of the map explored (unless you are playing with a normal, large, or giant map).

"
"
Immediately research Heavy Plow and Bow Saw.,
Build a Monastery and a University.,
Build up your military.,
Make the infantry in one group, the archers in another, the cavalry in another, and the siege units in another group.,
Do the economy stuff before the military stuff.",How to Win in Age of Empires II3," If you do not have enough resources, then you will have to wait. Also, research other stuff that are good to, like Gold Mining and Stone Mining (Stone Mining should be researched later unless you want a castle as the ""2"" buildings).

, Universities should be built first because they have fairly priced but powerful upgrades. Monasteries should be built later in the game unless you are planning a siege in the early Castle Age. Continue to create villagers, and research Wheelbarrow or Town Watch (Wheelbarrow may be too expensive, but do not use your food on Town Watch of you have less than 100 food). You must build another Town Center though. More villagers = more resources = better military = better chance that you will crush your opponents.

, Build a Barracks, Archery Range, Stable, Siege Workshop, and other buildings. The order is listed below.
Barracks
Stable
Siege Workshop
Archery Range
, You should have 4 military groups. Continue to build up your military slowly, but DO NOT FORGET ABOUT YOUR ECONOMY!!! If you forget about it, you will not have enough resources to build up your military, well...you will lose. Keep creating more villagers until you think the mark reaches 50 for villagers and 50 for military units (15 infantry, 15 archers, 15 cavalry, and 5 siege units).

, This will make it easier, as the economy will boost, leaving you with many resources for the military. When you reach 1000 food, 800 gold, and a castle or 2 Castle Age buildings, you can choose to advance to the Imperial Age and continue to work on your military for an easier win. Or, you can lead your military of 50 troops (it is actually a lot in this game) and destroy everyone. You should advance to the Imperial Age if there are more than 2 enemies, and just attack if there are 2 or less enemies. If you are planning to do the military attack, go ahead and crush everyone. If not, here is what you do in the Imperial Age.

"
"
Research all the important stuff like Crop Rotation, Two-Man Saw, Stone/Gold Shaft Mining, and other stuff that are important.,
Continue to create villagers.",How to Win in Age of Empires II4," Research your unique techs in the castle because no other civilization has the unique techs you have. If your enemy has many buildings, it is best to rap up 1 or 2 trebuchets until you attack.

, You should at least have about 80 villagers. Create 20 more (don't worry; you do not have to do it all in one time) 5 at a time. When you reach 100 villagers, all you should be concentrating on is the military. Reseed farms as usual, and rap up your military. Create many units so that you have 50 infantry, 25 archers, 20 cavalry, and 5 siege units. If you are playing the Goths, you have a +10 population which means you can fill in 5 more villagers and some trebuchets. Now, with 100 (or 105) units, go crush your opponents as you've never done it before!!!

"
"
Have all villagers that you start with collect food from sheep or berry bushes.,
Use your scout to look around your area for additional resources.,
Once you run out of food resources, have all five food villagers build a mill near your town centre.,
Advance to the next age.

",How to Win in Age of Empires II5," Produce as many villagers as you can. Once you create your first villager, make him build a house then set him on food.

, Once you have five villagers on food, get five on wood so that you have ten villagers altogether.

, Once they are done, have each of those villagers build a farm and add five farms to the mill queue. Have your wood villagers build a lumber camp near a large forest and get wood. Get two more villagers for constructing buildings and have those two build a barracks and dock if needed.

Know your ways of winning.,
Gather many resources in the beginning.,
Put your town center in a strategic and hidden location.,
Age up as much as you can.,
Use shipments often.,
Pick a good commander.",How to Win Age of Empires 3," There are two ways you can do so:


Victory by resignation. This is when your opponent resigns from the game (usually when you force him/her to resign because he/she does not feel able to win the game anymore).






Victory by elimination. This is when you destroy all your opponents' units and most buildings. You automatically win when the game determines that there is no way for your opponent to win.





;
, You will need lots of resources later on in the game, and most sources will be depleted by then.

, Since your town center is the only thing that can produce settlers, you need to put them in locations that offer good defence.


In the New England map, there are lots of stone barriers, which can be helpful in protecting your town center.






Clumps of trees are particularly good not only because it is hidden, but units cannot move through thick woods.







, This will offer you many more units, buildings, and shipments from home. They can even send you upgrades.

, These can offer valuable things that you can not get in the game such as forts and factories. You need to wait to get a shipment, so use them wisely.

, Some offer better units than other. Generally, the Spanish is easiest and Ottoman is the hardest.

",How to Play As Ottoman in Age of Empires III2,", As soon as they gather 800 foods, advance to the second age.

, Build 10 houses, an artillery foundry, and a barrack. Your settler count now would be around 20, as you get a free settler for every house built.

, Food is required faster than coin to build an army, wood is not that important, as both grenadier and musketeer do not require them.

,, These guys are very good at bringing the buildings down to ground. And gather as many musketeers as possible because Napoleon is very good at building an army.

, If he reaches the third age, then he will be getting more upgrades for his army and you can expect cannons also.

, Press Ctrl+1, and in the same way select your entire musketeer and press Ctrl+2. From here on, you can press 1 to select grenadiers and 2 for musketeers.

, If you want to attack his enemy soldiers, you can press 2 (don’t go for attacking soldiers with grenadiers because they are slow and vulnerable). Attack enemy buildings with grenadier by pressing 1.

Provide resources to your teammates in specific situations.,
Support your teammates with troops.,
Send your troops quickly!,
When your teammate got nearly defeated, send him resources or just some military so he can rebuild the most important things.,
Use the communication system; it is very important for defense and especially for offense.

",How to Support a Teammate in Age of Empires," There aren't many players who request resources because you should be able to get them by yourself. But sometimes they need your help because they get attacked by two enemies at the same time or if they could kill somebody but just need some resources to make the final move. Give them the requested resources when:


You don't need them to defend yourself






You see a reason in giving them resources






They could help you out with something






You have an overflow of the requested resource and really don't need it.





;
, If your teammate gets attacked it is always good to send some troops. It's very important that you think about your own safety. Some good players make fake-attacks where they send a small troop to one enemy so all the troops move there, so they can force all their strength on the other opponent and destroy him because he has no defense anymore. So always ask yourself: Am I safe when I send those troops there?

, Don't think about it; just send them there. When you wait too long, it's already too late and you never know if the enemies attack again after their troops got defeated. Try to attack the enemies' troops from behind so they have to fight on two fronts. Mostly the cannons stand at the back, so you can easily destroy them from behind. While your troops are fighting, build new units to bring them in or to prepare for a counterattack.

, When both enemies attacked, go for a counterattack. Try to hold the pressure and communicate with your teammate. When both attack at the same spot it is never as effective as when you attack from different directions.

Much of the information on making your economy boom should be applied while you are playing as the Goths.;
, The barracks doesn't need to be placed anywhere strategic, as you will be building many more. The creation of militia during the research and during the Feudal Age should be avoided due to the high costs. Infantry become much cheaper during the Castle and Imperial Ages.

Build a castle.",How to Play As the Goths in Age of Empires 23," Also research Tracking and Squires if you can afford the 200 food. These technologies are found at the barracks. It is advised that you research Pikemen as well.


At the blacksmith, research Forging and Scale Mail Armor. The Castle blacksmith upgrades are offered, but advancing to the Imperial Age is a higher priority.

, You do not need to build any other military buildings other than the barracks, castle, and perhaps some siege workshops if you wish. The barracks should all have one common rally point and be built near the enemy base in a row.

, At least 10 Pikemen should be created in order to mitigate the Knight threat, which dominates in the Castle Age.

, Another castle or two is encouraged due to its +20 population increase.


Research Anarchy. The unique technology is critical to the Goths' attack as it allows Huskarls to be created in the barracks - very useful, because castles are expensive and stone is generally not found in abundant quantities in the game.
Build a university. Universities have some defensive upgrades like Masonry and Architecture that increases building HP. This helps a little bit with the Goth's mediocre defense.

"
"
If you haven't already, continue to build the row of 10-12 barracks near your enemy base.,
Research Conscription, Perfusion and Elite Huskarl in the castle.,
Spam Huskarls.,
Attack your enemies!",How to Play As the Goths in Age of Empires 24," It is important that these not be built near your base. The walking distance is very time-wasting, the location is passive, and the possibility that you become stuck on the defensive becomes much greater.


In the barracks, research Two-Handed Swordsmen and Champion.
Continue to research Iron Casting, Blast Furnace, Chain Mail Armor, and Plate Mail Armor in the blacksmith. The upgrades may not seem like much, but when attacking in such large numbers, it makes a difference.

, Perfusion is what makes the Goths shine. Barracks units are created 50% faster. Along with Conscription, which makes all military units be created 33% faster, and their team bonus which allows units to be created 20% faster, the creation of Huskarls in the barracks becomes lightning-fast.


Do make sure that you are able to keep up Huskarl production with houses. When a row of 10-12 barracks and fully upgraded barracks and castles produces Huskarls at such fast rates, a team of 6 villagers building houses one at a time becomes far too slow. You must make sure that the population cap does not hinder your spamming.
Once you have destroyed one of your enemies, you should create more barracks against other enemies (if you aren't playing in a 1 vs 1). The other barracks should still be pumping out Huskarls until you reach the 210 population limit.

, Huskarls have strong attack and have a bonus against buildings. But along with that and its fast speed, Huskarls have substantial pierce armor, which makes them almost immune to arrows. They are more expensive to produce than Champions, but Champions do not have the +6 default pierce armor that Huskarls have.


Because of their pierce armor, Huskarls are unusually well-equipped to bring down castles. Champions get the job done as well, but are more susceptible to the Castle's arrows. Usually, other infantry are slaughtered in large numbers.
Champions can be spammed as well if you are getting low on resources. They have a slightly greater attack than Huskarls.
Trebuchets, while almost required for other civilizations, have a lesser priority than the Huskarls. The main point of Trebuchets is to bring down difficult-to-reach or heavily fortified buildings. However, if your opponent is heavily fortified with walls, Trebuchets should be created. Other siege weapons can be created if you wish, but the advantage of the Huskarl's speed is negated when they are traveling together with the siege units.
It is recommended that you set your army to staggered formation in order to reduce the splash damage by Mangonels and Scorpions.

, Set your army to aggressive (if it hasn't - aggressive is the default) and send your troops to attack castles, town centers, military buildings, monasteries, and most importantly, villagers. Armies in Age of Empires II can consist of a maximum of 40 troops.


Remember, you must always constantly be on the offensive. During the Imperial Age, if for any moment that you are not attacking an enemy with your army, you are not taking advantage of the Goths' superior infantry!

Map awareness and map control is the key.",How to Get Better at DOTA (Defense of the Ancients)," It doesn't matter what you do, whether it is to watch replays, read guides, or hire a pro to give you lessons (led, than you should play as much as you can.;
, You can learn a lot from them, and also play games as team mates. You always have an advantage if you know your team mates and your opponents don't know each other.

, Today there are many DotA guides out there, targeting from new/noob players to experienced players. There are lane control guides, hero guides, hero counter guides, overall guides, and much more.

, You can still ""fight back"" if someone insults you, since they will not likely become your friends =P.

, Juking is one of the most useful skills you might ever learn in Dota. A good juking guide is found within the Lane Control guide above.

, Last hitting normal creeps usually gives you 40 or 50 extra gold. Last hitting simply means giving that final blow on a weakened creep. Denying reduces the exp your opponent will get for the dead creep. Denying means last hitting a creep of your own team, and to attack a creep of your own team, it must be below half of its hp (you usually want to hit it when it's red though).

, Hero denying is a very skillful move, but effective if successful. Hero denying means killing your own hero or a team mates' hero, in order to prevent your opponent from getting exp. You need a good deal of judgement though, since it's better for you friend or yourself to live on then die. Further Hero denying information can be found in the Lane Control guide. A form of denying more common than hero denying is tower denying. To tower deny, the tower's hp has to be red. You want to wait as long as you can to tower deny.

, This is a guide to improve your dota skills, not to healthily improve your dota skills. The more you play, the better you'll get, on any game or on any other thing that involves skills.

, Be aware of other heroes positioning at all times. Put wards in jungle or in rune spots where you can have vision for areas in fog to avoid any ganks being made on you or your team mates.

Choose what large item to make.",How to Demolish Enemies with Bloodseeker in DOTA," Bloodseeker, or ""BS"" as DOTA players like to call him, is primarily an ""agility hero."" His main attribute is agility, so you will never have to worry about ""low attack speed or damage"" with this hero. This ability is also passive, which is a huge advantage during gameplay.


You will be able to pick out every hero on the map with low health and, with the help of extra speed and damage provided by Bloodthirst, chase and kill them.;
, For your starting items, take a ""Quelling Blade"" and ""Tangoes"". Bloodbath will help to keep your health up and the only hard part is getting last hits on enemy creeps. The Quelling Blade will help you with that and you will have to do some practice on your own as well.


Not only does the ability provide effective health regain, it gives you a good damage boost which can be very helpful towards getting early kills.

, This ability marks a large area in blood and this mark expires after a few seconds, causing every hero within the mark to be silenced and take pure damage. Although the damage is not very high, the large area of silence is very useful for crippling enemy heroes who rely on their abilities. It is also a great ganking and initiation skill.

, This will help you to take more kills and get more powerful!

, This is one of the most powerful and highly destructive ultimate skills in DOTA. It causes immediate shock to any enemy hero and traps it in place as the more an enemy hero moves the more damage it will take. This skill is a wonderful ganking skill and completely immobilizes any lone heroes that you encounter during your roaming around the map.


Remember BS needs as many kills as possible so roaming around the map for unsuspecting enemy heroes is a core strategy for this hero.

, By this time you will have entered the mid game phase and hopefully gained enough gold to make your core item: Sange and Yasha. This item is absolutely wonderful for BS, as Sange gives damage and adds health which BS always needs. In addition, Yasha provides a great base speed gain and attack speed increase, which in addition to Bloodthirst makes BS literally fly around the map to chase down enemy heroes.

, Just remember to always choose your ultimate at levels 11 and 15 as soon as possible. Once you get 3rd level of your ultimate you will be virtually invincible 1v1 against any hero in the game. You'll be a great asset to your team during fights.

, There are 2 options while making a large item for BS once you have earned a lot of gold. Either you could go for the Butterfly Build or the Radiance Build.


Butterfly is the supreme item for any agility hero and gives huge boosts to attack speed and damage as well as the option to increase your movement speed on will. With this item you will be producing tons of damage per second.
The second option is to increase your damage per hit which is provided by radiance. Radiance also gives an added advantage of burning the enemy team/creeps in a large radius for 50 damage per second.
The choice is entirely up to you at this point and greatly dependent on what type of enemy heroes are present in the enemy team. If the heroes are mostly low health radiance is a better choice but if there are tanky heroes, butterfly is needed to lower their health quickly before they can cause too much damage.

His main attribute is intelligence so you will never have to worry about ""low mana"" with this hero. However ICEFROG has still decided to add unlimited mana for this hero. The more you use your array of spells, the more chance OD has of replenishing his mana pool.
, OD almost always goes into the hard lane of his map because of his good range and high starting damage. For your starting Items take a ""Null Talisman"" and ""Tangoes"" to keep your Hp up. If your opponent is low on gold it will always give your team a decided advantage especially if it is a carry opponent., If you have not killed your opponent yet, skill your first Ability, which gives you a pure damage bonus. With the Null Talisman you will be able to add about 20 to 25 bonus damage to your attacks which should be enough to land you a few kills., By the fifth level you should have quite a damage bonus to your attacks and remember that this is pure damage(not affected by any armor value or physical damage resistance)., This is the turning point for OD when he transforms from a sole hero killer to a nightmare for your enemy. The ultimate has a large area of effect and by now you should have Rod of Atos or Aghanim's Sceptre in your Arsenal which only adds to its damage bonus., With both skills maxed you will have infinite mana if you keep the Arcane Orb on auto-attack (you can do this by Right clicking the ability icon), Essence Aura will constantly refresh your mana pool., While they are trapped, use the time to get ahead of them so they can't escape and then hit them like crazy until they die (which they will)., Your ultimate can hit heroes trapped in Astral prison. Use this to your advantage to trap a carry or annoying support then hit the enemy heroes during a team fight. Finally when the prison is about to expire launch your ulti at the fight location. This combo is guaranteed to get you 2 to 3 kills instantly and you can chase up to the leftovers and finish them too., This item is absolutely marvelous on OD. It gives you a boost of intelligence which basically means more damage for you and the ability to propel yourself instantly through 600 units of distance makes you every low hp hero's nightmare. You can also use this to initiate a team fight., This item gives you insane mana regeneration(not that you need it) and also contributes a lot towards your arcane orb effect. Also the regeneration bonus means that you can stay in Team fights for longer and cause more damage per second., If you can't then blame your teammates because if you follow this guide you will be the most damage producing hero in your team."

Last hit creeps perfectly.,
Skill build.,
Item build.,

Select powerful heroes.,
Practice killing.",How to Become Beyond Godlike in DotA Allstars," You must last hit all the enemy's creeps in order to get rich early. Note that you can also not deny your creeps because this might be tiresome - just focus in last hitting your enemy's creeps.;
, You must know what is the right skill build for your hero to make it more powerful and tough. Note that skill build must be different depending on your enemy. First example. Your hero is Omniknight and your enemy is a nuclear weapon user(High damage dealer via spells such as Demon witch) , master first the 2nd ability(immune to spells) then the 3rd skill (slow) so that when you reached in Lv7, Lion(Demon witch) can't cast spells to you because your 2nd ability is Lv4 or maxed - the only way that Lion can defeat you is to fight you with his normal attack which is a very small damage for you. When you attacked him, he can't escape because of your 3rd ability's slow. He'll die in this right skill build without using 1st ability (heal). The item build for him is 1.phase boots 2.vladmir's 3.sange and yasha 4.Armlet of Mordiggian 5.tarrasque 6.butterfly. Second example. your hero is Omniknight and your enemy is mortared whose damage comes mostly from physical attacks. Your 2nd ability is pretty much useless in this scenario. Learn first your 1st ability (heal) then 3rd ability(slow).





, You must also know the right item build for your hero in order to make it powerful and tough for example, the right item build for Lycanthrope is this: 1.Power Threads (Str) 2.Vladmir's 3.Abyssal blade 4.Armlet of Mordiggian 5.Tarassque and 6.Assault Cuirass. Sometimes, your item build must be different depending on your enemy for example, when your enemy is Ursa Warrior, you must have a blademail so that his damage will return to him; and if your enemy is a skiller, buy a Necronomicon (level 3) and cast it to him so that he'll loose a big amount of his remaining mana and HP, buy a Black King Bar so that he can't cast spells to you for a few seconds, or buy an Orchid of Malevolence to make his skill silenced for 5 seconds.





, You must learn how to survive by using blind-spotting (hiding on trees) and by the use of items that can help you escape (e.g. Phase boots, Force staff, Lothar's edge). You must also learn how to avoid being ambushed.





, You must not use these following heroes in a 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or 5v5 game because they are weak and not kill stealers therefore they can't make you become godlike: Keeper of the Light, Lone Druid, Warlock, Alchemist, Pit Lord, and Undying. You can only become beyond godlike with them when you're a professional DOTA player.

, You must know the right combo skill of each hero (e.g. for Slayer, use first the 2nd ability (stun), then the 1st ability (damaging fire wave), and then the ultimate ability (Laguna blade); for Rhasta, use the Lothar's Edge or Eul's Scepter of Divinity first, then ultimate(ward), the 2nd skill (shackle), the 3rd skill (voodoo), and then 1st skill (lightning). You must also practice the perfect aim and shot of their each very long-ranged skill (e.g. Mirana's arrow, Pudge's hook's, Invoker's sunstrikes, Clockwerk's missile - practice aiming and shooting on AI maps in mode).

Get your Eidolon to level 40.,
Know the requirements.,
Gather the required materials.,
Evolve them!",How to Evolve Eidolon in Aura Kingdom," This is the minimum level required for evolution. You can level them up by feeding them Experience Crystals, but only up to your current level, so make sure you’re level 40 or higher before attempting this.;
, Head on over to the Eidolon menu by pressing N or by clicking the icon that looks like a silhouette of Serif in the lower part of your screen. Then click on your Eidolon’s icon on the left half of the menu, and select “Evolution,” which you’ll find on the right half of the menu. This will show you a small screen depicting the ingredients you need to gather to evolve them.


The ingredients vary for the first evolution, but usually, for the starter Eidolons, you need 30 Small Experience Crystals and 1 Hero’s Emblem. For the other Eidolons you can get, you need 1 of the Eidolon’s corresponding Key of Gaia, 4 of a specific Elemental Crest, and 30 Small Experience Fragments.

, Now comes the hard part. This bit requires a lot of grinding and farming, and will take a very long time. Just be patient and know where you will find what you need.


You can get Hero’s Emblems from connecting your starter Eidolon with Gaia. This is an uncommon reward from linking, but you only need 1.
You can get Key Fragments from connecting your other Eidolons too, or by beating some Eidolons over at the Temple of Eidolons in Crescent Hill just south of the Navea gate. You can then fuse 10 of the same type to make a Key of Gaia for that Eidolon by right-clicking on the Fragments to trigger the Fusion menu, then click “Fuse.” You also have a small chance of getting an actual full Key of Gaia from beating Eidolons at the Temple. Just know that the selection of Eidolons in the Temple are random, but the Key Fragments you get from linking are somewhat rare, meaning that either way, you’re in for the long haul.
Small Experience Crystals can be farmed in mainly in Crescent Hill and Cactakara Forest.
You can get Elemental Crests from either completing quests or, more reliably, from linking any Eidolon to Gaia.
If you plan on evolving them further, you’ll need Brilliant Evolutionary Beads, which you can get at the highest levels of the Sky Tower. You’ll need to be level 99 to reach it, so consider it a stretch goal for long-time players.

, Now, once you get all your ingredients, it’s time to evolve your Eidolon. Head back to the Eidolon menu, and click the “Evolve” button again. If you have all the required items, the button on the bottom of the Evolution menu becomes available for you to click, so just click it and rejoice in your Eidolon’s growth of power!


Quite a lot of Eidolons can evolve up to level 3, and quite a few of them get a change in appearance when you reach level 3. The game is also currently updating which Eidolons change appearance once you reach that level, so don’t be surprised if yours suddenly gets a new look.

Once she is dead, light the bonfire and return to Firelink.",How to Defeat the Dancer of the Borreal Valley Early in Dark Souls III," Sword Master is an NPC wearing only ragged clothes and wielding a katana. He is crucial for this method.


To find him, leaving from the Firelink bonfire, go up the stairs and proceed outside. SwordMaster can be found on right path.






There are several ways to deal with Sword Master: you can straight up fight him, try and kick/knock him off the cliff (if you choose this method you must quit the game then reload the save if you want his sword) or try to get his aggro and drag him to Firelink shrine; he will get stuck in the doorway and you can bash him to bits.





;
, The boss you will be fighting is actually “hidden” in one of the earliest parts of the game.

, Proceed through the level normally or just run through it; there aren't any items you need or enemies you need to kill so it doesn't really matter how you get there.

, From the courtyard with the winged knight, go to the opposite end and go up some stairs to the right.


Be careful because there will be an ambush at the top of the stairs but it is easy enough to deal with.







, Regardless of how well you think you can dodge or evade attacks, it is very important to open the shortcut because the boss will pretty much kill you in one hit.


Ride the elevator up and then open the door.
Go up the stairs and run to the right, after going up more stairs you are now at the first bonfire and will be able to return to the boss fight easily in case you die.

, Go back down the elevator and clear out all the enemies in the area except for the Lothric knight with red eyes, he typically won’t bother you unless you provoke him. You mainly want to defeat these enemies so that you won’t die while attempting the coming steps.

, At the bottom of the stairs is a large archway that leads to the Vordt boss fight; instead of going inside, make sure you are embered (if you are, your body/clothes will have flame effects on them) and then look to the right of the archway and summon Sword Master.


If you need embers you can buy a few from the Shrine Handmaid in Firelink shrine.

, Go inside the building at the top of the stairs and talk to Emma until she gives you an item.


Once you get it just attack her until she dies, don’t worry this won't mess up any other NPC quest lines or have any negative effects overall.







, After Emma dies you get an item called the Basin of Vows. Try to place it under the head of the kneeling knight statue and this will summon the Dancer of the Borreal Valley boss.

, Once the fight starts stay alive as best you can and wait for Sword Master to die.


He is relatively weak so it should not take long.

, This will take you back to the title screen, Select your character and load back into the game, when you come back in you will be outside the Dancer’s boss gate and she won't be able to reach you.

, Go down to his summon sign at the bottom of the stairs and summon him again.

,


Sword Master is now invincible and will kill boss eventually on his own (if you see him taking minuscule damage every attack don't worry, the weapon he uses hurts him, but he will typically outlast the Dancer’s health).
During the fight try to keep your distance from the Dancer and let Sword Master attack her until she dies.
Be careful though because if you move too far away Sword Master will stop attacking her and try to stand right next to you, which can end in your death.
If you are feeling brave you can use bombs/spells to speed process but this will make the dancer target you.

, If at any point fighting the Dancer you die, you will need to repeat the process of waiting for the Master to die, quitting, and resummoning him., Sword Master may have to heal throughout the fight, but generally he is able to defeat the Dancer on his own.

, You can now level up quite a bit."

Use drinks and food in PVP.,
Use food items in dungeons.",How to Cook in Aura Kingdom," Cooking in Aura Kingdom gives you additional stats for an hour or more. To cook, you need ingredients. Ingredients can be obtained from harvesting from field maps.


Helonia—Ingredients that can be gathered in Helonia are Rainbow Fruit from Rainbow Grove, Ghost Pepper from Hot Pepper Tree, and Fragrant Flower from Sweet Grass.
Crescent Hill—Ingredients that can be gathered in this map are Crimson Eggs and Blue Speckled Eggs from Small Bird's Nest, Crescent Vanilla and Crescent Nectar from Crescent Flowers, Chopped Nuts from Nut Tree, and Tiger Lead Power from Patterned Grass.
Cactakara Forest—Here you can gather Multicolored Water Mushroom and Small Colored Mushroom from Colorful Water Mushroom, Vigor Leaves from Energizing Cabbage, Dried Berries and Small Berry from Berry Bushes, and Small Cranberry from Sourfruit Tree.
Demarech Mines—In this map you can gather Egg and Giant Egg from Nest of Twigs, Miracle Thornapple and Miracle Plum from Demarech Fruit Tree, Oasis Spices from Oasis Spices, and Miracle Flower from Demarech Flowers.
Candeo Marsh—Here, you can gather Sweet Coconut and Old Coconut from Coconut Tree. Fresh Garlic Sprouts from Garlic Plant, and Cocoa Fruit from Cocoa Tree.
Triatio Highlands—Ingredients in Triatio Highlands are Sand-Vine Fruit harvested from Desert Vine, Sweet Coconut and Old Coconut from Coconut Tree, and High Wheat Flour from Highland Wheat.
Ventos Prairie—You can harvest Grapes and Raisins from Grapevine; Green Allspice and Green Bay Leaves can be harvested from Wind Spice Bush.
Oblitus Wood—Small Egg and Wind Bird Eggs can be harvested from Wild Bird's Nest.
Navea—You can gather Small Mushrooms and Aromatic Spores from Mushrooms. Navea Soothing Herbs and Navea Herbs from Navea Vanilla, and Stardust Flower from Stardust Flowers.;
, You can view recipes by pressing B to open your bag and then right-clicking any ingredient you have. This will show the full recipe of foods that can be made using this ingredient.


Some of the ingredients needed can't be harvested, especially premade food. For example, in order to make Toast with Honey & Jam, you need 1 Fragrant flower and 1 Fruit Jam Toast. Fruit Jam Toast is a premade food, which means you can only obtain it by purchasing it from the Grocer or Merchant.
After purchasing the premade food and obtaining the remaining ingredients, you can now craft the food. To do so, right-click the ingredients again and then click Fuse Item.
Each fuse has a cost, so it's best to have enough money before cooking.

, Making drinks is the same as making food. You right-click an ingredient to see the recipe then gather the remaining ingredients, such as a premade drink from a Grocer or Merchant.


You can fuse item once you have all the ingredients in your bag.
Remember, you can use food and drink together; this is a good combination for bonus stats.
Most players cook food that are relevant to their class. For example, wizards and sorcerers prefer making food and drinks focusing on damage and double cast, tanks make ones such as Berserker, and guardians prefer boosts on HP and Crit.

, In every fuse of food and drinks, you will get an unidentified food item. Before you can use the food or drink you have created, you must right click the unidentified food item first to get a random grade. Every grade has different boost and duration.


White Grade—This is the most basic food item grade. This is mostly gained from purchasing food from a Grocer or Merchant. Its boost only lasts 30 minutes.
Green Grade—Compared to White Grade, Green Grade has added stats; for example, Helonian Fruit Jelly only has DMG +63 while Rainbow Jelly has DMG +63 and Crit DMG +5%. Usually, Green Grade food items lasts for 1 hour after using it.
Orange Grade—Orange Grade food items usually lasts 3 hours, with a higher stat compared to the Green Grade, and also has an additional boost. For example, a Green Grade Rainbow Jelly has Crit DMG +5%, but an Orange Grade Rainbow Jelly gets upgraded to Crit DMG against bosses +15%.
Purple Grade—Obtaining a Purple Grade food item can be difficult, but possible. It has the same duration as Orange Grade but with a slight difference of boost. In Purple Grade, a Rainbow Jelly gets upgraded from Crit DMG against bosses +15% to Crit DMG against players +15%.
Gold Grade—This is a very rare food grade. It slightly increases the boosts compared to Purple Grade. For example, an Orange Grade Rainbow Jelly gives DMG+ 76 and Crit DMG against players +15%; Gold Grade has DMG +82 and Crit DMG +15% (to both monsters and players). The boosts also lasts up to 6 hours.

, Players often make a lot of food and drinks until they obtain a high-grade food item. If you're planning to farm and fuse to get the grade you want, remember to sell your unwanted food item instead of throwing it away.


Food and drink items are a good source of money. The more gold you have, the more food you can fuse.

, You can sell your raw ingredients using the Auction or selling to the Grocer or Merchant to gain more silver. With this, you can save on inventory and earn profit.


Note that some ingredients and even food items cannot be traded.

, As you grow stronger in Aura Kingdom and advance to higher level maps, you will notice that monsters, especially in dungeons with high difficulty, become tougher. Using food items gives your character a boost in damage, speed, and even casting, since some of the food possesses double casting and even triple.

, In PVP, it is best to use food with +ACC; this will increase your character’s accuracy, giving your character a higher chance of hitting an opponent with huge speed.


Aside from accuracy, you can use double or triple damage. This takes effect on both monster and players; the same goes with double and triple cast.

, You can use food items to prepare for certain dungeons. For example, monsters in the Infernal Abyss dungeon are fire attributes. It means you need a food and weapons to counter this.


Lamb Wellington, a Gold Grade food from Spicy Grilled Lamb Rib, gives Crit +303, and Flame Skills do an extra +8%. If you're a wizard, it's advisable that you use this food during your exploration in Infernal Abyss for extra damage and quick kill against mobs and bosses.
You can use a drink item along with Lamb Wellington, such as a change to double cast.

",How to Complete Sky Tower in Aura Kingdom," If you're a Bard, the best preparation for your survival, including the party members, would be having a high boost for your Heal percentage. Your party members expect you to heal them and support anyone within your party, especially the tanks.;
, For the tank type, you need to withstand any attack to protect your teammates and prevent DPS and Bards from dying. High DEF, HP, and a decent attack will be enough.


Don't forget to use skills that can provoke the enemies, increasing the malice count toward you.

, For DPS class, keep in mind that you don't have unlimited respawn in the Sky Tower. The key to winning is to stay alive while raiding through the floors. Have greater damage to kill monsters quickly


Don't forget to have a decent DEF to avoid dropping out from the party in the early part of the raid.
If the tanks are unable to hold the enemy’s malice, cease your attack and let the tank inflict more damage until he gains its 100% malice. Only then can you proceed your attack.

, Sky Tower NPCs can be found at certain towns in the game (listed below). You can also check your map for the rope sign, indicating the location of the Sky Tower NPC.


Navea (x:345, y:470)
Ventos Prairie (x:115, y:766)
Oblitus Wood (x:465, y:215)
Star Sand Desert (x:310, y:120).

, Just talk to the Sky Tower NPC. You can start registering for the raid one hour before the starting of the raid. Players who registered for the game can choose a group, the max number of group will be 90.


In order for you to join the Raid, you need to be level 60.
Eidolons are not allowed inside the Sky Tower, which makes the raid challenging for the players.
Aside from limiting participants to 40 players, you can only join 1 raid group per day.
You don't have to worry about dying since you can respawn inside the Sky Tower up to 15 times, beyond that you're not allowed to join the raid team.
Keep in mind that each raid group will be put into sets, which will be assigned to a certain time period:

Saturday: Group 1–30 (3PM–5PM), Group 31–60 (8PM–10PM), Group 61–90 (10PM–12AM).
Sunday: Group 1–30 (3PM–5PM), Group 31–60 (8PM–10PM), Group 61–90 (10PM–12AM).


All times are based on Eastern Standard Time.

, An hour before the raid time, talk to the Sky Tower NPC to join a raid group. You can join up to two different groups.


Remember to be on time and look for groups that start with floor 1 and have 40 people.
Choose a group wisely to avoid wasting your raid attempt.
In the group list, you can check the members before you can join them. Look out for the class composition and make sure that the group have at least 8 bards in the party, 5 tanks, and a good number of DPS.

, Sky Tower will reward you with loots if you're able to survive the floors. Mobs in the tower do not drop loots, but chests will appear at the end of the floor after you killed the boss.


The chests in Sky Tower are also bosses—the best way to get a decent loot is by using Treasure Charm.
You need to hit the chest at least once in order to get a loot.
Bards need to inflict damage as well for a higher chance.

, The most common mistake that occurs in the game is ignoring the red carpet. “Red carpet” is the term used for the red mark that appears whenever bosses use their skills. Never take those damage simply because in Sky Tower, bosses inflict huge damage, especially to players with low stat equipments.


Focus on killing the monsters and avoiding the redlines.

, As you enter the room, players will be buffed with either red or blue circle charge. If you bump into a player with a different charge, you’ll both receive damage. Try to stand away from each other, especially for those long-ranged classes.


For the melee class, attack the boss when you have the red charge buff since the boss spawns red charge explosives that will only inflict damage to blue buffed players.

, In this part of the floor, tanks need to pull mobs and control them all in the middle of the room.


The Bards’ Stun will be useful for crowd control.
Sorcerers can use their Sleep skill as well.
The other players should gather orbs to throw them into the giant jar.
Tanks shouldn't pick up orbs and should focus on holding the mobs instead.

, Plant monsters in this level will boost up the boss' damage reduction by giving them buffs. The only way to kill these plants quickly is by luring them into the fire pit while the tanks hold off the boss.


Bards need to keep an eye on the DPS classes since walking over the fire pit inflicts huge damage. Heal them whenever you can, and at the same time, keep an eye on your tanker.

, There will be mud summons in this floor that will approach the boss to heal it. While the tank is holding back the boss, let the other melee class handle the mud summons and kill them before they can heal the boss.


DPSes must focus on inflicting damage against the boss and kill it quick.
Healers should focus on healing the tanks, including the ones holding off the mud summons.

, If you're familiar with Tower Defense, this floor has the exact mechanics. The floor will be split into 6 sections, with towers and mobs will continuously charging to bring it down. All players must have enough DEF to survive and to protect the towers.


Split up the party for each tower and have everyone protect their assigned spot.
Kill the monsters with a crown above their head as they can deal more damage to the tower.
Survive, protect the tower, and kill the monsters for 5 minutes.

, This floor has three bosses that will summon one after another.


The first one to appear will be a staff boss, which has the ability to cast Instant Thunder; this will stun players.
The second boss is an axe boss; it has debuff skills that prevents everyone from receiving heal for 30 seconds. Kill this boss before everyone's health reach low.
The last boss is a sword-and-shield boss.
Divide the team and assign them to each bosses, and make sure each boss stands far apart from each other.

, This is one of the hardest part of the game since this requires teamwork. The boss will summon different kinds of totems that will give various kinds of buffs to the boss.


The tank's job is to lure the boss away from the totem buff zone to make the buff inactive.
Whenever a totem appears, all DPS class should stop attacking and let their tank pull the boss away from the buff, only then they can proceed.
Continued attack while the tank is luring will increase the risk of a target change, which might end up killing the DPS—or worst, healers.
Do not use any binding skills for this boss.
Bards should support mainly on tanks.

, Press ""water bomb"" skill twice when you throw.
Bards please buff move speed on party members and try to move together in a group with your party. Let tank takes agro on fire sprites first.

, Enter but stay outside outer circle. Wait for the ""go"" signal and do full dps on boss.

, Team will be assigned on the element, sync the hp and take it down at the same time. Tell us if your corner reach 10%.


assign teams to the 4 elements
Kill when all sides are at 10%

Brush up on your DotA knowledge.,

Look at your minimap often.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Be Good at Defense of the Ancients (DotA)," In DotA, you choose one hero to play as from a selection of dozens at the start of every game. Since each hero has his/her/its own skills and strategies to master, it's wise to start by picking just a few heroes to get good with at first. It's much quicker and easier to master two or three heroes than it is to try to learn every single hero's play style at once.


The official DotA wiki has roughly ranked the DotA 2 heroes in order of how easy they are for beginners to use. Among the easiest are Bane, Centaur Warrunner, Lich, Lion, Ogre Magi, Crystal Maiden, Treant Protector, and Warlock.It's a good idea to pick two or three heroes to start off (rather than just one) in case a teammate picks your preferred hero or your team contains too many heroes of one type (all magic users, all offensive characters, etc.);
, In DotA, not dying is just as important as killing the enemy. When an enemy hero kills you, the enemy is rewarded with gold and experience. Over time, this can add up, giving the enemy a big advantage over you. People who die often in DotA are often called ""feeders"" because their deaths ""feed"" the enemy team with valuable resources.


Though it's hard not to be a feeder at least a few times as a beginner, it's easier if you remember the golden rule of not feeding: don't ""push"" attacks all by yourself. If you run into trouble in enemy territory, your chance of survival is much higher when you have a teammate or two to help you out.
Try to always have an escape route from any battle. This can be as simple as having a few TP scrolls (see below).

, The huge selection of equipment and items in DotA can be intimidating to beginners. You can find a good guide to DotA items (including crafting recipes) here.While each hero's ideal item loadout is semi-unique, there are few items almost everyone should buy. You'll want to have the following:


Town Portal Scroll (or ""TP""): An item that teleports you back to a friendly building. Great for escaping from dangerous situations.Courier: A unit that's used for taking items to and from the base.
Sentry Ward: Makes an invisible unit that can be used to spy on others and keep certain areas of the minimap ""filled in."" Great for keeping track of your enemies.

, Your goal in any game of DotA is to destroy the enemy team's ancient (the well-protected structure in the opposite corner of the map from yours). To do this, you'll need lots of gold (to buy items) and experience (to make your character more powerful). There are a few main ways to do this. Try to do these things (or at least help your teammates while they do them). At the same time, try to keep your enemies from doing the same:


Killing heroes.
Killing creeps. Creeps are the non-hero units in the game — for instance, the small soldiers that move down the lanes and attack each other. There are also neutral creeps in the spaces between the lanes that will attack anyone. Some of these neutral creeps are quite powerful. Killing easier creeps is a good way to get stronger if your hero isn't very good in one-on-one combat with other heroes.

, The DotA community uses lots of slang and shorthand that can be tricky for newcomers to decipher. Learning these terms is important for communicating with your teammates. A good glossary of in-game terms is available here.A few of the most fundamental terms include:


Aggro: The attention of an enemy unit. For example, if a creep or tower is attacking your hero, you have ""aggroed"" it.
Deny/last hit: Killing something to prevent the enemy to get the gold/experience from it. More on this below.
Farming: Killing creeps to get gold and experience instead of fighting enemy heroes or structures.
Ganking: Killing heroes by surprise or ""gang-up"" tactics.
Jungle: The spaces in between the main lanes where the neutral creeps are.

, DotA is just as much about planning and knowing how to react in certain situations as it is about reacting to your enemies. The game rewards players with extensive game knowledge, so it's valuable to take some time to acquaint yourself with the many, many aspects of the game. You don't have to memorize every single item and skill, but you should know the basics of all the heroes and the most important items.


A good resource for new players is the DotA 2 Wiki, available here.WikiHow also has numerous articles on DotA topics.

, DotA isn't a game that rewards honorable playing. Engaging the enemy team on fair terms is only making it easier for them to kill you. Instead, look for opportunities to surprise your enemies, trap them in unfavorable situations, and hit them when they're weakest. There are many different ways to do this — just a few ideas are below:


Attack enemies who are alone with a few of your teammates to help you. This is even easier if you bring a hero with a slow or stun spell.
Sneak behind an enemy by going through the jungle, then strike when she runs back to base to heal.
Lure an enemy near to one of your towers or some friendly creeps and continually dance out of his range, letting the creep or structures pick away at his health.
Ge the ""last hit"" on creeps and structures (see below).

, This is a crucial DotA skill — it's something that's super exciting when you pull it off and super aggravating when the enemy does it to you. In DotA, the hero who gets the final hit on an enemy before it dies gets the gold and experience for killing it. It doesn't matter who did most of the damage to the unit — whoever gets the last hit gets the reward. Take advantage of this to ensure your team gets as much money and experience as possible and your enemy gets as little as possible. A few ideas are below:


When an enemy is about to kill a creep, hit it with an attack so that you kill it instead. This is something you can do even for your team's own creeps. If you can pull this off for a powerful creep with a big reward for killing it, your team will love you and your enemy will hate you.
When the enemy is about to kill one of your towers or structures, hit it with a strong attack so you get the last hit. You won't get the reward for killing friendly units, but this keeps your enemy from getting it.

, Many rookie mistakes in DotA can be attributed to not knowing where your enemies are. The minimap is an extremely useful tool. While looking at the minimap distracts you from the action, it can give you valuable information about the positioning of the players in the game. Some higher-level players recommend spending up to 1/3 of your time looking at the minimap.


One great use of the minimap is to avoid confrontations with powerful enemies. Don't wait until they're on screen to run away — if you see them coming on the minimap, get out!

, No one is going to be great at DotA at first. If you're just starting out, you're bound to be called a n00b a few times. The important thing is to use your inevitable failures as opportunities to learn. When you do poorly, make note of what isn't working and figure out how to fix it. The DotA Wiki can be a big help here!


Remember: the definition of insanity is trying the same thing again and again and expecting different results. If you don't like the results you're getting, be willing to change your play style. Find yourself dying too much? Play more defensively or invest in defensive items. Not getting enough kills? Look for more opportunities to surprise your enemies when they're weak.

Run to the Military Hall, and into the small area that looks like a house with a line of bushes fencing it off. It’s found to your left and next to the large stairs. Talk to the singular lady knight, Military Officer Iris.
After delivering her package, run up those stairs until you see another portal. Use it to warp yourself to the Residential Neighborhood. Head east, and right next to the giant purple lion-man, you’ll find Aunt Dana. Hand the package to her, and receive the title “Express Courier,” which grants you a bonus 16 DMG.
Remember, this quest is timed and you need to complete it in under 2 minutes, so don’t take your sweet time to explore. The way described here is the quickest, and also introduces you to the local warp portals native to Navea.

, You probably spotted another quest at the entrance of the Military Hall. Talk to Policeman Hugh, and agree to patrol the area. Head to the outer portion of the “Central square,” which is the roofed corridor area circling the middle of the map, and somewhere in the northwestern part of the circle, you’ll spot an Annoyed Girl and a Drunkard. When you approach, the Drunkard turns aggressive, so beat him up. After the girl gives you her thanks, you’ll receive the title “Deputy,” which nets you a bonus 4 EVA when equipped.

, Head back to the Military Hall. Talk to Soldier Levi, who’s hanging out by the cannons. He’ll ask you to pick up some stuff for him, so agree to it. Now hug the wall south until you spot an alcove decorated with what appears to be furnaces. You’ll see a bunch of people there, but your aim is Craftsman Karn, who’s in the innermost portion of this alcove.


Talk to Karn, and after listening to his gripes, run back to Levi and talk to him to receive your title of “Personal Assistant,” which adds 16 points to your DMG.

, South of Levi is Training Officer Leroux. Talk to him, and after a brief speech, he’ll hand you some Training Weapons. Face the Training Dummy next to you and Leroux, click on it, then right-click on the Training Weapons on your inventory. Do this three times, and you’ll get the title “Private,” which nets you an extra 4 points to EVA.

, Head on over to the far northwest area, where the Sky Pillar resides. On the western side, by the river, you’ll find a man, Fisherman Taz, west of the Fishing Association. Talk to him and receive a Fishing Rod you’ll use for this quest.


Right-click on the rod, and a short scene will play. Watch it to the end, and you’ll receive the “Ace Angler” title, which nets you a nice bonus 20 HP when equipped.

, On the far northwestern area of the Sky Pillar, you’ll find a poor lost Granny. Talk to her, and she’ll start following you. Head on south to the Residential Neighborhood, then east until you reach the fountain next to “to Military Hall” warp. A short scene will play. With Granny safe at home, you’ll net yourself the “Good Samaritan” title that adds a bonus 4 CRIT when you equip it.

, Oh no, poor Mick can’t find his friends! Mick is found just northeast of the entrance in the Trade District.


First go directly south, in the small alcove directly west of Baker Laura, next to the stairs. You’ll find Kate behind some people talking, and you’ll be alerted by the game that you found her. Speak to her first and then be on your way.
Next up is Leah, who is found beside Auction House Sally, who is somewhere due west of Mick. Speak to her again, then it’s time to look for Allan.
The last child is found directly east of Laura, right on top of the roof. Jump on top of the boxes and barrels next to the stalls, then jump on top of the tarps of the stalls, then double-jump to reach the roof. After talking to Allan, make your way back to Mick.
When you talk to Mick after you’ve found everyone, a short scene will play, and you’ll recieve the achievement “The Seeker,” which gives you a bonus 20 points to your HP.
Do note that this quest is known to be horribly bugged: sometimes Kate or Leah won’t spawn, sometimes they both aren’t there, and sometimes even Mick won’t spawn. As of writing, many players have reported this bug, but the quest remains glitched. Sometimes, the glitch is easily fixed by exiting and re-entering Navea or by using a different channel, but they are not very reliable methods. Luckily, the dev company, XLegend, has already announced that they’re working on fixing this error.

Go solo ten times.,
Beat it as a party ten times.",How to Complete Crescent Hill Titles in Aura Kingdom," First off, just like in Helonia Coast and Port Skandia, there are plenty of conversations to eavesdrop on. As usual, you can do this by looking for NPCs with yellow speech bubbles with an ellipses (...) above them.;
, The Crescent Hill area has many important places, but the most important areas for you in this venture is the town Lunarin, Clark’s Farm, and the Crescent Flower Field. Lunarin is found in the eastern portion in the map, and is your starting area. The Flower Field is directly south, and the farm is directly west.

, Walk up to the NPCs, click, then listen! It might take you a few times, especially if others are also trying to listen in to the conversation or if your Internet is slow, but just make sure you listen until you get an Achievement notice!

, The title “Lunar Legend” is unlocked when you manage to listen to all the conversations in the area. It grants you a bonus 3 points in SPD and 4 points in CRT when you equip it.The vast bulk of the conversations are found in the town itself, but there are two at the far west of the Flower Field and one in the farm. All in all, there are ten conversations, so good luck eavesdropping!

, As usual, you will find yourself drawn to the green exclamation points scattered on your world map.These are Hidden Quests, which offer little to no advice on how to complete it or any quest notification in your Journal, but they offer some nice bonuses on top a Title upon completion.

, Go pick the Moonlight Flower at the southernmost part of the Crescent Flower Fields, due south of town. It’s the only pink flower in the section full of yellow flowers. Then head to the far east section of town, where Nala lives. When you talk to her, you can hand her the flower, and she’ll not just give you a nifty flower crown (which gives you a small buff) but also the title “Florist,” which adds 20 HP when equipped.

, Pick up five Flowers from the fields near where you found the Moonlight Flower. Then head northeast of town, around a shining pagoda, near where the Fishing Association NPCs can be found. You’ll spot a Box near the water, and clicking it will yield an Empty Basket. Now, right-click on the basket, then choose to fuse it with the flowers. This will become a Basket of Flowers.


Right-click on the Basket of Flowers that you receive, and it will lead you to the area. Right-click again, and a short scene and a battle ensues. Defeat your opponent and get the title “The Illusionist,” which grants you +16 DMG!

, Somewhere in the northern area of the Flower Field is a Drunken Lily Beetle half buried in the ground with only it’s “flower” poking out. If you click on it, you can gather some Intoxicating Nectar from it. Head back to town, and you can find Winemaker Cain near the northern exit of town. When you give it to him, he’ll give you a nice bottle of wine and a nifty title, “Wine Enthusiast,” which adds 4 points to CRT.

, Somewhere due northwest from town, north of Traveling Merchant Angie, you’ll encounter a Small Bag. If you click on it, you’ll receive some Strange Beans. Right-click on them to automatically head to Clark’s Farm, which is directly west of the village, and to what appears to be a flower garden in the farm. If you right-click it again, you’ll be able to plant those beans. Once they’re grown, defeat the enemy that appears, and receive the “Super Cool” title, which gives you a bonus 20 HP when you equip it.

, Since you’re at Clark’s Farm, go and check out the Feed Barrel nearby. When you gather Bird Food from it, head to the Birdbrains just to the east of the farm, click on one, then right-click the feed. When you’re done, head back to the farm, talk to Clark himself, then watch the scene that ensues. You’ll get the title “The Glutton,” which rewards you with +16 DMG when equipped.

, At the southwestern end of the map, in the depths of the camp of the Mistwalker Tribe Gnomes, there’s a tank. If you click on it, you can gather some Green Juice. Take it to town and find Sue. She can be found in the middle of town, and when you talk to her, she rattles off something about a beauty treatment. Afterwards, she asks you to get a Feather from the Birdbrains nearby. Go slay a few to acquire your Unidentified Feather, then head back to Sue. After a cutscene, you’ll be rewarded with the title “Fashionista,” which adds 16 points to your DMG when you use it.

, Inside the Mistwalker Tribe’s camp, to the west of the entrance, you’ll see poor old Gruff crying in a corner. If you approach him, he’ll ask you to help him find his lost treasure. Exit the camp then head east around the hill, then south until you find a pool. If you run into the water, a short scene will play, and Gruff will set a small box on the ground. Pick up the box’s contents and you’ll receive the “King of the Ring” title, which adds 4 EVA when you equip it.

, Somewhere in the southern corner of the Alabastren Temple Ruins is a Box of Machinery between some arches and stairs. Pick it up to get some Mechanical Parts, then head on over to Paolo, somewhere in the southwestern fringe of the Temple Ruins, directly east of Angie. Give the parts to him, and watch the ensuing scene to get the title “Ace Mechanic,” which grants you a bonus 4 points to DMG.

, Since you’re at the Temple Ruins, head near where your found the Box of Machinery. You’ll see a Raised Mound there, and you can gather some Old Slate Fragments from it. Head on over to Clark’s Farm, and show it to Rosie. She’ll restore if for you and tell you about it’s use. Right-click on the tablet and you will be brought back to the ruins. Right-click it again then watch the scene that unfolds to unlock the title “Modern Relic,” which gives you an additional 4 EVA when equipped.

, Head on over to the furthest eastern portion of the Temple Ruins, west of the glowing red gate. It’s a bit hidden, but you’ll spot a Toolbox there. Click on it to take a pair of Scissors from it. Click on one of the leonine Mysterious Provocateurs, then right-click on the scissors.


You might want to be a bit higher-leveled to do this, since the Provocateurs are generally aggressive mobs that try to kill anyone and anything wandering too close, or at least be really good at running away.
When you’re done, head on over to Craftsman Anthony back in the southern end of Lunarin and present to him the Lion’s Mane you got. Watch the scene to get the title “The Superstitious,” which adds 20 points to HP when equipped.

, You probably reached level 20 sometime before arriving in Crescent Hill. Once you reached 20, you probably had a special quest triggered while wandering around, and now you find yourself in an unfamiliar face and at a loss. But not to worry, this quest can be easy for the prepared!

, Of course, this quest is only triggered once you reach level 20. Once you reach 20, a cutscene will be triggered, and you’ll be prompted to head to Crescent Hill. If you glance at the lower right side of your screen, you’ll see that a Quest has been added to the list. If you left-click the option to head over to Barthold, you will find yourself automatically being taken to Crescent Hill, specifically to the Dimensional Mage Barthold. After speaking to him, you can now choose to accept the quest or not.


Do note that the Dimensional Key he gives you after accepting only lasts for 24 hours. If it expires, go to your Journal, click the Quest’s entry and click on the “Abandon” button. This will let you talk to Barthold again and receive the Key again.

, While this dungeon can be accessed by anyone by themselves, to truly take advantage of it, you need two others who have accepted this quest. To the left of your World Map is an icon that looks like a person holding a wooden sign. If you click on that, you’ll see the Party Menu open. You can click the option on the upper left to only let you see what parties are recruiting for a level-appropriate dungeon. On the left, you can see what dungeons you can start raiding—in this case, “Dimensional Hall (20+).” Click on that, and on the right side, you’ll see what parties are recruiting for that dungeon. You can then click on a promising name on the list, then click the “Join” button under it.


When you click on the party you wish to join, you can also view which members are already in it on the upper right part of the menu.
If you’ve made friends beforehand, pop open your Social Menu, which can be opened by clicking on the icon that looks like two people being buddies. Scroll down to whoever is online and the appropriate level, right-click their name, then click “Invite to Party.”
It’s highly recommended you take a Bard with you or have a member with Merrilee as their Eidolon, since this dungeon is normally your first taste in beating bosses by waves.
Your invitation is automatically rejected if they’re fighting a monster or already part of a party. You can invite your friend to your party even if they’re on a different channel, but you need to be on the same channel if you want to beat dungeons together.

, Now that you have two other people along for the ride, it’s time to head on over to the Dimensional Hall. Use the portal right behind Barthold. Click the portal and click the option “Dimensional Hall (20+).”

, Now pick one of the three large floating crystals, and click on it. All three party members need to pick different ones. Choose to unlock the Shackles when given the option.

, You’ll suddenly have to fight off some monsters and a couple mid-bosses before the actual boss comes around. Coordinate with your members and don’t die!

, While you’ll get an achievement from beating this, plus the usual quest prizes, you’ll need to do this four more times before you get the title “Banisher,” which adds 3 points to SPD when equipped. You can just ask Barthold for the quest after finishing it, but since it’s a daily quest, you might need a few days to completely finish it, since you need the key to unlock it.

, The “Crescent Conqueror” title is given to you when you manage to defeat and capture all the four mid-boss monsters wandering in the area. Those monsters are distinguishable by the silver crowns hovering above their names and by the dragon head icon roaming around in the map. The four, from weakest to strongest, are <Alluring Fragrance> Bayin, <The Glutton> Doniland, <Deadly Poison> Senka, and <Troll Berserker> Varis.

, Of course, you can’t kill them if you can’t find them. Bayin is the easiest to find, since he hangs out right at the western edge of town and is basically an overgrown Lunar Flower Dryad. Next is Doniland, who is a rather overgrown Flower Trap and lurks at the south, in the Flower Field. Senka, a huge beetle, is at the northern part of Clark’s Farm. And finally, Varis lumbers about, looking very much like an extra-large golem, in the northern corner of the Alabastren Temple Ruins. They respawn at random times, but are found in the mentioned areas.

, Now it’s time to fight them! The weakest, Bayin, is at level 21, while the strongest, Varis, is at level 29. There aren’t actually a lot of requirements to defeat them, just decent equipment, good timing, and maybe a few potions. But after the battle, you need to have at least one slot free in your inventory. This is because the four monsters are immediately “sealed” in a crate or urn that you need to take back to the village. When you click on the urn or crate that appears when the monsters are defeated, it immediately becomes a cart that follows you around.


Note that you can only carry one crate or urn with you at a time, so you can ‘t go fight all of the monsters at once.
The crates or urns also have a time limit. It only lasts for 20 minutes in your inventory before it disappears. It also disappears if you log off or switch characters or server channels.

, Once you’re dragging the cart, head on over to the Village Guard Albert. He’s found at the southern exit of town, by the stairs near the Banker and past the Chefs. He’ll gratefully take your spoils and reward you with a chest of loot for your troubles. Once you hand the last of the mid-bosses to him, you’ll get your fancy new title, which grants you an additional 8 DMG when you equip it.

, If you’ve managed to reach the end of the Crescent Hill questline, you’ll be prompted to head over to the Temple. If not, you can still tackle the area once you’re around level 28 or so. It’s found at the far northeast of the map, and the entrance is at the furthest eastern section.


If you’re completing the Main Quest prompt, simply use the automatic function of your Quest Log to take you there instantly.
You can also use the Warp Portal southeast of town. It’s the pagoda with the floating blue jewel. Click on the jewel and choose the Instance tab, which shows you the dungeons available at your current level, then pick Alabastren Temple.

, You’ll be able to get Silver, Armor, and Weapon chests and Refining materials from beating the monsters, as well as some special equipment from the three bosses inside. You’ll need to be ready for the fights, though, so buy the best stuff you can afford and train up Eidolons you want to use!


You can also tackle this as a party of up to 5 members.

, You can enter the dungeon by yourself around four times a day. Leaving the dungeon counts as you entering, but not beating the dungeon. You get a title if you beat it three times, then another at five times, then the last Solo title at ten times.


The first title is “Life After Death,” which adds 6 points to your HP.
The second title is “Big Comeback,” which boosts your DMG by 7 points.
The last Solo title in this dungeon is “Walking Dead,” which grants you a nice bonus of 12 HP and 3 SPD.

, The dungeon in general is a bit harder to compensate for the extra party members. If you can get your party to stick with you enough times, or attempt it enough times with decent members, you’ll get a title when you beat it three, five, and ten times. When you finish the Crescent Hill questline, this unlocks a Daily Party Quest prompt from Halton, though you can only reap the Daily Quest reward (if you’ve already progressed to the end of the Crescent Hill questline) once a day. You can also enter this about three times a day as well.


The first of the Party titles is “Barely Alive,” which adds 12 HP when equipped.
The second you can get is “Demolition Party,” which has nice bonus 12 points to DMG and 3 points to SPD when equipped.
The last of the titles from beating it in Party mode is “Undead,” granting you an additional 1 SPD and 14 HP when equipped.

Gather materials for crafting.,
Buy and learn Fusion Formulas.,
Learn equipment recipes.,
Craft your equipment.",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom1," While at level 40 below you’ll be quite fine just using the equipment you get from dungeon diving or completing quests, once you hit the higher levels, you’re better off crafting equips from the Refining Blacksmiths. To do so, you’ll need to have some materials and Cores, which you can also craft this way. Your materials can be found by killing monsters in Instance Dungeons, by mining things (patterned rocks, crystals, mineral rich dirt, etc.) with a pickaxe, by foraging here and there, and trading Ethereal Crystals to the Gathering Association of Navea for Gathering Tokens, which you can use to buy your materials in packs of 100.;
, To make better equipments, you can go and buy Fusion Formulas from the Masters in Navea’s Military Hall. They can be found at the far northeast of the map, up the stairs leading to the huge building. You can learn the Formulas you get by heading to any Blacksmith anywhere and clicking the “I want precise casting and forging.” This will open a menu with some drop-down options and a button that says Learn New Recipes.


Select the “Learn New Recipes” tab and find the Formula you want to learn here. Drag the Formula you want to learn into the Special Recipe slot, and click the “Pay” button below to learn it. Obviously, you need a certain amount of Gold to learn most of them. It's best if you bring at least 10 Gold with you, just in case. Afterwards, you just need to search for the right materials, or to craft them if you already have them.

, You can also learn equipment recipes from the Blacksmith themselves by clicking “Recipes List,” then exploring their selection of equipments.

, Simply select your chosen item on the drop-down list of the main window of the Fusion menu. When you pick whichever item you need, it will show you the minimum requirements on the right. Now, either select the “Refine” or the “Refine All” button, and it will craft your item for you and drop it in your inventory!


You can also use Recipes (the item) to craft your equipment. They’re basically lower-leveled Fusion Formulas you can get from fishing or by tackling dungeons and world bosses, and you can learn them the same way as the Formulas. You can buy a couple starter ones in Canadeo Marsh’s Blacksmith, but better Recipes are found when dungeon diving or fishing.

Understand that the point of the Gladiatus is to become champion of the Arena, so it would seem logical to fight in the arena.,
Be ready for the Publican at the tavern.,
Do not feel bad if you don't kill anything on your first few expeditions.,
Move ahead.,

, That is normal. It will get your xp up and the chances of winning become greater.

, After a few expeditions you will probably be getting bored. Go to the training in the city and get a few of your levels up.

, Make sure you buy armor equal or less than your level. Don't waste your money.

Collect Weapon and Armor Fortification Scrolls.,
Gather up some Fragments.,
Level up your equipment.",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom2," Once you have the equipment you want to use, you will need to level it up. To do this, you’ll need Weapon and Armor Fortification Scrolls, which you can get as a reward from certain quests and monsters. The scrolls have a chance to either level up your equipment or to add to the equipment’s Potential points, which basically represent the amount of points you need for a successful level up.

, To use the scrolls, you’ll need some Fragments. You can do this by using the “Salvage” option, represented by a claw hammer icon, at the bottom of your inventory. When you have any equipment that you haven’t sold or used, you can salvage them for a small amount of Fragments, and occasionally on higher levels, some nifty other items you can use to improve your weapons. This is a great way of getting rid of loot when you’re in an Instance Dungeon and running out of space.


At the lowest levels, you can get by with just scrounging up at least 20 Fragments, but at higher levels, the amount of Fragments you get from Salvaging and the amount you need for upgrading increases. Don’t be afraid to salvage multiple weapons and armors you aren’t using or you don’t need.

, To actually level up your equipment, click the shiny sword icon next to the Salvage icon. That’s the “Fortify” button, which opens up the Fortification menu. Now, on the lower right portion of the Fortification screen, place the weapon or armor on the left-hand slot, then the Weapon or Armor Fortification Scroll on the right. It will then show you how many Fragments you’ll use up per scroll, and if you have enough, you can just keep fortifying until you’re satisfied!


Keep in mind that Basic Fortification Scrolls only work up to level 9, and Advanced Scrolls only work up to level 20.

Approach a Secret Stone Merchant.,

Embed a stone to your weapon/armor.,
Upgrade Secret Stones.",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom3," Secret Stones are nifty little things that enhance certain skills for its assigned weapons. If you buy even the cheapest ones, the small boost to your weapon’s signature skill is considerable. There are Secret Stone Merchants in every city and town, and you can find them by searching the world map for a blue icon resembling a crystal with a white X.

, Talk to the merchant and pick the “Show me what you got for sale.” option. The regular, low-level secret stones from the merchants in the town are worth about 200 Silver a piece.


At higher levels, you can buy better, but more expensive Secret Stones from the Masters at the Military Hall in Navea, found in the furthest northeastern area of Navea, at the side of the huge building in the Military Hall. You can buy the Secret Stones for both weapons and armors from them for some Gold.
At level 65 and above, you can find Secret Stones in the high-level versions of Instance Dungeons in Crescent Hill, Cactakara Forest, and Demareach Mines. Do note that you need a party to enter these Instances, however.

, To embed a stone in your weapon or armor, simply choose the “I want to embed, extract or upgrade a Secret Stone” option when you talk to the Secret Stone merchant, click the “Inlay/Extract” tab, and place the weapon you want to embed the stone in on the top slot. Place the stone to embed on the bottom slot, and then press the “Inlay” button.


If you want to take out a stone, place the weapon on the top slot and the Secret Stone in the weapon will show up in the bottom slot. The “Inlay” button will become an “Extract” button. Press this to remove the stone from the weapon—just make sure you have enough slots in your inventory first!

, You can even upgrade these Secret Stones by selecting the “I want to embed, extract or upgrade a Secret Stone” option, placing your chosen weapon’s Secret Stone on the slot on the middle, then placing Secret Stones and consumable Secret Stones (Secret Stone of Despair, Glimmering Secret Stones, Shining Secret Stones, etc.) on the slots at the bottom and press “Refine.” Best part is that it’s free!


Do note that levelling up the Secret Stone boosts not only the bonus effectiveness of the move, but also some stats depending on the prefix of the stone you got when you bought it.

Level up.,
Unlock the General and Advanced Masteries.,
Unlock the stat masteries.,
Buy yourself some other masteries!",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom4," As you level up, you can unlock Skill Masteries. Masteries are passive skills that improve the character in many ways. They’re divided into six types, with each one augmenting the character in a different way: General, Advance, Attack Spec, Defense Spec, Tactical Spec, and Special. Only one mastery in each tier can be equipped, but you can switch the chosen Mastery at any time.

, General Masteries are basically the first tier of skill masteries available and improves your first set of skills. They are unlocked at level 14. Advanced Masteries, in return, improve on the latter set of skills, and is unlocked at level 19.

, Attack Spec, Defense Spec, Tactical Spec, and Special masteries are unlocked at levels 17, 22, 23, and 41, respectively. Attack Spec passively improves the basic attack stats, Defense Spec improves the basic defense stats, Tactical Spec adds chances to either debuff enemies or buff the character, and Special deals with improving Combo Skills from subclasses and giving minor stat bonuses.

, You can also buy Masteries from the Masters in Navea for Tokens, or find some in high-level dungeons. Keep in mind that you’ll need an absurd amount of Tokens (gained from doing quests) and a high level just to afford those, much less reach the level requirements.

"
"
Find the Envoy's Path options.,
Level up.,
Unlock your bonuses.",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom5," The Envoy’s Path system works by making you choose some stat bonuses and skills from a “map,” sort of like a modified version of the skill trees normally used in games. You can access it from the Character menu, which you can access by either clicking “C” or by clicking on the helmeted icon on the lower part of your screen, then clicking the Envoy's Path button.

, New bonuses and abilities can only be selected from squares directly adjacent to squares you have already unlocked as you levelled up, and the best abilities and the abilities for sub-weapons are available on the farthest sides of the map.

, To unlock a bonus, left-click on a darkened icon (and not the “locked” ones), then click “Confirm.” If you’re having second thoughts or made a mistake while selecting, as long as you haven’t clicked on “Confirm” yet, you can just click “Undo,” which will reset your choices. If you made the mistake of pressing “Confirm” as well, you can press “Reset,” but doing so will cost you quite a lot of money.

Buy some base food.,
Improve your food via Fusion.,
Improve with Manual Cooking.",How to Become Stronger in Aura Kingdom6," If all else fails, just grab something to eat! Each town has a specialty food item you can buy from the Chef NPCs, indicated by a hat icon hovering above them. Certain food items have certain stats they boost, like how a Golden Fried Chicken bought in Crescent Hill can improve your DMG by 231 points for an hour or how the Enthralling Baumkuchen of Demarech Mines boosts your Speed by 408 points for 30 minutes.

, If you can find some ingredients, like Fragrant Flowers or Chopped Nuts, from gatherable plants and items in the map, you can improve them even further! For example, the Golden Fried Chicken can be improved by gathering some Crescent Vanilla from the Crescent Flowers growing about near town and in the Flower Fields. If you right-click on the Crescent Vanilla, you’ll be taken to the Fusion screen, and when you click “Fuse,” you’ll be given a random improved version of your chicken. The quality, from lowest to highest, is green, orange, purple, then finally gold. Do note that fusing yourself some food costs money, in addition to what you paid to buy the food item to begin with.


Some recipes, like the Double-Colored Biscuits of Cactakara Forest and the Enthralling Baumkuchen of Demarech Mines require 2 ingredients, one of which is found in other areas. You can usually figure which ingredient can be used to improve which food item, but you won’t know if it needs another ingredient until you try to fuse the food and the ingredient.

, If you have money to spare and good reflexes, you can buy some Cooking Utensils from the Chefs for 1 Gold each. This will unlock the Manual Cooking option, which lets you play a minigame for a sure chance to get high-quality foods if you succeed. Each recipe has it’s own required tool, classified as Speed (knife), Complex (kitchen set), and Skill (skillet) recipes. You can figure out what tools to use by hovering over the “Unidentified (food name)” item in the Result area in the Fusion menu. Equip your desired tool with a right-click, then choose “Manual Cooking” to get started. You still need to pay the fee to cook, though.


The cooking minigame is simple enough: just click on the wrong ingredient, as indicated at the start of the game, before it reaches the red line at the left side of the minigame screen. The less wrong ingredients go through the line, the better the quality. And if you end the minigame with a full bar, you even get two gold-level food items instead of one!

It is advisable to open the Quest Log when you're in the City or Town to avoid being attacked by monsters.;
, To get in a dungeon, simply press the Dungeon tab found on your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Simply click on the dungeon you want to enter and then press “Start Dungeon,” or hit F8 on your keyboard.


This will automatically assign you to a party, but if you're already in a party, choose “Start with current members” instead.

, Some quests require dungeon runs to be completed under a certain difficulty. To change the dungeon difficulty, after opening the Dungeon Selection window and choosing a dungeon you want to enter, look at the menu to your right; here you can see the description of the dungeon and the dungeon difficulty.


You get to choose from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard; just click on the difficulty you want the dungeon to be.
Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level.

, For Rena to become a Ranger, she must be level 15 or higher to have the Ranger quest available in the Quest Log.


If you’re already a Ranger, you can skip this entire part and proceed to Part 3: Taking the Trapping Ranger Quest.

, Open your Quest Log, which can be found at the bottom right of your screen. Look for the Ranger quest and click on it to accept it.

, After accepting the Ranger quest, head straight to Underground Waterway and kill 7 Mickey the Mice; this should be done under Very Hard mode; otherwise, killing Mickeys won't be counted.


This can be done in a party. If your party member killed a Mickey, that too will be counted.

, After completing your first quest, go to the next dungeon, which is the Suburbs of Wally's Castle. All you need to do is clear the dungeon in any level you desire.


There’s no need for you to have a higher dungeon run grade. As long as you have successfully finished the dungeon, this part of the quest will be completed.

, Look for Hoffman in Elder Village. He's the Village's Equipment NPC, which can be found at the top right of the map. Talk to him about the quest and he will give you the third test.

, After talking to Hoffman, head back to the Suburbs of Wally's Castle and clear the dungeon once again, but this time, under Hard mode.


You can invite your friends for a party raid or join randomly with other players.
After completing this quest, open your Quest Log to complete your Ranger chain quest and become a full-fledge Ranger.

, After becoming a Ranger, look for Echo in Elder Village and talk to her about the class advancement.


She will tell you about the monsters in Elder Village and the leader in the final dungeon causing havoc. It's your duty to put an end to this, and as a reward, you will become a Trapping Ranger.
In the option Echo provides, make sure you choose “Trapping Ranger.”

, The first part of your quest is to enter and complete the Suburbs of Wally's Castle under the Very Hard difficulty. Enter the dungeon while in a party to finish this part quickly and easily.


There is no time limit at this point and no grade requirement either.
Leaving the dungeon before you have completed the run won't be counted, so make sure you have cleared the level and killed the boss.

, After clearing the Suburbs of Wally's Castle, it will unlock the next dungeon: Wally's Castle. This is where you'll find Wally No.8, which drops the quest item needed to progress the story.


Enter Wally’s Castle under Very Hard mode, and make sure you're in a party or perhaps seek help from your friends with higher levels. Fortunately, there is no time limit or grade requirement, so take your time in finishing the dungeon.
It is best to enter every floor to find mini bosses as they drop valuable rare items that are useful in boosting up your damage and defense.
Take note that the drop rate of the quest item can be very low. Reruns is required until you obtain the item you need. After doing a couple of reruns and still there's no quest item drop, double-check if you have set the difficulty to Very Hard. Sometimes players forget to change the level.

, Once you have completed the quest, you can return to Echo to hand in the items, or simply open the Quest Log by pressing “Q” on your keyboard, click on the Class Advancement quest, and then click “Complete Quest.” This will automatically change your class to Trapping Ranger.


If for some reason your character didn't advance to Trapping Ranger after completing the Quest, simply log off then log in again. Sometimes the server is too busy to register the new update of your character class.

, Like other classes, Trapping Ranger will give you a new set of combo skills that can be used against enemies in PvP and dungeon. One new combo is the Jump Dash.


Run towards your opponent by pressing the arrow key in their direction, press Up to jump, and then tap Z twice on your keyboard; this will make Rena run, jump, and then slash while in mid-air using her new weapon: the dagger ( >> or <<, Up, Z, Z ).
This is useful for enemies who try to escape from you or charge at you while airborne. An easy yet very effective skill with countering attacks.

, Most Rena users enjoy using Dash as this class moves fast and is very flexible. A Trapping Ranger, however, can use her dagger after a dash towards her enemy. Not only does it cause the enemy to flinch, but it also inflicts huge physical damage.


To execute, press the arrow key toward your enemy twice, hit Z to kick the enemy, and then X to slash ( << or >>, Z, X ).

, With the use of flexibility and the dagger, Trapping Rangers can execute a simple tap combo, which causes great physical damage and ends with a stronger attack that will knock down the enemy.


Simply press Z five times, stunning the enemy and making them vulnerable to combos that will follow ( Z, Z, Z, Z, Z ).

When the game starts, only build villagers.,
In the second Age, try to make the most villagers, because you need all the resources now.,
Important: Think about some military too.,
In the third age, start spending your resources.,
Try to make some troops and upgrade the units you use.,
The fourth age shouldn't be much about resources; it should be more about defense and offense.,
In the fifth age, upgrade everything so you are fully equipped for a fight.,
Now that you have upgraded everything, you should be ready for an attack.,
Don't hesitate to spend much resources.",How to Make a Very Good Economy in Age of Empires 3," Let's say you have 5 villagers. 3 of them should go for food and the other 2 for wood. Gold is unimportant at the start of the game because in a normal game, gold is not needed at the start. Collect food and use the food for new villagers. About 2/3 of the villagers should be collecting food and 1/3 should be collecting wood in the first Age. Important: Try to collect food from sheep first and don't build fields, they use up too much wood. When you step into the next Age, you should send some villagers to collect gold.;
, Your food-collectors should now have killed all the sheep or other animals and you should have enough wood to build a field. Also build a market because you can increase the speed of collecting food, wood and gold. Try now to build as much villagers as possible so you can build more fields and also send more villagers to mines where they can collect gold.

, Build one barrack and build some Infantry just in case the enemy wants to disturb your economy and you can't afford that when the game started. So always have this in mind. Always look for upgrades from your home-town so your villagers can collect everything faster. The faster you get resources the faster you will have an army.

, Try to build up a small army but continue building villagers. Try having many villagers and it really pays off because you will get many resources fast. In the third age you should really watch for upgrading everything and build all the buildings. Upgrade your troops. Now you will need gold. Try to collect as much gold as you can from the gold-mines and not from plantation. Plantation is good but not as fast as gold-mines. So you want to use the mines. (Tips on how to build good gold-outposts you can read in my other guide: ""How to build good outposts for gold-mines in Age of Empires 3"")

, Keep your economy running and don't hesitate to build more villagers. You should have two fields with 10 villagers each, so you won't get out of food. Try having many villagers for collecting wood because you won't get it as fast as the other resources. For gold you can use about 10 to 15 villagers.

, Try to build a real army and keep collecting all the resources. When you realize that there aren't gold-mines anymore, start to build plantation. It's slow but better than nothing. If you have enough wood, use some villagers who are collecting wood to build a new plantation and don't use food to build new villagers. Upgrade everything and build your army (Tips on how to build an army you can find in my guide: ""How to build a good balanced army in Age of Empires 3"").

, Develop everything in the church and in the smith because there are really good upgrades that will help your military.

, Mostly in the ""war-time"" you will have some gold problems because cannons and such cost so much gold. So focus on gold with plantation and factories. If you have enough food, try to use the villagers from the fields/mills to collect gold in plantations.

, You need the resources so don't just watch at the numbers, use them! You can always build troops or something that you need. Keep practicing and arrange the resources depending upon situation. Sometimes you have to build military because the enemy is attacking you. But if your economy is good, you gain resources fast and can push the enemy back and attack him after.

This chain quest is a requirement to open the next leg of the class advancement where you get to choose Weapon Taker. If you have done the Taker chain quest already, see part 2; if not, proceed to the next step.;
, There are different buttons at the lower-right side of the screen, all with different features. Click the button with exclamation point (!) as an icon. A window will appear showing the list of On-going and Available Quests.


The Quest Log can also be opened by pressing Q on your keyboard.
It is recommended that you're in a city or town when opening the Quest Log to avoid being attacked by monsters.

, Just click on the quest name to accept and begin the quest.

, These monsters are found in the Suburbs of Wally's Castle. Just enter the dungeon and kill 9 of them.


You can enter the dungeon on any mode. The quest can be done with or without party members, and there is no time limit.
If you're unable to kill 9 Jangos in one dungeon run, you can enter the dungeon again to kill the rest.
To enter a dungeon, simply press the “Dungeon” tab found on your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter and then press “Start Dungeon,” or hit F8 on your keyboard. This will automatically assign you to a party, but if you're already in a party, choose “Start with current members” instead.
To change dungeon difficulty or mode, after choosing a dungeon you want to enter, look to the right of the menu. Here you can choose the dungeon difficulty: Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level.

, After completing your first quest, head back to the Elder Village and meet Echo the Alchemist. Echo is the white-haired girl found at the upper-right part of the map; she is standing a little to the left of the Blacksmith.


Echo will explain something to you regarding your next set of quests. Accept the quest, and then head out to enter another dungeon for two more tasks.

, To finish this quest, you must clear the Suburb of Wally's Castle under Very Hard difficulty. The Secret Letter is dropped by the dungeon boss after you kill it, and along the way to the boss, you must kill at least 18 Bomber Mongs.


There are chances that you won't be able to complete the quest in one dungeon run, so keep on entering the same dungeon under the same difficulty.
You can complete this task while within a party, which is far more easier than doing solo.

, Right after you have obtained the Secret Letter and killed 18 Bomber Mongs, return to Elder Village and report to Echo. She will reward you and change Raven's class to Taker.

, After you have completed your Taker chain quest, open your Quest Log by pressing Q on your keyboard. With the completed Taker quest, you are now allowed to select which class advancement you want Raven to have.


Raven can become Over Taker, Sword Taker, or Weapon Taker. Choose Weapon Taker to begin the quest to become one.

, Lenphad is the muscular-looking man with blond hair standing at the upper-right corner of Elder Village. He's also known as the Equipment Shop Owner, the NPC where you get to repair your equipment or purchase weaponry and armor.


Talk to Lenphad to bring up a menu; select “Quest” from the options, and he will give you a set of quests to complete.

, This item is a drop from the boss of the Suburbs of Wally's Castle, William Phoru. To begin, enter the dungeon under Very Hard difficulty, clear up the monsters on each floor quickly, then kill the boss.


The drop rate for this quest item is pretty low, so you might have to a couple of dungeon reruns until William Phoru drops Blueprint.
You may skip a few floors and go straight to the boss.

, After obtaining the Blueprint, your next objective is to complete Wally’s Castle under Very Hard mode and defeat the final boss, Wally 8, to obtain his Mechanism Core.


Being in a party is much preferred to complete the quest quickly.
There's no time limit for this quest, and it's much advisable to clear every floor of the dungeon to get a higher chance of picking up rare weapons and equipment.

, After you have completed Wally’s Castle, return to Lenphad to hand in the items and he will then change your class to Weapon Taker.


If for some reason your character didn't change to Weapon Taker after handing in the quest items, log off then log in again. There are times that the server lags due to the high volume of players playing the game. Entering a dungeon or exiting the city works as well.

, The unique ability for a Weapon Taker is the Overheat state, which can only be triggered when the same action button is pressed 5 times. For the Overheat Barrage, press X repeatedly to execute a combo where Raven fires bullets to his enemy. Rather than pressing five times before unleashing his Overheat state, the combo will trigger at the third X you press ( X, X, X, X, X).


Continuing pressing X will increase the damage, plus the bonus damage coming from the overheat state.
Keep in mind that while under Overheat, your character HP decreases.

, To execute, simply press the directional arrow twice (toward the enemy), then Up to jump, followed by Z, and X twice; Raven will slash then release an explosive magic to inflict damage (Left, Left or Right, Right, Up, Z, X, X).

, This combo can be done two different ways:


First, after pressing Z three times, you can execute using two Xs, which will unleash a magic attack after taking a step away from the enemy (Z, Z, Z, X, X).
Second, press a directional arrow towards the enemy, followed by two Xs to roll towards the opponent then grab him, which will inflict high physical damage (directional arrow towards enemy, X, X).
The second way is useful for tricking enemies into believing that you're taking a step backward, forcing them to go after you. Instead, they will be grabbed and then received damage.

To begin selecting a civilization, on the AoE3 main menu, click “Single Player” or “Multiplayer,” depending on the game mode you want. This will bring up the Home Cities page.;
,, This allows the player to easily have a high villager count.

French—Special villagers called Coureurs gather resources faster than the villagers of other civs.

Russians—Villagers train in sets of three as opposed to one by one in other civs. This allows the player to easily acquire a high villager count.

Ottoman—Villagers spawn automatically without the player's intervention, and for free.

Germans—Settler wagons are produced along with normal villagers. These settler wagons allow very quick gathering of resources.

, Click the building where you want Home City shipments to be delivered. Buildings that qualify include Town Centers, Castles, and Outposts.


Click the “Deliver Home City Shipments Here” button. This is the button with the picture of a house and a red arrow on it.

, Do this by pressing the Home City hotkey (H) or click the Home City button (the button with your civ’s flag above the resources stockpile on the bottom left of the game screen).


The Home City Window displays the cards you can use to send free shipments from the Home City to aid your developing colony.

, During the game, using military cards from your Home City will delay having to spend resources on military for as long as you can. The number and type of military cards depends on the civilization you are using to play the game and also on the age your colony is in. For instance, for the Germans:


In Age Two: 3 Doppelsoldners + 2 Uhlans | 5 Uhlans | 2 Outpost Wagons | 4 Landsknecht Mercenaries
In Age Three: 7 Skirmishers + 3 Uhlans | 8 Uhlans | 3 War Wagons + 3 Uhlans | a Falconet + 3 Uhlans | a Fort Wagon
In Age Four: 9 Skirmishers + 3 Uhlans

, Position the military units sent over from the Home City in defensive positions around your colony, or use them to launch minor assaults on enemy colonies.

,


The Market building provides early economic upgrades for your villagers without which your economy simply cannot boom. Click an idle villager to select him and then press the hotkeys B followed by M to construct a Market (costs 100 Wood).

, Its command panel will appear at the bottom right corner of the screen with icons for various technologies for improving your villagers.

, To discover what upgrade each icon represents, hover your mouse over the icons to produce tooltips. Here are the technologies together with their costs and the age your colony is required to be in so the upgrade can commence:



Gang Saw (Age One; costs 100 Food)—Villagers gather Wood 10% faster

Log Flume (Age Two; costs 150 Food & 250 Coin)—Villagers gather Wood a further 20% faster

Circular Saw (Age Three; costs 240 Food & 480 Coin)—Villagers gather Wood a further 30% faster

Hunting Dogs (Age One; costs 50 Wood & 50 Coin)—Villagers gather Food from Hunted Animals 10% faster

Steel Traps (Age Two; costs 125 Wood & 125 Coin)—Villagers gather Food from Hunted Animals 20% faster

Placer Mines (Age One; costs 75 Food & 75 Wood)—Villagers gather Coin from Mines 10% faster

Amalgamation (Age Two; costs 250 Food & 200 Wood)—Villagers gather Coin from Mines 20% faster

, Of great importance to booming is upgrading economic buildings so they perform at their best in terms of producing resources. First, perform Mill upgrades:


Research Seed Drill (Age II; costs 150 Wood & 150 Coin)—Click your Mill to select it (hotkey Ctrl + I) and click the Seed Drill button (a picture of an antique seed drill). This will allow villagers to gather food from Mills at a +15% rate.
Research Artificial Fertilizer (Age III; costs 335 Wood & 335 Coin)—Click the Artificial Fertilizer button (features a picture of a sack with fertilizer in it). This will increase the rate at which food is gathered from Mills a further 30%.

, This upgrade enables livestock to fatten 25% faster at the Livestock Pen.

,


Research Bookkeeping (Age III; costs 300 Food & 300 Wood)—Press the hotkey Ctrl + L to go to your Plantation, and then click the icon of a book. This upgrade increases Plantation coin gathering rates by 10%.
Research Refineries (Age IV; costs 600 Food & 600 Wood)—Click the icon of smelted gold being poured from a container to another. This upgrade increases Plantation coin gathering rates by 10%.

Create villagers.,
Have you villagers gather Wood.,
Instruct your villagers to build houses.,
Build the houses faster.",How to Increase the Population Limit in Age of Empires1," Villagers (or Settlers, depending on which version of AoE you are playing) are required to gather Wood for constructing houses, and they are also the units that do the actual construction of buildings.


To create, or train, villagers, select the Town Center by left-clicking it. A panel will be displayed in the bottom-left or right corner of the screen containing buttons for all the functions that the Town Center can perform.
The first button on the panel is always the “Create Villager” button, and will usually have a picture of a worker on it. Click this button as many times as the number of villagers you want to create.
Villagers cost resources to create, the amount and type of which depends on the version of AoE you are playing. For instance, in AoE 3, a villager usually costs 100 Food to create.
If your colony is already at its population limit, you cannot create additional villagers. In this case, use the villagers you already have by taking them off other tasks. If you don’t have any villagers at all, you can lower your population by sending your military to war so that some of them get killed off.;
, Houses usually cost Wood, the amount of which depends on which version of the game you are playing. In AoE 3 for example, a house costs 100 Wood. If you don’t have this resource, have your villagers gather from forested areas on the map.

, If you have the Wood and the villagers required, command them to build houses. Left-click a villager to select it, and from the panel that appears, select the first icon to build a house.


Move the mouse to position the building’s foundation where you want it built, then left-click to place the foundation. The villager will immediately start constructing the house. When the house has been constructed, your population limit will increase by 10 (one house supports 10 population).
You can have one villager build many houses by placing multiple house foundations. When they have finished building the first, they will move to the next and so on until all the houses have been constructed.
If you still need to increase your population even further, build more houses. Note that you can only build a maximum of 20 houses—you cannot increase your population limit beyond 200 by building houses in AoE 3.

, If you want the job done faster, you can allocate multiple villagers to the construction work. To do this, select them by holding the Ctrl key while left-clicking each villager and then click the house icon on the build panel. When you place the foundation, all the villagers you had selected will start building the house and will complete it much faster.

Immediately build a Town Center with at least three lumberjacks.,
Research Heavy Plow.,
Allocate villagers to stone.,
Build the required building(s).,
Prepare to defend yourself against rushers.,
Trade resources in the market.,
Once you have the necessary resources, click on the Imperial Age button in your Town Center.",How to Get Into The Imperial Age on Age of Empires 2," Building another Town Center is an important step towards not only a good economy, but also makes the Imperial Age requirement easier to achieve.


During the Castle Age, more Town Centers should be built to further increase villager production.





;
, This is found at the mill and makes farms last longer. This makes it easier on the lumberjacks, as wood is in great demand in the Castle Age.


Additionally, you need to create more farms. More farms should be built around the first Town Center, and farms should be created around the second (and subsequent) Town Center. Farms can also be created around the mill, although this is less safe, as the villagers are more vulnerable to rushers.






Also research Bow Saw and Gold Mining.







, Castles are expensive (650 stone) and it is important that in the Castle Age that you build a castle. A mining camp should be built next to a stone mine and Stone Mining should be researched.


This does not mean that you should ignore your other villagers, however. Along with farms being built, villagers should also be allocated to wood and especially gold.







, If you are not building a castle as the Imperial Age requirement (but perhaps in the future), two good buildings to build are the University and the Siege Workshop (which cost a combined 400 wood, 200 each). Also good are the University and the Monastery (375 wood total).


Building more barracks is highly recommended, even if you are not an infantry civilization. Upgrade to Pikemen and Long Swordsmen.







, There are two main categories of rushers in the Castle Age: early Castle rushers and late Castle rushers.

Early castle rushers typically send knights and a few battering rams early in the castle age (before 22:00). Knights dominate in the Castle Age and there is no other unit that can kill it one on one (assuming default armor and attack, full HP).
Pikemen, infantry that counter cavalry, are the answer to the knight problem. While pikemen cannot take on knights one on one, they find strength through numbers. Initially, the knights will be winning, but as you continue to create more and more pikemen, they will eventually prevail because of the consequences for the rusher of losing too many knights. Research Squires if you can, as it helps with defending a lot.






Long Swordsmen can take down the battering rams, but not the Town Center garrison by themselves due to the ram's virtual immunity to arrows.
Camels are another unit that counter cavalry but are expensive. They will also lose in a one on one with knights. They generally should be avoided as a defensive unit.






The main disadvantage with the knights is of their high cost: 60 food, 75 gold. Prominent is the 75 gold requirement. Losing too many knights would be food and gold wasted that could've gone into researching the Imperial Age.






Late castle rushers are much more varied. As it is pretty late into the game where the military starts to dominate, armies can very dramatically. It is important to take advantage of your civilization's strong points, as well as creating more pikemen to fend off the knights. Other units that you could create are long swordsmen, mangonels, crossbowmen, and cavalry archers (created at the Archery Range, not the Stable).






Knights of your own should also be created to attack your enemy's lumberjacks, miners, etc. in an effort to slow down their economy.
Scorpions can be useful support weapons in defending against a late castle rush. As the bolts penetrate multiple layers of units, their damage can be amplified.







, Use the market to your advantage - you can brute force the 1000 food or 800 gold requirement.

, The research takes a few minutes.


A common goal in researching the Imperial Age that neglects your military (Wonder Race) is 25:00. Consider this an absolute zero - if you develop your military in any way, you will miss this goal. It takes practice to shorten the time you reach Imperial Age. The times can vary from 25:00 to 31:00, and that is what you should be aiming for.

Use the scout to find .,
Assign your existing villagers to food gathering and building a few houses.,
Create at least 6 extra villagers.,
Build a fishing dock and start fishing.,
Advance to Feudal Age (Age II).,
Start gathering Gold.,
Advance to later ages.",How to Get More Tech Points in Age of Empires1," Food is the primary resource required to move your way up the ages in Age of Empires 2, so make it your mission to gather as much and as quickly as you can.


At the start of the game, you are provided with a cavalry scout. Use the scout to quickly explore the area near your Town Center for food by moving him around the unexplored areas.
There usually are a few sheep in the unexplored areas close to the Town Center. Send those back to the Town Center so villagers can gather food from them while easily storing it there.
Also be on the lookout for cherry bushes, which are another source of food.;
, Have 2 of the 3 villagers you are provided with at the start of the game gather food while the third builds two houses with the 200 Wood you are initially provided with. The houses will allow you to accommodate extra population as you try to create more villagers.


As soon as the houses are built, reassign the builder to food gathering.

, Using the food gathered by the initial 3 villagers, create at least 6 more villagers.


Assign 4 of these to food gathering and 2 to woodcutting. Now you have 7 villagers gathering food.

, You had 200 Wood at the start of the game, and at this point, 60 has been used to build 2 houses. Together with the Wood gathered by the two villagers assigned to the woodcutting, you should by now have around 300 Wood.


Explore the area using the scout cavalry to find the sea.
Use 150 Wood to construct a fishing dock and the remainder to create two fishing ships (at 75 Wood each).
Command the fishing ships to fish. You can do this by left-clicking the ship to select it and then right-clicking a part of the sea with fish (you will see them jumping about in the water).

, Assign any spare villagers you have to gathering, and as soon as you have more than 500 food, go to the Town Center and click the “Age Up” button. This will start the process of advancing your colony to Feudal Age (Age II).

, This resource will be needed to level up to higher ages. Just select or create a few more villagers and have them mine the boulders with yellow streaks on them, which you will find in areas nearby.

, The next ages after the Dark Age that your colony is initially in are Feudal Age (costs 500 food), Castle Age (costs 800 food and 200 Gold), and finally, Imperial Age (costs 1000 food and 800 Gold). Continue having your villagers gather resources for the cost of aging up, and once you’ve had enough resources, just go to the Town Center and click the “Age Up” button.


Advancing your age in AoE2 costs significant amounts of resources (food and Gold), and the more resources you spend, the more the Tech points you will have at the end of the game.
Advancing your age also makes more technologies available for researching. The more technologies you research, the more the resources you will use up, and the more the Tech points you will earn.

A Stable costs various amounts of Wood in the different versions of Age of Empires (i.e., 175 Wood in AoE3, 175 Wood in AoE2, and 150 Wood in AoE1).

, Horseback units—like the scout cavalry in AoE1 and 2, and the hussar in AoE3—are the fastest moving in the game, and they have the line of sight required to make exploration an easy job.


Left-click the Stable to select it. On the the building’s command panel (which appears on the bottom left corner of the screen for AoE2 and earlier versions, and on the bottom right corner for AoE3), click any icon that shows a horseback cavalryman to create them.
Once created, the unit will appear in front of the stable.

Explore the game world to discover treasures.,
Determine if claiming the treasure would give you XP.,
Kill Treasure Guardians, if any.,
Collect the treasure and earn your XP.,
Check your XP.",How to Get More Experience Points in Age of Empires1," Treasures include resources like Food, Coin, or Wood, and unique units like pet bears and dogs that appear on the landscape and that are often guarded by Treasure Guardians. Some of them are worth lots of XP, like the “Journal of El Pollo Guopo” on the Texas map worth 320 XP.


Move your explorer around in the unexplored areas of the map by left-clicking him and then right-clicking the area where you want him to go.
Keep doing this until you find a treasure. Just looking at the treasure should be enough to tell you what it is as. For instance, if the treasure is Wood, you will see blocks of wood lying on the spot where the treasure is.;
, Do this by hovering your mouse on the treasure. A tooltip will appear that will inform if and what amount of XP the treasure is worth.


Keep looking till you find a treasure with XP. Treasures with XP are the ones that don’t have Food, Wood, or Gold.

, If a treasure is has guardians, they will be out in the open, hovering about the treasure. Evaluate the level of military power it would take to kill the Treasure Guardians guarding that particular treasure. Their type, number ,and power depends on the value of the treasures they guard.


Usually, your explorer is able to easily kill one guardian. If the treasure is guarded by just one, just kill the guardian by left-clicking your explorer and right-clicking it.
If the treasure is guarded by many guardians, however, they may overpower and kill your explorer. Direct some of your military units to the area to assist your explorer.

, As soon as all the Treasure Guardians have been eliminated, your explorer’s ability to collect will activate. Select your explorer and then right-click the treasure to collect it. The respective amount of XP will be added to your total XP.


You cannot claim a treasure unless all of its guardians are dead.
Besides your explorer, the only other unit that can collect treasures is a settler (villager).

, You can check the progress of your XP by checking the green XP bar next to the Home City button (a button that features the flag of the player’s Home City) near the bottom-left corner of the screen. Each time the XP bar fills up, an additional help shipment is ready for you to request from the Home City.


Hovering your mouse over the XP bar will display a tooltip that will inform you exactly how much more XP you need towards your next shipment. For instance, if you needed 400 XP, and you claimed the “Journal of El Pollo Guopo” for 320 XP, you would then require only 80 XP.

Find a trading post site on the trade route.,
Build a trading post on the site.",How to Get More Experience Points in Age of Empires2," Trade routes are predetermined paths in the AoE3 game world with designated sites where the player can build Trading Posts to gather XP.


Move your explorer around in the unexplored areas of the map by left-clicking him and then right-clicking the area where you want him to go.
Keep doing this until you find a trade route. Trade routes have the unmistakable appearance of windy gravel paths on the landscape.

, Once you find a trade route, have your explorer follow it till you see what looks like an unfinished building foundation next to the path. That is the site on which any player may construct a trading post.

, First, make sure you have the required resources for constructing a trade post, which is 250 Wood. You can gather wood by commanding your villagers to chop down trees in the game world.

Have the most military units by the end of any Age of Empires 3 game.,
Win any Age of Empires 3 game.",How to Get More Experience Points in Age of Empires3," This will earn you 500 XP at the end of the game. Economic resources are Food, Wood, and Gold. You can gather more resources than your rivals by ensuring you have a greater team of villagers, meticulously allocating them to the gathering tasks and making sure they never stay idle for long.

, This will earn you 500 XP at the end of the game. You can gather less economic resources (Food, Wood, and Gold) than your rivals by ensuring you have a less villagers and using your resources more frugally to eliminate the need to gather a lot.

, This will earn you 500 XP. Military units are any units that you use to attack other colonies or defend yours. You can ensure you have the most military units by adopting a defensive strategy instead of an aggressive one. Create as many military units as you can, but use them to defend your colony rather than attacking other colonies. This will keep loss of units at a minimum.

, This will earn you 2,000 XP at the end of the game. Usually, the way to achieve this is to kill all your enemies.

Decide if you want to build a rescue base.,
So start building a rescue base when you know that your economy is bad, your troops are not that good and the whole structure of your village is impossible to handle, and then start to send villagers to build a rescue base.,
Pick a spot.,
Don't let the enemy realize that you sent villagers to build a new base.,
If you found a good location, build walls to mark how big the base should be.,
The enemy will realize very fast that you have built a new base because he hasn't won already, so he will look for it.",How to Escape and Push Back in Age of Empires 3," First you need to know, when you should even build a rescue base. It's only needed when you are losing and it will give you a second chance. But you have to realize it early that you have to build a base, because when the enemy already destroyed nearly everything it's too late.;
, Send about 20 – 50 villagers to build a base. You will need them immediately. It would be good to be in the 4th age, where you can build new town centers to make villagers.

, The location is a very important aspect. You need an area on the map that has trees to collect wood and it should be a flat area where you can build some buildings. It should also not be too near to your enemy because he is still in the advantage and he can destroy you when he finds the base too early.

, Stay with your troops at your main village to make him think you want to defend your village. Also you can keep him busy and he won't search for survivors because he wants to destroy everything. Send your villagers out of your village, where the enemy has no units. If he sees just one villager running away, he will attack him and find the others. So be sneaky.

, Do not make it too small. Use some space because you need to build mills, plantation etc because you have to keep producing resources. When the wall is built, you build a town center and about two mills. Start producing villagers to collect wood and building plantation. At the same time, normally your main village or at least your troops should have been defeated by the enemy and he will destroy everything there. So now it's time to build troops. Build barracks and stables. You won't need cannons right now, they cost too much gold. Be prepared for an attack!

, You have to build troops because when he finds the base, he will attack immediately and you have to push him back. When he attacks you, try to stay behind your walls and don't move out. Use your resources for military and build units the whole time, even when he is attacking you at the moment. If you won the fight, you ""restarted"" the game. Normally he will destroy you because he has more resources than you, but sometimes you can win with this strategy. You need to have some experience already to do this very effectively, but when you try, you learn and get better.


With some skill and planning you can push back really hard. It's all about time management and controlling your opponent. With these strategies you can easily win.

Ringing the Town Bell is a strategy best used when the colony is under attack and will immediately command your villagers to stop working and garrison. You can, however, use it at any time.
Ringing the Town Bell will make your villagers garrison inside the nearest building that has garrisoning ability, not just the Town Center. This includes buildings such as Towers and Castles. If your villagers are too far away from a building that has garrisoning ability, they won’t garrison when you ring the Town Bell. You may have to manually garrison them.

, Once you’ve collected 100 Burning Hearts, go back to Prontera and talk to Hainrich again.


As promised, he will tell you the information regarding his research. Choose the option that shows you're interested about his discovery, and then ask him if you can go investigate the traces he found. He will then give you the information and location of these traces.

, By opening your Quest Window (Alt + U), you will find information on the traces, which you can find in Glast Heim.

, In order for you to reach Glast Heim, you can either warp to Geffen using a Kafra service or ask a Priest to warp you there.

This will trigger a quest, and a dialogue will appear, activating the trace that was mentioned to you by Hainrich.

, This is the easy part. All you have to do is approach the marks on your mini map, and then right-click the traces to obtain the evidence you need.


Keep in mind that you may get stones on your failed attempts.

, Continue clicking on other traces until you obtain a piece of Cloth of a Saint.

, Once you have the piece of cloth, return to Hainrich in Protera and talk to him.


Remember, always dismount from your Peco Peco whenever you talk to Hainrich; otherwise, he won't honor your conversation.
After talking to Hainrich, he will take the cloth from you and give you the Shield of King.

, You can read the hidden texts on the shield by pressing Alt + U. This will open your quest window where it will state a certain location in Glast Heim.

, Back to Glast Heim, approach the building surrounded with water. This time, however, do not climb the stairs. Walk to the side of the water to your right and continue on until you reach the end. There you will find a beaming light by the bushes.

, These words will appear: “Memory of King Schmidtz.”

, Click on the words and a dialog box will appear with a set of questions; simply choose the best one that shows you're ready to be a Royal Guard.

, After the dialogue, your job will automatically change into Royal Guard.

, Head back to Elder Village then open your Quest Log. There you will see a quest titled “Guardian Advancement”; click it to see the information on the quest, and then accept it.


The Quest Log is the exclamation point (!) icon at the lower-right side of the screen. You can also press Q on your keyboard to open the Quest Log. Once you click on the exclamation point or press Q, a window will appear showing the list of On-going and Available Quests.
It is advisable to open the Quest Log in the cities or towns to avoid being attacked by monsters.

, The first task you have to do is enter the Suburbs of Wally's Castle on any difficulty to defeat the boss, William the Phoru. Collect one drop item from William after killing him, which you will need later on.


You can enter this dungeon under any difficulty, but it's best to enter under the Very Hard for a chance to obtain rare items.
To enter a dungeon, simply click on the Dungeon tab found on your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter, and then click “Start Dungeon” (or hit F8 on your keyboard). This will automatically assign you to a party, but if you're already in a party, choose “Start with current members” instead.
To change the dungeon difficulty, after opening the Dungeon window and choosing the dungeon you want to enter, look at the menu to your right; here you can see the description of the dungeon and the dungeon difficulty. You get to choose from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level.

, After you have killed William and collected a drop item from him, look for Lenphad in Elder Village and hand the drop item to him.


Lenphad can be found at the upper-right side of the village; he's the village Blacksmith, a huge man standing a few steps away from the Alchemist.
Click on him to talk, and then select “Quest.”

, At this point, there are two more tasks: kill William under Hard mode and complete the Suburbs of Wally’s Castle under Very Hard mode. You can do these tasks in one dungeon run; just enter the Suburbs of Wally’s Castle under Very Hard mode and kill William at the end of the run.


It's highly advisable to enter the dungeon with a party to complete this round quickly and to have a higher chance of survival.
There is no time limit or grade required, so take your time and enter every room to get rid of mini bosses for rare items.

, After you have completed the tasks, return to Elder Village and talk to Lenphad to become a Guardian.


Alternatively, you can simply open your Quest Log by pressing Q on your keyboard and then clicking on “Complete quest.”

, Now that you have completed the first leg of the chain, you can choose one of the three advanced classes for your character. Select Shooting Guardian in your Quest Log and then click “Proceed.”


After accepting the quest, you will receive another set of tasks, but these are much more difficult and requires a lot of time.

, You have to enter Wally's Castle under any difficulty; however, you're required to clear the dungeon without receiving not more than 30 hits from the monsters. If you’re hit more than 30 times, you will have to restart the the dungeon run.


There are no time limit and grade requirements.

, After you have completed your first task, return to Elder Village and look for Luichel. She's the Accessory Shop owner in the Elder Village; click on her to talk and then choose “Quest.”


Luichel can be found at the upper-left side of the city. She's standing near the exit portal and is wearing a lovely dress.

, These monsters are found in Wally's Castle. Enter the dungeon under Very Hard mode, and quickly kill off the required number of monsters within 15 minutes.


This is easy to achieve if you have strong party members, and if needed, you can ask your high-level friends to assist you in completing this quest.

, After you have completed Wally’s Castle and killed the monsters, return to Luichel to become a Shooting Guardian.

, Every class advancement in Elsword will give a new addition to your combo. For Shooting Guardian, you will receive Gun Stance, which is similar to Archer's Stance skill; however, this combo is easier to do and more effective when it comes to dealing with fast-moving enemies.


Perform this combo by pressing X, Z, Z simultaneously. Your character will release 3 shots with his pistol then finish it off with a cannon blast, which will inflict massive magic damage to the enemies (X, Z, Z).

, The Shooting Guardian can release 5 shots simultaneously while airborne. Run towards your enemy and then press Up to jump, tricking your enemy to jump after you. While airborne, press X twice to release the Air Shots combo. Your character will unleash 5 shots diagonally, and each will inflict major magical damage (run towards enemy, Up, Z, Z).

, You can dash past your enemy by pressing the arrow key twice in their direction. If you press X three times after that, your character will execute its third combo: after dashing past the enemy, he will turn around to shoot twice with his pistol and then finish off with his cannon (Arrow key towards the enemy twice, X, X, X).


This attack inflicts both physical and magical damage.

Right after talking to Lenphad, he will give you a set of quests—mostly about killing mobs.;
, You can find Bomber Mongs in Wally's Castle; Bomber Mongs are monsters wearing junk parts from the roof; they carry a bag full of bombs.


There are no dungeon difficulty stated, so you can kill them in any dungeon level.
Hunting in a team is also allowed.

, These monsters can be found at the same location: Wally's Castle. Kid Phoru monsters are the ones who uses a torch to burn you while Jango uses melee attack.


This kill quest is only available in Hard or higher dungeon level, so make sure to do this with a party rather than hunting alone.
Both monsters appear in every floor, even summoned at the last floor of the castle.

, After you have completed the quest, go back to Elder Village and speak to the Accessory Shop Owner. She will reward you for your hard work and then give you the last quest for Knighthood.


Before jumping into the quest dungeon, make sure you have bought enough potions and repair all your equipment.

, The last part of the Knighthood quest requires you to complete Wally's Castle within 15 minutes under the Very Hard level. This quest can be done with a party or even with players with higher base level compared to the dungeon.


If you know anyone who is already level 30 or more, you can ask for their help to clear the dungeon before the given time runs out.
After the completion, head back to Luichel, and she will turn you into a Knight.

, Take the Magic Knight quest from the Bulletin Board and then you will given a new set of quests.


Don't forget to repair your equipment before you jump into a dungeon.

, 8. found in Wally's Castle. Wally no. 8 is a mechanical-type boss. He can glide and hit hard if you don't have any proper equipment, so make sure you bought equipment in par with your level.


If you don't have enough money to purchase items, remember equipments are dropped by mobs, so make sure to clear your inventory before doing dungeon runs.
Even in Very Hard difficulty, Wally no. 8 can be taken down quick if you have DPS type in the party; this could be a Mage or an Archer.
You can also ask help from people with higher levels.
The quest can be completed in any difficulty.

, This can be obtained from Mickey in Underground Waterway.


This quest must be done under the Very Hard difficulty or else no Mickey's Tails will be dropped.

, You have to clear the Wally's Castle after gathering the Tails. However, in this quest, you are not given any time limit, but only to finish and obtain B rank or above.


Getting B rank is easy, as long as you kill a lot of monsters, used skills in defeating them, and obtain less damage from enemy attacks.

, This is found in Wally's Castle by killing the Wally's Guardians. This may or may not drop in your first dungeon run, so be ready to do multiple runs.


This is done in Very Hard dungeon level.
You can clear this quest with party members or with the help of higher-level players.

, After you have completed all the quest, return to the city and then click the Bulletin Board. You will be rewarded for our hard work, and your class is now changed to Magic Knight.


If for some reason you're unable to change to your next class regardless of finishing the quest, simply log off then log in again to have the game system register that you have, in fact, cleared the job quest.
After becoming a Magic Knight, your next advance class will be Rune Slayer. Reach at least level 35 to unlock the class change quest.

, This is a very useful skill you'll obtain after switching to Magic Knight class. Players in PvP mode often use this technique to stun their enemy, making them vulnerable to skill attacks or combo. This type of attack also works on monsters to canceling any skill cast or make them flinch to make them open for any combination.


Fireball Dash unleashes a huge fireball skill after running. To execute this skill, simply double tap the arrow button toward your enemy, and while running, press Z, Z, X. When you press Z, your character will slash the opponent after the dash, hitting them twice with 120%–160%. Pressing X will execute the fireball within the combo, unleashing 270% magic damage.
Aerial Fireball is another approach in releasing Fireball attack. This occurs when you jump to avoid any opponent then unleash Fireball while in mid-air. To execute this combo, run toward the enemy by tapping the arrow button and then jump by pressing up, followed by X and Z. By the time you jump and pressed X, your character will swing his sword, damaging any enemies who attempts to jump with you, causing 200% physical damage. At Z, you will release your Fireball, which will cause 200% magic damage. This is best done with fast combo execution.

, As Magic Knight are great with mid-range attacks with their Fireball skills, enemies will attempt on doing more close-range attacks to prevent you from doing more Fireball combo.


Most enemies will now dash toward at you then slash before you could swing your sword. To prevent this, use the Knockback Slash to knock them back, making them fall to the ground and vulnerable to your next combo. Simply tap on the arrows twice toward your enemy's direction to run and then press Z after the dash, followed by two more Z to attack. The first slash will inflict 120% damage if you manage to land a hit on your opponent. 160% for the second attack and 200% physical damage to the third.
This combo also works on some boss.
Use this skill to your advantage, for this increases your chance in surviving the game.

Have a leashed pet, or step on the fewest squares possible. (Except in Minetown, you will probably not want to explore the mine, due to the traps.), Many gray stones are load stones, which is a pain to have, they weigh 500 and by default, you cannot drop it (don't hit watchmen, or you will make them hostile).,, If you encounter a monster, kill and sell!


Pretend Minetown is a shopping mall. At a shopping mall, you probably wouldn't pick lock, kick down a door, dig into a shop, cut down a tree, destroy a fountain, attack shop keepers and police officers, or steal from a shop. Well, same applies to Minetown.

Make a stash. Put extra wands, scrolls, etc. into a chest, lock it, and engrave ""Elbereth"" with a magic marker/magicbane, put the chest inside a room, and lock the room. This will ensure strong security from anything that has a key, anything that can lift a chest, and anything that can go though the wall.

Don't kill shopkeepers. This will decrease your luck, make your god angry, and will be counted as murder.

Go to the lighting store, because there is a 20.6% chance of a magic lamp. They will cost more than normal lamps, and have a chance of showing the message ""You see a puff of smoke"" when you rub it. Rubbing it repeatedly will cause a dent to show up, with a chance of granting you a wish. If you have not paid for the lamp when this happens, the shopkeeper will charge you a usage fee.

Let your dog or cat go inside the food shop There are many tripe rations your pet will treat themselves to, when you are shopping for other foods. Alternatively, get tripe rations yourself (pay for them or find them) and throw them at your pet when you feel the need to reward them (such as when they pick up items in shops and leave them where you can pick the items up without paying for them). Horses should, as a rule, not be let into shops.

Kill monsters and sacrifice the corpses, if there is an altar of your alignment. Converting the altar will turn the priest hostile, and you will most likely not be strong enough to survive their wrath (at least the first time you hit up Minetown).

, The end lies somewhere between 10th and 13th level. There are luckstones, that will increase your luck, and gems., Cockatrice corpses\eggs may be useful for the priest, ""Chat"" to the Oracle for a consultation. You will need some money to do this.,, Repeat the cycle as many times as you like to get even more experience and raise your score.,,, Complete the last puzzle, and kill every animal in the zoo., You get one of the two rewards, a bag of holding or an amulet of reflection. Unfortunately, you don't get to pick which one., You choose. The best will probably be to take the risk, in exchange for a lot of experience points. To attack safely:


Make a small fort, by reading a scroll of earth. Move a boulder to let monsters in.

Fight at the corner, if you don't have a scroll of earth.

Kill fast to reduce the risk of huge crowds. Most monsters in the big room will see you.

Stay near the stairs. Better yet, make your fort at the stairs. Go up if you have major injuries. Continue when healed.

, The portal can be in a vault somewhere between level 10 and Medusa. Not every game has a portal to Fort Ludios., There will be many monsters that have wands.,, The fort has very useful loot in gigantic amounts. Enter though the left end of the fort. Freeze, or float/jump over the moat, blast the door, and get inside., Fight him and the monsters, to go to the other side of the fort.

To make the battle with Croesus easier, don't engage him hand-to-hand.

, You will want to ""search"" to avoid the numerous land mines. Also, inspect the four corners; there will be gems there.

There are around 50,000 gold pieces, half of a strong character's total carrying capacity. Bring a Bag of Holding.

, Be prepared. Bring a lot of food, a lot of armor, and a happy god. Also, you won't need coins., If possible, bring speed boots., ""Chatting"" with your leader will get you quite a lot of hints and tips about what will happen., The quest artifact is very useful, and the bell (Bell of Opening) is required to win., Medusa can turn you into a statue right when you enter her room. If you bring reflection, she will turn herself into a statue., The level is almost filled with water., Eels can drown you, resulting in sudden death., Bring good tools for the great challenge at the Castle and later on., There will be a moat, and you will need to levitate, jump, swim, or walk on the water., Play the notes (letters A–G) on a musical instrument that can play notes. The drawbridge will open, allowing you to pass it and go inside the castle. If you are lazy, use this., It will be in a locked chest in one of the four rooms close to the corners of the castle, with the word ""Elbereth"" burned into the ground there., Watch out for the numerous trap doors. Kill the dragons, and (if possible) make dragon scale mail. ""Search"" at the spot the dragons were, and go into a secret storage area. You will find four rooms filled with food, armor, weapons, and gems., Congratulations for making it through the Dungeons of Doom!"

Be proud if you reach the stairs., In particular, bring a good cloak; this will mostly protect you from life drainers. Make sure spellcasters don't surround you with summoned monsters., Think twice before pressing a key. Remember, this game is not in real-time; you could leave the computer, go to sleep, and the monsters still wouldn't be able to attack you., This time your goal is to get to the end, not to try to find wands. Not while an arch-lich is poking your back with the Magicbane., This will make things much easier.,, Wraiths are common in the Valley of the Dead, but they rarely leave corpses there so you might want to lure them to a lower level.,, You will have to go through it again later on your way out when you don't have time to kill many monsters., There is a temple in the Valley of the Dead. If you haven't yet, buy protection there. Vampires will also not attack you while you are on an altar, but you shouldn't need that by now.,,, Vlad is infamously easy for such a late-game enemy, so anything should work except for wands of death; being undead, Vlad cannot be killed with death magic. Silver weapons work especially well.,, The Wizard's Tower is three levels tall. Two other levels in Gehennom have a possible entrance to the tower surrounded by a moat. The moat is tiny, but is in the middle of the levels. Zap a wand of digging at the exposed wall. It will make an opening to let you inside., There will be a random kind of lich standing right on top of the portal, so watch out. If there is no portal inside, you will have to find the second level with a possible entrance; it looks like this level, except with a portal inside., Go to the middle of the level to find the moat.,,, To do this, go to the lowest level you can go to using the stairs, and then step on every tile until it says: ""You feel a strange vibration under your feet."" To do the ritual:

Light 7 candles on the non-cursed Candelabrum of Invocation.
Ring the non-cursed Bell of Opening.
Read the non-cursed Book of the Dead.

, Make sure you have full health. This will be a huge battle. If any of the demon lords is still alive, you can bring it here so it will fight the high priest for you., There are fire traps surrounding it, so don't go directly next to the wall., You might need a scroll of charging. The bell will find the door and open it for you. Alternatively, a wand of secret door detection will also work., Zap him with the wand of death. There is a chance he has magic resistance. In that case, you've got bad luck. You'll have to battle him without magic., While it is in your inventory, the game tries even harder to make you lose; for example, you may teleport down 3 stories just because you are trying to climb up, and spellcasting takes much more energy than normally!, When you use these with the Amulet, you will enter the Endgame."

Congratulations!!",How to Beat Nethack5,", From this point, there is no return to the Dungeons of Doom., You can also leave your Bell of Opening and the Book of the Dead, because they are useless now (the end game doesn't have doors)., This will usually be 4 scrolls of gold detection and a reliable method of confusing yourself; reading the scroll while confused will tell you where the portal is located., He is guaranteed to reappear when you enter the Plane of Earth., The monsters in the first room will have a spellbook and wand of digging and also a pick-axe. If you are good at magic, you might use the spell; otherwise, you should probably bring your own wands of digging in case one wand is not enough. Do not use the pick-axe if you can avoid it as it digs slowly and allows earth elementals to attack you., You can save yourself from a lot of digging. It is not required, but is recommended., All you have to do except fight. Dig, dig, dig., Without one, you will just walk on air, and waste precious turns., This will scare the air elementals, which are the greatest danger on this Plane.,, Clouds will generate lightning., This way, you can take shortcuts across the lava., There are many fire traps trying to burn you to death, and while fire resistance will protect you, it will not protect any scrolls or potions you are carrying., Levitation allows you to float over the water. If you don't have levitation, you will have to stay in the bubbles; water walking does not work., The magic portal in this level will float around, moving slowly around every turn. You should still use a method of portal detection so you will be able to see the portal when it is nearby, however., Be prepared to get on another bubble if your bubble joins another bubble., While your god will send some angels to fight you in this case, conflict is very helpful in fighting the Riders., Death, Pestilence and Famine will revive after you kill them. Use a wand of death against Pestilence and Famine. If you can, avoid Death; death rays will only make him stronger., There are 3 altars (lawful, neutral, chaotic) to offer the amulet. Of course, choose your alignment. You can look at the altar when standing on it (or at the priest when standing next to him/her) to find out.

If you don't mind cheating, you can exploit a bug to make life easier. When you ""call"" them a name, it will show the name of the priest of your god.

Search for the quest in your Quest Log, right-click on the name, and then choose “Accept Quest” found at the bottom right of the Quest Log window.


To open the Quest Log, right-click the button with exclamation point (!) as its icon. A window will appear showing the list of on-going and available quests you can do.
Alternatively, you can open the Quest Log by pressing “Q” on your keyboard.
It is recommended that you open the Quest Log while you're in a city or town to avoid being attacked by monsters.;
, After accepting the quest for Little Xia, you will be given a set of tasks to complete, and the first one is for you to enter and clear the Suburbs of Wally's Castle while under Hard mode or higher. Simply run a dungeon raid like normal, finish the game successfully, and obtain an overall score of B or higher.


You can do this dungeon run while you're in a party to complete the raid quickly.
To get in a dungeon, simply press the Dungeon tab found at your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter, and then press “Start Dungeon,” or hit F8 on your keyboard. You will be automatically assigned to a party, but if you're already in an organized party, choose “Start with current members” instead.
To change dungeon modes, after opening the Dungeon Selection window, choose a dungeon you want to enter. Look at the menu to the right where you can see the description of the dungeon as well as the dungeon difficulty. You get to choose from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard.
Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level.

, Enter the Underground Waterway dungeon, which is just one level lower of the Suburbs of Wally's Castle. Kill Nasod Banthus to obtain the Steel Pieces.


This can be done in any difficulty, but Very Hard is highly recommended as there will be mini bosses in some of the floors. There are chances that these mini bosses will drop rare weapons and equipment that you can either sell for gold or use to become stronger.

, In the Dungeon Selection window again, click Banthus Cave, which is just a one level lower to Underground Waterway. This part of the quest is simple as you're only required to complete this dungeon raid twice under Hard or Very Hard mode.


There's no rank required for this quest, and no time limit.
It's best to do this quest while in the party to finish the raid quickly.

, With all the other quests completed, you may now proceed to entering the final dungeon in Elder Village, Wally's Castle. Unlike the previous quest, in this dungeon you're required to complete and obtain B rank or higher in order to compete this.

If you're unable to complete the raid or if you obtained a low overall rank, you may enter the dungeon again for another run.
If you have successfully completed the quest, open your Quest Log and then click on “Little Xia” to see the progress of your quest.

, Click “Complete” to finish or simply approach the bulletin board found in the Elder Village.


You will be rewarded for your hard work, and of course, when given the option to choose your first class advancement, choose Little Hsien.

, Your first task is to talk to Echo in Elder Village, a young girl alchemist with white hair. After talking to Echo, she will give you three tasks to complete, and part of this will unfold Ara's story.


To become Little Hsien, make sure you have completed the Little Xia quest in order for the Little Hsien quest to appear in your Quest Log.
You can find Echo at the upper floor to the east side of the village, just a few steps away from Hoffman, the Blacksmith.

, The first quest given to you is to enter the Underground Waterway under Very Hard mode, and then complete the dungeon run within 8 minutes.


There's no rank requirement, so if you want to finish the dungeon run within 8 minutes, skip the other floors and go straight to the final room where you can find the boss.
Being in a full party will help in getting rid monsters and crowds, and most importantly, killing the boss.
If you're unable to complete the dungeon within 8 minutes, you can do reruns.

, Your next quest is to do a dungeon run twice in Wally's Castle while under the Very Hard difficulty. Being in a party is accepted and there's no time limit or rank requirement at this point.


It's advisable to explore and complete the dungeon by entering every floors since there will be chances that you will encounter mini bosses. These mini boss may drop rares such as accessory, weapons, and armors.

, Enter and complete the Shadow Forest dungeon while under Very Hard mode, and you must avoid receiving damage from any monsters in the dungeon. If you got hit more than 20 times, you will have to do another dungeon run.


To make it simple, enter the Shadow Forest while in a party and let your party members kill the monsters for you.
Using your skills will help to take down enemies quickly before they can land an attack on you.
There's no time limit for this part and no overall rank required.

, After you have completed all the quests, return to Elder Village and talk to Echo. She will then turn your class to Little Hsien with a few rewards for your hard work.

, As mentioned, Ara possesses high speed and unique attacks. One of her newest combo after advancing to Little Hsien is her Double Slash, where your character jumps into midair then swings her spear 180 degrees.


To do this, simply press Up to jump, then Z twice to slash (Up, Z, Z).

, Ara can dive toward her enemy from midair, causing devastating physical damage to both monsters or players in PvP, knocking down opponents once hit.


To execute this combo, press Z twice and then X twice (Z, Z, X, X).

, This is the most-used combo in PvP (Player vs Player) and effective in stunning enemies for more juggling combos. As the name states, Ara will stab her opponent using her spear, but her attack won't knock back her opponent, which will give her a chance to do connecting combos.


Press arrow twice to run toward your enemy and then Z twice to execute. Keep in mind that this skill can be countered if your opponent lands a hit first (Right, Right or Left Left, Z, Z).

If you have successfully done these quests, the quest name in your Quest Log will become green, indicating that you have completed it. Otherwise, you need to do another dungeon rerun.

, Head back to Elder Village and talk to Mr. Hoffman; you can find him at the upper level, right in the middle, next to Luriel. After talking to him and handing in the completed quest, he will change your class to Dark Magician.


If the advancement change didn't work, exit the village by either going inside a dungeon and then re-enter the village. This bug usually happens during high peak hours.

, Magic Touch releases a magic charge while your Dark Magician is on the ground, aiming enemies while they're mid-air. This charge will be released, stunning the enemies, followed by additional melee attacks with a finish of a higher magic attack that inflicts more than 200% Mag DMG.


To execute this skill, press X twice, followed by Down button, and then X and Z. (X, X, Down, X, Z).

, As a mid-range character, it's important to have a launching combo that can knock opponents down to make them vulnerable for additional combos and attacks. This combo is usually used with a teleport skill, as after the Dark Magician moves closer to the enemy, she unleashes this combo to strike the enemy, sending them flying.


To execute this skill, press arrow twice toward your enemy and then Z, X, X. (<< or >>, Z, X, X).

, This skill is very powerful when done in perfect timing, as the enemy will receive damage repetitively once landed on. Aside from multiple hits, this ball will also stun the enemy, making them open to another set of combos.


To execute this skill, press X twice then an arrow to your direction (to your back) and then X (X, X, < or >, X).

Wait for the Cure progress to hit 25%.,
Wait for the Cure progress to hit 75%.,

Keep trying.","How to Beat Black Plague Brutal Mode in Plague, Inc."," Before you start your game, you will have the ability to apply modifications to your starting disease. These modifications will help your disease survive and will allow you to combat the Cure easier. By this point in the game, you should have access to almost all of the options, allowing you to pick the best ones suited to Black Plague Brutal Mode.


DNA Gene - Catalytic Switch. This gene gives you a bonus DNA from popping blue cure bubbles, which is essential for fighting the Cure later on.
Travel Gene - Aquacyte or Suppression. Aquacyte is highly recommended because it helps make infecting island nations like Greenland and Madagascar easier. Suppression is good for getting across closed land borders.
Evolution Gene - Ionised Helix (Optional). This gene will give you DNA back when you devolve, but you shouldn't be devolving during this mode anyway. Do NOT pick any genes that make your disease easier to cure.
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This gene makes your disease harder to cure, which is essential for this mode.
Environment Gene - Extremophila. This gives your disease a boost across all environment types.;
, There is a lot of debate over which country is the best to start in, but India seems to be one of the most successful starting locations thanks to the population size, warm climate, and close proximity to China.


Other good starting locations include Egypt, Saudi Arabia, China, and Central Africa.

, You want your virus to spread as quickly and innocuously as possible before you start turning up the heat. To do this, start collecting DNA. When you have enough to start modifying your disease, focus on the following upgrades, in this order:


Rodent 1
Livestock 1
Bird 1
Rodent 2
Livestock 2
Bird 2
Extreme Zoonosis - This is only available when you evolve each of the transmission types up to 2. It allows the disease to quickly spread between species.

, Once you have transmission locked down, it's time to shore up your disease's defenses. Focus on the following resistances, in this order:


Cold 1
Drug Resistance 1
Cold 2
Drug Resistance 2

, Now that your disease is spreading and defending itself, you can start making its presence known. Symptoms will help spread the disease, and you should see your numbers start to skyrocket. Once symptoms start appearing, work on the Cure will increase, so the clock starts ticking now! Focus on the following symptoms first:


Pneumonic Plague
Coughing
Skin Lesions - There's a good chance that this will mutate on its own.
Sneezing
Pulmonary Oedema
Pneumonia

, Once you've got symptoms evolved and the disease is spreading, there's not much to do at this point but wait for the Cure to progress. Make sure to keep popping DNA bubbles so that you're ready to make changes to the disease as necessary.


Once the Cure hits 25%, evolve Genetic Reshuffle 1 and Drug Resistance 3.

, At this point in the game, you are just focused on fighting the Cure. Each time you perform a genetic reshuffle, the Cure progress takes a hit. Once the Cure progress hits 75% the first time, evolve Hardened Reshuffle 1.


When the Cure hits 75% again, evolve Hardened Reshuffle 2.
When the cure hits 75% again, evolve Genetic Reshuffle 2.
When the cure hits 75% again, evolve Genetic Reshuffle 3.
Make sure you keep popping DNA and Cure bubbles.

, Your disease should have infected nearly everyone on the planet at this point, so you can move in for the kill. Spend your DNA on the rest of the symptoms in any order that you choose. The Cure should be failing at this point thanks to everyone dying, so you shouldn't have to worry about fighting it anymore.

, There is a lot of random luck involved with Plague Inc., and no one strategy will work every time. That said, this strategy has been known to work well for players on their first try to on multiple attempts in a row. Keep at it, and you'll soon conquer the world with your black plague!"

Direct a villager to a specific location or resource.,
Direct multiple villagers to a specific location/resource.,
Set a destination for villagers before their training is complete.",How to Direct Your Units to a Specific Location in Age of Empires1," Under normal circumstances in Age of Empires, you want your villagers to go where there are resources (i.e., Food, Wood, and Gold) so they can gather them and provide the empire with the means to grow.


To do this, left-click the villager to select it. Right-click the resource you want it to gather.
For instance, if you want your villager to gather Wood, right-click a tree that is in a considerably well-forested area in order to make sure they gather as much of the resource as possible. If you try to gather from an area that does not have many trees, you will be forced to waste time reallocating the villager to a different forest when it has gathered all it can from that particular area.
If you want your villager to gather Food from hunted animals, direct it to an area with many animals by left-clicking the villager and then right-clicking one of the animals. That way they won’t go idle after they have gathered all they can from the first animal.
No matter where you are directing the villager, make sure you see red marks flash on the area you clicked, indicating that you have issued the command successfully and that the villager is on their way.;
, To save time, you can select multiple villagers to a specific location or to gather a specific resources.


Select the villagers by either double-clicking one of the villagers or by using the left mouse button to drag the mouse over all the villagers you want to move. Double-clicking selects all villagers that are in the current field of view. Clicking and dragging selects all the units you have dragged the mouse over, regardless of whether they are villagers or not.
Right click the location or resource where you want the villagers to move. Red marks will flash on the area you clicked, indicating that the villagers are on their way.

, A very useful strategy in Age of Empires is to designate a location or a resource that you want your villagers to go to after their training from the Town Center is complete. You won’t have to intervene and waste time that you could have spent doing more meaningful things.


To do this, left-click the Town Center to select it then right-click on the location or resource where you want your villagers to go after they are created. A small red flag will appear on the area you clicked.
Now the villagers will move to the area you selected immediately after they are created. If you right-clicked a forest, for example, the villagers will move to the forest and start gathering wood immediately after they are created.

Direct multiple military units to a specific location/target.,
Set a destination for military units before their training is complete.",How to Direct Your Units to a Specific Location in Age of Empires2," Just as with villagers, to direct a military unit to a specific location or target, left-click the soldier to select it first.


Find the location you want to set the unit. If the location is not within the current field of view, scroll using the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys or the mouse until it is in view.
Right-click the location you want them to go to. Red marks will flash on the area you clicked, indicating that you have issued the command successfully and that the soldier is on their way.
It is also possible to direct a unit to a specific location without scrolling the screen to get it into the field of view. To do this, select your unit and then right-click the area of the map that you want them to go to. The map is shown in the bottom left corner of the screen in AoE3 or in the bottom right corner of the screen in AoE2.

, If you want your military unit to attack a specific target, such as a building or an enemy soldier, select the unit and then right-click the target.

, Select the units by double-clicking one of the units. This selects all units of that particular type that are in the current field of view. For example, if you double-click a Crossbowman, all Crossbowmen in the current field of view will be selected. You can also select by using the left-mouse button to drag the mouse over all the units you want to select. This will select all the units you have dragged the mouse over regardless of whether they are military units or not.


Right-click the location or the enemy unit where you want your military units to move or attack. Red marks will flash on the area you clicked, indicating that you have successfully issued the command.
Sending out many military units to attack a target instead of just one or a few increases your chances of successfully eliminating the target.

, You can designate a rendezvous point for military that have not finished being created out of the training buildings (e.g., Barracks and Stables) in preparation for a coordinated attack on your enemies.


To do this, left-click the training building to select it then right-click on the location or enemy unit where you want your military units to gather after they are created. A small red flag will appear on the area you clicked.
Now the military units will immediately move to the area you selected after they are created. If you right-clicked an enemy unit, the military units will travel to it and attack immediately after they are created.

, In AoE3, your first and most important training building, the Town Center, is already constructed for you from the start of the game. This building allows you to train villagers, who you will then instruct to gather the resources required to build the training buildings that you need. They will also be the ones building the training buildings, in this case the Barracks.


To train a villager, left-click the Town Center to select it. Town Centers are different depending on the Home City you are working with. If you are unsure which building is your Town Center, press the hotkey T on your keyboard to immediately select it.
Once the Town Center is selected, a panel will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen with different buttons for the different functions that your Town Center can perform. The “Train Villager” button is the very first one on the panel—the one with a picture of a man and a woman. Click the button once to train one villager or multiple times to train many villagers.
Once the training is complete, your villager(s) will appear in front of your Town Center.
In AoE3, a villager usually costs 100 Food to train. This is deducted from your resources stockpile, which is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen next to the map.

, 200 Wood is the resource cost for building Barracks in AoE3. Left-click a villager to select it. Scroll to an area of the game world that is forested.


Right-click a tree. The villager will travel to the tree, chop it down, and start gathering from it.
Repeat the steps to allocate more villagers to wood-gathering. The more the villagers you assign to the wood-gathering task, the faster you will reach the target amount of Wood needed.
When you have accumulated 200 wood (check your resources stockpile in the bottom-left corner of the screen), you are now ready to build your Barracks!

, Left-click a villager to select him (or her), and then click the “Barracks” button (a square icon with two pistols on it) from the build panel that appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen.


Move the mouse to position the building’s foundation where you want it to be built, and then left-click to place it. Your villager will now construct the Barracks.
The more the villagers you assign to the task of constructing the building, the faster it can be completed. To assign extra villagers, left-click them and then right-click the building’s foundation.

, Once constructed, you can train units out of the building using the same procedure as training villagers out of the Town Center. Left-click the Barracks to select it, and then click the buttons on the panel that will appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen to train units.


Examples of units you can train from the Barracks are: Crossbowman, Pikeman, and Musketeer. Hover your mouse over the buttons on the panel to find out what type of unit each trains.
Training these units costs economic resources, which are deducted from your stockpile (e.g., a Musketeer costs 75 Food and 25 Gold).

, Stables are available in Age of Empires 3, Age of Empires 3: The Asian Dynasties, and Age of Empires 3: The Warchiefs (PC). They’re used to train cavalry (soldiers on horses).

, Just as when constructing a Barracks, the first step to constructing a Stable in AoE3 is training villagers and then gathering the required resources (200 Wood for a Stable). Train villagers using your Town Center and command them to collect at least 200 Wood from a forested area of the map.

, To build a Stable, left-click the villager and then click the Stable button (a square icon with a horseshoe on it) from the Build panel that appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen.


Position the building’s foundation by moving your mouse to the location where you want the Stable built, then left-click to place it. The villager will now construct the Stable.
The more villagers you assign to the task of constructing the building, the faster it can be completed. To assign extra villagers, left-click them and then right-click the building’s foundation.

, Once constructed, you can train three types of units out of the Stable: Hussars, Lancers, and Dragoons. Left-click the building to select it, and then hover your mouse over the buttons on the panel that will appear on the bottom left corner of the screen to find out what type of unit each trains.


Training these units costs economic resources, which are deducted from your stockpile (e.g., a Hussar costs 120 Food and 80 Gold).

, A Siege Workshop is available in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (PC). It is the building out of which you can train Scorpions, Siege Rams, and other siege weapons.

, The first step to building a Siege Workshop is training the villager(s) for the job and gathering the 200 Wood needed to construct one. To to this:


Left click your Town Center to select it. A Town Center is usually already constructed for you from the start of any AoE2 game. Town Centers are different depending on the Civilization you are playing. If you are unsure which building is your Town Center, press the hotkey H on your keyboard to immediately select it.
Once the Town Center is selected, a panel will appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen with different buttons for the different functions that your Town Center can perform. The “Train Villager” button is the very first one on the panel—the one with a picture of a shirtless workman. Click the button once to train one villager or multiple times to train many Villagers.
Once trained, the villager(s) will appear just outside your Town Center.

, Once you have your villagers, instruct them to gather wood from trees. Left-click a villager to select it, then scroll to an area of the game world that is forested.


Right-click a tree, and the Villager will travel to the tree, chop it down, and start gathering wood from it.
The first icon on your resources stockpile in the top-left corner of the screen represents the amount of Wood you have. Once you have gathered 200 Wood, you can construct your Siege Workshop.

, Left-click a villager to select it. In the bottom-left corner of the screen, a panel with four buttons will appear. Click the second button. This will open up a panel with the icons of different military buildings that you can build. Hover your mouse over the icons to see what building each icon represents.


The Siege Workshop icon is the fourth one from the left on the top row, one with a pair of gears on it. Click the icon then move your mouse to position the building’s foundation where you want it.
Left-click to place the foundation and begin construction. Your villager will now begin constructing the building.

, Once your building has been constructed, you can train different types of siege units from it by left-clicking it and then clicking the icons that appear in the bottom-left corner of your screen.


Training these units costs economic resources, which are deducted from your stockpile (e.g., a Siege Ram costs 160 wood and 75 Gold). The amounts of each resource you have are displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.

"
Select your Town Center.,
Click the Town Center’s “Train Villager” button to create a Villager.,
Train multiple Villagers.,
Cancel training (if needed).",How to Create a Unit in Age of Empires1," The Villager is a very fundamental unit in all versions of Age of Empires—the very foundation on which an empire is built. Villagers gather the economic resources (wood, food, gold, etc.) that are needed to propel the empire forward and construct various structures/buildings. If push comes to shove and you have no military, villagers can defend the empire as well!


In most Age of Empires versions, your first and most important training building, the Town Center, is already constructed for you from the start of the game. You will also usually already have a small amount of each resource to get your empire up and running. To select your Town Center, just left-click it.
Town Centers are different depending on the Home City or Civilization you are working with. If you are unsure which building is your Town Center, press the game-specific hotkey on your keyboard to immediately select it (e.g., T for all versions of Age of Empires 3 and H for all versions of Age of Empires 2).;
, Once the Town Center is selected, a panel will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen (for Age of Empires 3) or in the bottom right corner (for Age of Empires 2) with different buttons for the different functions that your Town Center can perform.


The “Train Villager” button is the very first one on the panel—the one with a picture of a worker. Click the button once to train one Villager.
The time it takes to train a single Villager is 30 seconds on average, but it depends on the age your empire is in (i.e., Stone Age, Tool Age, Imperial Age, etc.). The more advanced the age, the faster you can create villagers. Other buildings, such as the Temple in Age of Empires 2 and the Monastery in Age of Empires 3, provide research advancements that allow Villagers to train faster.
Once they’re trained, Villagers will appear outside the Town Center.

, Clicking the “Train Villager” button many times will create a training queue. The Town Center will, however, only create one Villager at a time.

, If ever you want or need to cancel Villager training, you can do so before the process is complete by left-clicking the Town Center and clicking the training progress icon on the panel that appears. This is an icon showing the progress of the training using a swathe of green color. Clicking this icon will immediately halt the process of creating the villager and return 100 Food (the cost of 1 Villager) to your resource stockpile.


If, for example, you chose to train 5 villagers, there will be 5 icons on the panel. Clicking any of the icons will remove it from the panel and reduce the number of villagers in training to 4. Clicking another icon will reduce them to 3, and so on. If you click all of the 5 icons before any of the villagers has been created, the entire process will be cancelled and the total resource cost (500 Food) will be returned to your stockpile.

Select the Barracks.,
Train a Crossbowman.,
Cancel training (if necessary).You can do this by clicking the Barracks and then looking at the training progress icon.",How to Create a Unit in Age of Empires2," The Crossbowman is a ranged infantryman armed with a crossbow and arrows that is especially effective when defending against heavy infantry like Musketeers. Crossbowmen are available in Age of Empires 3 (including The Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties expansions).


Before you can train crossbowmen, you must have a Barracks, which requires 200 Wood. So check your resources stockpile, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen next to the map. If you don’t have it, command your villagers to gather enough wood.
Also make sure that you have enough resources to train a Crossbowman. 1 Crossbowman costs 40 Food and 40 Wood. If you don’t have enough resources, select a Villager and instruct him to gather the resources.

, When you have enough resources, left-click the Villager to select him (or her) and then click the “Barracks” button (a square icon with two pistols on it) from the build panel that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.


Move your mouse to position the building’s foundation where you want and then left click to place it. Your Villager will now construct the Barracks.

, To select the Barracks, simply left-click it. Alternatively, you can select the Barracks by pressing Ctrl+B. A panel with icons representing the different types of units you can train from the Barracks will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.

, The very first button, one with a soldier dressed in blue and holding a bow, is the button for Crossbowman. Click it once to train one Crossbowman or multiple times to train many.


It takes usually 27 seconds to train one Crossbowman.
For convenience, it is best to train military in batches of 5 soldiers instead of training one soldier at a time, since it takes the same amount of time to train 5 soldiers as it does one. To train a batch of 5 soldiers, just click the “Crossbowman” icon 5 times.
Once the training is complete, your soldiers will appear outside the Barracks.

, This is an icon showing the type of soldier(s) being trained, number of soldiers and the progress of the training using a green color.


If, for example, you chose to train 5 Crossbowmen, clicking this icon once will reduce the number of Crossbowmen in training to 4, and clicking it again will reduce them to 3, and so on.
Clicking the icon 5 times means the entire process is cancelled—no Crossbowmen will be trained—and the total resource cost for the 5 Crossbowmen will be returned to your stockpile.

Cancel training (if necessary).",How to Create a Unit in Age of Empires3," The Falconet is a type of light infantry that is useful during a siege attack by enemy infantry or for destroying enemy buildings when used in groups. Falconets are available in Age of Empires 3 (including The Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties expansions). Before you start training, make sure you have at least 300 Wood to create an Artillery Foundry by checking your resources stockpile. This is displayed on the bottom left corner of the screen next to the map. If you don’t have it, command your villagers to gather.


Also make sure that that you have enough resources to create a Falconet. One Falconet costs 100 Wood and 400 Coin. If you don’t have enough resources, select a Villager, and instruct him or her to gather the resources.

, Once you have enough wood, left-click a Villager to select him (or her) and then click the “Artillery Foundry” button (a square icon with crisscrossed mallets on it) from the build panel that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.


Move your mouse to position the building’s foundation where you want and then left click to place it. Your Villager will now construct the Artillery Foundry.

, To select the building, simply left-click it. Alternatively, you can select the Artillery Foundry by pressing Ctrl+A. A panel with icons representing the different types of units you can train from the Artillery Foundry will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.

, The second button, one with a picture of a real-life Falconet on it, is the button for creating a Falconet. Click it once to create one Falconet or multiple times to train many.


It takes 45 seconds to create one Falconet. Unlike other military units, Falconets cannot be created in batches. You can only create one Falconet at a time, and as such, creating 5 Falconets would take 45 x 5 seconds.
Once the process is complete, your Falconets will appear outside the Artillery Foundry.

, You can do this by clicking the Artillery Foundry and then looking at the training progress icons that will appear in a panel in the bottom left corner of the screen. These icons show the type of unit(s) being trained, the number, and the progress of the training using a green progress bar.

If, for example, you chose to train 5 Falconets, the panel will show 5 Falconet icons. Clicking on any of the icons means you have cancelled the training of one Falconet and will remove the icon from the panel. This will reduce the number of Falconets in training to 4, and so on.
Clicking all 5 icons off the panel means the entire process is cancelled—no Falconet will be created—and the total resource cost for the 5 Falconets will be returned to your stockpile.

Build the buildings with a little structure and not everywhere you want.,
From your hometown you will get defense-towers if you have them selected in the menu.,
Build walls around your main part of your village.,
When you are attacking, always leave troops at your village in case the enemy attacks you too.,
Build your fort from the hometown behind your walls.,
Manage your defense line and your attacking troops.",How to Build a Strong Defense in Age of Empires 3," For example: Don't build the market or the mills at the front or in the middle of the map. Build it in the centre of your village or behind it. When the enemy attacks, your resource-places should be in a safe place. Build all your military buildings in the front so you can pump out troops fast in case your enemy attacks or you want to attack fast. This structure is one of the most important things in the game.;
, Place those at points that need a little defense. Like outposts or just some villagers who need to be defended. They can also build towers. You should also place towers in front of your city because they will help your troops to defeat the attacking enemy. Just build towers everywhere where you think this place needs a defense but not a whole army.

, If you have walls, the enemy can't walk in without destroying something first. Walls will stop your enemy and will give your troops which are defending a short amount of time to reach to the action.

, Because some enemies try to sneak around with their troops to avoid a big fight between your main troop and his main troops (which is clever by the way, you should do that too). When you have your troops at home, don’t let them stand around near the barracks where they came out. Spread them near the walls so the most important places of your village will have a defense when the enemy destroys the wall. Where the enemy attacks you send your troops. But also here, don’t use all the defensive troops to fight against the enemy because good players will attack at two spots and you will have to fight at two points at the same time.

, Many people use the fort to pump troops out near the enemy. Which is very good, but you can also build barracks or stables with two villagers. The fort is very good to push enemy troops back because it does huge damage to infantry. Try to spread your defense-troops near the fort and all along the wall. It is very important to spread your army. Try to have crossbows for defense because they can shoot through the wall and do very good damage against attacking infantry.

, I recommend you to first set up the defense-line and afterwards you start attacking. Most of the time the big troops fight in the middle, then it depends on how good the army is. If you also want to learn how you can build a very effective army you can read my guide to: ""How to Build a Good Balanced Army in Age of Empires 3""

Avoid building very large wall.,
Build walls offensively.,
Build walls in two rows to make it really difficult for your enemy to attack your outpost or village.,
Give your wall a structure.",How to Build Walls Efficiently in Age of Empires 3," If a wall is too big, it's not effective anymore because you can't control it when your enemy attacks. So first think about how big it should be. You can minimize the size of your walls if you follow some of the following tips when possible:


Try to use small forests because units can't get through forests. Use the nature it will be much easier for you to send your defending troops to the action when there is not much wall. However, your opponent can knock the forest down with a well aimed cannonball, making this strategy ineffective against experienced real players.
Don't make the wall far away from your village. If the enemy gets through the wall, it will be difficult to defeat him because he can spread his troops and can cause huge trouble to your villagers etc. So really think about which part of your village needs to be defended and build the wall around this area.;
, When you want to send troops really fast to your enemies, you can build a military outpost near them. Build walls around this outpost and make the wall big enough so they have to attack it in order to get to your village. (The enemy could just walk around but nearly all players want to destroy an outpost because it's dangerous for their village).

, The walls shouldn't touch each other. They need to have space between them so you can place troops there. This is a really effective way because if the front wall gets destroyed, your troops can still defeat the enemy army. It can also give you time to send support from your home village. It depends on the situation.

, Do not build a wall that goes back and forward and back and forward etc. If possible, build a straight wall so your troops can reach it easily and you have a good overview on what's going on. This will help you a lot! If you don't know where your wall goes and how it's built, it's too late when the enemy attacks. You need to be quick but it's very effective for the defense.

Make sure you have the card in your deck that transforms your Strelets into Musketeers.,
Think about of how big your army should be and how much resources you want to spend.,
Build more than one Barrack.,
Build enough musketeers.,
Build 5 blockhouses.,
Have a good proportion of troops and supplies.,
Wait for the next shipment and choose the card that transforms the Strelets into Musketeers.,
If you attack, save the cannons.,
When the enemy starts to attack your cannons with his cavalry, try to kill them with your pike men and musketeers as fast as you can.,
This should have given you a good introduction and a small overview on how you can build a good troop.",How to Build a Good Balanced Army in Age of Empires 3,";
, Because you can't spend all your resources. When your troops will get killed and you don't have any resources left and your enemy realizes that, you will lose. Usually you can use 2/3 of your available resources.

, If you have only 1 barrack, the building of troops can take a little bit of time. Build 4 to 6 barracks, then with only one Shift+Click and all barracks selected, you will have 20 or 30 skirmishers that will fight for you. The resources go away fast, but you can pump out troops really fast and it's also useful to build a fast defense, if your enemy is attacking you.

, They are strong and are the key of your army. Build at least 50 of them. They will shoot every enemy who is in their way. To support your musketeers against other infantry, build some cannons. They will shoot all the enemy infantry away and your troops get a better survivability. You can not specialize your troops on one unit. To attack successfully, you will need everything. Some units more than others.

, Make sure you will use them as Outposts. Select the blockhouses and train 100 strelets. They are cheap, and with 5 blockhouses you will have 100 strelets in no time.

,


musketeers / 5 – 10 cannons / 20 pike men / 20 melee-cavalry
This is a very good little army. If your army needs to be bigger, just double everything.

, Send shipments of Strelets, if you have an overabundance of Strelets. Although they are cheap, it is better to get them for free.

, They were expensive and they are very effective! So watch them all the time. Good players will always try to first kill your cannons with cavalry.

, When your cannons survive, then can make huge damage to the enemy infantry. I always try to kill the enemy cannons first. If you let cannons shoot your troops too long, you will have nothing left, they blow everything away (except cavalry).

, Of course there are other good combinations and you can adjust the units to your play style.

Make sure you have already gained all the gold from the gold mines near your base.,
Try to keep your outpost away from the enemy lines.,
Take enough villagers with you.,
If you reach the place where you want to build the outpost, place the villagers there and start building walls with them.,
Build two or three towers for better defence of your outpost and move some troops there.",How to Build Good Outposts for Goldmines in Age of Empires 3," Because building outposts costs some resources and also you can lose villagers, but it's worth it when it works.;
, If you build the outpost for gold too near to the enemy base, he will destroy it very quickly and you would have wasted some resources. Because if an outpost is near an enemy base, it is easier for the enemy to destroy it.

, For a mine, use at least 5 villagers to get gold.

, The outpost shouldn't be very big. The bigger it is the easier it is for your enemy to find the outpost. We don't want the enemy to know that we have an outpost there. Most of the players will destroy an outpost very fast because it doesn't have a good defence like your main base and it gives you more resources.

, The towers can defeat little troops that the enemy will attack with. But for a good defence, send some crossbows and some musketeers to the outpost because you don't want the enemy to overrun your outpost. When the enemy attacks with many units, you can keep them fighting against your small troop until support from your main base reaches the fight. You want to save your outposts because they can really help you to gain resources very fast and this will help you in building more units.

You need to have a balanced army.,
Get your troops together at an area in your village.,
Try to surprise the enemy.,
Attack from different directions.,
What do you want to attack first?,
Don't watch the whole fight at the front, switch to your village sometimes.,
But that's not the main point.,
Attacking is the best defense.,
Don't get stressed.,
Don't be scared to attack!",How to Attack Your Enemy in Age of Empires 3," If your army is just made of one type of unit, there is a big risk that you will lose the fight. Because if you have only musketeers and the enemy has musketeers but some cannons too, you will definitely lose. If you don't know how a balanced army looks like, you should read my guide ""How to build a good balanced army in Age of Empires 3"". This guide will help you a lot!;
, Before you attack you should collect your units and see, how many of them you want to use for an attack and how many you want to leave behind to defend your village. I always recommend taking about 2/3 to attack and 1/3 to defend your base. If the enemy is attacking you while you are bringing your troops together, try to push the enemy back only with your defending troops so you can make a really strong counter attack with your main troop. If your defending troop gets destroyed you have to use your attacking troop to defend your village and start building new units.

, To make a really strong attack you want the enemy not seeing your troops until you knock at his front door. So here's a little trick. Build some cavalry and about 2 or 3 mortars. Before you send your troops to your enemy, you want to look for enemy towers, outposts or ambushes that the enemy placed somewhere near your village or near his village. If you find buildings (towers, outposts etc.) destroy them with mortars, they are very strong against buildings. If you find enemy troops, send small troops from your base to kill them because you don't want the enemy realizing that you want to attack him with your real army. If you send the whole army to defeat his small troops, he realizes that you will attack him and he can prepare a strong defense. It's much easier to defeat an enemy if he doesn't realize an attack.

, Take a small amount from your army to attack (for example) from the right and the rest will attack from the left. Attack with the small troop first! Many enemies will send the main part of their army to your small troop because he thinks you are attacking there. When you see his troops coming, start attacking with your main troop. If he has cannons, try to eliminate them first because they do huge damage.

, First you will have to fight against his troops. When you can defeat his army and you are already in his village and you have troops left, he lost (most of the time; He can still rebuild everything and defeat you, but that's not often the case) If you see that you can not win against his troops, try to sneak around the fight with some cavalry or infantry to kill villagers. If you can kill villagers, it will stop his economy and he should not attack you immediately after the fight because he has to rebuild his economy.

, You shouldn't concentrate yourself only on the fight. Always watch your village. Maybe he is attacking at the same time and you have to send troops back in order to defend your village.

, While your troops are fighting at the front, units will die and your population limit will go down again. So while it's going down, start building new units at home. This has two advantages. You will have units to defend a counter attack from your enemy or you can start a second attack immediately after your first attack. This will do very hard pressure to your enemy.

, If you are attacking, he is normally not attacking because he has to defend himself. So keep the pressure on him. If you are attacking, start building barracks near him with some villagers, so you can always send new units that replace the ones who got killed in the fight with the enemy. Sometimes the enemy can destroy your troops completely. Then you should have a new army that can attack again or defend. It is really important that you never stop building troops when the war-time started. Because when you don't have troops and the enemy attacks, you lose normally.

, If you are attacking, just do the best you can with your troops. Sometimes the enemy army is just better and your troops will die. So don't give up. You should have seen the enemy troops when you were attacking. So in your village, start building counter-units to destroy the enemy army when you are attacking again. It's all about pressure and defense.

, This is a very important point. Not only in Age of Empires, but in every War-game. If you don't attack, you will never know if your troops are good enough or not. Don't be scared of losing all your troops, you can build new ones. And when you never attack, you will lose. Because in a fight, the one who is always attacking will mostly win because he can build new troops while you are just defending and staying at your home-base. It can happen that some attacks fail, but with each fail you will learn new strategies on how you can attack your enemy. Don't be scared, just attack and I guarantee you that you will get better and win!

",How to Sell Items in Brunelleschi: Age of Architects," Select 'Markets' from the navigation bar at the top of the page (assumes you are logged in and have selected a character). Your market menus and view will appear with the Bulk market selected for display by default.;
, You can exchange your items for resources, goods, or currency at any level by fulfilling one of the existing orders - provided you have whatever they're asking for.


Click the 'Filter' button, select 'Only Affordable Offers' from the dialog.
Click 'Submit' and the Markets will refresh showing only offers you can fulfill.

Select a green shopping cart icon on an offer to bring up the purchase form and complete the exchange. Yes, this 'selling' is equivalent to 'buying'; as offers can be placed for resources, goods, or currency it is a good way to exchange what you have for currency (or other items).

Select Offer Type and Asking Type. The first step of placing a bulk offer is to specify what kind of thing you'd like to offer and what type of thing you'd like to receive in exchange. Your options for things to offer are Raw Resources, Processed Goods, Crafted Items, and Currency; you may ask for these types as well except for Crafted Items which may only be offered (not asked for).

Lucia is not sure yet which specialties to choose.
As mentioned, she have high power but low control. Advisable of intermediate players.

, Was born from the Demon King's heart and Nell was found and raised by Cadie, the greatest witch of Pangya Island. Cadie is unaware of Nell's past but often displays mysterious power that belongs to the Demon King or perhaps an inception from Cadie. Nell's age is unknown and she loves spending time with Pepper.


Specialty club is all and she's ready to learn new things.
She have been playing golf for 1 year.

, The newest character released in PangYa world. Spika has landed on PangYa Island, though her initial landing was by pure accident. Her curiosity about the world made her decide to stay on the Island. Her current goal is to conduct research about the magic energy of Pangya Island and the bring the technology back to her planet Zephyr. You can always see her with a device called Roi. Her favourite food in PangYa is Wizberry Snowflakes, a famous dessert made with ice from the alpines near Wiz Wiz. She's a good friend of Cecilia due to their common enthusiasm for technology. Spika is 16 years old who loves breaking and rebuilding devices.


Her specialties is woods.
Spika have a high power and control.

, Just like real golf, you get to use all 14 different clubs which are divided into several categories. Each category has different characteristics which must be learned to know each strengths and weaknesses of each.


Wood - Wood have 3 kinds of club. 1w can reach 230 distance, 2w reaches 210 distance and 3w reaches 190. Woods are best for long distance but suffer from poor accuracy and control.
Iron - Irons send your comet high into the sky. These clubs are accurate and easy to control. Commonly used for chip-ins. 4I have 160 distance, 5I have 150, 6I have 140, 7I have 130, 8I have 120 and 9I can reach 110 distance.
Wedge - These clubs will send your ball up at an even steeper rate than normal irons. Use them near the green or in the bunker. Also useful to get through any obstacle in the game. Wedge have 2 kinds of club, PW have 100 distance and SW have 80.
Putter - A putter is used almost exclusively on the green. Putter have 1 club which is PT with 40-30 distance.

, After selecting a club and determining where the comet should land. Use the space bar or right mouse button to start and execute your swing. You will notice a bar moving towards the right, this determines the power level you want. For example, if you want the comet to and approximately 220y. Simply press spacebar to execute the swing then press spacebar again once the bar points at the exact distance you wanted.


To hit the comet, tap the space bar a third time when its on the white line between the pink bar. The closer you get to the white PangYa Bar the better you hit. If you land precisely on the PangYa bar, the ball will at its furthest and straightest.
Hitting PangYa good practice and timing. Players who play a couple of games find this easy as time passes. A high control and accuracy also helps in achieving a PangYa shot.

, Woods and Irons are great at getting the comet to the green. You have to use a putter to move the comet onto the green. Once you reach the green, you will be able to see the distance between the ball and the golf hole. You will be able to see grin on the ground as well with dots. Use these dots to plan your putt. Therefore, if dots appear mostly on the left of the squares, aim your shot to the right.


You will also see the difference of the hit bar between the Iron and wood, and putter. In putter, you will be able to see a green mark, showing the distance between the ball and the hole. Note that the small dots on the hit bar indicate the slope of the green. If the dots are sloping up its means that you need to add more power than normal to reach the cup. If the dots are sloping down, you need to decrease the power. A dot in the middle indicates that the slop is flat.

, During the game, you can press tab to see the score board. Scoring in PangYa is like golf in real life. The score is based on the regulated par. Meaning, the shorter strokes you do, the higher points you get but this vary on how many par hole is listed. For example, the hole 1 have par 4. This means that you have to do do less 4 strokes into the hole. If you go beyond 4, you will get a + score. Remember, the lower the strokes, the higher chance you win.


Hole is made with 3 strokes left is called Albatross (-3 Score)
Hole is made with 2 strokes left is called Eagle (-2 Score)
Hole is made with 1 stroke left is called Bridie (-1 Score)
Hole is made with no strokes left is called Par (0 Score)
Hole is made with extra stroke is called Bogey (1 Score)
Hole is made with 2 extra strokes is called Double Bogey (2 Score)
Hole is made with 3 extra strokes is called Triple Bogey (3 Scores)

, Pang is the name of the currency in the game. You can earn PangYa by finishing a game, make a good hole in and other basic pang bonus. Basic Pang Bonus will be listed below.


Over Drive - When you're doing a tee shot the ball flies farther than the distance set on the club.
Approach - When the ball is at least with 60y of the hole.
Nice Recovery - When the ball safely arrives in the bunker or rough but makes it to the fair or green with a super spin.
Super Pangya Shot - A long drive and combination.
Power Spin - A hole in using a power backspin.
Power Curve - A hole in with a power topspin
Crash Combo - A hole in with a power curver.
Beam Impact - A successful hole in after collision with objects.
Long Putting - A hole in after hitting the light beam.
Long Chip In - A hole in from putting from at least a 17y distance.
Cobra Shot - A successful chip in.
Tomahawk Shot - A successful Cobra shot.
Team Battle Judgement - A successful tomahawk shot.
Happy Bonus - When a member of the team gets a hole in one.

, Take note that when the ground is tilted to the left, the pink portion of the hit bar will be larger on the left, increasing your chance t hook. When the ground is tilted right, the pink portion of the hit bar will be larger on the right, increasing your chance to slice. In the game, when standing on a steep slop, your posture will be poor and hitting the comet will be difficult but not impossible. Best to avoid going to the rough grass since usually the slop there is uneven.

, On PangYa, there are forests and other obstacles that disrupt the wind and causes turbulence. Even if the wind at the tee is blowing North at 2m. If a clump of trees disrupts the wind, it may change the speed and direction. When teeing off, make sure to take such obstacles into consideration and plan for changing winds.

, Upgrading your clubs will increase the stats you wanted such as power (for increase of distance), control (decrease the movement speed of the bar) and accuracy (the white pangya bar between the pink bar.). To upgrade your clubs, simply move to My Room by clinging the My Room button. Choose Item and then Club Set. You will be able to see the club listed there. Click the Upgrade button then select the stats you wish to upgrade.

, As you continue playing the game and taking part of the tournament. You will be able to get rare items such as clubs, clothes and other boost items. In the game, Lounges are a great place for players to sit back and relax after a long day on the greens. Players can create shops so players can sell items they no longer use or want to other players. To join the Lounge, simply go to the Lobby then choose any Lounge you wanted to join.


Inside the room, open the shop menu by right clicking your character.
A window will appear where you can put your items and assign prices.
Press Open Shop if you're ready to sell.

, In the Lounge, you will see players with shop icon over their heads. Simply click on the shop icon to open the window to see the items in the list. If you're planning to purchase the item, click the Purchase button, check the item amount or price and then press complete purchase.

, Tomahawk shot is very useful to have an extra distance. Most players use this when they're about to ran out of moves or to attempt a hole in one. To do a Tomahawk Shot, you need 1 power gauge to perform this. Start swing with a minimum of 80% power then after the half-way mark, push Up, Down with arrow keys. Land a PangYa and your shot is complete. It takes practice to perform this but easy to achieve if you have a high control stat. Control stat decrease the movement of your bar which helps greatly in landing in PangYa.

, When there is a low hanging obstacle, you can use Cobra Shot. Cobra shot go straight and at the same time low before climbing steeply. Just like Tomahawk, you need 1 Power Gauge to do this Special Shot but instead of pressing up, down after the half-way mark, you will be pressing Right then Up with arrow keys. You need to land on Pangya as well to make your shot complete.

, A high flying shot that peaks quickly before descending. You can use this shop when there is a tall object near you. The same as the other special shots, you need 1 power gauge to use this. You have to press Right then Down and on Pangya to complete this shot."

",How to Play Dwarf Fortress," It is free, and doesn't have to be installed.



Get tile sets if you want. Tile sets show pictures instead of letters, and are very helpful, especially for beginners.;
, It is ""Dwarf Fortress.exe"".

, This will create a world for you using a pseudo-random generator. Watch as the mountains, deserts, rain forests, etc. are created. Dwarf Fortress uses a very complex and powerful engine to calculate erosion, rain shadows, drainage, animal simulations, etc.


If you are using a laptop, or your keyboard does not have a number pad, be sure to press E.S.C and change the key bindings by finding ""move secondary selector up"" and changing it to something with the up arrow. I recommend ALT . do the same for ""move secondary selector down"".

, Press shift while holding the number keys to move the world map. Use the u, h, k, and m keys to move around on the local map. (All maps are of the same world. They just have different zoom levels.) Press e to start your castle.


Try finding a place with lots of greens, but with not-so scary monsters; these will be identified in purple as scary, haunted, or terrifying. Make your first fortress an easy one. A good area is one with 2-3 layers of non-rock (will be listed in embark bar as brownish colors) followed by flux-stone (white) marble, granite, or obsidian. All of these rocks are full of delicious goodies such as hematite, limonite, magnetite and tons of gems to cut. Obsidian does not generally contain many of these things, but can be cut into swords by a crafts dwarf which can boost your military in the beginning.

If the place selected has an aquifer, try somewhere else. Aquifers have less stones, because the water washed some precious stones away. Aquifers also create a layer of water under your fortress, which is very bad if you want to dig a deep fortress. If you are using the newest version v.31.##, then make sure your embark location has some sort of water supply such as a river or brook, as farming requires irrigation.



, You will be presented with a semi-confusing menu of seven dwarfs. These are the dwarves your fortress will be starting with and you can choose their professions to suit how you want to play. For example, on your first dwarf, press the right arrow key, or '6', and then increase his skill in mining to around skilled or proficient. The numbers next to his name in blue should decrease. Each dwarf only has a limited amount of skill points to use, so choose carefully. You are going to want approximately 2-3 miners, a woodcutter/carpenter, a grower/herbalist/brewer, and if you are going to be building lava spewing volcanoes to Armok, then a dwarf who is at least a competent mason. Making one or two of your miners a mason or stone detail maker will help out a lot. If you are using v.28.181.40 or older, your last dwarf should probably be an ambusher/marksdwarf as he will start out with a free crossbow/bolts/leather armor. As of v.31.## there is a bug in the hunting skills, and doctoring is highly preferable (diagnostics,suturing, etc.). Make sure to make one of your dwarves a novice judge of intent,organizer, appraiser, and record keeper, he will be designated as expedition leader. If you are more observant, you will have noticed some numbers in the bottom-right corner decreasing as you designate skills. You only have 2000 of these points, and if you are out, press TAB to see a list of everything your expedition is planning to bring. If you are pre-v.31 then you may want to consider ditching the anvil, as it takes up half your points. You can always trade for one later. I recommend bringing 2-3 picks (depending on the number of miners your party has.) 1 battle axe, 1 anvil depending on version, about 20 plump helmet spawn, 2 dogs, 2 cats, 60-80 units of assorted alcohol, 50-80 turtles (which give shells) get rid of crutches, buckets, and splints if you are using a newer version and only bring three ropes. This is really the only stuff your first fortress needs. You can add things not on your list by pressing 'n', and increasing the things on your list by pressing 'alt' up or down if you took my earlier advice.


You will see some dwarves wondering around, waiting impatiently for their fame and fortune. They also have pets, food, drinks, and a wagon they used to get there. This is a third-person game, which also makes dwarf fortress unique.

,, You could live outside, but that's for humans and elves. Make a hallway. The hallway should be 3-4 squares wide, to avoid traffic jams. You miner will come to dig. If there are no hills around you may need to build down stairs in a suitable location. After you build you down stairs, press 'd' then 'i' to select up/down stairs, mine out these on the z-level below your up/down stairs in exactly the same pattern as the above. Do this for 3-5 z-levels. The first or second level (underground) should be dedicated to farming and/or storage of items. Any kind of layer that is non-rock is ideal for this, as rock layers leave behind stone when dug out, stone takes up one square, and so if you grid out a storage area of say, andesite, you are going to need to do a lot of clearing out.

, Then press 'p' and get a bunch of plants. After this step, this guide will be referring only to version 40d (v.28).


To dig, press d (read the command bar), press enter on one corner of the square to dig, move the cursor, and press enter on the other end. You can also use your mouse to do this.

Installing FlightGear (together with scenery, airports and aircraft) takes a while, so while it's installing, go eat a sandwich, watch your favorite TV show, and check back later. The same applies to loading a flight simulation.

, Hold the S key (S for ""start"") to start the engine. Like turning a key in a car, it takes a few seconds for it to ""catch"", and once the engine starts purring, you can safely let go of the key. FlightGear offers in-game flight tutorials, but for quick reference, the most basic controls are as follows —


The space bar starts the engine on a prop engine aircraft (it's usually on when FlightGear starts), Page Up increases throttle, Page Down decreases throttle, the up and down arrows control the elevator, the left and right arrows control the ailerons, and 0 and Enter (on NumPad) control the rudder.
If you have difficulty, click Help, then Basic aircraft controls. Note that, again, FlightGear is designed for realism, and the controls are highly responsive, but also highly sensitive, which can prove quite daunting for the inexperienced flyer.

Do not take all of the initial grants at once.,
Holding cells are much cheaper than individual cells, and can allow you to raise your prisoner numbers (and therefore daily income) quickly.,
You should aim to install TV's, Phones, toilets and benches in the yard (if you intend to keep yard time scheduled on the regime) and canteen (especially if you have multiple ""Eating"" times each day).,
Ensure that meal quantity and variety are set to high.,
Research deployment as your first priority.,
Leave no empty space on your daily schedule.,
Research Prison Labour as soon as possible, it is the only chance you have of making a prison profitable, and riot free.,
Ensure that you maintain a good guard to prisoner ratio.,
Detecting contraband is imperative.,
Use dogs and CCTV sparingly.,
Grow your prison organically.","How to Build a Profitable, Low Danger, Riot Free Prison in Prison Architect","


Although there are no punishment for using the funds for reasons other than as intended or for not completing grant related tasks in a given time, having all of the cash available right off the bat makes you reckless.
Plan your prison first in planning mode, and take grants only as you need them to complete the phases of your project. If you only have 10 prisoners, there is relatively little benefit in building a massive cell block. You can easily extend buildings, so start small, and build only as much foundation as you actually need. Extend the foundations as your capacity requires.
By not taking all grants as soon as they are available, it will force you to think twice before starting a major building project. There is nothing worse than building a massive foundation, and having no money left to fill it out with.;
,


Put beds, TV's and Phones in the holding cell. They are not requirements, but will keep your prisoners much more happy early on. Without them, prisoners sleep, family and recreation needs will spiral out of control before you know it, and riots will ensue.
Ensure that there is one bed per prisoner in a holding cell, one Phone and TV to every 3-5 prisoners and one toilet to every 10 or so prisoners sharing the cell. One bench is sufficient regardless of prisoner numbers, as they will be much more inclined to use benches in canteen, yard or other areas during their free time.
Holding cell doors close even during the day (when regular cell doors remain open). Ensure that there is one guard stationed in each holding cell to avoid prisoners getting locked in for extended periods of time.
Do not rush to build individual cells for prisoners, (except possibly getting your capacity up to 15, to receive the $10,000 grant completion bonus). As long as there are beds, TVs and phones, prisoners will happily remain in a holding cell for several days or weeks, allowing you to work on other things like laundry and workshops as an initial priority. Holding cells can easily be torn down and the space converted into standard cells later (where you will already have beds for them).
Prisoners also do not attempt to tunnel out of holding cells, so use this to your advantage early until you are ready to tackle potential prisoner escapes.

,


Prisoners who have already eaten earlier in the day and no longer have a hunger need, or who do not have an exercise need, will still visit either the canteen or yard during defined eating or yard times. They will not, however eat or exercise, and will therefore just stop when they get into the area, and get in the way. Phones, TV's and toilets will allow them to attend to other needs during these times of day when they can't go elsewhere. It also keeps them out of the way of prisoners who do need to attend to these needs.

, Hungry prisoners are riotous prisoners, well fed prisoners are content prisoners. If they are well fed, they will put up with a lot of other issues, especially early on.

, Set your kitchen, storerooms etc as staff only as early as possible, this will prevent prisoners from getting hold of the worst kinds of weapons.

, White space is essentially lockdown your prisoners will be forced to return to their cells with no way of fulfilling needs like entertainment, family or freedom, which prisoners really dislike.


Replace all empty space with ""Free time"" initially, and they will attend to their own needs quite happily.

,


Once you have researched Prison Labour, convert some of this free time into work, but still ensure that there is sufficient free time available to attend to their other needs.
Dirty uniforms and surroundings do not make prisoners happy, and will result in serious complaints. Ensure that laundry rooms and cleaning cupboards are installed and staffed as soon as Prison Labour is available. Prisoners can later be replaced by janitors to keep the prison clean if you prefer, but these can be researched later.
Split the working day up. You lose a little efficiency—depending on the layout of your prison, it can take as much as 30 in game minutes for prisoners to get to the workshop and begin work—but your prisoners are much happier for it. Two 4 hour work shifts broken up by a couple of hours of free time is much better for prisoner morale than one 7 or 8 hour shift, and the financial losses are fairly minimal.
Several smaller (but interconnected) workshops are better than one large one. Although for efficiency's sake, they should all be in the same room or complex, share an entrance and exits, and prisoners should be able to freely move from one workshop to another, breaking it it up into smaller units using fence and (locked open) doors will allow you to assign many more prisoners to work in PI, greatly increasing your daily profits.

, Typically aim for 1 guard per enclosed area (cell block, canteen, workshop, laundry etc) which prisoners have access to, plus around 5-10% of your prisoner capacity as unassigned guards, with a minimum of 4 unassigned guards at all times.

,


Although expensive, metal detectors are imperative in ensuring your prison runs smoothly. At minimum, ensure that prisoners need to pass through one when entering and leaving the canteen, workshop, visiting area and kitchen (if you intend to use prisoners to work the kitchens, which I don't recommend). Ideally, also make them pass through one before returning to their cells, or any area with a toilet or TV, where they can stash the contraband, but this can be a longer term goal.
Dog patrols help detect smelly, non metallic contraband. However in current versions of the game, this is not so important, as it has no real value to prisoners. Only tools or weapons can be used, and all of these are metal.

However dogs are very useful in detecting possible tunnels, though currently seem to throw up a lot of false positives.


Search every cell block at least once every day.The best time to do this is during meal or yard times, as all prisoners will be out of the cell block (and will therefore not be searched unnecessarily, which is a serious complaint that increases the danger level in the prison). Click on one bed or toilet in each cell block and choose ""Search Cell Block"". This will search every possible hiding place in the cell block, like a shakedown, but without angering the prisoners. Ensure at least one guard is assigned to the canteen (not just to patrol it) during this, as all available guards, including those on patrol will leave their posts to carry out the search.

, In current versions of the game, it is much better to spend the money on additional guards, rather than lots of dogs or CCTV cameras. though this will undoubtedly change.

, Turn off all intake for a few days if you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, do not run out of money building huge new cell blocks until you are at or over your capacity (remember to add any additional capacity you have from holding cells as this is not included in the number displayed on screen). Patience is key. Trying to get too big too quickly will inevitably lead to even longer periods of waiting while you slowly build up cash reserves to complete your current project. It is best not to start a project until you can fully fund it to completion, and keep the money in reserve for unforeseen emergencies like repairs and tunnel removal.

Consider your PC or Laptop Configuration.Before you are buying flight simulators, you will need to take into account the graphic settings of your PC.,
Take into Account Your Favorite PC Games.,
Test the Flight Simulators.,
Read Online Reviews.,
Compare Prices.,
Check For Updates.",How to Find the Best Flight Simulators for PC Games," The higher the resolution is the better. Just ensure that the video card and software will be able to deal with the speed and you will have enough memory for running PC Games.;
, You can buy many PC Games in your life, but you will always have your favorites. That is why you will need to prioritize the consoles and additional PC Games features with your preferred games in mind. Advanced flight simulators will take up more memory than simple games, and you should ensure you are getting your computer checked before you are making a purchase.

, These days – thanks to the Internet – you can easily test the flight simulators online or in the shop. You will not need to guess how it feels like to virtually navigate a plane. You can get the same graphics, sound and experience by testing the PC Games. It is a clever idea to get demos for free, before you invest hard cash.

, The best way to determine the value behind different PC Games is to ask an expert. There are loads of computer geeks online, who are happy to write about different products they have tried and share the information for free. There is nothing better than an expert review about flight simulators, and you can also compare the features and benefits of each and every brand, before you make a decision.

, Once you have the product in mind, avoid just walking in to the shop and buying it. There are many online PC Games retailers offering free delivery and better prices than shops. You need to be able to purchase a new game for the same price people would sell you their used ones. Just use price comparison and review sites to get the full picture about the offer.

, Everybody likes having the latest PC Games. Find out if there is a new version to come out soon, and wait. You might even be able to reserve your own item before it gets released online, and that is one of the main advantages of updated online PC Games shops. You also have to find out if the version the site offers is the latest, and if you get free software updates with the product.

Move your ship north towards his dock warehouse. At the top right-hand corner of your screen, a pop-up will appear asking if you would like to accept the tools and building modules. Accept the request so the materials will be loaded onto your ship.;
, After picking up materials from Mr. Strindberg’s warehouse, head southwest to an undeveloped island where you will begin to settle your new city. Bring your ship close to the island’s shore so you can begin to build a warehouse.

, Once you are beside the shoreline of your new island, a pop-up will appear allowing you to select a warehouse to be built (costs 300 Credits, 3 Building Modules, and 2 Tools). The warehouse will have an influence radius, displaying how far the warehouse can go to pick up goods.


If the position you chose is a problem, you can easily move it by hitting Escape, moving your ship, and then placing it again in a new spot.

, Once you place your new warehouse, EVE (Extended Virtual Entity) will contact you mentioning the need to build a city on your island. Start by building a City Center somewhere on your island. The Center will cost you 300 Credits, 5 Building Modules, and 3 Tools. It is best to place it where there is a lot of space to build houses around the City Center.


Next you will need to build 8 Worker Barracks. Each will cost you 2 Building Modules.
Make sure the Worker Barracks and the City Center are all connected by roads. If they are not connected by roads, the Worker Barracks will not have anyone moving into them.

, The Building Module is one of the most important goods for an early city. It is used in building practically everything! To start the production of these modules, start by building 1 Basalt Crusher and 1 Smelter. Make sure these buildings are connected to a Storage Depot or a Warehouse by road. Once the buildings are in place, Building Modules will begin to be built and end up in your island’s storage.


The Basalt Crusher will cost you 50 Credits and 1 Tool while the Smelter will cost you 50 Credits and 2 Tools.

, You will be asked by EVE to build a Fishery on your island. Place it near your dock warehouse and connect it by a road. This will complete the basic needs that you will require to continue expanding your city.


The Fishery costs 125 Credits, 1 Building Module, and 2 Tools.

, Mr. Strindberg will contact you, giving you Turbine parts and asking for them to be improved. Click on the ship to receive the items. They will be added to your island’s warehouse.

, In order for your island to run properly, you will need a sufficient amount of power. EVE informs you that you need to build 1 Rotary Excavator and 1 Coal Power Station. Build these two buildings close to a warehouse or depot, and connect them by a road.


The Rotary Excavator will cost you 50 Credits, 1 Building Module, and 3 Tools while the Coal Power Station will cost you 350 Credits, 1 Building Module, and 4 Tools.

, You will receive a new piece of mail to show you how to view mail in the game. All you have to do is click on the message at the bottom of your screen to read it.


You can also read your mail by pressing Escape and clicking on your mailbox to view past mail.

, Mr. Strindberg will message you telling you to pick up Steel from his warehouse in the northeast. Pick up the Steel and return it to your warehouse so the construction of the new Turbine can begin.

, You require more room for workers in your city! Make another 7 Worker Barracks connecting them to your City Center. Remember to use roads to connect these two buildings or else no one will move into the new Worker Barracks.

, After building the new houses, Mr. Strindberg will ask for the optimized Turbine. All you need to do is click the “OK” button from the message to hand over the new Turbine. This will complete the mission and play a cutscene showing the dam bursting and flooding the city below, promptly starting the next mission.

,, It allows the _drivePort to be free as often as possible

, So, add ‘_drivePort.Subscribe(_driveNotify);’ below ‘base.Start();’ in the Start function.
Now we need to add a function to listen to messages that come in on the _driveNotify port. The code we add is complex for the simple concept we want to achieve. But it allows the runtime to synchronize the processing better (from what I understand of it at least)

Code Block 1


We made reference in that block of code to a function named DriveUpdateHandler. Here’s the implementation. All it does is to set the robot into a wide circle. This is NOT the best way to do this. But it gives you a quick understanding of how everything gets wired up.

Code Block 2


Build the project. It should compile and build just fine.

, We didn’t specifically state that we’re connecting to the simulation environment in our code. So we have to do it somewhere else. That place is in the manifest file. The one for this project is called Simplest.manifest.xml. We want to open it in the manifest editor.


From Start, Programs, Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5) run Microsoft Dss Manifest Editor.
Click File, Open, choose your manifest file C:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5)\My\Simplest\Simplest.manifest.xml
Find the Simulation Engine service from the list of services on the left. Add it to your manifest.
With the SimulationEngine selected IN your manifest, Click the Import Initial State button in the properties window.
Change to the samples\config folder (C:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (1.5)\samples\Config)
Change the file type to Any XML File
Choose iRobot.Create.Simulation.xml

This will load a bunch of standard entities (blocks and such) as well as the iRobot Create entity. It is named IRobotCreateMotorBase


Now we choose the simplest service in the manifest editor
Then find Simulated Generic Differential Drive in the list of services on the left
Add it to the manifest diagram by dragging it ON TOP OF the simplest drive entry in the manifest. This will do two things. Add the SimulatedGenericDifferentialDrive service AND associate it with the simplest drive service. This is why we chose PartnerCreationPolicy.UsePartnerListEntry in the declaration in our code.
The only thing left is to associate the SimulatedGenericDifferentialDrive service to an actual entity in the SimulationEngine configuration. So, click on the Entity reference under SimulatedDifferentialDrive and set the Simulation Entity property to ‘http://localhost/IRobotCreateMotorBase’.

, I am by no means an expert. It has taken me a couple weeks to figure this stuff out. And since these parts finally clicked I decided to post them for everyone’s benefit.

Navigate your ship to the survivors at the marked positions south of Thor’s Warehouse. Right-click on the lifeboats to pick up the people. There are three lifeboats you need to pick up. Once you have done this, return to your warehouse and drop off the survivors.;
, Each Worker Barracks will cost you 2 Building Modules. Make sure to construct these Barracks near your City Center and connect them by a road. Mr. Thorne will then ask you to protect certain depots to prevent them from flooding.

, Head to Mr. Thorne’s Ark to retrieve the sandbags. The sandbags you are given are predefined and don’t have a certain amount. You will be using these sandbags to protect depots from the flooding due to the dam.

, Once you have sandbags on your ship, head to the 3 depots marked on your map. Align your ship up against a depot and left-click to use the sandbags. Do this for the other two depots to complete this task and move on to the next.

, Mr. Strindberg will request you to pick up oil from his warehouse and deliver it to your own warehouse. Head to his warehouse and accept the offer of Oil. You will then need to return the 1 Crude Oil to your warehouse on your island. Once you complete this task, you will finish the first Main Objective. The next objective will involve repairing the damaged dam.

, You will need to meet the required needs of Tycoon Employees to repair the dam. Start by building 1 Distillery and 2 Rice Farms on your island to start producing liquor.


The Distillery will cost you 50 Credits, 2 Building Modules, and 1 Tool; while the Rice Farm will cost you 250 Credits, 1 Building Module, 3 Tools, and 2 Wood for one.
Make sure these buildings are connected to a warehouse or depot so the resources can be delivered properly.

, Mr. Thorne will ask you to add Rice Fertility to your island by picking up Rice Seeds from his ship at your island. Click on Mr. Thorne’s Ship to receive the seeds. Open your warehouse and click the Rice Seeds to activate them on your island. This can be done by left-clicking on the seeds icon.

, The last need Tycoon Employees require is Activity. This can be satisfied by constructing a Casino on your island. When placing the Casino, place it near your houses so its influence area is covering them. Make sure the Casino and houses are connected by road as well. You will begin to see the houses upgrading to Tycoon Employees once all these needs are met. This will unlock the buildings needed to make tools to repair the dam.


The Casino will cost you 300 Credits, 4 Building Modules, and 4 Tools.

, To start the construction of tools, you first need to build a depot near the Raw material deposits on your island. One depot will cost you 300 Credits, 1 Building Module, and 3 Tools. Make sure the depot’s influence is covering these deposits.

, Start by building 1 Iron Ore Mine and 1 Coal Mine on the two deposits you have found. Make sure a road connects these mines to your depot. The next set of buildings to build are the Iron Smelter and Tool Workshops. Construct 1 Iron Smelter and 2 Tool Workshops. Once they are all connected to a depot by road, watch them begin to produce tools!


An Iron Ore Mine will cost you 600 Credits, 2 Building Modules, and 4 Tools; while the Coal Mine will cost you 600 Credits, 2 Building Modules, and 2 Tools.
A Iron Smelter will cost you 400 Credits, 2 Building Modules, and 4 tools; while one Tool Workshop will cost you 500 Credits, 2 Building Modules, and 3 Tools.

, Wait for 15 tools to be constructed from your Tool Workshops; this can take a couple of minutes for the process to finish. You will then need to deliver them to Engineer Peterson located at the Dam. This will complete Mission 2 and lead to the next mission called the Black Sea.

Produce a diplomat and establish communication with as many cultures as possible.,
Note that when building an army, always try to equip it with a wide variety of warriors.,
Remember that while besieging an enemy town, make your weakest troops command the siege engines you build at the town (siege towers, rams, etc.),
After conquering a city, see what the city's happiness level is before you decide what to do with its citizens by looking at its window through the space between the information scroll and the edge of the screen.,

Battles are often won before the opposing armies ever see each other.,

When choosing where to expand, always keep in mind two factors.,
Use forts, they can be priceless in their ability to keep enemies out of your territory, to seal mountain passes and shut down bridges.",How to Be Great at Rome Total War," If, however, you want that that city to grow and don't mind making a little bit less every turn, move it to the lowest tax rate until you upgrade it.;
, As long as you have the money, try to make sure that all of your settlements have at least one building being produced on the construction panel.

, If you have conquered a city and it already has a religious structure from a different culture, destroy it and build your own. The only exception to this is when that city's happiness rating is too low to last a turn without that building without revolting.

, However, if you have the ability to upgrade the city and the citizens are becoming too restless, delay whichever current structure you are building with the new one that will advance your city.

, It's good to build some strong allies early. Don't ally yourself with a faction though if you plan on waging war on them any time soon.

, Include spearmen to defend against cavalry, heavy infantry to combat the enemy's spearmen and other infantry, cavalry to outmaneuver your enemy or to match theirs, archers or javelin-men to harass your enemy before your melee units engage, and when you have a city advanced enough to build some, siege equipment to attack a town without waiting another turn or more.

, unless they are at risk from being attacked by the outside. You don't want your best unit to be cut down by arrows before even engaging the enemy. When you've brought siege equipment, such as onagers and ballistate, try not to destroy any buildings that appear in the campaign map. When you've finally broken the gate or a section of their wall, you should group the units you plan to send in and press Shift+8 to move them into column formation. This is best for storming a city.

, If it's red, you should massacre or enslave the citizens. In that situation, massacre them. If it's blue, enslave them. If it's yellow, you could still enslave them just in case. If it's green, neither massacre nor enslavement is necessary, but then again, you are the king, so it's completely up to you.

, It is possible to defend a city with 21 weak Greek Cavaliers against 350 Macedonian spearmen and archers and win with 15 men remaining and your general still alive. When you're the one whose city is about to be stormed, place the troops with the strongest defence near the place where the enemy has penetrated your city, and put them into guard mode. There are all types of different methods you can attempt to try to save your city. Something that often works is to put some spearmen a few yards back from wherever the enemy has come in and let them advance. Then, order any swordsmen, no matter how strong or weak, to attack it's now unprotected flanks since it is trapped between your defending army and the gate.

, Always try to place your army on a hilltop when it's about to be attacked. This hill will be on the battle map as well, and the slope could be the difference between defeat and victory.

, Leaving your ranged units on fire-at-will can cause them to fire and hit your own men if they are close to the enemy.

, Put yourself into win-win situations.

, Chariots on the run can still cause casualties to you by the blades on their wheels.

, Morale is as much a weapon as any conventional one, don't overlook it.

, The first is military, take over a settlement to make defending your empire easier, or to weaken an enemy. The second, and most important, is economics. Your main drive in attacking a settlement is to make more money, either by opening up new trade routes or merely adding more people to tax.

, Only family members (Generals with portraits) can build forts. These forts must be manned by at least one unit at all times, or they will fall into disrepair, and disappear. Forts can be used to prevent war, and they also makes sure you'll be calling the shots once it starts.

If you are trying to unlock factions for the Barbarian Invasion expansion instead, look for barbarian_invasion/descr_strat.txt in the same ""campaign"" folder.;
, Just in case, make a copy of this file with the same name and save it in a different folder. Now if these changes cause problems in your game, you can drag the copy back into this folder. That will replace the altered file and undo any bugs that the changes introduced.

, Make sure to copy only the lines that include the faction names. If you introduce any extra spaces or other characters, this will not work. Each line must begin with a single Tab ↹, followed by the single word that described that faction.

, This hack lets you play as factions you can not unlock during normal gameplay. However, there are several issues you should be aware of before moving them all to the playable section:


The SPQR (""roman_senate"") and Rebel (""slave"") factions are buggy. Your SPQR game will crash if you click the Missions tab, and the Rebel game will crash on loading for some players. In rare cases, players have reported more serious bugs that required uninstalling the game. Try these factions at your own risk.
The Barbarian Invasion does not allow you to play as the Romano-British, Ostrogoths, Slavs, East Empire Rebels, or West Empire Rebels. Choosing one of these factions will crash your game unless you download a third-party mod.The faction selection screen can only display 20 factions. Keep some factions you are not currently playing in another section.

, Launch Rome, restarting it if it's already open. The factions you made playable should now appear as options when you start a new campaign.

, If the factions still don't appear, you likely have an unpatched version of Rome: Total War (earlier than 1.5). You will need to change an additional file to unlock all factions:Navigate back to the data folder and open /data/text/campaign_descriptions.txt
Copy-paste this into the file:

Know the playable factions.,
Start a short campaign as the Julii.,
Gather resources.,
Establish your power center in northern Italy.,
Use your diplomats wisely.,
Form two armies.,
Occupy nearby cities.,
Switch to rapid military expansion.,
Pay attention to your funds.,
Complete the campaign.",How to Get All Factions in Rome Total War2," At the start of the game, you can only play as one of the three Roman houses: the Julii, Brutii, and Scipii. Once you beat a campaign as one of these factions, you will unlock the Britons, Gauls, Carthaginians, Greeks, Egyptians, Parthians, Seleucids, and Greeks.For strategy advice on beating the campaign as fast as possible, continue to the next step. If you're interested in unlocking normally unplayable factions, you'll need to edit the game files instead.

, This is generally considered the fastest way to beat a campaign. Since completing any campaign will unlock the other factions, choosing the short option will save you a lot of time. To win this campaign, you'll need to defeat Gaul and control at least fifteen provinces., Your first priority is growing the economy of your two cities, and taking the northwestern town of Segesta as instructed by the Senate. These should be your first actions in the campaign:


Send your faction leader's army back to Arretium.Build paved roads here.Send your other army to besiege Segesta. Take and occupy it immediately, or wait two turns for them to surrender.
Build a port in Ariminum.Install governors at Ariminium and Segesta as soon as you can.

, The Julii's major weakness is its lack of easy money sources. Spend the first couple years of the campaign improving your city in ways that increase resource generation. This includes ports, traders, and markets. For now, you only need military buildings at Arretium, and it's worth prioritizing economic buildings even there.During this time, send your armies out north of the Alps and to the northwest of Segesta. Build forts there within sight of the Gaulic cities so you have advance warning if they attack.

, Your starting diplomat can quickly negotiate a trade route with the Gauls, usually earning you 700–1000 denarii. This is a temporary measure, though, since you'll soon be at war. You may decide to send him to one of these locations instead, or to recruit additional diplomats to cover these tasks:Sail east to Greece and negotiate an alliance for 4000–8000 denarii.
Travel west to Spain, and wait until after you've attacked Gaul to negotiate protection and trade for 2000–5000.
Keep an eye out for cost-effective bribe opportunities. Unled rebel forces and soldiers from other Roman factions are usually a good deal for your money. Gallic captains are also good targets.

, Have Arretium produce as many hastati as you can afford, along with a couple unites of equities. Split your forces into two armies, each led by a general. At this stage of the game, your basic infantry forces should be able to defeat larger barbarian forces:Arrange your hastati (infantry) to use the manipulated tactic: have two or three lines of reinforcement, and allow the front lines to fall back behind the next whenever morale or fatigue becomes an issue.
Protect the archers you start the game with at all costs. Use fire arrows when enemies are close to routing.
Equities (your cavalry forces) are weak, but a wedge charge from the side can easily cause a rout. Keep them well away from battle at the sides of your forces, and charge only when you can hit an unprotected flank.

, By around turn 5 or 6, you should have enough of an army to attack Gaul, your main enemy. Have one army attack any roving bands of Gauls to the north, then besiege Mediolanum and Patavium. At the same time, have your second army sail west along the coast and take the city of Massilia, again prioritizing Gaulic units outside the city (if present).Although the Gauls rarely make a serious attempt on Massilia, the Britons may show up if they're acting aggressive. Don't leave it undefended.

, Build barracks in all cities and start recruiting for your army. From this point onward your goal is a rapid military campaign, and you'll need a growing army to complete the campaign before your enemies entrench themselves. Your immediate goal is to defeat Gaul, which you can do as follows:Move along the coast to take port cities such as Narbo Martius first, stealing the Gauls' trade income.
Kill Gaulic family members whenever possible. If the Gaul faction falls early, you may be able to complete your campaign by spending all your funds bribing rebels.
Depending on where your armies are strongest and where the Gauls have concentrated their forces, either move south into Gaul-controlled Spain, or march north and take the Gaulic capital (usually Alesia).After a successful campaign in either area, the rest of Gaul is usually easy to defeat.

, As mentioned before, the Julii can easily get low on denarii. Don't neglect your road upgrades, which have a massive effect on trade and allow faster transport through your little empire. Build farms whenever necessary for city growth, along with just enough health or entertainment buildings to prevent severe squalor or revolt.If you've defeated Gaul but still only have 10 provinces or so, you'll likely need to spend some downtime keeping your cities happy and building income sources., Once Gaul is defeated, your cities are relatively happy, and your armies are back up to full strength, all you need to do is conquer provinces until you have fifteen of them. In most games, the Britons will have a substantial presence on the continent by now, and will likely attack you even if you attempt to ally yourself with them. Make them your next target, keeping the following in mind:


The Britons' chariot has a terrible effect on your morale. Recruit more missile troops to wear them down before they charge.Naval warfare in this area is dangerous. Blockading ports will greatly weaken the Briton economy, but if you're struggling with finances you may want to stick to land for the short campaign. Do not blockade Londinium until the Senate offers you a reward for doing so.
If necessary, ally with the Germans for help against the British — but keep an eye out for poorly defended German towns, which may be your final couple provinces.
If you're still short on provinces, conquer poorly defended Carthaginian cities, starting with Caralis on the nearby island of Sardinia.

Point the nose of your beauty jet at the flying target (the hardest flying target is the Mirage you can find it at the mission of attacking bombers).

Track the opponent pointing your nose in front of him (to lead him with gun fire) and make sure to make the big circle right on it (the jet) while its flying (at the very close range) and the (small circle at the case of the little bit widened range target), fire short rounds and it will detonate like hell so no need to spend lot of rounds over a single target, that's why you know it here also bear in mind that you have got only 150 rounds in that stingy Russian 30MM-Gsh Cannon.

,
Know that if the target is stationary (in your 12 o'clock) (right in front of you without maneuvering) then you will find that the W Figure in your gun sight coincides on the big circle and the small circle at the same time, make the big circle and the W figure slightly under your target then shoot.,

The 30MM-Gsh High explosive, armour piercing& incendiary flash rounds are quite affective at hitting a target, your enemy can feel the vibration if you're firing against him at close range without hitting him even.

Bear in mind that the Cannon guns is the only weapon can be used in a swirling air to air combat (classic air combat) because there is no way you can fire a missile since you won't be able to lock-on your target in the first place also if u fire a missile, it won't guide.

Have lots of money.,
Train people to become good armies.,
Own great armies.,
You need to keep a look out for several factions.",How to Become the Strongest Faction in Rome Total War," Money is the main thing because if you don't have money you can't build armies, buildings or hire mercenaries. which means you will lose. To get lots of money you have to make your people pay taxes and keep them happy. The main way to make money is to capture as many cities as you can, because it just makes people pay more.;
, To have a good army you have to have good people to train. Now if you're in the beginning of the game all you can hire is town watch, hastati, and peasants. Peasants make come in higher numbers but they're very, very weak and should only be used as a last resort. Hastati are the best people in the beginning of the game but they do throw javelins before they go into hand to hand combat. Town watch should only be used to fight armies coming into the middle of your area. Town watch should also only be used to fight weak armies. To get good armies you just have to build the barracks, stables, and different archery ranges and a good thing to keep in mind is that you want to build the type of building you need the most, you just don't want pure military power.

, Great armies consist of warlord cavalry, principles, triarii, praetorian cohorts,and much more. Warlord cavalry is the generals cavalry and are strong. Principles are the oldest men in the army and are very strong when in numbers. They the Triarii and Praetorian cohorts are what you call heavy infantry. Triarii are best against cavalry and are great against infantry to.

, Firstly, the Greeks. The Greeks are a really powerful faction but mostly depend on spear men not cavalry. Secondly, the Carthaginians. They depend on one unit... elephants. They are extremely powerful and their faction should be destroyed as soon as possible to prevent them from getting armored elephants.

Choose a Faction.,
Think of who to smash first!,
Remember that money is the key to winning.,
Always keep a good garrison in your provinces.,
Have eyes and ears in your enemies' countries.,
Send out assassins.,
Take your time fighting a faction: Rome wasn't built in a day.,
Defend the rebels with ports.",How to Be Good in Medieval: Total War," Choosing a faction is key, because playing a certain faction has benefits and advantages than others do. Such as unit types, province bonuses, and titles.;
, Now, when you start playing you have to be a little aggressive to grabs some territories and start racking in the cash from them. Usually, that means you're going to have to fight another faction (Because if you don't, they'll get you later on) but don't take on the whole world by yourself! Take on factions one at a time.

, Without cash, you have nothing to fuel your war machine. Plus no money to ransom back some of your troops or generals in case they get captured. You'll also find a hard time trying to build new buildings in your provinces as well. A good source of income is merchant fleets that connect one of your provinces with trade able resources to a foreign port that also has trade goods then you'll earn a pretty penny.

, If you don't, then the province will rebel against you! Especially if you have just acquired a new province from an enemy faction or rebels. Try reducing the tax rate as it will make them happier and less likely to revolt. Also, when you capture an enemy province then a scroll piece will appear. This is a Title for a general under your command. These Titles can help boost the Loyalty of a general in your military tree. They also have a variety of other boosts such as: Dread, Command, Acumen, and Piety.

, Having spies can be useful in many ways in Medieval. For one, they can gather information about the province they are in. They can also reveal hidden vice from an enemy general or King! In result of this, it could cause penalties for the generals statistics or make the province he is governing more rebellious. Spies aren't the only ones capable of peeking about in Europe. Emissaries, Bishops, Cardinals, Inquisitors, Princesses, and Imams are capable of spying on enemy provinces but they aren't as good of course as the spy is.

, Aye, this may be dirty but it sure is easy to wipe out someone who's pestering you the sneaky way. Be careful though! Assassins that are fresh from training aren't going to be very experienced off hand. They need to kill lesser targets in order to be better at killing more important figures. Why you should be careful is that assassins could wind you up in a lot of trouble with another nation if they get caught trying to kill someone. Usually it means war but if the nation is too busy to worry about you then they just shrug off the fact and focus on other matters. Assassin's don't just have to be for killing your enemies, they can also be used to kill your lame generals, princes, and even your King! Ironic, huh?

, Be patient and think strategically. Also, if you are playing as a Catholic faction fighting another Catholic faction (ie. England vs. France) then be careful because the Pope hates it when Catholics are fighting against each other so he'll probably excommunicate you. I bet you're thinking ""So what? I don't care."" Well, if that's the case then I hope you have a rather large army because once you get excommunicated then the Pope basically declared you free game for Crusades. Don't worry, if you did get excommunicated it doesn't last for too long and most of the time it rarely happens that you see yourself getting Crusades declared upon.

, A rebel province with a port is the same as a province from a neutral country if you are neutral with the rebels. When the rebels with ports (and at least 1 fort) is attacked by a computer, relieve the siege so you can retain a trade partner."

Understand the origins of the language.,
Understand that simlish was developed further by linguists and speech actors for use in the Sims.,
Know that there are a few English words in simlish, thrown in for variety.,
Discover that a great deal of simlish is created in song, beginning with Hot Date.,
Use the sims and pay attention to the sounds.,
Find and download various famous recording artists who, as part of a promotional campaign, have released version of their songs in simlish.,
Record your voice and practice improvising in simlish, then play back the results to see how close you are to the voices in the game and the music.",How to Speak Simlish," During development, Will Wright, the creator of the Sims, felt that the characters needed voices to express emotion and connect with the player, but the thought of real languages would sound too repetitive and would be too costly to translate. So, the development team started on working on a fake written language by combining the alphabet and visual structure of over eight different world languages (English, French, Finnish, Latin, Ukrainian, Cebuano, Fijian and Tagalog). The spoken version of Simlish is just gibberish which was improvised during recording. In fact, the developer specifically hired actors that were good at making up gibberish sounds during auditions., By studying parts of language, they were able to create a gibberish language that modulates and emphasizes like a real language. These techniques give simlish a consistent and realistic sound although it is, for the most part, improvised.

, In interviews, Maxis Audio Director Robi Kauker has indicated that it takes about 40,000 audio samples to put together a version of simlish. In addition, there are certain phrases that the voice actors are instructed to include in all versions of the language (male, female, baby, alien, etc.) including the baby (nooboo) and pizza (chumcha). Currently the development team responsible for simlish voice and music numbers six people.

, Imitating songs may be the best way to learn to sound simlish.

, You can pick up a lot of the simlish style this way.

, Imitate them. Recording artists who have cut tracks (and even videos) in simlish include:


The Black Eyed Peas
Lily Allen
Bare Naked Ladies
Aly & AJ
Drew Carey
Depeche Mode
The Flaming Lips
Pussycat Dolls
My Chemical Romance
Natasha Bedingfield
Paramore
Neon Trees
Katy Perry
Pixie Lott
Kimbra
Becky G

, Repeat and practice to get better at sounding simlish.


PS: Simlish was developed through understanding Ukrainian and Tagalog (a major language of the Philippines). It may be a little easy after knowing these two languages. Also you can say ""how are like"" (shee so ba)

Now you can draw a picture that matches the theme of your song somewhere on the screen by clicking on the colour you want and placing it down. Make sure that you keep you notes that your bugs play away from the picture so they don't get mixed up together.

, You do this by placing one or more of your bugs on the notes that you wanted it to play. You use the tweezers to get the bug(s) to the notes. Now sit back and enjoy the music. If you still have any corrections to make, you should do them immediately.

, You do this by clicking on 'file', and then 'save'. Now you have to fill in three boxes. In the one that says 'artist', put your name there. In the one that says 'title', put the title of your song there.

Death by starvation.,

Death by burning.,
Death by shocking.,
Death by Guinea Pig.",How to Kill a Sim in the Sims 11," Make your Sim walk to a relatively clear space in the garden and build a wall around them. The wall should be as small as you can make it and it should have no doors. Your Sim should eventually starve after a few Sim days.

You can then delete the walls. 
This is the easiest method, but it is very long and drawn out and you have to put up with many Sim days of Jim Sim complaining at you to feed him, take him to the loo, shower him etc. etc.
If your Sim is unable to move for some reason or you don't have enough space in your garden, then just remove all doors, food and telephones from the room where the Sim is in.;
, Make your Sim jump into the swimming pool using a diving board, then remove the ladder or build a wall right around the pool. Your Sim will keep swimming but eventually he/she will get too tired and drown.

It's a cruel way to go, but relatively easy and quicker than starvation. Your Sim will still complain while swimming, though.

, Buy some fireworks and set them up in Your Sim's room. Make sure there are lots of wooden objects in there. Make your Sim explode a firework in his room. The room will set on fire and your Sim will die.

No complaints, but a torched room to deal with, and a lot of ashes to be swept up by your Sim's roommate.

, This will work 80% of the time. If it doesn't, you can just turn it into death by starvation. Make your Sim walk to a clear space in the garden and build a medium-sized wall around him, about the size of a small room. Don't build any doors. Put a fireplace inside it and put a wooden chair right in front of it. Make your Sim light the fire and sit on the chair. The chair should catch fire, along with poor Jim Sim. 

You can then delete the walls and the fireplace, and there is only a small pile of ashes for your Sim's roommate to deal with.
You can also simply get your Sim (if he/she has no cooking skill) to try and cook a hot meal without a fire alarm, and a fire will probably start. He/she will burn if he doesn't run away or try to put the fire out. However, you will have to renovate the kitchen and you will leave a lot of mess for your Sim's roommate to clean up.

, Wait until your TV is broken, then get your Sim (if he/she has no mechanic ability at all) to try to fix it. Jim Sim will unfortunately be electrocuted and die.

Sometimes your Sim will get lucky and miraculously fix it without injuring himself/herself at all, so this will also work if a Sim with any amount of mechanic ability attempts to fix a broken TV while standing in a puddle of water. If your Sim has an... er... accident while standing in front of the TV, then tries to fix the TV, he/she will discover an unfortunate end.
If your Sim tries to fix a flat-screen TV with no mechanic ability and no water, he will definitely die, but flat-screens cost a lot of money.

, Buy a Guinea Pig, and remove all 'Forgotten Guinea Pig' paintings from the house. Make your Sim forget about his Guinea Pig for a few days, until the cage gets dirty. Then make him/her randomly play with the Guinea Pig. The Guinea Pig will probably bite poor Jim Sim, who will be infected by the dreaded Guinea Pig disease.

The symptoms are coughing and sneezing, as you would expect from a normal cold. Don't care for your Sim at all. Delete all of the doors and leave your Sim outside if you have to. Your Sim's poor roommate will be confined inside the house for a few days, but your Sim will eventually die.

Removal by bad parenting.,
Removal by bad grades.",How to Kill a Sim in the Sims 12," Make your Sim parents ignore their child for days, until he/she is hungry, tired and bored. The social worker will come and take him away. Make sure free will is turned off so there is no interaction between the child and the parents.

If your Sim parents completely ignore their baby in the same way, The Social Worker will come very quickly to take the baby away.

, Make your Sim child repeatedly miss school for days, and do not make him/her study or do his/her homework by using the bookcase at home (Sims can be home-schooled if they study every day from the bookcase). The teacher will come and send him/her to military school. The Sim won't be very happy, but it's a kinder way to go."

Developing your romantic relationship to reach “Marriage” status requires constant completion of tasks that improves your relationship with your partner.

, To place the crib, either buy from the store or click on your inventory if you have bought directly from the children's store. Then, go to a free tile in your house and press the ""Check Mark"" to place.


If you are placing it next to the wall, place it so that the ""roof"" of the crib is facing the wall.

, When the baby finally arrives, tap the crib to customize its name, gender, and other details.

, You can add a new baby by buying another crib in Build Mode. You also need to level up to add a new Sim.


In case you have already reached the maximum Sims in your level, simply remove one from the “Create-a-Sim” menu- or, you can lower your Sim Count by moving one temporarily to another town.
Make sure that you have married Sims and have at least one adult in the house before adding a baby Sim.

Cook food items for your Sims.",How to Get More Money and LP on the Sims Freeplay1," Inspired Sims earn more Simoleons when they complete tasks. You can inspire Sims by fulfilling their needs. To see a Sims' needs, select him or her and look at the bars. If the Sim is hungry, use the fridge to eat. If the Sim is low on Fun, rest by watching TV or playing on the computer. If your Sims' social needs are low, try petting your dog, talking to other Sims on the phone, or meeting them in person.


You can quickly and easily raise your Sim's Energy by drinking espresso. You don't actually need to sleep if you use this constantly!
When interacting with other Sims, ""Be Funny"" will usually raise the bar to the maximum.
You can purchase Cupcakes for LP that will make your Sims inspired, or you can buy a Cocktail at the Nightclub for Simoleons.;
, Buy a stove, and sell some baked goodies. Start off by baking cookies or pancakes and when you've made your baking skill really high, you can bake chocolate cake! It takes a lot of time and patience to earn a lot of money this way, but it can still be worth it and it also earns you lifestyle points.

, After the dog digs up Lifestyle Points, praise him so he knows that he will get praised if he digs up Lifestyle Points. This will mean more rewards for you later. You can also buy the bone for 2LP for your dog. It will get you Simoleons and LPs faster.


The more expensive your cat or dog is, the faster it will gather Simoleons and LP.
If your dog doesn't have the dig/pounce sign on it, get a toddler to play with it or an adult to praise it. Do this twice and it should run or slowly walk away. Usually this will lead it to find something, and repeating the process can get you even more stuff.

, When your Sims go to work, they earn money, which they keep. Also, when you go to work regularly, you get promoted, which will earn more Simoleons and XP after a work day.


Working regularly will help you achieve a large number of the goals in the game as well.

, When they are completed, you will earn more money depending on what you grew. Overnight, while you're asleep, have your Sims gardening (all the ones who aren't at work or busy). If you garden 7 or 8 hour crops at night, you'll wake up to lots of Simoleons and XP. Make sure they are inspired because they'll earn 1.5X the Simoleons.


Try planting bell pepper seeds, as bell pepper seeds are free and it only takes 30 seconds for them to grow and be ready to sell! After they are ready you can sell them for a few Simoleons.
You can dedicate one lot in your town to gardening. Place at least one garden on the lot per Sim in your town. Get all or most of your Sims inspired at once, and take them all to the lot to garden.

, Buy the Community Center at the top left of your town map. Do hobbies like fashion designing, ghost hunting, and figure skating. All of these are the hobbies that will get you rewards and one big reward when you complete their collections.

, Earn some extra Lifestyle Points or XP by competing at the Competition Center (added with the Supernatural update). You can compete between all the active hobbies: ballet, karate or ghost hunting. You can choose a specific Sim that's going to compete for the next 12 hours. You need to level up your skills to win a higher place, which in turn leads to bigger rewards.

, If you are in the middle of baking something that takes a long time, and you need money fast, getting two ovens will help. Don't buy the expensive ones if you are not too rich though, because it doesn't let you bake any faster.

, When you go for a drive, it can earn you money and lifestyle points. Quickly tapping on the music notes will earn you bonus money. Sometimes you'll even be lucky enough to get LP.

, If you don't let the Sims go to the bathroom, they will wet their pants. Cleaning it up will earn you points. Similarly, if you shake your device, your Sims will get sick and throw up. If you clean up the vomit, you can earn points. Doing this too often might make your device freeze up, so use it sparingly.

, Be smart about what you buy. Don't waste your money on anything you won't use. Like in real life, this habit is key to a successful budget.


Save items you can reuse. Put a cradle in the inventory once a baby's born. Other couples can use it and it saves money so you don't have to buy a new one.
Be ready for a rainy day. Save up your LP because some of your tasks require them. Once you complete the task, you'll get some back. You don't want to be stuck because you spent all your LP on something you didn't really need!
Be careful of spending real money. Don't waste your real money for Simoleons and LPs. You can earn plenty if you're patient, and spending real money on this can become a habit.

, Go to the purple trolley and press ""Free"" on the top left. It will bring up short programs or videos and if you watch them, you will earn one LP. These won't earn you much, but the videos change regularly, giving you a constant stream of LP.

, The Sims FreePlay Facebook page will often have special offers and giveaways. If you Like the Facebook page, you will be updated every time there is a new event. You can earn Simoleans, LP, and a variety of other items this way.

, If you click on your stove, you can select cooking or baking. If you select cooking, you can start this hobby and cook food for your sims. It is like a regular hobby, but you will get a plate of food for your sims to eat.

Make sure that you have the right appliances (3 star stove, 2 star toaster,ect,) for the food you are trying to cook, or else you won't be able to cook it.
Each food item costs Simoleons and takes time. The longer it takes to make the food item, the more Simoleons it will probably take to cook that item.
Some food items have a chance to catch your stove on fire when you're finished making them. Be careful when making these items.

Level up.,
Complete the goals.,
Increase your land value.",How to Get More Money and LP on the Sims Freeplay2," If you raise your Sims FreePlay level, you will gain more lifestyle points and money.

Also, when you level up you can build houses, businesses and workplaces, all of which increases your land value and earns you more money.

Create your family.,
Move your new family into a random house or create one.,
If your house doesn't have one, get a fireplace from build mode and place it in the house.,
Ask a Sim to light a fire.,
Put one wooden chair next to the fireplace and ask one Sim to sit on it.,

Get a pool big enough for all your Sims to swim in.,Disable free will.,
Before letting your Sims swim, buy multiple treadmills and other exercise equipment.,Fast forward until your Sim's energy bar is dangerously low (not fully low, but close).,
When your energy bar is low, let your Sims in the pool and let them  swim to random spots in the pool.,Wait until they eventually pass out in the pool, since their energy bar is low, and die.,Create an actual family with a decent name, last name, look, and personality,
Move them in to the house where you just killed off a family.,
Delete all the objects in the house.,
Set up for the haunting.,
Wait for the ghosts to show up.",How to Have a Haunted House in the Sims 1," Create one or choose one from the family bucket. In creating your family, you don't have to be serious; you can name them whatever you want.
, If you're using a family from the bucket, still buy a cheap house. This will be a big help.,

Make sure your fireplace is easy to get to. Don't put it behind tables or objects, as sims in The Sims 1 don't know how to get to places when there are objects in the way.

, Only adult Sims can do this.

Click the fireplace and select ""light a fire"".

,

Make the chair accessible, too, and as close to the fireplace as possible.
Make sure you have a wooden chair, or else it won't work.

, The reason you would want to do this one by one is so the chairs are accessible to all Sims.,

This is why your chairs should be wooden. Wooden objects ignite the fire faster. If any object is too close to a fireplace, a fire will surely start, but wooden objects cause fires faster.
Go to settings and turn off free will for a while. This will help a lot.
If one or more of your Sims stand up and a fire hasn't started yet (or if a fire has started) then let them sit down again. Disabling free will helps kill them off faster, as they won't disobey you.

,

If this doesn't work, wait for about 4-5 fires and let them roam around for a bit, but close  to the fire. Then have one Sim try to extinguish the fire. Don't let any other Sim help.
Only adult Sims can extinguish fires.
While the Sim is extinguishing the fire, the fire should trap him/her and kill that Sim.
If you have a child Sim, keep them close to the Sim that's extinguishing the fire. They all should die.

, In this method, it is required.,, They should all die of hunger,

Go to build mode
Click on the water tool
Start building a pool

,, Buy multiple playgrounds for your child Sims.

Why multiple? Sims can't interact with the same object and do the same interaction twice (like talking to a person twice)

,,

Even when it says ""Go here"" with a pair of shoes as an icon, your Sim will swim there.

,,,

If you used the fire method in killing off the family, you might want to make them hire a maid to sweep up all the burn marks

, Give the house a brand new look., Never make your family mourn for the dead sims. If your dead Sims are in the form of urns, place the urns in a bedroom. If they are tombstones, do not put water in front of the tombstones and the house. Ghosts can't cross water., Ghosts don't always appear, but sometimes at 11:00-daybreak they show up. They can scare a Sim to death (literally) if the scared Sim's needs are very low, and that's fine.

If ghosts do that to all your current family members, move in a new family and have lots of ghosts haunt the place.

""Earn"" through your hobbies.",How to Get Far on the Sims Freeplay," You can either start a new game or continue an old game. For iOS users, continuing an old game will continue a game that was previously saved on your Game Center account.;
, This makes them walk faster.

, You actually get more money and XP for the sims completing actions in their own house.

, When you play TSF, you unlock more items and quests through leveling up. For beginners, a quest is where Sims complete certain actions for special unlockables and even limited time prizes! You have to complete quests for marriage, babies, toddlers, preteens, teenagers, adults (when aging teenagers) and seniors.


When you level up, you also get LP. LP speeds up actions. 1 LP is worth 1 hour, so if you have 12 LP you can speed up a 12-hour action, but LP cannot speed up part of an action (e.g. you can't use 1 LP on an action with 12 hours left for it to only have 11 hours. You must wait until it needs only 1 LP for the action to be completed.) And leveling up also allows you to buy more buildings with Simoleons- Simoleons are the currency.

, Items can be rated up to 3 stars, and the more stars and item has the more it costs, but the less time an action takes. And when it comes to buying houses, the more expensive the house is the better items there are in them (e.g. the Two-Story Mansion comes with mostly 2 and 3 star items while the One-Bedroom Home comes with mostly 1-star).

,


Here are a few actions to get a decent amount of XP with no requirements:

Hibernate (time depends on bed)
On Hold to Tech Support (time depends on phone)
Hot bath (time depends on bathtub)


Here are a few actions with requirements:

Roast beef (Cooking quest completed, 3 star stove, level 6 cooking 24 hours)
Tacos (Cooking quest completed, 1 star chopping board 12 hours)



, Be Nice, Be Rude, Be Romantic).

, You can change relationship paths (e.g. change from Friends to Budding Romance) by choosing another action. The Sims will interact for a designated amount of time, and their relationship will change. If you chose Be Nice, the Sims will be strangers, acquaintances, friends, good friends, and best friends. Each relationship milestone will give you more XP, and sometimes unlock new interactions.


A Sim can have relationships with every Sim in town, but you won't earn XP by changing their relationship path. Sometimes you need to have certain relationships to finish a quest, like having two Sims be partners for the marriage quest, and having two Sims be married for the babies/toddler/preteen/teenager quests.

, The bigger the relationship milestone, the more XP you will receive, especially in marriage.

, Each Sim can have a hobby, and multiple Sims can have the same hobby. There are different hobbies depending on a Sim's age. Each hobby level gives you a new prize. Sometimes XP, sometimes an item is unlocked, sometimes LP, sometimes Simoleons, sometimes town value.


Adult: Cooking, diving, fashion designing
Teenager: Music writing, cooking, diving
Preteen: Ballet, karate, diving
Toddler: Shell collecting, Play house (at the pool)
Baby: Xylophone playing

, Each hobby level unlocks different prizes. The prizes are not actual won items, they are just something that the Sim ""wins"" after they have completed an action in their hobby. For example, after cooking a meal, an adult Sim ""wins"" a cooking tool. Sometimes you win new tools, sometimes you win tools you already have. There are a certain amount of prizes that you can win in a row.


If you collect all of the prizes in one row, you win an actual prize. Sometimes it's XP, sometimes it's LP, sometimes it's a new item, sometimes it's Simoleons, sometimes it's town value. Once you collect all of the prizes in all of the rows, you win an exclusive item.
Sometimes hobbies have a limited time prize- like the Salsa Dancing adult hobby had a limited time prize and usually when you unlock a new hobby with a quest there is a limited time item that you could win. If you don't get the item, then you can't buy it later either- it's limited.

In the Sims original, you can find the tutorial very easily. When you first go on the game there should be a house with a large arrow pointing on it. This is the house of Bob Newbie, and his life is mostly a literal tutorial. Play on this house and you will go on a step by step tutorial.
In the Sims 2, the tutorial is available on the starting screen. If you open the 'options' menu then you should be able to find an option called 'tutorial'. Click on this and you will find some friendly descendants of Bob Newbie who's life is a living tutorial.
In the Sims 3, immediately when you start playing there is a step by step tutorial on everything you need to know, and there is also a help option in the 'options' menu which gives you everything you need to know. This is also true for the Sims 4.

, Even before you purchase the game, there is an abundance of guides, youtube videos and blogs on the subject, if you really want to be a pro before you start the game. There are also many wikiHow articles on the subject, such as this one.

, Creating your Sim family is very time consuming so if you want to quickly get a family, move into an existing household by clicking on your desired house on the map and pressing 'play'. Don't build your own house at first, it is very time consuming and you need more experience with building.


If you want to create a new family, for your first time, create as little amount of Sims as possible, without only creating one Sim, because having only one Sim is very dull. At the start, its best to have two or three adult Sims. That way you get more money coming in from jobs and you don't have to worry about getting the children to school until later, when you are more experienced.
In the Sims original, it is best to create Sims with personalities that are easy to manage. Bump up their Neatness, and Outgoing points are a plus as well. You very much want an Active Sim. You don't need to worry too much about the Playful and Nice points, but make sure that your remaining points go mostly towards the Nice section. Cancer is a good star sign to pick, as is Aries, Aquarius, and Scorpio, but you can choose to customise the personality points.
In the Sims 2, the star signs are still there so you follow along the same lines as the Sims 1, concentrating on the Neat, Active and Outgoing sections the most and the Playful section the least. For your lifetime wish, the Family and Knowledge wishes are the easiest to achieve, and the Romance wish is the hardest to achieve (and your Sim will have a strong aversion to commitment).
In the Sims 3, the star signs are scrapped to make room for traits. Try to choose good traits like Good, Friendly and Lucky. The skill traits like Handyman, Green Thumb and Neat are extremely helpful and Workaholic and Ambitious (especially Workaholic) is a must for a super successful career. Your lifetime wish depends on which traits you use, so be sure to look for specific combinations if you want specific lifetime wishes. The same goes for the Sims 4.

, In the beginning, don't go into advanced editor until you are more experienced because this makes everything more complicated. In the Sims 1 there is a separate program for this that you definitely should not use until you are more knowledgeable. Instead, use pre-made hairstyles, outfits and faces.


You can even choose a whole pre-made Sim or a random Sim if you want.

, Some people like to keep free will on, but this can be annoying when your Sims are travelling around the house doing exactly what you don't want them to do. In 'options' you can also turn on features to enhance your gaming experience and turn off options that make your computer slow. This makes the game easier to play.

, You need the money to succeed in the Sims. In every game, jobs can be found by going on the computer or reading a newspaper. In the Sims 3 and 4 you can even go to a workplace to have any job you want.


You will need certain skills to succeed in jobs. Make sure your Sim has items bought from the build and buy section that can increase skills, such as an exercise machine, a chess board or a piano. In later versions of the game you will also need a good relationship with your boss and co-workers, but Sims in the Sims 1 and 2 don't need to worry about this because they don't have a boss or co-workers.
Live frugally. At the start, you will not have much money, so don't buy furniture that you don't need. Delete second bathrooms and buy the second-cheapest sorts of furniture, wallpaper, doors and windows.

, In every version of the game, there are cheats that you can use by pressing ctrl+shift+c and opening a cheat box. Entering specific words in the cheat box and pressing 'enter' can make you rich, change your personality, kill your Sims and a whole host of other things. Learn how to cheat in the Sims 1, 2, 3 or 4, depending on what game you have.

, Eventually, as you become more and more experienced, you will become a real pro and learn how to do way more things on the game.

Learn the look of Ghost from the software title.,
Learn about Ghost's Charisma.",How to Look Like Ghost from Modern Warfare 2," As the picture states, Ghost has one scary skull mask! You can buy them online at reasonable prices, but you can make your own.


Find a hat with the print of a skull on it.
Cut the hat in half, so you just have a little snood, but with a skull mouth.
Put on a balaclava (With a big gap for your eyes).
Slide the skull mouth snood over your head, and rest it on your mouth area.
To complete the look, get a pair of sunglasses and put them on, but tuck the ends into your balaclava.
For the rest of the outfit, wear a black long-sleeved t-shirt and some black trousers, like Ghost wore in the MW2 mission ""The only easy Day... was Yesterday"".
Another option is a short-sleeved t-shirt with jeans like Ghost wore in the missions ""Takedown"" and ""The Hornet's Nest"".;
, If you have ever played MW2, you will hear Ghost chip in at certain points and make funny, and often rude remarks about the mission, enemies and others. If you have ever played Multiplayer as Task Force 141, (TF 141) you will hear Ghost at the beginning of the game say, ""Let's do this."" This became his trademark. If you want to copy him, just sound gruff and say a funny thing at a time. Try to say his lines as well. For example, if you are going shopping on Christmas Eve, before you step into the mall, that is packed, say, ""Let's do this!""

Locate a Necromorph and assess the type it is.,
Stay at a safe distance.,
Dismember them!,
Aim for any glowing yellow masses or areas on the Necromorph's body.,
Use the terrain available.",How to Kill Necromorphs in Dead Space," There are numerous different types of Necromorphs and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Take the time to note what type it is and although generally the steps below will work on most Necromorphs, you may find it easy dealing with each one based on its weaknesses. Types of Necromorphs are provided in the tips section below. The most common type is a slasher.;
, Necromorphs are much easier to kill when you don't give them the chance to swarm you and possible attach themselves to you. Get close enough to effectively kill them, but far enough away to make sure you are not rushed. Some of them fire projectiles. Do not engage in hand-to-hand combat with them. They have blades as arms for a reason.

, The whole game system on Dead Space is based around dismembering your opponents with the variety of weapons you are given. Whether it's a chainsaw or plasma cutter, you need to aim for the limbs to reduce the risk of the Necromorph harming you and to deal extra damage rather than just shooting its body. The head and legs are excellent places to aim for. The head is what they see with, so that can really help out. Shooting the legs slows them down.

, These are usually highly vulnerable and will come in handy to aim at when versing various Necromorph bosses such as the Leviathan, Slug Boss and Hive Mind. The yellow sacs are highly explosive.

, When gravity panels, open engines or rotating blades are available, make use of them. They'll kill most Necromorphs out right and in some cases, give you a nice achievement, too. You won't even have to waste ammunition - just lead your folly into the hazard and watch the fireworks. Just don't kill yourself.

Select game servers closer to you.,
Close any network-hogging programs on your computer.,
Check if there are any other devices on your network taking bandwidth.,
Connect your computer or game console to your router via Ethernet.,
Reset your network hardware.,
Check for malware on your computer.,
Enable QoS on your router (if possible).,
Upgrade your router if you haven't in a while.,
Check for available internet upgrades.,
Consider using a VPN service.",How to Reduce Game Lag1," Many games have the option to either browse through available servers or set your matchmaking region. Selecting a location close to you is the absolute most effective way to decrease your ping.


The process for this will vary wildly depending on the game you are playing. Look for location filters in your server browser, locations in the server name or description (US-West, EU, etc.), or region settings in the matchmaking menu.
Not all multiplayer games allow you to select a region, and may automatically try to connect you to the closest server or player to you.;
, Before playing your online game, make sure any bandwidth-chugging programs are closed. Torrents, streaming music, and open browsers can all have a big impact on your in-game lag. Close these programs before starting your game. Look in the System Tray for programs that may be running in the background., If someone is streaming video in the other room, you'll likely take a big hit to your ping. Try to time your gaming to when others aren't using the network, or ask politely if they can do something else for a while.

, If your computer or video game console is connected to your network wirelessly, you may experience worse performance in-game. If your network setup allows it, try to run an Ethernet cable from your computer's Ethernet port to an open LAN port on your router.


You may need to select the wired connection if you are already connected wirelessly.

, If you're noticing worse lag than usual, resetting your network hardware may solve the problem. This will disable your network for a short while, so close your game first and make sure you're not interrupting anyone else:


Remove the power cable from your modem and from your router, if you have a separate one.
Let your network hardware rest unplugged for about 30 seconds.
Plug your modem back in and wait for it to boot up. This could take a minute or two.
Plug your router back in after the modem finishes turning on, if you have one. The router may take an additional minute or two to turn back on.

, If you have a virus or adware infection, background processes may be eating up a lot of your bandwidth and processing power. Make sure your antivirus program is up to date, and run scans with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and AdwCleaner (both free) to find and remove most common infections. See Remove Malware for more detailed instructions.

, If you have a router that supports QoS (Quality of Service) controls, you can use them to prioritize gaming traffic on your network. The process for activating these controls vary depending on your router, and not all routers have this feature.


Most QoS default settings will prioritize gaming and web browsing over other traffic. You may need to look up specific settings for your router.
See Access a Router for instructions on accessing your router's configuration page. The QoS settings, if they are available, can usually be found in the ""Traffic"" section.

, If you're connected wirelessly and you haven't upgraded your router in a few years, you may be able to get a much more stable connection with a new router. See Choose a Wireless Router for some tips on finding the right router. Look for routers with QoS controls, which can help prioritize gaming traffic on your network., This is a bit of an extreme step, but you may be able to find a good deal on a major speed upgrade. If you haven't checked prices in a while, you may find that you're paying the same amount as a faster package.

, Sometimes, your ISP may route your traffic through a variety of servers before it reaches its destination. This can lead to bad ping, even if you are physically close to the server. If this is the case, a VPN may help reduce your ping as there will be less hops between you and the gaming server.


A VPN cannot make you magically closer to the server. If you're trying to connect to a server overseas, you still have to contend with the speed of light and a VPN won't make much of a difference.
In many cases, a VPN will actually increase your ping, as it's another hop your traffic needs to go through. VPNs are only really useful if your ISP throttles your gaming traffic or routes it in an unusual way.
See Connect to a VPN for instructions on finding and connecting to a VPN service.

Make sure no other programs are running while you're playing.,

Run a version optimized for your hardware or drivers.,
Disable integrated graphics card settings.,
Search online for mods that increase performance.,
Read discussion forums.,
Perform virus and malware scans.",How to Reduce Game Lag2," If you have programs like iTunes or a torrent program running in the background, they could be eating up precious system resources.


Check your system tray for programs that may be running in the background.
Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc to open the task manager and view any programs that are currently running.

, Your graphics card drivers are the software that controls your graphics card and allows it to interface with games. Running outdated drivers can have a big impact on your performance, as drivers are often tweaked in later releases for specific games. Try to make sure you're always running the latest version of your drivers. You can download the latest drivers from the Nvidia, AMD, or Intel website (depending on who manufactured your graphics adapter). See Update Your Video Card Drivers on Windows 7 for detailed instructions.

, The best way to get a big performance boost from your games is by lowering the graphical settings. This may make the game look a little worse, but can lead to massive gains in frames per second (FPS), which will provide a much smoother experience. Look for some of the following settings in your game's Graphic Options menu for a big impact:Resolution - Games will look best when they're running at your monitor's native resolution, but you can make a big FPS improvement by dropping the resolution down. The game will look blockier, but should instantly feel smoother. Changing your resolution can give you one of the biggest performance boosts you can get. For example, switching from 1920×1080 to 1600×900 will often give you about a 20% boost in FPS.
Anti-aliasing (AA) - This is the technique that smooths out the pixelated edges on objects, making edges look more natural. There are lots of different AA options (MSAA, FSAA, etc.), but for now you just need to know that most of them have a big performance cost. Try turning AA off completely and see how your game plays. If you're getting super-smooth performance and want to try some AA, try FXAA if available first, as this is the cheapest AA solution. Also, stick to 2X or 4X solutions.
Texture Quality - If you're getting intermittent stuttering while playing (as opposed to a low frame rate), you may want to lower your texture quality. This is especially important when playing newer video games with older video cards.
Shadow Quality - Detailed shadows can take a whole lot of processing power, so try dropping your shadow quality to get a major performance boost.
V-Sync - This locks the vertical sync to your monitor’s refresh rate which may force the game to run at a lower frame rate. You can disable this setting for a potential speed boost, however it may introduce screen tearing.

, A game may come with an alternative version of the game that is optimized for 32-bit or 64-bit CPU processors or may come with a version that is optimized for your graphics driver such as DirectX 11 or above. Run the different executables and note which one provides better performance.


There are two major graphics card manufacturers on the market, Nvidia and AMD. You may run into a game that was designed around one particular graphics card. The developer may provide a patch that resolves issues with a graphics card brand that is known to cause performance issues. Check discussion forums and developer websites for more information.

, Certain computer configurations such as laptops that feature both an integrated graphics card and a high-end graphics card may cause programs to run on the integrated graphics card that features lower specifications.


Nvidia graphics card drivers come with the Nvidia Control Panel software that allows you to change programs from using the Integrated Graphics card to your dedicated Nvidia graphics card. To open the Control panel, right click on an empty space on your desktop and click on “NVIDIA Control Panel.” On the left hand side click on “Manage 3D Settings.” In the main window pane click on the “Global Settings” tab and set the drop down labeled “Preferred graphics processor” to “High-performance NVIDIA processor” then close the window. This will change the graphics card settings for all programs.Check under the game’s settings to see which video card is being used as the primary display driver. If you have more than one video card installed, changing this setting to your video card that features high performance may resolve the issue.
You can set your BIOS to disable the integrated graphics card. Check with your computer’s user manual or manufacturer’s website for more details on how to disable the integrated graphics card.

, You may run across a game that is not optimized for your hardware or is known to have poor performance. Search online for unofficial mods or enhancements that provide higher performance. Read reviews and discussion forums before downloading to ensure how to properly install the mod.

, Social hubs such as a developer or publisher’s game discussion hubs, gaming websites, and game download services such as Steam or GOG provide an outlet for those who face issues with a particular game they are running. Asking for help while providing your system specifications can help you identify issues that you may be facing. There are also other discussion threads to look out for when browsing forums.


Developers may post about known issues, server maintenance, workarounds and compatibility issues with configurations of your hardware, the operating system, or conflicts with other programs.
Other users may be facing the same issue as you and can sometimes provide a similar solution.

Consider overclocking your hardware.,
Try a PC optimizer program.,
Consider upgrading your hardware.",How to Reduce Game Lag3," If you have the right hardware, you may be able to squeeze more power out of it by increasing the clock speed and voltage. This is referred to as ""overclocking,"" and is not without risk. Increasing the voltage too much can fry your equipment, but if you can get more power out of your hardware you can see significant performance boosts. Heavy overclocking will require more advanced cooling techniques. Not all hardware can be overclocked.See Overclock a Graphics Card for instructions on overclocking your video card.
See Overclock a CPU for instructions on overclocking your CPU.

, There are several programs available that are designed to boost performance while playing games. These optimizers will suspend non-essential background processes, defrag your game folders, and perform other optimizations. Your mileage may vary with these, especially if you've already taken the time to close background programs and regularly maintain your hard drive. Popular boosting programs include:Razer Cortex
Game Gain

, If you haven't upgraded your computer in a while, a few upgrades can go a long way towards increasing game performance.:


RAM - Most games released these days require 4 GB of RAM at minimum, with 8 GB being recommended in most cases. RAM is pretty cheap, and installing it is easier than you may think. See Install RAM for instructions.
Video Card - One of the best ways to improve your video games' performance is by upgrading your video card. These can get a little expensive, but even a mid-range card can provide a significant performance boost if you haven't upgraded in a while. See Install a Graphics Card for instructions.
CPU - Your CPU is less important to gaming than it used to be, but if you're running a really old computer you may want to upgrade to a quad-core processor. Upgrading your CPU is usually the most complex task when it comes to computer upgrades, because it usually necessitates a new motherboard (and RAM), which will also require reinstalling Windows. See Install a New Processor for instructions.

Decide if you're going to do a new game or alternate mode run (ie.,
Start off with the shortest possible path, and work off from there.,
Skip as much as possible.,
Go through all the weapons, moves, combos, etc.,
Look for speed-enhancing tricks that allow the character to travel faster by rolling, jumping, side-strafing, flying, running faster, etc.,
Look in particular for glitches.,
Look for every trick you can find.,
Practice.,
When you've gotten a good enough time, or are doing a good enough run, record it and put it on-line at http://www.speedrun.com/.",How to Speed Run a Video Game," with unlockable items, characters, etc.) And if there are already runs done of the game, look at those to find the tricks used.;
, Are there any items that need to be collected? Which ones are closest to the path, etc.

, This includes enemies, items, areas, cutscenes, etc. Often it takes some tricks to skip items or enemies, we'll get to that later.

, to find the absolute most effective ones. Often some weapons or moves have characteristics that can be used for particular places to make that part faster. Get to know the characteristics or peculiarities of each particular move or weapon.

, Jumping, flying, bomb-jumping, etc. are particularly good for glitching out of an area and through or over a barrier, which can save tremendous amounts of time.

, Glitches can often let the player skip substantial portions of the game. And when one glitch has been found, look for all the places that it could be applied throughout the game.

, Think counter-traditionally. Look for all the things that other people wouldn't consider. Remember, the idea may not make sense at first, but it's a video game, so it could still work. And often one trick can be applied in many places in the game.

, There's no substitute for it. A lot of the best speed runners play a game over a thousand times. Don't reset a run just because you lost a lot of time if it's still possible to finish the run using the route you're using. Even if you lost so much time that it's too late to get a PB, finishing the run still gives you the practice as well as speeding up your learning which parts you should practice during special practice sessions that are not part of a run.

, Many people will like to see your speed run.

Read the community rules for the game you are playing.,
Many games implement a system in which you can get reported by other players.,
Ignore insults and do not lash out.,
Respect other players.,
Avoid making sexual or perverted jokes in public chats, as these can get you banned.

,
Do not use bots.,
Do not make racist or sexist remarks.,
Follow the rules of the game.,
Do not use your account to advertise a product or service in the game.",How to Prevent Yourself from Getting Banned from Online Games," If they forbid swearing then do not swear. Learn and know these rules so you can keep out of trouble.;
, Understand the players, if they disagree with what you are doing and it happens to be against the game's rules, you could have a ban on the way.

, If you do, you risk giving the other player grounds to ban you. Instead, report them if they are being really offensive.

, The word n00b is considered offensive by some people (which actually means ""newbie,"" so it would be better to say that instead of noob)

,, You can also get banned for using bots, automated programs that play the game for you. If you do not cheat by using bots, you will not get banned because of them. Most online games have ways to check for or fight back against bots now anyway.

, These are considered offensive in most online communities.

, This seems simple but is often overlooked.

, This is considered spamming and can get you banned. You will get banned even faster if you post links involving sexual content.

Keep your distance.,
Know where to aim for.,
Melee them.,
Use stasis.,
Fight them off.",How to Kill a Slasher Necromorph on Dead Space," Although Slashers are reasonably easy to kill on their own, they usually travel in groups of two or more, so keeping your distance is key. Select a medium to long-range weapon such as the plasma cutter to increase your chance of killing the Slasher before it reaches you. They will overwhelm you in numbers.;
, Remember, shooting the Slasher's body is useless, so you need to aim for their limbs. The most effective combination to take them down is to aim for their legs initially as they are a large target. If this doesn't kill them, it will drop them to the ground, where you can then aim for either their arms or head if you are a good aim or curb stomp them. Use melee only as a last resort,

, Slashers are reasonably easy to fight off with the melee, especially if you're only facing one. They will usually take about 3-6 hits to kill. Because of their larger size, they are one of the only Necromorphs you can melee effectively, so if you are trying to unlock the Brawler achievement, then take advantage of them.

, Especially if you are using the legs/arms combo, then using stasis on a Slasher will give you the time you need to implement this. This is particularly effective when you are facing a large group of Necromorphs or Slashers and you need to lower their numbers. If you can, use the stasis cheat.

, If they manage to hook onto you and bite into your neck, then press A repeatedly to push them off. Unlike other Necromorphs, this will not kill them, so you will still need to finish them off, either with a melee or shot. If you can push them off into a Gravity Panel, the it will also help you get your Ragdoll Check achievement.

Master the easy levels first.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Repeat a calming mantra.,
Release rage through physical activity.",How to Stay Calm While Losing a Video Game1," It may seem silly to not skip over the easy stuff, but sometimes you pick up a valuable skill or trick on a lower level. Many times in video games, the easier levels are used to teach you a new function of the game play. This can be a new way to access secret parts of the game or even a new super power. Skipping over the lower levels via a game cheat code can mean you miss out on valuable insight.Taking a break from a harder level you are getting frustrated with to play an easier level also gives your brain a break. The anger many people get from video games isn’t usually linked with the game content but instead the frustration.
A lower level can also help you to find what made video games fun in the first place. While playing the lower level, focus on the music or graphics.;
, There are several different ways to use your breathing to relax and also take a break from the focus on screen time. Take a stimulating breath by breathing in and out quickly through your nose with your mouth relaxed but closed. Do three sets in about a second and then rest with normal breathing. You can do this for up to 15 seconds to give yourself a quick rejuvenating boost of oxygen.
You can also try the 4-7-8 exercise. This starts with breathing out completely through your mouth, and then closing your mouth to breathe in through your nose four a mental count of 4 seconds. Now hold it in for 7 seconds and finally breathe out for 8 seconds. Repeat these steps for a set of 4 reps.

, A mantra helps to refocus your brain on a more positive point than your anger or frustration. This can give your body and mind a much-needed break when the game gets tough.One example of a calming mantra may go as follows: while visualizing a swinging door, say out loud, “Thoughts and feelings come in and out like people. Be the door not the doorman.”
Another example may include: with your eyes closed repeat, “imagine with each breath you are melting into an ocean of light and space.”

, Step away and focus on using your muscles instead of your mind that’s been so focused on the game. Physical activity also releases endorphins that boost your mood.Taking a walk outside will give you access to fresh air, allow you to use more of your senses and also give your eyes a rest.
For some people really working out hard and sweating has a cleansing feeling and can also be a boost since it releases chemicals to your brain that change your mood for the better.

Take frequent breaks.,
Relax in your bed for a while.,
Get better at the game you're playing by practicing whenever you have the chance.

,
Listen to some angry metal or any other music if you're feeling aggressive.,
Take a few deep breaths and continue playing the video game.

,
Perform some self control techniques by sitting down at a chair, relaxing all your muscles, and taking deep breaths.,
If you can't relax at all, than take your stress out on a pillow.,
Go for a walk.,=== Alternate Method ===

,
Play a casual or sandbox game, like Tetris or Grand Theft Auto.,
Avoid the section of the game that you cannot beat.,
Avoid playing the game for a while.",How to Relieve Stress from Playing a Video Game," It is easy to get burned out.;
, Think of happy things. (It may sound dumb, but really try to think of relaxing things that make you happy.)

,, Listen to some peaceful music if you're calm.

,, You should do this for about three to five minutes.

, It makes sure you don't break the game.

, Exercise can take away stress. You should do this for about 5-10 minutes.

,, Getting a high score and blowing up cars are great ways to relieve stress.

, If you aren't good against other players, play the single player campaign. If you can't beat a boss, complete any available side quests instead.

, Watch TV or lie down and relax instead.

Prepare your mouse.,
Find something that needs doing on your computer.,
Race around the desktop nabbing icons with your mouse.,
Feel peppy.,
Focus on the rest of your day.",How to Race Your Mouse Around the Icons,"


Give your mouse a good clean. If you don't know how yet, read wikiHow's article on how to clean a mouse.

Clean the mousepad too while you're at it.
Check your mouse cursor. Still happy with it? Or is this a good opportunity for an upgrade to something a little funkier?;
, Use this as a good opportunity to do some application or program updating that you've been putting off because you can't stand just staring at the screen while it happens. Get it rolling.


Really slow-to-load web pages are also a good choice. Try any webpage aimed at providing you with answers about why your taxation refund hasn't arrived still.
Note, it needs to be something that allows you to a) see your desktop; and b) still move your mouse. If this isn't possible, lose the program sprucing and just start mousing.

, If you're not sure that going around in circles, or squares, or whatever shape you're tracing over your icons with the mouse cursor is fulfilling enough for you, try to smarten up the experience with a few added hurdles:


Try following patterns, such as skipping some icons but not others. Or try to trace out the shapes of animals, food, favorite computer symbols using the icons positioned as they are.
Use mathematical formulas to work out which icons to touch and not touch on.
Randomly click on an unused icon now and then. Once it opens, have the mouse chase around anything of interest on the opened item, then click close again and return to desktop mousing.
Alternatively, take a penalty for every accidentally opened icon or drop-down box.
Think up any other amusing ways to prolong your procrastination.

, Apparently that is a standard requirement following chasing your icons.Peppy means ""full of energy, high spirits, and lively"". Possibly you might need some other boost to help you reach this state. Some suggestions include:



Healthy snacks at the desk
Slightly less but definitely delicious chocolate snack stash at the desk

Caffeine - coffee, chocolate, tea, whatever way you like it most.

, You can always resume chasing the icons around with your mouse whenever the desire takes you.

Call a friend to vent.,
Take a nap.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Fast from the game for a while.",How to Stay Calm While Losing a Video Game2," This is a good time to analyze the problem at hand. Talking to a friend about how frustrated or annoyed you are may even lead to him or her giving you a suggestion as how to win that part of the game.Something as simple as hearing from your best friend that he or she didn’t like that part of the game or found it nearly impossible helps to tell you it’s not your fault.

, Your frustration—and poor performance—may be mounting from lack of sleep. If you’ve been at it for hours, try getting some rest. Your reaction times and critical thinking skills will benefit.


Prolonged video game play has been linked to several conditions that are tough physically on the body like obesity and heart disease. It may even be keeping you up at night; so catching up on your sleep is a good break from the game., Sometimes when you focus too long on the game you may forget to eat and your blood sugar runs low. A piece of fruit, some nuts, or a granola bar may give you the nourishment and energy you need to power through a new session.


As mentioned above, video games can also negatively impact your health so healthy eating combined with sleep will help.

, You may be at the point where you are so frustrated by the game that you are not able to concentrate, taking a break will help to fix this. When you take a break try to focus on things you feel you are good at and have nothing to do with this game. Give yourself a boost to get your confidence back. Tell yourself you won’t play for a full day, and stick to it.

Know that it’s a learning process.,
Watch online tutorials for practical tips.,
Celebrate every small improvement in performance.,
Don’t give up.",How to Stay Calm While Losing a Video Game3," Accept the fact that you are improving and there will always be a learning curve. Stop beating yourself up over your idea of failure so much that you ignore the learning process. Give yourself the time to learn the game and recognize the growth process.Make trial and error a fun part of learning instead of something you dread. If you approach it more like a science experiment, it becomes fun to try something to see what happens. You may find some of your biggest discoveries start out as a failure.

, There are several sites including YouTube that are great resources for tips and hacks. Online communities are also a great way to see other people like yourself who are out there struggling and beating the very same game you are struggling with. It can be done and you will figure it out., If you normally would blow up or get really angry at the thought of not winning, even the fact that you are able to control that impulse is a win.


Tracking your performance in a journal can help you to see the progress and may even show you patterns that you need to beat the game. Write down each trial and error, you never know which move will be the winning one.

, The only sure fire way you will lose the game is to give up. Instead of focusing on “never” winning a certain level, learn to tell yourself you haven’t won the level “yet”. Simply changing your view of the challenge and future success will change the way you look at the progress you have made."

Get help when you're stuck.",How to Play Video Games," Playing video games no longer requires a dedicated console or a souped-up gaming computer. There are an increasing number of quality games available for your laptop, old computer, smartphone, or tablet. Get a taste for these first before you shell out hundreds of dollars for a console or computer upgrades. Once you've decided to explore new territory, keep the following in mind:


For the largest number of available games, get a desktop computer running the latest operating system, and install a good video card.
For a cheap, easy to set up option, purchase a console. Choose a latest-generation console (PS4, Wii U, or Xbox One) to play new games, or an old one (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 or even earlier) for a large selection of cheap, used classics.
Choose a handheld gaming system for a specific game you can't get on your phone.;
, Game rating systems vary between each country, but an explanation should be available on the packaging or online description. Games rated M for mature or for an age range 17 or higher typically contain extreme violence or disturbing scenes.

, If you are using a console, you should be able to play any game for that console. Computer gamers need to find out their computer specifications and check them against the requirements on the game packaging or website. There are typically two sets of requirements listed:


""Required"" lists the bare minimum. If you fall short of any of these requirements, don't purchase the game. If you barely meet these requirements, the game will probably be slow and/or look much worse than trailers and screenshots show.
""Recommended"" requirements should let you play the game with shorter loading times, no lag or visual glitches, and better graphics settings.

, Games are a huge business, and the actual gameplay sometimes fails to live up to marketing hype. Find at least one review before you purchase an expensive game, preferably a video one so you can watch the gameplay first hand.

, If you have gamer friends, you'll probably hear about new games whether you like it or not. Other sources of information include gaming blogs and magazines, which you can find with a quick online search, or browsing the vast collection of computer games on Steam, the free game store.

, Don't feel obligated to play the first game in a series. The sequels often have improved gameplay and graphics, and often don't even follow the previous story directly., If you don't consider yourself a gamer, there are certain genres that you may not enjoy. First-person shooters, fighting games, ""battle arenas"" like League of Legends, and to a lesser extent sports games tend to be fiercely competitive. These are often extremely difficult for a new player to learn.


If you have your heart set on learning one of these genres, pick one with a single-player mode that lets you learn on your own, such as Halo.
Some specific games in different genres fall into this category as well. The Starcraft and Dark Souls series are not recommended for inexperienced gamers.

, If you're uncertain about a game, look for a free demo version. If this isn't available, consider renting the game from the Gamefly website, or from a brick-and-mortar store.

, If you've never got into a video game before, you might want to try a few free ones first to see what you enjoy. A quick search online or in an app store for ""free games"" will give you thousands of results, but here are a few suggestions you should be able to find in an online search:


Puzzle games are easy to find in mobile app stores or online flash game sites. If you've had your fill of classics like Tetris and Minesweeper, try Loops of Zen, 3D Logic, Lightbot, and many more.Most free action games on mobile or online aren't great introductions to their more ""gamer""-oriented counterparts. If you have a decent computer, Path of Exile is a more expansive introduction.If you like strategy, try Hearthstone (collectible card game), Plants vs Zombies (tower defense), or Battle for Wesnoth (turn-based strategy). All three are available for both computer and mobile platforms, and most versions are free., Some of the biggest casual ""coffee break"" puzzle games include Candy Crush and 2048. Take it to three dimensions and add a quirky story to discover the acclaimed Portal and Portal 2. If nothing but the most cerebral and fiendishly difficult will do, play Braid.

, This is a broad and popular genre. If you like fighting and platforming (leaping and climbing around), look no further. The atmosphere and setting of these games ranges from horror (The Last of Us) to family-friendly (Legend of Zelda) to historical (Assassin's Creed). If you like testing your reflexes but don't really care about story or immersive experiences, try a competitive first-person shooter (such as Call of Duty) or a family-friendly platformer (such as Super Mario Galaxy).


If you'd rather mess around or have fun with friends than explore and follow a story, try Super Smash Brothers (family friendly) or Grand Theft Auto (the opposite of family friendly).

, Enjoy sprawling fantasy settings? Play Dragon Age or Skyrim for a pseudo-medieval experience, or one of the more recent Final Fantasy games for the Japanese take. Bioshock 2 or Bioshock: Infinite are more unsettling examples set in utopias gone wrong.

, Build an empire with turn-based strategy in Civilization V or Civilization: Beyond Earth. Test your reflexes with fast-paced ""real-time strategy"" games such as the challenging multi-player game Starcraft II. Try any Total War game to test your single-player tactical skills or play the role of famous historical figures.

, If you don't care about graphics, there are few games more appealing than Minecraft when it comes to building a world. Maybe controlling a house and family in The Sims 2 is more up your alley, or perhaps you'd prefer a more detailed world and atmosphere in Sunless Sea.

, World of Warcraft popularized this genre, in which you play online with thousands of other players. WoW is still around alongside Star Wars: The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, and many, many others. Most of these are partially free to play, but find out what the full version's payment system is like before you get involved. These games are infamously addictive, and once you're hooked you might find yourself spending a great deal of money on monthly subscription payments or in-game purchases.

, Most games have tutorials that will walk you through the game play. If you prefer to learn on your own, read the instruction manual, or look for the ""documentation"" section on the main menu or website.

, This is recommended for adventure and horror games especially.Besides a greater feeling of immersion, this will cut down on glare interfering with your ability to see the screen.

, Games don't have to be about suffering or pushing yourself to the limit. If you're playing a video game to unwind, set it to Easy difficulty. The harder difficulty levels are often intended to be difficult challenges for people who have played similar games for years.


If the game has both single-player and multi-player options, the single-player portion is almost always easier.

, You can ignore this step until it's an issue, but if you find yourself hitting the wrong button or straining your fingers, visit the menu options. There's almost always an option to change the controls to whichever key you find easiest.


A laptop trackpad makes it extremely difficult to play some games. An actual mouse is a big improvement.
If you like the feel of a console controller, these are available to plug in to your computer as well, if you have the right adapter. Not all games support this, however.

, Most games have an auto-save feature that will save your progress regularly. If it also has the option to save manually, do so often.There's nothing worse than losing hours of progress because your system crashes or the power goes out.


If you have the option to use multiple save slots, create three or four and rotate between them. This lets you load an old save to explore a different story branch, or recover your game even if a bug screws up your most recent save.

, One of the most appealing features of video games compared to other art forms is the ability to insert hidden content that you have to actively search for and discover. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of your games:


In platformers, role-playing games, or even racing games, try to move through or attack walls that look out of place with their surroundings.
In strategy games and action/adventure games, try new tactics even if they don't seem great. The later parts of the game (or harder competition) often require the ability to recognize when an unusual weapon or strategy has a chance to shine.
In games where you can talk to ""NPCs"" (non-player characters), use every dialogue option and read closely for hints.

, Unless your only goal is bragging rights, why spend hours losing to the same fight or stuck on the same puzzle? Search for the game name and the word ""walkthrough"" online, and you'll find strategy advice or answers for every part of the game. If you prefer to solve it mostly on your own, ask friends or gaming forums for hints and advice. Hints and advice can make the game easier!


If it's not possible to follow the walkthrough advice (such as talking to a dead character), or if you are following the instructions but nothing is happening, it could be a bug. Search online for a description of your situation and you might find other players who can help you fix it.

, Although this is a more serious method, it is very possible in the majority of shoot 'em ups to memorize the level and where the bullets will go. This method, of course, relies on your ability to remember possibly highly complex designs.

, ""Curtain fire"" shoot 'em ups have swarms and swarms of bullets on them, which can be made into intricate patterns by the game developers. Sometimes, living is as simple as weaving between the bullets in a consistent and repetitive manner.

, If you get too frustrated with a game, you're more likely to make errors. This will undeniably lead to deaths in-game, which will ultimately result in an earlier game over. Taking breaks when you get annoyed is definitely a must if you plan on playing this style of game.

, Sometimes, game developers assign the world's most annoying controls to their games. In some games, it is possible for you to adjust it to more fit your style of playing. Don't let this addition go to waste, utilize it.

, In most shoot 'em ups, you are granted a certain amount of ""bombs"", which generally do a huge amount of damage to all enemies on screen, or even eliminate all the bullets currently on the screen. Don't use them when there aren't many enemies, that's a waste and you'll regret it when you're in a pinch.

, Due to your positioning when in a corner, you're more likely to get trapped. After all, it only allows you to have 50% of the directional movement you would normally have.

, Like most games, you must always practice if you hope to truly become better. Without sharpening, any tool would grow dull. In this case, your fingers are the tools. Don't let them grow slower in the time it takes them to react and dodge bullets. Even if it appears as if your practice is in vane, you're slowly developing muscle memory, which will make you perform better.

, If they have a strategy for a level you can't beat, utilize it.

, Although this may seem tempting, cheating will make you seem like less of a gamer to other players, and you'll never get any better if you are playing with cheats.

, Sometimes, it is too hard for you to beat a level on the difficulty you're on. No problem, just go down in difficulty for now. You can come back and beat it later, when you are better at the game.

, Eventually, you'll be good enough to clear the entire game on an easier difficulty. That's great! Now, move onto something harder. Raise the difficulty to the equivalent to ""hard"" if you're on what this game calls ""normal"", and to the equivalent of ""normal"" if you're playing on what would be called ""easy"" on another game.

, Winning the game is what you've worked for. If you quit before you've beaten it on the hardest difficulty, you've not truly beaten the game.

Consider a game engine.,
Use frameworks and other tools.,
Try an IDE.,
Learn a programming language.,
Create a plan for the game.,
Gather your art assets.,
Script your game.,
Create individual levels.,
Test your game.,
Take the next step.",How to Program a Video Game," Few game developers reinvent the wheel and write their own game engine from scratch, especially for their first game. If you want to dive right in, but still have plenty of opportunities for programming, using a game engine is a good option. An engine typically includes higher-level tools for altering 3D models, scripting events, and other common game applications, but will still provide plenty of hands-on programming opportunities.


Popular programming-heavy examples include Unity, UDK, Unreal Engine 4, and CryENGINE.;
, A framework is a step below a game engine, but still provides a set of tools and APIs (application program interfaces) to save you time and streamline your coding projects. Consider this the minimum level of software to use for your first gaming project, and even then you should feel comfortable introducing yourself as a programmer, or have a deep interest in the behind-the-scenes work on game engines. Depending on the exact framework and/or game engine you are using, you may want to do some of the work in additional, specialized APIs, such as the popular OpenGL for creating 3D graphics.


Polycode, Turbulenz, and MonoGame are example of frameworks created with both 2D and 3D games in mind., An Integrated Development Environment is a general-purpose compiler and collection of source files that makes complex programming projects easier to build.An IDE will make programming a game much more convenient, especially if it comes with built-in ways to interact with graphics and audio systems.


Visual Studio and Eclipse are two examples, but there are many others. Look for an IDE based around a language you are familiar with.

, Most of the tools above are based in a popular programming language, so following the accompanying tutorials will give you a great start. While you can create a game in almost any sufficiently powerful programming language, the most common languages are C++ or C# for all devices, Flash ActionScript or HTML5 for browsers, and Java or Objective C for mobile devices. These are good options if you are aiming to eventually get hired by an existing game studio, but plenty of independent games are created using Python, Ruby, or JavaScript.

, Flesh out the concept of the game as much as you can before you begin, including the genre, mood, and type of gameplay. If you start programming before the concept is clear, you'll likely have to tear apart and rewrite a significant amount of work. This will probably happen anyway, but a solid plan will keep these events to a minimum.


All but the most experimental games have a progress arc, so this is a good place to start the planning. Progress typically happens through one or more of the following: discovering more about the plot and characters, making decisions that affect the storyline, gaining new abilities or higher stats, exploring new areas, or solving harder and harder puzzles.

, Collect or create all the textures, sprites, sounds, and models you will need for your game. There are quite a few collections of free game assets, so do some searching. If you are making a 2D game and don't have an artist to help out, you could create your own pixel art.

, The script tells the engine what to do and when to do it. If you used an open source engine, chances are that it already has a scripting language, and probably tutorials that will teach you how to use it. If you build your own engine then you will have to create your own scripting language. Either way, you'll need these major components at minimum:

A constantly running game loop that checks for user input, processes the result, processes other events, calculates what needs to be displayed, and sends this to the graphics card. This should run at least 30 times per second.
""Active listener"" scripts that check for events and respond when they occur. For example, one script can watch for a player interacting with a door, then run the ""open"" animation and make the doorway non-collidable. Another script can watch for a weapon hitbox contacting the door, and run the ""blow apart"" animation instead.

, Level design — which may involve a literal ""level 1,"" an area the player can explore, or the next round of a fighting game — will test some skills unrelated to programming. Start with a simple level showcasing typical gameplay, following this basic guideline for genres that involve traveling through environments:


Create the basic outline of the area.
Decide on the basic path the player will most often take through the area. Add challenges and benefits (items) along this path. Space them close together for adrenaline and excitement, or farther apart for a more relaxed atmosphere.
Start adding graphical elements. Place light sources along the main path to encourage players to follow it, and keep the side paths or less important areas dim.
Match the gameplay, style, and setting. For example, a suspenseful horror game thrives on stretches of empty exploration punctuated by surprise attacks. A never-ending barrage of enemies overwhelms the player with adrenaline instead, while combat that requires careful tactical planning can distract the player from the emotional atmosphere.

, Now you get to see what all your hard work has turned into. Test each level while you are polishing it, and many times after it is ""finished."" Make a conscious attempt to play the game in ways you didn't intend, such as playing through more difficult areas first. Better yet, find playtesters to get fresh eyes on the game, and ask for as much feedback as possible.


Watch someone play without giving them advice, unless it's basic tutorial information that hasn't been added to the game yet. Frustrating mistakes and points where the player gets ""stuck"" are signs that you need to include more guidance.
Once the game (or at least a level) is fairly complete, try to find strangers or acquaintances to help playtest. Friends tend to be more optimistic, which is great for providing encouragement but not as helpful for predicting how players will react.

, If you finish the project, you may want to release it for free or put it up for sale, but make sure you read the terms and conditions for any game engines or software you used. Whether or not you complete the game as you envisioned it, you may want to ""cannibalize"" some assets and ideas for a different or more ambitious project, or take the lessons you learned and start all over again!

Win.",How to Play Games Well," Understanding games is more important than a fast trigger finger. All games, if properly designed, should follow a set of ""rules"", which define how the game should be played. Get in the mind of the game and the developers who designed it. These rules are often unwritten, but invaluable to the way you play. For example, a tactical FPS (first person shooter) will often require that you do not stand in the open if you want to succeed. And in an FPS, learn where to aim in the body with each weapon. Often, you'll find that you must aim for the head. But shotguns are more effective in the chest, in most games. Rocket launchers should be aimed at the feet.;
, If you panic in any game, you'll either die, send your army or teammates to their deaths or you'll find that you are useless to your teammates. A good way to learn skills like not panicking and about the ""rules"" of a game, is to play the old classic, Tetris. If you panic in Tetris, you fail. If you learn rules such as ""do not create gaps"", ""do not create 'channels'"" and ""early on in the game, go for four lines at a time"".

,


In first person shooters, do not use the arrow keys! They look temptingly simple, but the best keys to use are WASD (W forwards, A left, S backpedal, D right).,Occasionally ESDF or ESCF are used instead for more room. This is because with the arrow keys, there are no other buttons nearby to use. Imagine the scene. You're playing an FPS, and you need to jump. There is no nearby suitable ""jump"" button. Or if you need to reload, where is the reload button? You would have to take your hand off the movement keys, which is bad in a firefight. Don't forget Ctrl and Shift, as these keys are easily pressed by your pinky finger, excellent for functions you are likely to use when you are moving e.g a crouch button or sprint button. Jumping is good with the spacebar.
In a strategy game, your buttons will often be laid out logically enough already. Example, in most strategy games, to build a Barracks, you tap the B key.

, This is key to forming strategies and learning where you are likely to get attacked from.

, Even if you don't know the people you are playing with, it is still good to type basic information like ""Enemy incoming"" or ""Guard this area"". But when you are playing with your team or with your friends, you really should learn how to communicate efficiently. Using TeamSpeak, Xfire voice or Skype is necessary. You will notice that in most games, the player without the voice chat is the one who dies first. The different voice clients all have advantages and disadvantages. Xfire of course lets you type into the conversation in-game as well, so posting a strategy that people can check at any time is easy with xfire. TS creates the least lag for the players.


If you cannot use voice, learn to type quickly and use any in-game auto-sayings quickly. When typing messages, do not be a fool and use the global chat! Use TEAM chat! Global chat is for chatting, swearing when you die and congratulating the enemy on a fantastic shot. In strategy games, discuss strategy. Call for help. Use Beacons. Co-ordinate attacks.

, Practice your skills. Practice strategies, use different armies and units, try new guns, practice activating your moves quickly. Become fast at what you do.

, Do not downright break them, but bend them to give yourself the advantage. For example, you know not to stand out of cover? What if you found a ridiculous piece of cover which no one would think of checking? You've tried the big guns? What about taking down an entire army with a knife? For example, me and my friends like to, when we run into enemies in a corridor, throw ourselves to the ground and shoot the ankles. unorthodox, but it catches them off-guard. Do not break the rules of a strategy game. The outcome of a battle is never determined by some crazy plan involving using one unit to dispatch an army.

, This is not necessary, but it is so much more fun in a game to have a play style. Are you the sniper who'll kill the enemy no matter what range? Will you send a rush early on, not to win, but to mock the enemy? Are you the maniac with a crowbar? Enjoy the game, play with style!

, Another step you don't have to do. Some players enjoy games more if they belong to a team.

, Winning games is great and the effort to reach and get. Do whatever it takes. But if you lose don't get angry.Try harder the next time. Retry or see what is the thing keeping you from winning; once you understand the boundary, you might surpass it..

You'll see several sites listed that allow you to download old games.


By checking the page description (or ""snippet"") under each search result, you should be able to determine which sites offer free downloads. Several of the results will mention the availability of game downloads.
It's not a bad idea to also perform a search like ""best sites for abandonware"" to help make an informed decision. You'll find some sites and forums that recommend specific abandonware sites and/or assess the safety of their downloads.;
, Depending on the sites, games may be organized differently. But you should be able to browse through categories or search for a specific game if you already have one in mind.

, What shows up next will depend on the site you're using. You're generally likely to find some information about the game and potentially other user reviews. Sometimes the download button can be difficult to locate amid the clutter, but you should be able to find it amid the clutter.

, Some sites will also give you the option to skip downloading and simply play the game in your browser. Downloading the game, however, will allow you to play it when you're offline. Beware of ads. Some advertisements are designed to look like download buttons. The design of the button will likely look different from the site, and there should be a button on the ad that allows you to close it.


There may be different versions of the game available for download, but you should be able to play either one.

, You should be able to find it in your Downloads folder. Games often come zipped, so you may have to unzip them manually if your system doesn't do so automatically. Programs like WinRAR may be helpful for this.


You may have to adjust your system's preferences to allow installation of applications from unidentified developers.

In this case, game emulators allow PCs, notebooks or mobile devices to operate games that were designed for other systems (such as consoles). Performing a search for ""game emulator"" should take you in the right direction, but you can also visit a comprehensive site like .


While emulators themselves are legal, you should consult this article's warning section regarding the legality of downloading games themselves (for use with an emulator or otherwise).

, This decision will likely come down to which system you're looking to emulate. Make sure to read, review and compare emulators before making a final decision. Better yet, download several emulators for the same console. Some emulators may be better at mimicking certain mappers, graphic engines and sounds than others.While an emulator usually emulates one system, some multi-system emulators also exist.
By example, some of the more popular console emulators include Zsnes, Nesticle, Visual Boy Advance, MAME, Gameboid, SNESoid, N64oid and many more. Be sure to check the emulator's compatibility with your operating system.
If you're planning to play games on a mobile device, you should consider its processing power (or lack thereof) and select an emulator accordingly., Initially, this is generally as simple as locating and clicking the ""download"" or ""start download"" but that appears once you've selected and clicked on your emulator of choice. The file should appear in your Downloads folder.


Note that you may have to unzip the file manually if it doesn't happen automatically.
You may also find an .exe file that extracts and installs itself once it's been double-clicked.

, Perform a search for ""ROM games for emulator."" ROM game files are generally based on read-only memory chips from video game cartridges, firmware or an arcade game's main board. Several sites will appear with snippets indicating that ROMs are available for download. Pick one, perhaps after conducting some additional research into the best sites for ROMs.


The ROM games may be organized by their original gaming system, making it easier to find one for the emulator you selected.

, This process is much like downloading the abandonware games and pretty straightforward.

, To open the emulator, expand its menu, click File and then click Open. Once the emulator has started, select the game from the file folder in which it's been stored. Double-click the game, and it should begin loading within the emulator.

Know which guard has which key.,
Don't use crafting notes.",How to Escape in the Game Escapists," Prison is all about routines. By attending them, you keep the guards off your back. If you don't attend one, for example breakfast, then your guard heat will raise in most prisons; it goes up to 70-99% but be careful if you get your heat 90% or over, as then you have to hide because the snipers in the guard towers will snipe!


For example: Say that you are digging underground and you don't know that roll-call is next; then you're screwed and your plan is gone and every contraband item you had!;
, It's important to know where everything is. You need to know the prison well, such as where the cafeteria is or where you can access the roof and so on.


For example: Let's say that you're running late to exercise period and you don't know where it is, then chances are you're going to waste time looking for it and not make it in time!

, Intellect is an important part of your escape because during your escape, you're going to need to craft things and you need intellect for this. Thus, remember always keep it as high as possible.

, In the picture here, you can see that that fence looks not like the normal black one which most likely means it's electrical. Now you're most likely wondering ""But wait, if it's electrical, then how do we get past it?"" Every prison has power generator and you're going to have to go to that power generator and click it to turn off the power making the fence okay to cut. However, you will need a good cutting tool, such as cutters because that power generator will go back on in 1 hour (game time) and 1 hour in the game is 60 seconds (real life time) so you have 60 seconds to cut threw that fence and not die.


About the cutters: There are three levels in every tool, so by every tool this means shovel, cutters, and pickaxes and the three levels are flimsy, lightweight and sturdy. Flimsy is the worst, lightweight is of medium effect and sturdy has the best effect.

, Before you start the game, there is a secret pattern to tell which guard has which key.


First Guard: Cell Key (Yellow)
Second Guard: Utility Key (Orange)
Third Guard: Entrance Key (Purple)
Fourth Guard: Staff Key (Red)
Fifth Guard: Work Key (Green) and the others have no key.


So as you see in the picture above, the fourth guard has been renamed to ""Officer staff key"" to know he has the staff key.







, First of all, it takes forever to find them and they are contraband. Second, there is an easier way of doing it. Let's say that you don't know how to make a bed dummy––just go on your favourite internet browser and type in ""how to make a bed dummy in the escapists"" and at least five results should appear, all telling you how to make it. Or, simply look at the pictures on here."

Decide on a main character.,
Spend money wisely.,
Upgrade your bag size as often as possible.",How to Expand Your Bag Space in Elder Scrolls Online1," This is extremely important, because in the Elder Scrolls Online bag space is directly linked to each character. Not only that, but bag upgrades can get expensive quickly so you don’t want to spend money on upgrading characters that you won’t play in the end. Choose a character and try to focus all of your resources into upgrading his or her bag space. It takes a while, and costs a lot of money to go from 60 bag slots to 240, the maximum number.;
, It may sound obvious, but the Elder Scrolls Online offers numerous money-sinks, and it’s important to spend your money on improving your bag space at first. The first bag space upgrade can be done in the Marketplace of each starting city, and the cost is quite low. However, the cost quickly goes up, and even veteran characters have problems affording bag space upgrades after a while.

, Since bag upgrade costs go up quickly, it’s important to start saving money. You should upgrade the capacity of your bag whenever you have the chance, because this is the main priority for your starting character. The cost of the upgrade pales in comparison to how much money you can lose if you don’t have space to pick up everything."

Purchase a mount as soon as possible.,
Log in each day to upgrade your mount.,
Create another character, and get a second mount.",How to Expand Your Bag Space in Elder Scrolls Online2," After personal inventory space upgrades get expensive, there is nothing left to do except get a mount. The mount is not only used to reduce travel time, it is also used to increase your storage space! Each mount storage space upgrade will increase your total storage space by one. This may not sound like much, but it will add up in time.

, A single mount upgrade can be performed each day, and there are other things to upgrade, not only its bag space! This is why it’s extremely important to log on daily and upgrade the storage space at first, because it takes around 60 days to reach the maximum level of storage, without upgrading anything else. Even though each upgrade costs 250 gold, it’s still cheaper than personal inventory upgrades after a while.

, As weird as this sounds, after a certain point in the game it’s easier, and cheaper, to make another character and purchase a second mount for him or her. Pick a class that you may want to play after a while, and log on each day on this character as well, to upgrade the mount. This will provide you with a lot of extra bag spaces that you can use if you keep the second character next to your stash, and simply move items into his or her inventory."

This offers space for 60 items, and can be upgraded just like your regular storage space. However, after joining a guild, you will also get access to the guild’s storage bank, which offers 500 inventory spaces!


Warning: keep in mind that all guild members can use the guild storage bank, so you will not get to use all the inventory spaces provided, or you may discover that some of your items disappear.

, After all, that’s why you joined the guild! Making friends in the guild will also have a direct impact on your inventory space. However, first get to know players in the guild, and make some friends that you get to trust in the game. You’ll be able to use the mail system to its full value once you do, and decrease the number of items stored in your inventory.

, You can send mails to other players in the game, and the mails are saved for 30 days, along with the items attached. This means that you can use mails to empty most of your inventory while you’re out questing. Simply mail items you don’t need at the time to a friend, and then ask him to send it back when you’re in town or when you need them. Warning: only do this with friends or persons you know well! There’s no way of forcing them to give the items back, so you don’t want to send items to someone who may not want to send them back."

There is a bug in the console which allows automatic gameplay.,
After the test mode is left or automatic gameplay is abandoned, you can continue using the console as usual.

","How to Enter Test Mode in ""My Friends Tigger and Pooh"" Handheld Game"," While the console is off, press and hold the ""left arrow"", ""right arrow"" and ""Sound"" buttons simultaneously. While still holding them, press and release the ""Power"" button. Then release other buttons. All segments on the display of your console will come on. Your console is in the test mode now;;
, Press the ""Start"" button five times. After the first pressing, the display will go out, the four other pressings will reveal different display patterns composed from segments. Press ""left arrow"" to hear the sound ""choose"". Press ""right arrow"" to hear ""cuckoo"". Press ""Power"" to hear ""one"". Press ""Sound"" to hear ""two"". Press ""Start"" to hear ""three"". Press ""Select"" to hear ""four"". Press ""round"" button to hear ""five"". Press ""square"" button to hear ""cancel"". Press any other button to exit the test mode and turn off the console. Any other button outside this sequence will make the console emit a beep and do nothing;

, Repeat step 1 to enter test mode. Press ""Select"" and the console will start ringing with all segments still on. Press ""Select"" again and the console will stop ringing and start playing all sound samples stored in its mask ROM in sequence with all segments still on. You'll be amazed how many sounds are stored in the ROM of such a cheap device! After that, the console will leave the test mode and turn off automatically;

, To use this bug, start game 1, then place the ladder into the middle of the playfield, then place Pooh on the top of the ladder and automatic gameplay will begin. Bees are unable to reach the middle of playfield and bite Pooh, so you can now just relax and watch the score and play speed grow without pressing the buttons (they will increase not very fast since when the ladder is not moved, the middle beehive will drop honey not as often). The console, however, turns itself off automatically if buttons are not pressed for four minutes. Therefore you have to pause and unpause the game every three minutes. If you wish, you can build a circuit that pauses and then rapidly un-pauses the game every three minutes by imitating pressing the ""Start"" button with a reed relay to make the gameplay completely automatic. Why not design such a circuit yourself? Also note that score and pot counters are overflow protected. The score counter stops counting after reaching 990, while the pot counter stops counting after reaching 99. Then the game continues at maximum speed infinitely.

Determine if you are addicted to an MMORPG.,
Recognize your addiction.,
Tell your MMORPG friends that you are quitting, whether for a certain time period, or permanently.,
Start your long journey to recovery.,
Avoid triggering your addiction again.",How to Overcome an MMORPG Addiction," If you can control the amount of hours that you play, then you are probably not addicted. Some typical symptoms include the following:


Continuously thinking about a MMORPG
Missing work, school, or a social activity to devote time to a MMORPG
Playing a MMORPG for an excessive duration in one sitting (more than 5 hours)
Spending real money on in-game items (This in and of itself is not a sign. It's OK to spend money if you have money. If you should be buying food and you are buying in game items instead, you might have an issue)
Psychological distress attributed to lack of game play (feeling upset/angry if you can't play)
Loss of sleep due to excessive gaming
Putting more time into the game than important things like schoolwork, friends, family etc.
Other major lifestyle change that results in playing the MMORPG more often;
, Even if it is just a game, it is still an addiction that is affecting your lifestyle. In recognizing the problem, you become aware that it needs to be fixed.

, They may give you the emotional support that you need to recover. If you can't bear parting from your e-friends, keep contact with them via e-mail or chat.

, Depending on how addicted you are, and how much time you have to beat your addiction, you have several methods of approach.




Decrease your overall time playing. What seems to be the most common is to slowly lower your playing time until it is down to a reasonable amount. However, this may not work for people who are unable to control their addiction.
Force yourself to quit playing. Quit playing the game for a few months, and then your addiction will soon dissipate, provided that you don't slip back to the game.

Uninstall the MMORPG. If you cannot trust yourself to keep away from loading the game another time, then your best bet is to remove the program from your computer completely. In conjunction with this, delete your highest level characters or the characters most important to you before deleting the software and, in certain games, canceling your subscription.
Keep the installation CD out of reach. You might lock them away in a drawer, or give them to your parents, sibling, or trusted friend. If you are very determined, you might even destroy, or sell the CD even donating to charity/charity shops works.

Find new hobbies. Look for another hobby like reading or riding a bicycle. It is best if you find something that will keep you away from the computer, in effort to keep your mind off of the MMORPG.



, After your addiction is beaten, keep it at bay. If you're sure that the addiction won't come back, whatever you do don't try the MMORPG again,it is too risky. Also, don't look for starting another MMORPG. You'll only end up funneling your addiction from the first MMORPG to the next.

Try cutting down on the amount of time you spend on your PC (XBOX, PS3 etc).,
Replace your gaming time-slots with physical sports.,
Get support from friends and family.,
Make your gaming device impossible to reach.,
Find something else to do, such as scheduling activities with friends, finding a job (temporary or permanent), playing sports.

,
Wait at least 30 days before playing again.,
When you get your device back, try your best not to play for a week while you have it.",How to Overcome a Gaming Addiction," You might find yourself playing a particular game most of the day or most of the week. You won't bother to find a job and you'll rely on your parents to give you money. You might be very anti-social and missing out on social outings etc. Is your addiction really an addiction? Monitor how long your gaming periods are, and how often you play it.;
, Try going out with friends more often, try putting away your games in a safe place for a while. A common cause of addiction is knowing that the thing you're addicted to is within easy grasp.

, Suggestions include: boxing, basketball, or baseball. Do anything to get your mind and body active.

, Without motivation and encouragement, you could find yourself back on your PC or gaming console.

, Give it to your parents, lend it to a friend. Or, if you're going on a long vacation, don't take it with you.

, You know he’s feverishly trying to get to the maximum level, achieve the maximum score, or whatever it is that’ll help him beat the game. And while determination is a desirable quality, too much of it can be harmful. Forbidding him to play online games won’t work; what you need to do is encourage him to play different kinds of online games. If he’s into action games, buy or rent RPG games. If he’s crazy about simulation, trying out a few strategy games will be a healthy change. Anything that challenges his thinking and playing skills is fair game.

, Many times, kids get bored and play video games because they think there’s nothing else to do. But you certainly know better, so help him learn about the hundreds of fun, creative and productive activities he could do if only he would get off the computer! Allow him to pick something he enjoys – cooking, sports, crafts, reading, bowling – the list is endless.

Part of the controversy is that there is no biological component to video game addiction, unlike most substance addictions. Therefore the parallel most often used is to compulsive gamblers.

, Diagnosing an addiction is beyond the scope of this article, but there are some common sense guidelines you can follow:


Playing the game for more than 4 to 5 hours a day.
Becoming irritable or withdrawn without access to the game.
A steady increase in use over a period of time, addicts need more and more of their “substance” to feed cravings.
Lying to friends and family to conceal gaming
Falling asleep in school because of missed sleep due to the game
Not keeping up with assignments.
Worsening grades.
Dropping out of other social groups (clubs or sports).
Irritable when not playing a video game or on the computer.

,
Sleep disturbances

, Whether you believe he is addicted or just enjoys gaming his game use is clearly bothering you. The first step is to sit down with him and tell him how you feel. If you don't really think he is addicted tell him how his playing makes you feel neglected, or however it makes you feel. If you do think he is addicted, tell him why you think so.

, Perhaps you can play together for a while, and then do something you would prefer to do. Perhaps there are different games you can try that you would enjoy more than online role playing.

, This is the required level that your guild must be to create an emblem.

, The size of a small emblem is 32x32 pixels, with 24-bit depth, and saved in .bmp (bitmap) file format.


Most players used pre-made ones that can be found over their Internet, especially to already-existing games such as Ragnarok Online, as they have the very same emblem size and format.
For your emblem to have a transparent background, color the part you want to have transparent with pink (use RGB 255 for red and blue while green is 0).

, Nearly every day, the Guild Hall summons certain Eidolons without the need of Eidolon Energy.


Anyone can kill the Eidolon for drops, whether in party or solo. You get to pick up Eidolon keys, which is used to create a Summoning Key for you to own your very own Eidolons.

, In the guild, you can assign ranks to any members, which gives them the authority to either recruit, expel, and add new announcements in Guild Affairs. Basically, officers are the guild leader's trusted members who will take care of the group while the leader is away."

The Village Chiefs' quest level 2 is a bit more challenging than the first level, containing 18 quests, altogether.,
If you are stuck on level 3, read this.<<


The Village Chiefs' quest level 3 is highly challenging.",How to Conquer the Village Chiefs' Quest Levels 1 to 3 in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite,";
,,


The Village Chiefs' quest level one are the most easiest quests. It only has 5 quests, but the fourth one contains a Tigrex wandering around. It's best to move to another area number and dodge the Tigrex's moves. After completing all 5 quests, the village chief will ask you to complete an urgent quest. The urgent quest needs a Giadrome to be hunted down, in the snowy mountains area. Then after hunting it, you can initiate level 2 quests from the village chief.

, The first three are gathering quests in the snowy mountains, the jungle and the desert. They are quests that can let you explore around within 50 minutes, collecting as much goodies as you can. As you progress along, you end up encountering harder and larger enemies in level 2 such as a Yian Kut-Ku, a Congalala, a Bulldrome and a Cephadrome. Armor with great defense and high attack weapons would help when encountering one of the monsters. Make sure some of your weapons have an elemental attribute (example: water, fire, ice, etc.) that is strong against one of those monsters. It's okay to have a regular weapon as well. Once you finish all quests in the level 2 section, the village chief will ask you to do another urgent quests again. The monster will be a Khezu, which is an electric type wyvern that can shoot 3 electrical bolts out of it's mouth, which can paralyze you for quite a while. Watch out when it is angry. You will know when a monster is angry just by watching it snort out ice, fire, or even fart. In some monsters such as a Congalala will make it's nose and it's bottom red when it is angry. Also, monsters will be much faster at attacking and doing actions. When a Khezu is angry, it will emit electrical jumps that can damage you and decrease your health very low that you will almost fall unconscious. When you defeat it, you then start the level 3 quests from the village chief.

, It contains two gathering quests the can let you explore, in the swamps and in the forest and hills. There are even more harder and much stronger enemies such as a Daimyo Hermitaur, a regular and a green Plesioth, another Congalala, a regular and a purple Gypceros, an Iodrome and a Blue Yain Kut-Ku! There are 18 quests altogether, but most are very challenging, but the price reward can get even higher due to the monsters strength, rising in each quest level. The best way in defeating wyverns are by using a bow. It can reach a certain monster by a long distance. There are also unlimited arrows so you never run out unlike bowguns, you need to buy loads of ammo in each quest. But for bows you can just buy coatings (power, poison, paralyze, sleep, paint and close range coatings.), but you don't have to buy them because you have the unlimited arrows. Unless you have an elemental attribute bow, no need to worry. Once you have finished all level 3 quests, the village chief will ask you to do an urgent quest. But this one, is harder. It is a Blangonga, a faster version of a Congalala, but it has white fur, lives in the snowy mountains, and can order it's fellow Blango's, which is a smaller and weaker version of a Blangonga. It's like Blangonga's are the Congalala's brothers, and the Blango's are the Conga's brothers... Moving on, you will need a bow called, Kut-Ku Stave 1, which has an elemental attribute of fire, made from Yian Kut-Ku materials, which you'll need to defeat lots of times. A Blagonga is an ice type, so you get an advantage in defeating it. Always dodge the Blagongas jumps and attacks, as how they are more powerful than you think. Once you have finished hunting the Blagonga, you can initiate level 4 quests, which mostly takes place in the volcanic zone!

To control the game,



Player 1 should aim to have an even number chain count

Player 2 should aim to have an odd number chain count
Play this on any odd (or non-square odd-by-even) board size (such as those found in the Dot Game (3x3, 5x5, 7x7).,
Here Player 1 has managed to create 2 chains, and has forced Player 2 to hand him the smallest chain.

",How to Win at the Dot Game2," For games with an even number of boxes on each side, like 4x4, this rule is reversed).
Exception to this rule - in 3x3, a ""0"" chain count benefits Player 2

,"
"
In order to capitalize on the chain counting principles, you must be able to take every chain that is made.,
If your opponent plays within a loop, leave four boxes and play so that there is a space between two boxes on either side of your last line.,In 3x3, there are 9 boxes - you need 5 to win

,In 5x5, there are 25 boxes - you need 13 to win

,
In 7x7, there are 49 boxes - you need 25 to win


Because you must sacrifice boxes to obtain all the chains in the game, it is sometimes possible for your opponent to make a bunch of boxes.

,
Be careful not to allow the amount of boxes you sacrifice get too high as you might sacrifice too many and lose the game.,
Let's call the person who is going to get all the chains the 'leader' and the other person the 'follower'.,
Turn a chain into a loop.,
Everyone makes mistakes, sometimes you can use this to your advantage.,
Y-Chains are complicated as there is more than one branch that can be considered a chain.,
Y-Loops are similar to Y-Chains but instead of multiple chain branches, Y-Loops have branches that loop.,
If you are the follower, you want as many boxes as possible to make up for losing the chains.",How to Win at the Dot Game3," When your opponent gives you the first chain, take every box except the last two. Sacrifice these two by placing your line at the end of the two boxes, leaving space for a line in between one box and the other. This is known as the Double Cross.

, By sacrificing the last 2 boxes of a chain or the last 4 boxes of a loop, you are guaranteed to obtain every single chain in the game.

,,,, Since you are sacrificing all except the last chain you know that you will be giving your opponent 2 boxes for every ""1"" in the chain count (except for the last chain)


So mathematically: 2 * (chain count - 1) = number of boxes sacrificed

, Since the leader is going to get the chains, the follower will get the last non-chain. In some cases, the follower also gets the first non-chain.


When you are the leader, you wish to avoid having non-chains as this may contribute to your opponent's score and allow them to win. When you are the follower, create as many as these as possible to allow for a closer game.

, Since loops are ""2"" and chains are ""1"", turning a chain into a loop or a loop into a chain causes the count to change by ""1"".


This makes an even number odd, or an odd number even. If you are the follower, try to alter the count by converting a loop into a chain or a chain into a loop. If you are the leader, try to prevent the follower from doing this to you.

, If you are the follower, you can sometimes take the opportunity to give a chain away early.


If your opponent forgets to sacrifice the two boxes at the end, the count will drop by 1 which can sometimes result in victory if your sacrifice did not give away too many boxes. To avoid excessive sacrifices, pick the smallest chains to sacrifice.

, When you get a chain that branches off in multiple directions first look at the splitting point. Count ""1"" for the base and one of the branches, count another ""1"" for each additional branch.


Most Y-Chain will count as ""2"" since there will be one base and branch with one additional branch. It is very important you only consider chains within a Y-Chain. non-Chains can sometimes branch off of a chain but this is not a Y-Chain.
Y-Chains are when a long chain has a small chain branching off of it. Sometimes more than one. Sometimes if there is more than one branch, consider the possibility that the Y-Chain can be broken in the middle making only 2 regular chains. Without considering this possibility you might think the Y-Chain is worth ""3"" since it has 2 branches. But if it is broken in the middle, leaving only 2 chains, then it is worth ""2"".

, This makes counting the final score early troublesome. A loop and a chain suggest a count of ""3"" but depending on where the follower places the line, you might need to sacrifice or you might be able to take it all.


When you encounter a Y-Loop, the loop is always the base and branch which counts as ""2"" followed by the count of the chains that branch off of it.
Similar to the Y-Chain, if there are 2 or more chains branching off of it, there is a possibility of cutting the Y-Loop by sacrificing 1 or 2 boxes within the loop and creating one large chain. This would reduce a Y-Loop with a value of ""4"" to a chain with a value of ""1"" which can drastically change the final score.

, In the even that you are facing a Y-Loop, always sacrifice the branch chain first, then the loop. This way, you get 2 boxes for the chain, and if there are other chains on the board, you might get 4 boxes for the loop if your opponent sacrifices them.

Since the mirror trick makes things even, it favors Player 1.,
3x3's are so small that they tend to change some rules.,
As many may have found out before, the way to change the turn in favor of Player 1 for mirror tricks is to give away the center box so that Player 2 is effectively playing ahead of Player 1, allowing him to copy.,
Don't let Player 1 give you center box.,
If Player 1 insists on playing exactly the same moves as you, then sacrifice non-chains repeatedly.,
Against someone who isn't used to the mirror trick, the mirror trick tends to require almost no skill at all.",How to Win at the Dot Game4," Since player 2 is second to play, Player 1 must find a way to become 'Player 2' in terms of being able to copy moves. Although many people try to create a mirror top-bottom and left-right, most do it wrong by only mirroring either the top-bottom or the left-right. A true mirror reflects top-bottom and left-right at the same time.

, While mirrors will tend to favor Player 1, if Player 1 only plays either vertical or horizontal lines, Player 2 can win a mirror game with Player 1 by creating 3 chains that are all vertical or horizontal. If Player 1 notices that he is being copied, he can create a loop around the center box which will favor Player 1 instead of Player 2.

, While most might think this automatically spells doom for Player 2 if they let it happen, it does not. There are two strategies against this:

, In the event that they seem to be forcing you to take it, make sure there are un-copied lines somewhere else one the board. Also, try to circle around the center block, incorporating it into a waving chain that counts as ""1"" so that if they mirror you the rest of the way, the count will remain odd.

, Since you are already 1 box ahead, if you share all the remaining boxes evenly, you will win. So eventually Player 1 will see that copying you will cause them to lose and they will stop.

, Thus, when you play people with it, you might get some extremely negative responses from people who like to appreciate skillful play.

"
"
In a 3x3 game with exactly 1 non-chain, 1 chain, and 1 loop, then player 1 wins (despite the count being odd).",How to Win at the Dot Game5," I think the reason is because this is such a small situation, so the usual sacrificing tactics simply give away too much. For example, look at a 3x3 board with a chain of 3 boxes at the top, a loop of 4 boxes in the bottom right, and a non-chain of 2 boxes on the bottom left.

Here's an example of what a roleplay post might look like. Player1: Judy felt the hot sun beating down on her neck as she traveled to work. She didn't know what the day would hold, but she really hoped Mister Smith had fixed the air conditioner.

Player Two: Ann pulled into the parking lot in her beat up old blue Honda. She just managed to pull herself out of the car when she seen Judy across the lot, ""Hello Judy!"" She called hoping to get her attention before she entered the building.


Fighting roleplay takes an even different approach. Here's an example. Player1: Steve pivoted on his right foot just barely managing to dodge the arrow that nicked his shoulder. He quickly pulled the trigger of the machine pistol he held in his hand. The bullets shot out of the barrel traveling fast towards the other's chest, if he was unable to dodge this would certainly strike a devastating blow.;
, There are hundreds of ways to roleplay and no one should be able to tell you what you should and shouldn't do. Find your own style and stick with it. Though, this doesn't mean that people have to play with you.

Post style. More experienced RP'ers often enjoy the standard book way of writing with text free and speech in quotes. (He bit, ""Hi."") While others, even professionals, enjoy the use of action marks around actions. (-He bit- Hi)
Post length. The length of one of your posts typically measured in 'lines' or paragraphs. This is often one of the more controversial questions floating around, and you will make and lose partners based on this alone. It ranges anywhere from online which some people frown on all the way to multiple paragraphs.
Post view. First person point of view (I, me, my) and third person point of view (he, she, they, them) are the two most popular. Second person is generally seen as godmodding and frowned upon. An acceptable use of this would be, (When you stepped out of the cave you should be able to smell the poison lingering in the air). Not controlling the character.

, These are the same as story genres. A few examples of them are action/adventure, mystery, crime, drama, romance, slice of life, etc. This will better help you find partners if you know what you're looking for., Some people prefer already having a preset character(s) while others enjoy making them on the spot (hubs) for specific plots and recycle the character when the plot is over. If you don't already have something in mind. Consider the following.

Name of your character.
Age
Gender
Orientation
Occupation
Species. Human or other.
General backstory. While this can be explored in the plot it's a good idea to at least have an idea of who they are, where they're from, etc.

, Roleplaying is a fairly big event and it crosses into multiple mediums. Some people enjoy Facebook making posts/comments and the chat. Some people enjoy more of the actual chat rooms, forums are really big, and some people enjoy apps such as Yahoo, Skype, Discord. You only need to Google roleplay, roleplay chat, roleplay forums, or etc to find a community., Some places will have rules that you and your character must follow. If the chat is for vampires only, then you'll need a vampire character. If the site doesn't allow sexual/romantic play don't go looking for it there. Generally this will only take a bit of poking around and reading the posting rules, but failure to follow these can get you kicked or banned. If you don't like the rules of this medium, find another., While this is the easiest, there are some general terms and phrases you'll see thrown out in the communities often. While you can always ask you'll look more experienced if you already know what some of them are.

RP: Role-play
PC: Player Character. Your and the other real players' characters.
NPC: Non-Playable Character. Not a real player's character. Think of it as Nurse Joy instead of Ash Ketchum. Can be used to further along a story but often not thought of again.
Side character: Similar to a NPC, a side character can be used to further along a plot. While they may be smaller in terms of the grand scheme they are often brought back again or expanded on.
OOC: Out of Character. You speaking instead of the character. You could use parentheses to show this, and is generally good form especially when others are roleplaying in the chat.
IC: In Character. You speaking or acting as the character.
Powerplaying: Trying to control other people's characters.
Godmodding: Changing in-game rules or controlling other characters' actions or reactions.
Mary Sue/Gary Stu: A character with little or no weakness, an overly dramatic or perfect past, and who is excellent at everything. Generally frowned upon.
CS: Character Sheet. A sheet/form that shows basic information about your character for others to look at.
Literate: Different from the actual definition this is used to describe a good roleplayer who shows they are able to demonstrate proper use of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and so forth. A literate role-player knows when long introductions are appropriate, understands the place for short one or two sentence posts and keeps in-character emotions separate from their own.
Semi-Lit: A decent role-player who has an okay grasp of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and so forth. A Semi-Lit role-player typically writes (sometimes excessively) long introductions several paragraphs in length and posts of up to a paragraph and longer.
Illiterate: Different from the actual definition. A bad role-player who disregards all grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc. Their spelling is usually equal to chat-speak (also known as ""l337 spk""). An illiterate role-player typically writes one paragraph for their introduction, and around one or two sentences per post. One-word posts are also frequent.
OC: Original Content/character.
Face claim: A picture/photograph, animated or not, used to depict a character(s).
One-Line: Form of posting length typically varying from one word to one-two full sentence(s)/line(s).
Semi-Para(graph): Form of posting length typically varying from two lines or more. Usually stopping at half of a paragraph.
Para(graph): Form of posting length typically one full paragraph or more.
Multi Para(graph): Form of posting length typically two or more full paragraphs.
Novella: Form of posting length typically when you start to go past the four paragraph range.
Yuri: Term to describe lesbian/girl on girl romantic/sexual scenes.
Yaoi: Term to describe gay/guy on guy romantic/sexual scenes.

, Now that you have a medium, a character, and the general rules of said medium. Go scrolling through active/online user lists, or post an advertisement if the medium allows this. If you do post an advertisement it should contain at least some general information about what you're seeking and who you're seeing for the role. While it doesn't have to contain everything you should avoid posting 'Anyone wanna rp?'.

Example include. ""Hi there! My name's Bob and I'm looking for a futuristic murder mystery type play tonight! My ideal partner is a woman who can write at least 4 lines per post and is willing to work to come up with a plot with me.""
You don't have to have a plot/story in mind to post an advertisement, but make sure to make this clear otherwise people may think you're leading.

, Tell them about your character, ask them about theirs, ask what they have in mind for the story, and tell them what you have in mind. Some people enjoy planning things out, while others just like starting off and winging it. It's a good idea to at least get on the same page about where you're starting though., In many places it's generally considered polite for the person who first contacted to start off (or at least offer) but either one can. The first post should be as good as you can make it. This is showing your partner what you can do. If you are starting the roleplay off, or even if you're not. Your first post should include

Basic information about your characters. Looks, clothing, etc.
Basic information about the scene. Setting, time, weather, etc.
Basic information about what's going on, and what your character is doing.

, If you and your partner connect well continue. Add plot devices, characters, etc. A good roleplay can last anywhere from a couple days to many years with the right partner(s)., Often in RP many people enjoy the skirt rule. 'Long enough to cover the essentials, short enough to keep it interesting.' Your ultimate goal is to keep the RP going, and give your partner something to react to. One or more partner may start getting bored if someone is not contributing to the storyline.

In respect to the skirt rule, you do not need to have a huge block of text if your character is doing something that can be described in two or three sentences; for example, if your character is in a fight, or a quick conversion between forms.

, In literate to semi-literate role-plays, the skirt rule may not apply. Many advanced role-players expect several paragraphs. Discuss it politely with your partner or leave if you can't write that much., Have multiple methods of contact. Discuss it before you begin the role-play.

, High security systems tend to have a lot of traffic, and can have unwanted visitors and/or inhabitants in their wormholes. Look at the color of the wormhole on the inside. If it's red, leave it behind, but if it's a blue-green, then it may be a C1 or C2.

, This is very important! After bookmarking the wormhole, warp to a planet (do not warp to a moon because an inhabitant may have a POS located on it) and drop a bookmark halfway. Warp to the bookmark, launch probes, and cloak; remember to run d-scans as you travel through the system.

, Watch out for ships and POS modules. If you locate a POS, check if it is online or not by turning force fields on on your overview and running a d-scan within range of the tower. There should be no force field and no inhabitants. If there is someone living inside, then quickly hop out and find another hole.

Before running sites or doing anything outside of the bubble, have each member remain online and in the bubble for another 2 hours or so.",How to Set Up a Basic C1 or C2 Wormhole Camp in EVE Online2," For a C1 wormhole, you should use a small tower, and for a C2 a medium, or if you've got loads of extra money, a large faction should do fine, such as minmatar or amarr towers. Have your scout remain in the hole and direct the industrials to a fresh moon and have them cloak when it's not their shift. For equipment, bring the following:


Corporate Hangar Array
Defense batteries (don't bother with e-war batteries unless you know what you're doing with them.)
Ship Assembly Array
Around two sleeper site running ships
Gas ventures and replacements
Scout ships with strong probes for tracking down intruders
Combat ships (t2/faction cruisers with frig support. Try the Deimos, Vigilant, Ashimmu, Curse, Zealot, and Gila.)
Industrials
PI equipment

, Begin onlining the tower and have your scout continue to run sweeps. Fuel it and set a force field password.

,, This is to ensure that you didn't stumble into someone's trap; some WH dwellers will wait for a tower to online only to hold the inhabitants hostage for a payment. Do not give into the payment unless it vastly under the prices of your tower and module cost. If you get caught, simply haul your equipment away when they go offline. (Use your watchlist!)

Train your teams well.
,When you first create your team, make sure that you find players who you know for a fact want to achieve something more than just being some pub all-stars, because if not, you will go nowhere.,
Understand that competitive gaming, and especially wanting to go pro, is the equivalent of a full-time job.,
Recruit effectively.,
Recruit mentally fit players, because physical skill will be improving constantly as they learn more about the game.,
Schedule your team.,Train your team, meaning train your team's work ethic,
When your team of four is finally set, the first job that you will have is to go map out spawn points.,
Go back over all the maps that you have just gone over, and create your own unique call-outs for each of these maps together as a team.,
Train your teams about set-ups; how you are going to set-up on each map and each game-type per that map.,CTF,
You need at least two set-ups and transitions for both sides of each competitive map.,Search and Destroy,
You will need at least three strategies for offense and two for defense.,Simulation,

The mental game.,
This is not and never will be the appropriate way to act.,
You must train yourself to remain calm and collected.",How to Strategise An Online Multiplayer PvP Game,",, This is first thing that needs to be understood by all.,

Find those who are cool, calm and collected in-game, patient, aware, focused 100% of the time, and make rational decisions. Physical skill can be molded and can always be improved, but the mental skill comes down to you and your DNA make-up, including individual moral beliefs and personal characteristics.
A good thing is to recruit those who may not be the best individual players, but who listen, learn and are open-minded.

,

Remember this: a mentally fit player is a dependable player.

,

Take down everyone's schedule. Now your schedule should include a specific weekly forecast of your life.

Every day needs to be specifically planned out to the best of your knowledge.


Then, after you've acquired everyone's schedule, match up the times for everyone and write down the universal times when every player can be on.
From there, add up the total amount of hours per week your team will be putting into the game. It should be no less than 40 hours a week (equivalent to a full-time job).

,, This is most easily done by having map layouts in front of you (purchasing the primary strategy guide would most likely be your best bet as it comes fully equipped with everything you will need). If you can acquire map layouts online for free, then by all means take the free route. Then, take your team and go into private match. Run through all the MLG variant maps while they are spawning and then switch sides constantly, in order to find all of the spawn points for that map. Then move on to the next map. Keep in mind that in FFA game-types, there will always be more spawn points than in team game-types. Therefore, doing this in a team game-type would probably be easiest and most efficient. Make sure that everyone has a copy of this., There are already pre-call outs on the map layouts in the PSG which are good to start out using, then just fill in any extra spots with your own where needed. Make sure that everyone has a copy of this., Set-ups need to be done for both sides. Use your knowledge of spawn points when creating set-ups, so that you can try to anticipate where the enemy is going to run and which routes they will take, allowing you to counter accordingly. Remember that transitioning is very important when trying to implement a set-up.,, This means that you need to have two set-ups for when you get into these positions, and then you can transition accordingly to cap a flag. Stage 1 is the ODB (off the bat) and getting into position; the set-up is stage 2 of your strategy; stage 3 is the transition for capturing the flag; and stage 4 is where you have them in a spawn trap or something close to it so you can continually cap flag after flag, also referred to as cherry picking.,, Any team who tells you that they are efficient at running the same strategy over and over again to mold it is wrong. This will never work against truly skilled teams who are able to quickly adapt to the first strategy they see your team using. They will anticipate the same thing being done on the second time around, or test the waters and half-adapt to check if this is how your teams plays. Common sense and logical thinking are the two biggest mental characteristics that are really cherished and rare to find in players ODB, but these are characteristics that you all must have.,, However, for offense and defense it may also be wise to explore other alternatives, such as playing it out like a domination game, where you control half map and force them to kill you instead of directly going for the objective. Demolition is probably the hardest game type of the three just due to the fact that you have to cover the whole map while the offensive team may plant at either bomb site. In this game type, whoever has the more efficient map/spawn lock will be the team who will be able to run down the clock the fastest, which in turn will get you your win., Let's start with positioning first. Some of you may be wondering, ""well this isn't Halo, so this is pointless"". But the fact is that this is probably the next biggest thing that any player can do besides making a call-out. Where you place your body is so important in order to block off your flank or blind spot, when you’re pushing up or in your set-up. For example: positioning your body where a wall, box, crate, pole, or any object that can be used as a shield, is pretty much directly to your left, allows you not to worry about getting shot from your left or hit by grenades, which will now allow you to focus on your target-area. Never get caught standing in no-man’s land, which is generally anywhere not close to the perimeter of the map. Always know where you’re going, what you will be watching, and when you'll be moving. Communicating during all three of these stages is essentially for up-to-date info while in-game so your teammates know what's going on at all times., The first rule of angling is never show more than necessary, which in turn means that if you’re in a building looking out a window, you never want to be hugging the window; you always shoot from cover, standing up or crouching, depending on which window it may be, but refrain from crouching while looking out windows if you can. Standing up and shooting from inside the building will always be better because it will be harder for your opponent to recognize you from the darkness inside the building, always giving you the advantage. The golden rule is to never show more than is needed. The best example is a high-rise on the elevator side. In this situation, when you get to the fence corner, you want to edge out only far enough to see barely in front of their elevator side and always stand a little ways back from the corner. Never hug corners, because by hugging corners even the most perceptive eye can see your gun sticking out of the fence and start pre-firing at you and maybe get lucky. You always shoot from cover,because now you have the advantage, since he has to come to you or at least where he may be running with his gun, not out right away, which will give you the advantage(and of course always be wary of stun and grenade checks)., If you are able to pull off an efficient and successful spawn trap you most likely will take the lead or be in a position to take the lead somehow. However, ST's are tricky because there is a certain minimum distance you need between the spawn point and yourself, in order to not accidentally cancel out that spawn point. This means that if you go, for example, within say 20m of a spawn point, you will cancel out that spawn point and then force spawn will take effect, where your opponents will most likely spawn in the middle perimeter of the map. This is something that your team must test out., This is definitely another important part of the game. having assigned roles to each player or possibly assigned load-outs to objective players and slayer players. these are things that you all are going to have to talk about with your team if you’re going to want flag runners, bomb planters, or slayers. another alternative is that for CTF and demo, you can just implement a half map lock and then just slowly push up from their after they have 2 down or what not, gradually make their area to work with smaller. then go in for the grab on the transition. there are multiple variations and alternatives. of course some may think it depends on the map, trust me it doesn't. You can run any strategy you want, it's just going to come down to whether or not that strategy is efficiently effective or not., Being able to comprehend all the great things that your mini-map gives you is something that 99.9% of players just honestly don't know how to do. Most of you may think that the mini-map is just for spotting enemies on the UAV and then occasionally opening up your big map to spot the far away enemies. now whereas this may be an important feature of the mini-map, it is not the only one. The next type of important intel that you can get from your mini-map is positions. now what I mean by that, is that you know exactly where your teammates are positioning on the map because you can see their green arrows on your mini-map. Not only can you see where they are positioned, but you can also see where they are watching by which way the arrow is pointing. I mean does it get any easier to set-up knowing this. the answer is ""no"" by the way., The object is to fill-in to the farthest away positions so that the spawners and fill-in to the shorter distance positions, which now creates efficiency in how you save time setting-up. most of you probably have never thought of using your mini-map as a way to set-up before until you've read this meaning that most of you were most likely not using your mini-map to its full potential. so I hope this part helps those who were unaware until now., now PN's can be effective if either thrown all together around a certain area where the chance of inflicting damage if not killing an enemy ODB is high. of course you can always go with the other alternative where all 4 throw your own PN and spread out the area of impact. the only way to effectively find these out if you so desire to is by timing how long it takes to run each route ODB from the spawn in order to calculate at what time to throw it, how to angle it, and how long to cook it(if semtex, then this doesn't apply)., Now using stun checking is to overall become fortunate in reveling where an enemy is hiding. Or to slow them down while reveling them as well. now even most of you see SC as purely on offensive maneuver, there are defensive tactics for this as well. for example if you’re about to push or you've just killed an enemy, turning to throw a SC at your flank or blind spot which most likely is either behind you or 90 degrees to either side of you. so simply put we can assume that after you killed an enemy, your position has be compromised, so SC your BS is used as a defensive tactic. so you would throw it and then immediately go back to watching your area. stun grenades are honestly one of the most useful items you are allowed in this game. cherish them., the benefit to this is that if you can find a great angle to use for this tactic you may get lucky in killing 1 person ODB and tilt the advantage in your favor. the best example is the GS on invasion between courtyard and parking lot spawn. You can shoot all the way down mid st. and possibly pick off 1 or 2 people ODB using this angle. Works for both sides, but is more in favor of base spawn. if you take the time to find these, they may become your advantage early game., RT's are fairly simple to figure out on your own. all you need is a stopwatch or even better, just use the clock in the game when the match starts. Then just run routes that you think your opponents would run and one's that you would run, then write down times on how long it takes to get to a certain place or point on that map. This information will then allow you to make pre-nade selections and coordinate other tactics as well., the mental game is so important, it's just ridiculous because the fact is that 99.9% of you get emotional and let your emotions show during games and after them. This is not the way to go about handling yourself. I’m not saying don't feel down that you lost or maybe a little disappointed, but don't show it, because no one honestly wants to hear it. if you've ever watched any type of MLG live streams from events, you will notice that some pro's don't get emotional. when they die, they keep a straight face and just worry about what they’re going to do when they spawn. They don't sit here like a lot of you may do but just won't admit that you do, where you may say things in-game like, ""wow!!"", ""OMG no freaking way!"", ""how did that bk kill me!"", and my personal favorite ""get so lucky kid! you’re so bad at this game! play me 1v1!"". these are all so pointless and honestly get you nowhere but put your team in a negative atmosphere and mind-state., you have to understand that in order for competitive gaming to ascend and be considered to be on the same level as other professional sports, the attitude of the individual and players has to change for the better. Just in order for our sport of gaming to be taken seriously., Be positive in every situation, but don't milk it. Make a list of what to do and what not to do, and just read it every night before you go to sleep to improve your mental game. Trust me, you will see changes, and not only on the game but in your life as well, and they will be for the better. Being mentally fit is what every athlete wants to achieve at some point in their career and you should want to as well."

Atlas has moderate armor. Go ahead and run Vortex Shield, as you can either get out and deal with pilots or crouch to fool them, unlike the Stryder.
The Atlas is sort of ""the best of both worlds"". It has moderate armor and speed and specializes at nothing.

,


Using Vortex Shield, catch Archer Heavy Rockets. Then throw them back. How to do this for first- time trying: At the bottom of the HUD, it will say ""Pilot Locking"" and point a direction, Turn that direction and hold the Vortex Shield. Locate the pilot, and release the Vortex Shield to throw it at them. It's OK if the rockets miss, it prevents major shield and hull damage.
Friendlies can fire bullets into your vortex shield. May be a bug, but make use of it!
A rumor: The vortex shield blocks from behind. If you're going to try this, go in a private match.

, A loadout that works well is: XO-16 Chain gun with extended mags, Slaved Warheads, Vortex Shield, Regenerator (regenerates bodyshield faster), Core Accelerator (explained below).

, Don't use it right away! Use it on enemy Titans and the dropship. Targeting a Titan's weak points with double damage and the XO-16, a fast firing weapon, can take down a hulky Ogre in about 5 seconds (if every shot lands, which isn't likely).

, This can be used somewhat like the Stryder. Dashes take 4 seconds to recharge, compared to the Stryder's 3 and Ogre's 5 second time.

, Deal damage to Pilots, kill Grunts and Spectres and Pilots, and try to deal damage to Titans. Core Accelerator helps a ton.

, Attempt to preserve all alien corpses and artifacts.


Don't throw grenades into a square that is near a corpse if you can help it.
Try to kill all aliens that you have already researched (or already have that particular rank of alien).
More advanced weaponry will also help to increase the percentage of aliens that you kill.

, Make them build items and then sell them. Laser weapons are a great product to sell. So are any other items that don't require any materials to produce. Some examples are:


Laser weapons, as mentioned previously
Motion Scanners
Medi-Kits
Alien Alloys

, At the end of every month, right before the end of the day, take your Engineers and Scientists off of their projects, leaving only a few behind to preserve the progress, and transfer them to another base. At the end of the month, their salaries won't be paid because they were in transit. When they arrive, send them right back and get them back to work.

, Contrary to some players' beliefs, you do not need a small radar and a large radar at the same time. They sweep just as fast.

, This effectively doubles your defense value for only $15,000 dollars a month. For example, if you had two Fusion Ball Defences and one Grav Shield, the monthly cost is only $43,000, which is cheaper than four Fusion Ball Defences ($56,000).

, Soldiers cost money too, and older soldiers who have more experience will be better, allowing you to make even more money.

, They are effective, and they require no ammunition. The ammo you save from not using plasma weapons can then be sold. Use plasma weapons when you need to kill something that is heavily armored (or that you want to make absolutely sure you kill, such as a Chryssalid).


The same does not go for craft weapons. A Plasma Beam does not use Elerium when fired. It is a better choice than the Laser Cannon because it is more powerful. It also allows you to intercept any UFO (except Battleships) without a chance of return fire due to its long range.

, When one operative shoots, give the used gun to another operative, so that less clips will be used. This rotation also allows the operatives to improve evenly.

, They cost much more money than an operative. Of course, it is up to you to weigh the pros and cons.

Pros: Infinite ammo for tanks with laser or plasma weapons, does not hurt morale as much when destroyed, great armor and health, excellent scouts (this goes double for Hovertanks), not effected by psi attacks, instantly repaired at end of mission, no salary, cannot be fatally wounded or stunned.
Cons: Very expensive, ammo is very costly (with the exception of plasma and laser), not maneuverable in winding corridors (such as alien bases) due to time unit usage, can go up one tile staircases but get stuck at the top, takes up lots of space, poor reactions, takes more damage from grenades, aimed shot means nearly nothing, can go berserk (on rare occasions) and cause lots of damage, instantly gets killed (but not infected) by a Chryssalid's bite.

, Bring a pack of buddies to Sarepia Theater. Get some popcorn and pick a movie to watch. Then you can quiz each other on it afterwards.

, For fashionable fun, have a dress-up competition by telling everyone to put on their best outfit, and dance through the ""red carpet"" (a line of red Welcome Mats).


First place prize should be a small rare, something expensive, or something from the diamond shop.
Second place should be something that's not worth much and comes back around the holidays, like an ice block or clover blanket.
Third should be a store-bought item, and so on.

, Get three jammers. One starts off by writing a paragraph of a story in a word document, then only telling the next person the last line of the paragraph. The next person writes a second paragraph in word document, telling the next player only one line. The last player finishes with a last paragraph, and the players read their paragraphs to each other.

, Ensure that one person hides an item in their den so it is hard for the buddies to find. The buddies then search for the item, and the first to find it wins the item! The winner then has a scavenger hunt in their den, and so on.

You might just want to camp in a secluded corner of Jamaa Township., You should roast marshmallows if you have a fire, go hiking, sing a song or two, and enjoy spending time with friends.

, Wear cold weather clothing in Mt. Shiveer. If your in Sarepia Forest or other places (besides Crystal Sands) you might want to wear a pirate sword, a blanket, a feather (if you can), and shoes. At night an old hood or bunny hat along with your blanket can be quite cozy.

Tell everyone to ignore the person.",How to Handle an Animal Jam Bully1," When standing up to them, you must remain calm and collected, despite the boiling hot rage you might be brewing within. It is much more effective to seem like you aren't angry and you know what you are talking about.


No matter what the bully is doing, you can stand up to them. If they are calling someone ugly, tell the person that they are wrong. The same goes for if they are insulting you.;
, Many people think they are doing this, but it ends up turning out like; ""OH MY GOSH JUST BE QUIET ALL UR DOING IS BEING RUDE UGH"". Reactions like this will usually excite the bully, and make them keep doing what they're doing. If you say; ""Look, I know you probably think this is funny, but it isn't. You are really just hurting the feelings of innocent children in the game. If I were you, I would be extremely ashamed."" Saying this will either bore or offend the bully, causing them to slow down on their insults, or try harder.

, If the bully doesn't do anything about your explanation, just get everyone to ignore him/her. This will definitely bore the bully into leaving.

Select a solid champion.,
Choose good items.,
Pick your lane.,
Farm.,
Play passively if you are losing your lane.,
Take objectives and don't hunt for kills.,
Aim to take out the enemy nexus.,
Don't flame or rage.",How to Win Games in League of Legends," A champion is the embodiment of your soul, an extension of your body and a window of opportunities (that opportunity is winning at League of Legends!). Always select the champion that does the most damage from the most distance. These champions are always at an advantage when fighting enemies with no range attacks, you are able to hit them 2-3 times before they can even attack you once! Not only does it put you at a 3-4 hit advantage, but some champions like Annie and Lulu have a ton of range and can hit you with spells as well! They are also great for attacking turrets because you can attack them from afar and escape when danger is nearby. Remember range champions are the key to winning in League of Legends!;
, If the champion is an extension of yourself, then the items is an extension of your hero, which doubles up on the extension of yourself. You could almost say it is a double extension or ""turbo extension"" in the pro scene. Some items are designed to trick the players down the incorrect path. The key is to purchase items with slow and attack damage.


Go for items such as Frozen Mallet and, to a lesser extent, Icebourne Gauntlet. These items slow the enemy champions, making it harder for them to reach you with your better range. If a normal ranged champion gets 3-4 hits in versus a melee champion then a frozen mallet champion gets 5-6 attacks in, thats 2 whole attacks! This is absolutely game changing. Icebourne Gauntlet is not as good as frozen mallet as it does not increase your attack or give the bonus HP which allows you to stay alive to do more attacks! Here is a list of the best items to help you at winning at League of Legends:

Frozen Mallet
Icebourne Gauntlet
Rylai's Scepter
Twin Shadows
Frost Queen's Charm
Tiamat



, As a range champion, it is advised to go to top lane, where most players tend to play melee champions' top lane is also a good choice because there is only 1 entrance for the other lanes to ambush you from. Middle lane is definitely a bad choice because there are multiple entrances for the enemy to ambush you from. Bottom lane is a hit or miss. Unless you are with a friend or know they good then do not bother with bottom lane, you are essentially playing against 3 players if your ally is bad. The trick to knowing if they are good is if they also picked a ranged champion. Remember the most important rule is Win lane, Win Game.

, 1 kill = about 15 minion kills. Think about that the next time you feed and feel like it's impossible to win your lane! Farming can make the difference between winning and losing the laning phase of the game, especially with spells-bearing champions dedicated to farming like Veigar's ""Q""and Nasus's siphoning strike, which make them the extreme damage dealers. But don't get worked up-They are only supposed to appear in the late game.

, In other words, if you're scoring 0/3 against a Nasus in top lane, don't chase him out past the river and make yourself vulnerable to ganking. Instead, make sure you always have an escape route.


You can also stay under turret, which will protect you from the champion and will slow them if they attack you. The only bad thing about the camping turret is that it's harder to farm the minion waves. The turret will kill most minions, but you won't lose as much health by staying under your turret. This will also prevent many ganks.

, Objectives such as Towers, Blue and Red buff, Dragon, and Baron Nashor can mean the difference between winning and losing; they give off a huge cash injection to the entire team and can help give you an edge that wins you a vital team fight. It is immensely important that you control as many objectives as possible at once with wards.

, In order to do this you must destroy the turrets leading up to the nexus itself. To do this, you must attack the turrets whenever you can, even if the enemy are attacking you at the turrets. Every little hit slowly builds up to remove the mountain that is the turret. This is key to victory. Also the additional gold you receive for destroying a turret is 150 gold to every team member meaning you are helping your allies get stronger as well!

, This annoys everyone in the game and makes you feel bad, even if you win. You shouldn't play to win. Instead, you should play to have fun! I mean, the point of this game is to have fun with your friends, right? Flaming and raging really doesn't help you win at all.


What does help you is thinking about what you're going to do before you do it and pondering what you did wrong after you do it so it doesn't happen again. Keep in mind that getting objectives helps your team out a lot, so if you have a flamer, rager, or troll on your team, try to counter them with your objective taking and superior leadership skills!

A recommended amount of gems for your spree is 2,500 to 5,000. Remember, you can always get more if wanted. However, you will be skipping this step if you already have enough.;
, You don't want to go crazy and buy clothing if you only have 187/200 slots left. If you want to go on a shopping spree for only one certain item category (clothes, den items) then you should either make sure you have enough slots (10-200 slots is enough) or you should delete items to get to enough.

, Avoid Epic Wonders unless if you have enough gems. Ideas would normally include Jam Mart Clothing or Jam Mart Furniture, but there are many other stores (besides the Diamond Shop) where everything costs gems. These include the Flag Shop, Claws n Paws, Sarepia Forest plant shop, Conservation Museum shop, Hot Cocoa Hut shop, Mystery Emporium, Adventure Base Camp shop, Secret Eagle shop, and many more. You could even go on a den shopping spree if you wanted.

, Make sure you won't regret it. However, you do not need to spend all your money, it's just an option that makes it more shopping spree-ish.

, There's no point in spending all that money if you aren't going to use it one something! Redo your den or try on your new clothes.

, If a bully is calling someone stupid, and you call them smart, it would really sound like you're siding with her. Instead, try complimenting both of them!

, Usually bullies take humor in hurting the feelings of fellow players, but there may be a chance that they're actually upset deep down. By asking them ""what's wrong"", or asking if they are okay, they may admit that something bad had happened to them. If they do this, be supportive, but be sure to tell them it is no excuse for hurting others.

Use their insults against them.,
Make maturity an issue.,
Be defensive, not offensive.,
Don't be repetitive.,
Know when to stop.",How to Handle an Animal Jam Bully5," If they seem older, smarter, or more mature than you, it isn't the best idea to take them ""head on"". Ask yourself this... If you answer yes to any of these questions, the bully is probably not the most mature, and you may be able to show them that.


Do they make many childish emoticons such as ""o3o"" or "")8U""?
Does their vocabulary seem less advanced than yours?
Do they often say ""le"", ""meh"", ""lol"", etc?
Do you feel like you're smarter or more mature than they are?
Are their insults silly, when they could be more mature?

, This doesn't necessarily mean to use cruel language. Simply call them out, thus focusing the person towards you. Instead of ""You rude little brat!"", try just saying ""Hey, Crouching!"" (or whatever their name might be). You can move on from here.

, Yes, using high level vocabulary does sound snobby, but it usually tends to intimidate the person you are fighting with. Even if you need to grab a dictionary, this step is certainly effective.

, If the person is calling you or somebody else something mean, reverse the insult back to them. For example; if they call you ugly, rhetorically ask: ""Are you sure you aren't looking in a mirror?"" Responses like this are hard to make a comeback for, and the wittiness will get people to side with you.

, If they are obviously being immature, call them out for it! It may make them feel inferior to you and stop bullying.

, You're trying to deal with the bully, not hurt their feelings. They may deserve to be called names, but that doesn't mean to do so. Argue as passionately as you want, but if they seem hurt, then stop. By continuing you become the bully.

, People use that to their advantage. If you continue to use the same comeback or statement over and over again, they will probably make fun of you for it. This would make the situation even worse.

, There is a time where you should just discontinue the fight. If the person seems hurt, you are hurt, many people fight against you, or the person leaves, then don't keep going. It isn't worth it anymore.

Kimbara Outback
Appondale

, Use green pillows/mats as moss beds, and if you want you could seperate the bed areas using Picket Fence and/or Shoji Screens. Mark off a special-looking bed area for the leader (that's you!)

, Every good wolf pack needs decorations! Hang nature-like things on the walls, decorate it with Leaf Piles, and also use some potted plants (but not the glitchy ones!) to make it more enjoyable to hang out there.

, Be sure you're able to walk onto all of the beds, make sure that the decorations look good for a wolf pack, just see if it looks good enough to make a wolf pack in!

Repeat this process until you have 8 to 14 members.

, For example, your medicine wolf could go for herbs, your betas could sharpen up on their fighting skills, or the hunters could catch some prey for the pack to feast on. Sometimes, the daily life can get boring, so tell them that there is something new in the territory, like a bear, or a human. Don't overdo it, though, or it will get out of hand.

High heels
A red or black designer skirt
A diamond necklace
A gardening hat, beret, or diamond earrings

Note: Avoid wearing the tiara, as it appears false.

;
, In order to purchase an expensive den and furniture, you will need to have a budget. Have bedrooms for you and your children, a living room, a bathroom, and a kitchen.,, Capitalize the first letter in each word. Avoid speaking in all capital letters, as it gives off the appearance of yelling. Additionally, act as rich as possible, using phrases such as ""steps out of golden limo"" or ""looks around room for sweet angels to spoil."" This will capture people's attention, as well as urge children to act cute in hopes of being adopted.

, Head over to her, and sit down while facing her. Compliment the child and interact with her, gauging her reactions to see if she is the child for you. Once you decide you want to adopt her, pretend to sign adoption papers before picking up the child and taking her home in a fancy mode of transportation, such as a fuzzy stroller or a limo., Fill her room with plushies and action figures, and feed her delicious food while reminding her how precious she is. Take her on special outings, such as to the movies, dinner parties, etc. Don't forget to add her to your friends list so you don't lose contact with each other.,, Warn her of the dangers of wandering out without you. Make sure you never take her to Sarepia Forest, a place full of dangerous clans and other Jammers who could harm her. Always push her in a fuzzy stroller, and protect her from others if necessary. Consider hiring a bodyguard or two if the child is particularly irresponsible.

While taking care of a child can be fun, make sure you allow her to be independent as well. Children need freedom, or else they'll grow too dependent upon their mothers.

, Every Monday, a rare item is in store. Buy several of them - even though they do not look very rare, they may become a little rare (such as a rare fox hat) or even extremely rare (like the headdress) in the future. Do this until you have about 5 to 15 rares.

, Wootmoo's den, Aldan, and crowded lands/Brady's Lab (in Aldan, Brady's Lab can get crowded) are great choices. People will want to trade with you there, as it is a huge place for rare people and people who just want to trade.

, Once a trade is agreed upon, click on a player's name card. In the bottom left corner, you will see a little arrow following another one. Click it.

, Note: Not everybody will have stuff on their trade list.


Be sure to know your rares before trading them. Trading up to rarer items may make you seem rarer, but it depends on how many rares and what types of rares you trade. Avoid looking up info on the Internet - they are often outdated and inaccurate. Try asking around Jamaa what rares are worth, or put an item on trade. Say something like ""Trading attempts for my list."" Depending on what people keep trading you, you should know what it's worth.
Be sure to try and differentiate what is fair and what isn't fair for an item. Avoid scammers - test Jammers out by asking if a single item is fair for their item and make sure it is a definite under (for example, a necklace for a den beta). If they say yes, they're a scammer. Block them and trade other Jammers instead.

, Try to trade four rare item Monday items for it. If they refuse, try for a fox hat. Fox hats came out for rare item Mondays a while ago. This makes them less rare. Try for a glove before you rush to the fox hats.


Get a few more fox hats/gloves. This will help you trade those for other items later.






Take four gloves or fox hats and aim for slightly rarer items.






Note: People enjoy clothing more than den items, unless they are den betas. A great one to reach for are rare bows and worn blankets. Afterwards, you can trade these rares for den betas and such. Some of these rares, such as a raspberry colored bow and arrows and black worn blanket, are slightly rarer than most items (for example, a black worn is worth 4 den betas instead of 1). Keep in mind that rare item Mondays are sometimes less rarer than their non rare variant (e.g. rare worn blanket, which is not even worth 1 den beta).

, When you get your rare bows, and other rare items you've traded for, try for the bigger stuff. Go to Jamma Township and put some good items on trade. Say this, ""1 item on my list for something better, my den if so!"" The reason you say ""my den,"" is because you can talk with the person about what they want to trade, what you want to trade, and make a good deal in order for it to be fair.

, As you go, make duplicates of rare items to trade for rarer ones by trading for more.

, Take your worns, gloves, bows, or whatever good rares you have, go to Wootmoo's den, and try to trade for some den betas. Gain at least 2 to 4 den betas for a spiked wristband and at least 6 for a short collar (8 for good short collars, 13 for a bad long). Once you get one, follow the trading line until you get as many rares as you can.


Before trading for a spike with someone, check that they have one.Then count how many of the item she/he has it on. If it's 1, there is a good chance of a declined trade since it's there only item of that type, but if it's more than one item, you probably have good luck in getting the item.

, Remember that above all, have fun trading.

, Crystal Sands and Mt.Shiveer are great places to go!. Go to options, change to an empty server, tell your child to follow you to Jamaa township/coral canyons to pretend your going to the airport (you'll more than likely to be send to either of the worlds), Then ask them to follow you to which ever world you are going to stay in. The best part about this is, is that you don't have to go home right away to sleep, use the huts and pretend there hotels!. This also works with the cruise ship party.

, This is something great you can do when the dinner party is on. A little like the last step, except consider you instead go to a full server.

, Pets are great for kids, especially for their birthday. Usually its the same as the third step, pick any pet that matches your kid's personality. Warning about this step: Dogs and Cats do run away to be wild, usually with adult pets/female dogs or cats with kittens. I'm not saying adopting an adult dog is a bad thing, but it might be if your child and pet have a bond. I suggest adopting puppies and kittens, as they're more innocent and less likely to run away.

, Probably the most important step. I know its hard to think of stuff to do with your kids when your not outside, but imagine if you were babysitting in real life, you would have to change their diaper, feed them food, put them to sleep, etc. Now, dialog should be easy if you're being realistic, (e.g: For bedtime, ""(Change them into pyjamas). ""(Turns off den music)"". ""(Turns off TV/turns on night light)"".)

, Usually its less likely someone will be advertising their school in jamaa township, but that's okay. Let them go to different classes in each different world. (e.g: medical centre is health class, Brady's Lab in temple of zios is science, etc)

, While their in school, try pick any job. Maybe be a doctor in the medical centre, or a store owner in any store in jamaa. Maybe even own you're own business (restaurant, beauty salon, etc.)

Make the nursery.,
Make the warriors' and apprentice area.,
Make the elder's area.,
Leader den time!,
Create the Medicine Cat den.,
Name the clan.",How to Create a Warrior Clan on Animal Jam," The cats should have natural colours, no pink or purple or the like. Grey, white, black, brown, blue-grey, peach, and orange are good colours. Blue, green, amber, black, or grey may be used for the cat's eyes. The pattern should be something that looks natural like fire or lightning. Red lightning can look like bloody scars if you want.;
, For clothing, use items like fox hats, raccoon hats, spikes, moon/sun necklaces, elf bracelets, leg armour, swords, bow and arrows, and tail armour. Do not use items like tiaras or fairy wings, as they don't match the Warrior spirit.


Spiked or studded collars are great, but leaf necklaces are perfect for any cat. Leaf leg armour looks great too.
Wear other things like gazelle horns, swords, bow and arrows, or for a medicine cat wear a worn blanket, head flower, and leaf armour again.

, Your animal should be a tiger or wolf. Wear a bow and arrow if you are a non-member and a sword, black necklace and a ninja mask or elf helmet. Your colours depend on the clan you will lead. See the picture above for some examples.


If you plan to lead an ice clan/wind clan, wear white and light blue, as well as bluish-white flames if you have them.
If you plan to lead a fire clan, wear all kinds of reds, oranges and blacks, including red, orange, or black flames.
If you want to lead a river clan, wear all kinds of blues.
If you want to lead a shadow clan, wear all kinds of grays, blacks and dark purples.

, Buy a normal den if you are a non-member, and if you are a member, perhaps choose a castle or bunny burrow. You can also get the Sky Kingdom, and if you do, skip this entire method. You shouldn't decorate this den.

, For your clan, the best dens are small houses, tree house, castles (not the princess one!) and a cosmos den at the very least.

, You could put trees, hamsters, a pond, or some Return of the Phantom prizes (any of them would work!) in the empty spaces that you think should add to the style. If you got the Sky Kingdom, you should have skipped these steps.

,


Queens are female members of the clan who are pregnant or are still caring for the kits. It is important to look after the queens, especially the pregnant ones because they get sick when birth comes around the corner. Put out some couches, flowers, torches, and toys. Newborn kits stay with their mothers until after they are weaned.
Weaned kits are babies in the clan who have stopped drinking their mother's milk. They need a room with couches, toys, flowers and anything else babyish but tough, so they can grow up to be warriors that the clan will never forget.
Warriors can get a room with beds and torches, but nothing too fancy.
Apprentices are the newest members of the clan in training. They can get the same things as warriors.
Cats need to eat. Use plushies for the fresh-kill pile.
Elders can get a room with plants and a place to sleep, rest and relax. Remember they were once a warrior or medicine cat or even deputy! So, treat them with respect.

, The nursery should be friendly with a large carpet. you can decorate it with at least one plant or two bunny plushies. In the non-member den, it should be inside. If you are in a bunny burrow, make it inside in whichever burrow you want. In the castle, it should be all the way at the top filled with pillows for the kits and queens.

, In the non-member den, it should be located at the beginning when you enter the den. It should have couches that look like a rectangle for the warriors to sleep on. The apprentices should sleep on the pillows. Don't make it too big, because you still have to make the elder area! In the castle, the warrior's den should be all the way at the bottom room near all the water. In the bunny burrow, make it in any burrow you want.

, The elders' area should have fresh-kill in the corner and soft pillows, couches, and rugs. For the non-member den, it could be anywhere inside. In the castle, it should be at the entrance inside. For the bunny burrow, it could be the last burrow you have. If no one wants to be an elder, you can make this the apprentice area.

, The non-member den could have the leader's den in the back, where the small stone square is. Don't make it too comfortable. Make it only have some fresh-kill, a rug, a hammock, (you can get one in Meet Cosmo or by watching Brady's Expedition in the Lost Temple of the Zios.) You can also have couches or pillows. In the castle, make this the small area, the top next to the entrance to the nursery. (the small narrow area should be empty, I'm talking about the square area) In the bunny burrow, it should be next to the Medicine Cat area.

, This should just be a small corner or just in one of the rooms in your castle. It should also have plants, mushrooms, berries, etc. You should also have a small drinking fountain, (you can get one by finding all the items in Bahari Bay.


For the non-member den, you might want to out this area at the small top grassy area when you enter your den. Don't make it to big or too small; if you want, you can put a fence. In the bunny burrow den, put this on the left or right corner outside the den. For the castle put it outside in the top small area. Again, skip these steps if you got the Sky Kingdom.

, To complete your clan, you'll need a name for it. The regular clan names are RiverClan, ThunderClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. You can choose one of these or make up your own! Name it after something natural (such as DarkClan, FireClan, BlizzardClan, or MistClan)and you're ready to move on!

, for a family home you will need quite a lot of stuff. A non members house can hold up to 100 items where as a gold members can have 200. I will include some stuff you should get in the ""Things you need"" section below.

, Try to get room dividers so you can section things off into smaller rooms. Try making a kids room with 2 sofas and a couple of plushies. (Plushies are available playing the claw machine. It costs 5 gems a go and there a range of animal plushies. Don't get frustrated when you try to try but you don't get any; you will eventually get some.)

, If you can get room dividers try making a kids room, a master bedroom and a living/dining room. In my den my Kitchen is outside as is the bathroom because the area is so small.

, Get a vegetable patch and some chairs, towels, tables and sun loungers. I have some treehouses and 2 boat ponds using the trade system and the treasure map.

, This way intruders can't stay at your den and beg for trades.

, It's essential that everyone gets sleep. Keep your kits asleep too. They are going to be weak in the morning if they don't get any sleep.

, It's a good idea to keep your clan's apprentices to stay that rank until you know they are strong enough to take care of your clan.

, Ensure that some warriors switch with others who have already slept for a while.

, You don't want any coyotes stealing your kits. The queens will get upset and maybe leave your clan.

, You'll need someone to keep your clan running. Make sure your deputy is fit too.

, Be sure to take your clan on a run often. Always leave some of the clan behind to keep the camp safe (see above).

, Have them go hunt and spar with each other on a regular basis. It's good to keep strong and sharpen your skills in fighting.

, They'll turn out to be strong apprentices if you let them play fight with each other!

, They aren't the dullest knife in the drawer yet!

, However, given the possibility, make sure your warriors are strong at all times, and that there are enough of them.

, They shouldn't have major parts in battle, but they can do a bit to help your clan and train at the same time.

Be a wolf, bunny, or snow leopard.,
Know some basic Clan terms.,
Know how to communicate like a Clan person.,
Dress ""Appropriately"".,
Understand more or less of a Clan is.,
Look for a Clan.,
Meet with the Leader.,
Once you are accepted, get to know your Clan-mates.,
Have fun!",How to Join a Clan on Animal Jam," Wolves resemble cats the most on Animal Jam, though some clans do not like people using them as they are canines, not felines. Snow leopards look a lot like cats too, but some Clans think that they look bad and will ask you to change. A lot of good Clans don't mind this though, so don't be afraid to try! Biologically, tigers are the best thing to use as they are the closest thing to clan cats that you can get in AJ. Not many people use cheetahs when they aren't roleplaying so a lot of people don't like roleplaying with them, and those are also rarely used. People use lynxes for kits a lot, and bunnies are what is traditionally used for kits.;
, This is a very crucial step. Warrior Cats Wiki has lots of information about Clans. Know the prey, insults, compliments, time terms (Like sun-high) and anything of that sort.

, This is probably the step that most people struggle with. The more you hang out with Clan people the easier it will be, but most of them aren't very approachable. As you may have noticed, they use loads of ""faces"". (Ex; o.o, o3o, :D, :), XD, ;-;) those are very few ones, but are some of the most used.

, Don't go around wearing pink or having unusual colors for your pelt. Try to make your pelt as natural as possible. Gray, black, brown, orange, and white are some colors that are worth your time trying. As for the undercoat, unnatural colors are okay as long as it is dark. Unnatural bright colors might make the Clan cats think differently of you, but it does not hurt to try. If you want to have a light undercoat, try one of the natural colors.

As for pattern, do not do hearts. It not a good pattern for realistic-ish cats and not many people use it. Lightning and the Blob patterns are the most popular and pleasing to look at. You are not required to have a pattern. Your pattern color can be any color as long as it looks good with the rest of you. For accessories, do not wear skirts or any human-like clothes.
For the back of your animal, a sword, bow, Jamaaliday bow or nothing is okay. For paws, elf bracelets, spike bracelets, gloves, and anything that is not too kittypet or two-leg looking (like the diamond ring) will suit you fine. The head is usually nothing or a fox hat. Skull helmets work too. Anything else will not make it any easier to look like a Clan cat. The tail a raccoon tail or tail armor of any color won't be too abnormal. The neck anything is okay, just not kittypet items again. A leaf necklace, heart necklace, spiked collar are good choices. Make sure your items do not look weird with your pelt. Try to match a little bit.







, Clans hunt, fight, and survive. There are ranks for each ""cat"". Don't walk into a Clan and ask, ""What's a Clan?"" Right after you asked to join. If you do not know basics by this step, go back to step 2.

, Many Clans will have their leader go to the world Aldan and go to Sarepia Forest  announcing to go to their den and join their Clan. There is nothing wrong with that, but make sure the person announcing it isn't a kittypet clan. Member leaders are more legit. They have more realistic items to roleplay with and Clannish-looking dens. The more experienced and better leaders are not likely to be in Jamaa. Many of the experienced leaders just expect you to come to their den and ask to join. The den above is holo the wolf's den also a dark forest of warriors. If you want a less aggressive clan to join try WindClan or ThunderClan. So if you are looking for a good start, head for other places. Coral Canyons will probably have 1-3 Clan cats there. Sarepia forest is likely to have a whole Clan, or even more than one for that fact, and the second runner-upper is Zios. Kimbara Outback very rarely has Clans, and Appondale may have more inexperienced clans. Crystal Sands is bound to have 0-2 Clan cats.

, You can go ahead and boldly go up to the leader of the Clan and simple ask, ""Can I join your Clan?"" or maybe you would want to get to know the leader first. Who knows, the leader may seem good, but once you join they won't even know what the definition of hunting is! The more you know the leader, the better you know how to approach him/her to ask for a place in their Clan. Or if the leader somehow hates you, try to reason, but do not try very hard. It will make you seem too desperate (even if you are.)

, Does this Clan have more boys or girls? Does this Clan have more members or nonmembers? Is this Clan nice or mean? These might seem like very stupid questions, but they will make you way to live in your new Clan much easier. If the Clan has more boys than girls, you might already have an idea of what the Clan will act like, if the Clan has more members than nonmembers, it is more likely it is more experienced, and if the Clan is mean instead of nice, you might also have an idea of how many battles or orders there will be.

, Don't let all of this Clan talk get into your head. Clan people sometimes chill when their leader isn't on, and it is a very good way to bond with their Clan-Mates. A Clan is a very good opportunity to make friends, and get a better reputation around Jamaa.

For starters, pick the right animal!,
Choose the right pelt.,
Get the pattern going well with pelt.,
Use the right eye color.,
Get the right clothes.",How to Be a Good Clan Member on Animal Jam1," For kits, you use bunnies, for apprentices you could use a fox (or bunny if you're a non member) and finally, a wolf if you're a warrior (this also goes for deputy, medicine cat, leader, elders and queens). If you want, or don't have a wolf/fox/bunny yet, try ending the name with ""the cat"". (Infinity the cat, Lucky the cat, Countess the cat, etc.);
, ""Pelt"" means fur. Your pelt is quite important; if your fur isn't appropriate for clanning, you could get ignored in your clan. Basically, you have to remember you're based on real cats from the warrior books, so change your fur to normal cat colors.


Here's a list of colors you should use: black, dark grey, grey, white, beige (beige and a very light grey are next to white, but there is only three, but it is a mix between white and brown, and white and grey), and brown. Red can be used for blood or scars, so if you do get hurt in a fight, maybe use your second color and patterns for scars or blood as well.

, Lighting and fire are most popular, but big blobs are good if you get hurt to look more realistic. Remember to use these in a good color that works with your fur.

, Obviously you should use the normal boy eyes and girl eyes, and use a normal eye color such as green, blue, dark blue, brown, or light brown. There may be exceptions, like black or a dark purple.

, You might need to do some trading to get the right clothes.


For members: Headdresses (If you have one, great! But if you don't, you shouldn't waste to much time getting one, as they are quite rare), fox hats (They can also be for non-members), swords (You can buy them from the normal store), and elf armor (horses only party).
For non-members: Bow and arrows (Note: these aren't as rare compared to rare bow and arrows, and they are quite common so if you have one, great!), fox hats (They came back which is bad, because rarity goes down, but it's also good because they're for new clanners to obtain), and pirate swords (you can get one color from adventure beta hard mode by rescuing the bunnies in this order: Daisy, Jack, Snowball and Oliver).

"
"
Search for food for clan.,
Someone on your territory.",How to Be a Good Clan Member on Animal Jam2," This is important! If you don't, the clan will starve (this is normally with smaller clans,very big clans like Madjasterx don't hunt a lot, only apprentices for training will). Sometimes there are feasting tables- this is a normal table with some plushies on it, and it's where you put your hunted prey down so the clan can eat.


Don't expect kits to hunt for themselves, they are the youngest in the clan and can't leave the nursery until their mother gives them permission to pad around the camp, but never outside the camp!
Hunt like a normal animal would. Example: ""*Sniffs bushes*, *Pounces*."" (the ""*"" represents what the cat is doing), remember to add more, don't use the same line over and over again, make up some new ones and you're set for hunting!
Hunt for a medicine cat apprentice. If you are a medicine cat, you wouldn't hunt for food, you hunt for herbs (for sicknesses) and cobwebs (for wounds or if someone is hurt). Use your medicine cat skills correctly; when someone is hurt badly from battle, don't tell them to swallow a herb, use cobwebs as bandages.
Train apprentice (warriors). Kits have to grow up if they have parents. They should have a ceremony with the leader (or deputy if leader is offline) for becoming an apprentice and beginning training. So, kits need a warrior that wishes to mentor a young apprentice. Pick whether you want to be a warrior cat or a medicine cat and tell your mentor.
If you want to be a mentor you have to train your apprentice in the ways of the clan. This includes hunting and fighting. Train them to attack enemies (not random people, this is cruel; for example, people just walking in your territory who don't know anything about clans. If they look suspicious, ask them if they're in a clan).
Get necessary training. At some point of your experience, you will have to fight. Don't just do weak scratches, you actually have to fight (normally with other clans), and don't hold back if you are getting attacked, you won't win.

, Every good clan has a territory, find out what your clan is and go there (a territory would be some place around Jamaa). If you see someone hunting or another clan member in your territory, ask them what clan they're from. If they aren't from yours, tell them to leave, and you'd probably only be out if you're older than 6 moons, so call for backup (mentor, clan-mates, anyone that you know in your clan besides the leader and deputy, who have more important things to do).

"
"
Obtain medicine cat apprentices.,
Obtain training.,
Introduce Starclan.",How to Be a Good Clan Member on Animal Jam3," Medicine cat apprentices are important, so there will always be a need for more med cats. A clan couldn't survive without someone qualified and trained by the main medicine cat. Things like attacks from other clans, territorial battles, and illness require medicine cats.

, Medicine cats need special training. They need to know all herbs and what they do to help, collect cobwebs and berries, and their mentor also needs to tell them about poison berries and infected animals (such as rats).

, This is the medicine cat ceremony (ex: use hot sauna at Mt. Shivers or shallow lake at epic wonders as moonpool}. Here is an example of how this tradition goes down:


Medicine Cat: I, (name), medicine cat of ___Clan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. (He/she) has trained hard to understand the ways of a medicine cat, and with your help (he/she) will serve (his/her) Clan for many moons.
Medicine Cat: ___paw, do you promise to uphold the ways of a medicine cat, to stand apart from rivalry between Clan and Clan and to protect all cats equally, even at the cost of your life?
Apprentice: I do.
Medicine Cat: Then by the powers of StarClan I give you your true name as a medicine cat. ___paw, from this moment you will be known as (new name). StarClan honors your (virtues), and we welcome you as a full medicine cat of (Clan).
The apprentice must drink from the moonpool after this.

"
"
Choose a den.,
Think of names first.,
The apprentice's names have to end with paw (featherpaw), the kit names have to end with kit (featherkit), the leader's name has to end with star (featherstar), and the elders and queens can have their warrior names.

,
Dress appropriately.,

Buddy your clan members.,
Start clanning.,
Host clan meetings.,
Be nice to your clan members.,
Send out the deputy for hunting patrols.,

Have fun with this and don't take yourself or the concept too seriously.",How to Be a Clan Leader on Animal Jam," Set up the den according to your needs and abilities.


For a nonmember, you could use the small house with trees on the outside.
On the inside of the warrior's and apprentice's den, use mostly mats and some Treetop Gardens nonmember plants and make sure not to use anything ""too"" fancy.
Use bamboo shields to make extra dens.
For the kit's/queens nursery, use plushies, mats, and couches.
For the medicine cat, use mats and lots of treetop gardens plants.
For elders, use mostly mats and few plants.
For the leader, use couches, mats, pillows, plants, and anything else you'd like to add.;
, Think of five names for each rank, such as Fernheart, Darkrain, Hawkflight, etc. The warrior's name can end with various things, such as pelt, tail, heart, claw, flight, and cloud and fur

,, Use colors that represent your name and clan, Bluestar of Thunderclan might use the light gray with the icy blue lightning pattern. If you want to wear something, use fox hats, bow and arrows, swords, leg armor, elf bracelets, tail armor, and for girls heart lockets.

, Keep a storage account there, and when it fills up, come back. Then proceed to the next step. You may also want to move around on your storage account, so people don't leave due to being bored.

, If somebody is being rude, though, you could unbuddy them and lock them out. Don't worry because you won't lock all your clan members!

, First name everybody, then train the apprentices with their warrior mentor, give the medicine cat an apprentice to train, sit the elders in their den to eat and sleep, and the kits and queens in the nursery.

, Clan meetings are important for ceremonies, and gatherings.

, Your clan members will respect you more and you will have a less chance of jammers leaving your den.

, Let your deputy know what the food chain is. For example, wood mice, moles, etc. Always send at least two senior warriors, one training apprentice, and one warrior.

, But don't be demanding. Try to roleplay so that the clan becomes more interesting for everyone involved. If the clan gets too crazy, try to not yell at people. You could call a meeting or tell people to calm down.

, Your clan members are part of your clan. Make sure to get some attention to everyone! Don't leave anyone out.

, Being fair is great. Let kits play around. Don't be the greedy one that gets the food and leaves crumbs for the clan.

, Playing by the warrior cat code will make the roleplay make sense.

, Nothing will continue to happen if your clan doesn't have any fun!

, Unlock your den and say, ""Deer herd my den!"" when you have enough people, say ""Last calling!"" then go to your den and buddy every one there. Ask them for their deer name and rank, but if you want to, you could use the first part of their animal name; for example, if someone's name was 'Infinity Arctic moon', you'd call them Infinity., You could graze or run around., Wolves may hunt deer, so be scared!

Finish!",How to Make a Shadow Clan on Animal Jam," Camps are the main places where cats eat, sleep, and socialize. Camps can be dens, for instance, a volcano den for FireClan, or an underground den for ShadowClan. (Also use the music ""deep blue"". Another good music alternative is ""Mt. Shiveer""). If you are a non-member or don't want to dedicate your den to a clan, consider getting a rarely visited place such as Outback Imports, The Flag Shop, (Flag Shop is rather large), or even the clothing store or Chamber of Knowledge (Very, very, large and cool to look at as well). Too many people choose the bottom of Sarepia Forest for their territories making it crowded, but the top ""treehouse like"" part could be used. Territories such as Temple Of Zios are less crowded and easier to roleplay in. Consider territories that are along your camp (if it's not a den of course!) such as Temple Of Zios with Chamber of Knowledge as your camp, or the top part of Sarepia Forest if the Flag Shop is your camp.;
, Shoji Screens and pillows are good for the dens, for the fresh kill pile get all red plushies and for wild animals to ""Hunt"" just put certain plushies about, no purple or green plushies and no rhinos.

Decorate your den.",How to Not Be Mistaken for a Noob on Animal Jam," That means no monkeys, koalas, or pandas. However, if you feel like they are good animal choices, choose them. Wolves, foxes, snow leopards, arctic wolves, and bunnies are the recommendation of many Jammers.;
, Names like 'Baron Cool Scurvy' aren't cool at all. Names like 'Major Major major' or 'Mythical Thecat' makes you sound experienced. Be sure that these names fit your animal. If you're a penguin, don't make the suffix horse, seal, wolf, etc. This goes for all animals.

, If you are still in your starting colors, change them. Don't go for anything too wild or crazy. Also, if you're a girl, don't go for all pink. Most jammers that are rabbits change their pattern to spotted. For wolves, arctic wolves, foxes, and snow leopards, black, white, gray, red, and blue is best recommended. For snow leopard's spots, make them the opposite of your color, or a lighter or darker shade of your original color.


Fake it until you make it! If you can't quite get your paws on something rare, purchase the silver glove (available at Epic Wonders in Coral Canyons). Many people confuse it for a plain white glove; therefore making you appear more rare.

, Don't go insane with color, but wear things that match or are close to your animal's color. Wear wings if they look good on you. Depending on the size of the animal, wings will look different. Rabbits look adorable, and wolves look too large. Avoid the butterfly wings; as they are almost always in stock. Buy clothes at stores that everyone ignores, an example is the new store in Appondale. Newer Jammers might think they are worth plenty because they haven't seen it in Jamaa Outfitters.

, Many Jammers make the mistake of getting a randomly colored pet instead of one that matches. Having a purple and neon green hamster while you're brown looks strange.

, There are video tutorials on this if you need help.


Speak with proper grammar. Use your shift key, know when to add an apostrophe, and add punctuation at the end of every sentence. It may take a few more seconds to type, but you'll come off as mature. You can have free chat when you're a member.

, These don't have to be relatively rare, but at least put a few on.


Steer clear from items you can buy. Items like the tiara and necklace are always in stores and having them on your trade list is worthless. Play Phantom Invasion a few times and put your rewards on your list.

, Play many different games, gain as many gems as possible, buy at least 25 clothing items; these are all way to get achievements. If you need, look up a list of them and how to earn them.





, Buy some furniture, and go on a serious Journey Book find. But make sure your den isn't cluttered!

Enjoy!",How to Throw a Sleepover on Animal Jam," One of the most critical parts to a good sleepover is the environment, so you should get decorating right away. Members can own more than one kind of den, so if you're a member, the Enchanted Hollow den, Cosmo's den and even the Restaurant den are good ideas.


Also, the most important decoration you can ever have for a sleepover are the beds! Your guests will need something to sleep on, after all. For members, plaid couches work well as beds, but if you're a non member, striped couches can work too. If you planned on sleeping bags, just use beach towels. Don't forget pillows and plushies!;
, Your sleepover will be very boring if you don't give your guests things to do. Decorations can help here, too. Don't add any arcade machines, as your guests might disappear into the games in the middle of the sleepover. Instead, try to recreate on Animal Jam what you would do at a sleepover in real life.


For example, eat! If you're a member, set out a feast table and\or a dessert table. If you're a non member, you can use the fruit bowl or an AJ birthday cake.
Do makeovers! Set out some things that remind you of makeovers. Non members can set out red or green painted pots, while members can use the fancy vanity, as well.

, Think about what you would wear to a sleepover. Pajamas, right? But, how can you wear pajamas on Animal Jam?


For members, get a sports jersey. On most animals, it looks like it's too big on you so it will give the comfy look of pajamas. Unfortunately, for non members, there is nothing that looks like pajamas, but whether you are a member or non member, you might also try wearing a broken heart necklace or a friendship bracelet and giving one of these to another person at your sleepover so you look like matches.

, A sleepover is nothing without people! Dance in Jamaa Township, or another well populated area, and say ""sleepover at my den!"" after you've been advertising for a few minutes, say ""sleepover at my den, last call!"" (or ""last calls"" if you have dictionary chat) and go to your den.

, You might try to encourage conversation between everyone at the party, or maybe you can even play truth or dare! Just remember to follow the site's rules and be friendly to your guests.


No inappropriate dares should be used. It usually doesn't happen that way, but remember you can back down from any dare that you think might get you in trouble or hurt someone's feelings. Above all, have fun!

Avoid begging players for rares (rare items).",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam1," This is annoying to most and people will most certainly block you/lock you out of their dens. Begging for rares from a friend may make them want to delete you.

Try to buy Monday rares. They may seem to lack value at first, but don't worry! They will gain value with time.
Trading with other players. Trading is an awesome way to get anything! Be sure to know the item's rarity level if you'd like, and always use the trade system, in order to avoid being scammed no matter how interesting the offer seems, PRINCIPALLY if it means you're getting overtraded: ""Send me your Rare Fox Hat and I will send you Non Rare Headdress!"", for example. After all, unless such trade cannot be done through the trade system (which already sounds fishy on itself, doesn't it?), there's no reason why not to use it!
Participate on Adventures! Please note that not every adventure will lead you to a rare. There are no guarantees you'll get rares everytime, good or not, on an adventure. You can still get non store-bought items or betas, which is good, you just need to give your best - and a little luck helps too!
NEVER scam to get rares!;
"
"
Always help people when you can!",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam2,"


If you know a new jammer to AJ, introduce yourself and the world of Jamaa to them! It's a good way to get a friend and plus, you are helping and making someone happy!
If you're good with item rarity, it'd be nice of you to help other jammers that are not! By sharing your knowledge, you're preventing scamming and helping others to be good, fair traders!
If you have rares you don't want, give them away! There may be someone who is in need of it more than you.
You do not have to give someone your rares just because they asked for them. Be reasonable about it!
If you're walking through the game and casually see somebody asking for help, and you think you might be useful, why not to help them?
If you think somebody's doing something wrong, you can tell them! They may not know they're being rude or offending.

"
"
If you are angry/sad because of something or someone...

...do not vent your stress on people and try your best not to be rude to others!,
Don't be a bully!,
Don't break AJ's rules!,
Do not try to scam!",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam3," If they aren't the reason of your anger/sadness, then the person is just either gonna be just as rude or block you! Most times, a nice conversation/discussion can solve problems!







,

That just really annoys people. Do not go around calling people names or offending them just because you think it is fun. Do not constantly mock others for things such as looks, personality, username... You don't know if they are having a bad time or if they are trying to have fun, and by being a bully, you are gonna ruin everyone's game! This is also very relevant in real life!







,

If you do, you will be punished and you'll be setting a bad example to other jammers. If you think haven't broken any rules but has still gotten punished, you/your parents can always talk to AJHQ about it!







,

This is a really bad thing and by scamming you can ruin someone's day. If you are a good person, don't scam. Also be careful to not get scammed!







"
"
This is not a very nice thing to do.",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam4,"


If someone is new and wants to trade their rare, do not cheat them! A new jammer most probably won't realize they've been ""fooled"" and when they do, there won't be much they can do. Be fair and make a good trade, even though the jammer won't know if you under or overtrade them.
If someone would like very badly to be your friend, don't treat them as your slave! They don't have to give you anything (unless they somehow owe you), break rules for you or to talk to other people for you in order to be your friend. They shouldn't want to be friends with someone that tells them to do stuff they don't want to! If you're the person who wants to be friends with someone very badly, don't let them treat you that way! This is also relevant in real life.

Good people and friends will retribute your good actions!",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam5," Be as nice you can. Your reward is a good reputation and lots of people who'd like to be buddies with you! It'd be very nice if you didn't demand anything back for your niceness.

"
"
If you are famous, don't act like you're better than others.,
If they are nice to you, be nice to them!,
Some people may only want to buddy you because of your rares/fame.",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam6," Being famous may make fans really want to be friends with you. Read Part 4!

, Being famous or rarer than someone doesn't allow you to be mean to others. People won't support you and you will get no friends.

, If you think they are only interested in what you have, imagine situations where you can discover their true interest in you. As for example:


If, after a long time they've buddied you, they try to become close/ask for an item of yours, you should probably not give it to them. Most times, they will unbuddy and block you, and keep your item.Then, you can't say you got scammed, because it was your choice to send the item. Unless you like and believe them/would like to become close friends with them first, you should not give them your rare.
If you are a forgetful person, try to think of a way to remember things. Some people may try to trick you into thinking you've promised them something, mostly items. This is also relevant for other situations apart from Animal Jam!

"
"
You have a right to be happy to have a membership, but having a membership doesn't necessarily mean you're a better or worse person than anybody else.,
Always remember: It doesn't matter if you have a membership or not!,
If you want a membership really badly, you can ask your parents/somebody you trust from your family for one!",How to Not Be a Jerk on Animal Jam7,"

It's not cool to act braggy, smug, or superior because of your membership! Remember to be kind and nice to other jammers, no matter what status are them in!

,

Of course that, with a membership, there are more ways for you to have fun in-game - and you're supporting AJ! But you, non member, are still a jammer just like everyone else! Don't feel inferior because you aren't a member, you can still play and have fun - and AJ is already happy to have you as a fellow Animal Jammer! If people don't want to be your buddy/ignore you just because you are a non member, forget about them them and jam on! That almost certainly means they are not good people, so try to avoid them!







,

If your parents cannot give you one, don't be sad. They surely have a reason for that, so don't quit Animal Jam because of it!
Here you go a few tips you can follow: Ask for a membership as a christmas or birthday present, make an effort to get good grades/keep on having good grades at school and, principally, be a nice, gentle and generous son/daughter are ways for you to get a membership! You could also try to make a little money by yourself so you can buy it, still with your parents' permission of course, if you're mature enough to.

Match your colors to the theme
Use clothes that match. Ex: dress the Scariest, body color (1) black (2) black eye shape (slanted, no whites) Eye color (red)

, It's a kind and clever thing to do. The kind side: they will be happy seeing just one vote on their report card! The clever side: it will decrease one vote of the best dressed jammer as you are not voting him/her., (this does not always work, sometimes theme emotes lessen your chances)"

, If you are a member, try to get bigger dens, but not too big so you can still keep track of your baby. Make a kitchen, playroom, and bedrooms. In your baby's room, give it a crib, plushies, and make the room colourful, and include pillows or a rug on the floor, so if the baby falls out of it's crib, it won't get hurt.

, Go to the pillow room in Jamaa Township to adopt your baby. First look around to see if there are any in the pillow room. If you spot a baby you like, look at it, and see how it behaves! Here is an example of what might happen: You: Looks at newborn with interest. Baby: goo goo! ga ga! You: aww, your a cutie! Picks newborn up and holds tiny body in arms. Baby: Mama! holds onto mama with tiny paws and nuzzles fur. You: Takes baby home. If that happens, make sure to buddy your baby so it can come to your den.

, When you find your baby, take it home. When you get home, say: Picks newborn up and carries around the house. Make sure to show your baby around so it gets used to the house.

, If your baby is only a few days old, you will have to feed it milk from yourself, or feed it a bottle. When you want to feed your baby, say: feeding time sweetie! Or, your baby might cry for you to feed it. After feeding remember to burp it. As it gets older, start feeding it mashed up bananas, or baby food from a store.

, After eating, pick up your baby and say: Time for bed my darling! Then carry your baby to it's room, and put it in its crib. Tuck the baby into bed, and turn off the lights. If your baby cries as soon as you leave, rock it to sleep, or sing it a song.

, To give your baby a bath, get a swimming pool, or pond. Say: picks up and carries to bath. takes off your baby's clothes. Then hold your baby as you put it in the water. Remember: Your newborn cannot swim! so hold onto it as you wash it.

Merchandise. Clothing and accessories such as jumpers, hats, bags, mouse pads, soft toys and wristbands are available. Sometimes there are specials offers where the prices are reduced by around 10%.

, Many children like to use their first name in usernames, however, because of this, their name may already be take due to the popularity of this game.

, Only chat or roleplay about things in-game (e.g. favourite piece of clothing; animals and pets; games; adventures etc.). Animal Jam isn't a social media website and should not be used as one.

Go on trusted sites; while Wikipedia may give you information that sounds correct, always visit more than one site to give you a general idea about your character.Make sure you know the character one last time before you start roleplaying.

, Members, you have all the options. Non-members can of course roleplay too, but they have a limited selection so it may be more difficult. That being said, don't get a membership just because you can't get the right animal. Remember to compromise.[[Image:

.jpg|center]], Members definitely get more options here, but remember what has just been said in the last step. Nothing can be perfect, so find a way to make an outfit that resembles the character's clothes the most. If you absolutely cannot find any clothes, you might have to try another roleplay character.[[Image:

|center]], Once you're all dressed up, learn to be the character. No matter what has been said to you, stick to character and do what he or she would do. It's just like acting in a play.Act as how the character would act.[[Image:

Practice makes perfect. Novices can't expect to be spot-on the first time roleplaying on Animal Jam. Once you learn more about your character, roleplaying will be as easy as tying your shoes.

Change your appearance to a sickly color.,
Go to the Medical Center.,
Go upstairs to the examination room.,
Once a doctor comes to help you, sit up.,
Listen to the doctor's advice, and follow their instructions.,
For a serious disease, a breathing machine might be given to you.,
Death may scoop you up if the doctor fails to heal you.",How to Pretend to Be Sick on Animal Jam," This will help convince people that you're not feeling well. Green is a popular color choice, as it hints that the animal is feeling nauseous. The splotches pattern is also recommended for further evidence that you're sick.;
, It's located in Kimbara Outback. This is a well-known place for sick animals to travel to in hopes of receiving help.

, Lay down on a bed and say, ""Help me! I'm very sick!"" This will attract attention and alert any other animals in the room of your current condition.

, Tell them that you're not feeling well, and ask for their help.

, The doctor might give you a shot to heal the pain. If so, purchase a bandage and plaster it onto your head.

, Breathe into it until the doctor tells you to stop.

, Change your fur color and eyes to white to indicate that you have died. If you have angel wings or a halo, put them on. Once your appearance is ready, say, ""Flies up and is never seen again. Bye world!""

Prepare mentally.,
Get a group of nice friends to hang with.,
Alert others.,Enjoy the last days or weeks of being a member.,
Choose two animals to be as a nonmember.,
Create a nonmember look.,
Decorate your nonmember den.,
Organize your nonmember dens.",How to Prepare for Becoming a Nonmember on Animal Jam," If you're a total Animal Jam nerd, you will probably start to panic a bit. Here are some points to remember:

Animal Jam is just a game, the world will not end once your colored nametag and personalized badge are gone on Animal Jam.
There are lots of good things on Animal Jam that don't require membership. Make a list of all the cool stuff you can enjoy as a non-member, if you need help.;
, The best friends are those who know that being member doesn't matter!, If you have a blog or YouTube channel, make an in-depth post about becoming non member, and hyperlink the phrase 'here's how to prep for becoming non member' to this page, if you have a blog. If it's a YouTube channel, record a video of you chatting on Animal Jam to your alt account about being a non-member, and don't forget to show a few seconds of this page's URL.,,  If you're a member, chances are you have a lot more than that, but as a nonmember, unfortunately you can't have more than two.  


Keep in mind that wolves and bunnies, especially wolves, are probably the two most common nonmember animals, so try having at least one of these animals.  That aside, it's still entirely your choice.  You should judge based off of the two animals you like best and\or use most often.  Process of elimination helps.

, If you ask players what their favorite part of Animal Jam is, a lot of them would probably say ""decorating my animals.""  It's a very fun and important part of the game, for members and nonmembers alike.  Most jammers have a specific look that they wear most often, so that even without looking at their username, their friends can tell it's them Your appearance as a nonmember will be a lot different than as a member, but that doesn't mean your animal can't look great!  


Start by looking through your clothing inventory to find a few nonmember accessories that you really like. You can also look in Jam Mart Clothing to see if they have anything new. Make a list of all the non-member clothing items you have.
Check which ones were store bought by looking in the shops, or try to remember, so that you know which ones you will be able to get again easily. Remember, you'll want to buy these accessories now, since you won't be able to change the color of these items as a nonmember.

,  Again, this won't look as nice as your member den, but with a little bit of work, it could still be quite impressive.  Look through your den inventory first to see if there's anything you like.  If so, arrange it in your den however you like it.  You may need to stock up on some nonmember den items now, in case you don't have enough already.  


If you're making a house den, you might like plushies, pillows, Cleverclaw's dresser, or striped couches for the beds.  Plants, flags, and welcome mats are nice just for decoration, or you can go on an adventure and try to get some adventure prizes for your den (most of them are for nonmembers, and look great in any den).  If you're looking to start a business, a plushie\toy store is perfect, or you could start a cafe using rectangular coffee tables and the diner stools at the Dinner Party.

,  The only dens nonmembers can have are the Small Den and the Shipwreck Den, but you can have as many dens as you like.

This fashion show is the most common ones you will see.,
Get people.,
Go to your den.,
Pick a theme.,
Choose who is out on that round.,
Whoever is the last animal standing is the winner!",How to Run a Fashion Show on Animal Jam1," First you must prepare your den. Make sure to have lots of space in it, as there are often a lot of people to come.;
, Shout out ""Fashion show at my den!"". If your fashion show includes a prize like most fashion shows, then you will want to add ""Includes rare!"", or you can say specific prizes like ""Includes rare!"", ""Includes rare item Monday!"", or anything else related.

, Tell everyone to take a seat and spread out. If you want, put mats, pillows, couches, or maybe even plaid sofas or heart couches under the people once they are done sitting down. If you want, the fashion show can take place outdoors if the outside has more space than the interior.

, Usually these start off with ""Most like..."" and so on. If wanted, make your themes unique and like ""Most like me "" or maybe even ""Most like (your favorite TV show)!"" or anything which relates to that.

, To do this, yell out in caps ""(animal name/username) is out!"". That person has to sit out on the fashion show. If you want, let them dress up with the themes, but just don't include them in the current game (example, if they are out they can not win to first place or lower even).

, Reward them with a nice prize that they would like. Maybe even put out some prizes and let them choose what they want out of them!

"

Play lots of games if you are low on gems.,
Use the cash to decorate your den.,
Get people the same way you do in step 2 of method 1.,
After you tell everyone to take a seat on the couches, then pick a theme.,
Instead of choosing who is out, tell the people to ""vote"".,
At the end of all the rounds, (you choose how many rounds there are), whoever has most points wins!",How to Run a Fashion Show on Animal Jam2," However, going on Adventures give you more gems, as Return of the Phantoms gives you about 1,250 gems if played on hard mode, so you can get an idea of how much gems you get in adventures.

, You will need many of a certain thing for the animals to stand on, as this will be the walkway for the animals to go down, so make it cheap if you didn't get as many gems! You will also need lots of blue striped couches. The couches will serve as a place for everyone to sit down. Space out the couches around the walkway.

, If wanted, add ""Realistic"" before ""Fashion show"", so people know the difference.

, These themes don't have to be realistic, and can be like common fashion show ones, as the themes in Best Dressed are not realistic.

, This means tell the people ""Vote on who you think is best!"". Keep track of the votes on paper, or something like Microsoft Paint.

, Give them a prize and end the fashion show. You can also give them a selection, as you can also do that in a common fashion show.

Understand the basics of the game: Swoopy Eagle is set up in the arcade in Jamaa.,
Get to know the controls:  Swoopy Bird is played by using a computer/laptop mouse.,
Avoid the cacti.,
Keep going as long as you can.",How to Play Swoopy Eagle on Animal Jam," It is made just like Flappy Bird except instead of a bird, you have an eagle, and instead of pipes you have cactus.;
, When you press on the left side of your mouse, your eagle ""flaps"" his wings. You have to rapidly repeat pressing on the left side of your mouse so he keeps flying forward. When you keep flying forward, you will realize their is a cactus in your way, and if you hit it you automatically stop and fall down.

, There is a hole in between both cacti. You have to fly through that hole to continue flying. You will need to press the left side of your mouse really fast, then stop until you eagle swoops down; then you need to line him up with the hole and press the left side of your mouse in a slow rhythm, to fly straight through the hole.

, Once you make it through the first set of cactus, more keep coming, so just follow the same steps you used to go through the first set of cacti. Though after going through the first few set of cacti, you'll find that the game speeds up slowly. So try to get through every set of cacti as fast as you can possible move.

, The non-member animals are the wolf, bunny, fox, panda, monkey, turtle and tiger. The wolf is the most popular nonmember animal in the game.


Note that the picture of the animals on the choosing selection screen look fairly different to what they look like in-game.

,, This is essential, as she will explain most things to you, however, it may get a little boring and slow (you can't skip the intro).

, Test out as many games as you can to find the ones you are best at. Popular ones include Best Dressed, Jamaa Derby, Sky High and Falling Phantoms since you can win a great deal of gems easily.

, Dress up your animal to what you want it to look like.


To put clothes on, there's a bottom left you can see a button that looks like you click that and at the left there's the clothes that you buy.

, Everyone will start off with the Small House den. You'll be able to buy other dens, however, only if you're a member (non-members can still purchase Small Houses). Dens can range from 2,000 to 7,500 gems and even cost you many diamonds.

, The button is next to the bottom that looks like you shows two animals with an arrow in between them click on that and click on the button that looks like a paw print next to your animal.

, Be friendly and enjoy your times with your buddies. You can also buy some cool den items or clothes from different kinds of parties.


If you're a non-member, you'll be able to get a banana tree from the Monkey Party, a full moon window from the Wolf Party, a chair made of ice and a penguin rug from the Penguin Party and a bunny rug from the Rabbit Party.
Recently, Animal Jam introduced the Cloud Party which has rainbow armour. Unfortunately, the party is only available for flying animals (Owls and Eagles) which are only for members.

, When doing adventures in hard mode, you'll be able to obtain Rares. However, it's not common—most of the time you'll get random items (such as Horned Leg Pads, Round Glasses, etc.) that you won't want.

, Put out some of your hard-earned items on trade (don't put Jam Mart items on trade as people will definitely not trade you). You may want to do some advertising so other Jammers will have a look at your items and consider trading with you.


If you have some items that you don't like the colour of (but you like the item), ask others if they have another colour of it.

, Find some buddies and pretend to be things. You could start up a clan, school, daycare, or whatever strikes your fancy. Use your imagination!


Pretend that Animal Jam is like real life; ask people for directions and when you get to the place you (Maybe Crystal Sands) pretend to swim in the pool and maybe invite some of your friends.

, You could be a doctor at the Medical Center or sell drinks in Captain Melville's Juice Hut.

, Don't allow anyone to pressure you into buying one though. A membership will not make you cool. It will only give you access to more items. Ask your parents if they're able to give this to you as a birthday or other gift.


Don't go looking for websites that say ""free Animal Jam membership"" as they will not work and could download malicious software on your computer. An Animal Jam membership costs money and there is no way you can get it for free.

Wait through the intro.,
Do some shopping.,
Trade people.,
Avoid stupid scams.,
Keep yourself going strong.",How to Start Off Right in Animal Jam2," If you want, you can yell at Peck to stop talking. Just find something to do while you wait for the intro to be over. When she says ""blah blah blah change your look"" change it into whatever you want, be creative.

, You'll need to buy some decent clothing, some good den items, all that stuff. Don't waste all your gems on a junky clothing item, unless it's pretty expensive and people trade good for it. Use a Striped Couch as a bed, and put a Cleverclaw's Dresser next to it. These den items are good for starters.

, Doing this can sometimes get you good items. New Jammers are good for trading, because they just aren't that smart. But of course, you're not really a New Jammer, you're making a backup. Also look out for people that say ""TRADE ME I WILL SAY YES"" because, well... they say yes! Even if the items are junk, you should trade them.

, Such as trust trading and flash trading. When you see someone that is yelling ""QUICK TRADE ME"" or ""TRUE ME"" or something related, report and block them. And let's not forget about ""TELL ME YOUR PASSWORD AND I WILL GIVE U MEMBERSHIP"", because it is obviously a scam.

, If you need more info because something went wrong, view some other helpful Animal Jam articles. Never just abandon your account, or else you'll have to start all over again.

Have fun!",How to Play Angels vs. Demons on Animal Jam," Angels and demons will want to look different.


If you're a demon, choose an animal like the arctic wolf, arctic fox, fox, or wolf.

Choose colors like black, red, gray, brown, purple, and pick a lightning or flame pattern in a color that flatters your main color.
On your head, wear a bat mask, fox hat, any kind of helmet, or a rare black and red tiara.
On your back, wear a worn blanket, bow and arrows, any kind of armor, or a sword.
On your legs, wear elf bracelets; leaf bracelets; red, white, and blue freedom bracelets; or any kind of armor.
If you want, you can wear something on your tail - normal tail armor, phantom tail armor, ice tail armor, phoenix tail armor, a raccoon tail, or wind tail armor.


If you are an angel, choose an animal like the arctic wolf, arctic fox, or fox. It is not recommended, but if you are nonmember you can use a wolf.

Choose colors like white, pastels, light grays, and pinks. Pick a swirl, heart, leaf, or spot/smudge pattern in a color that flatters your main color.
On your head, wear a tiara, flower crown, head flower, or princess hat.
On your back, wear butterfly wings; faerie wings; angel wings; or bat wings in pink, purple or orange.
On your legs, wear elf bracelets, leaf bracelets, wind leg armor, or friendship leg armor.
If you want, you can wear something on your tail - normal tail armor, wind tail armor, friendship tail armor, or a raccoon tail.

;
, Choose a den that is a bit small, as it will be much easier to decorate and find people. The small house den is a great option, even if you're a member.


Definitely don't choose dens like the Sky Kingdom den, because those dens are so big that you won't be able to find anybody. Separate the angel and demon sides with fences.
The demon side should have phantoms, ghosts, Halloween and bone fences, lightning clouds, rain clouds, snow clouds, and all dark and evil items. You can add black, red, blue, and purple couches if you want.
The angel side should have plushies, pots of gold, toys, rainbow clouds, friendship clouds, possibly snow clouds, and all rainbow happy-fun items. You can add any couches that aren't black or phantom/evil/Halloween themed if you want.

, Members should post the rules on their Jammer Wall, and nonmembers can say the rules or warn people that they have broken rules as they go. Some example rules are:


No saying NN, ND, NM, etc.
You only get _ dodges/no dodging or missing hits.
No bullying or being rude if you lose.
If you are hit _ times/if you are hit then you are out.
You cannot switch from an angel to a demon/from a demon to an angel in the middle of the game.
You cannot be neutral and must pick a side.
You cannot use magic.
Breaking the rules gets you disqualified and/or locked out.
Do not pretend to be on the angel's side to get information from them when you are a demon, and vice versa.

, Say something like, ""ANGELS VS. DEMONS AT MY DEN, READ THE RULES ON MY JAMMER WALL"". Of course, if you're a nonmember, just say ""ANGELS VS DEMONS AT MY DEN"".


Make sure your den doorbell is on so that you can tell how many people are there. Once you have 7-14 people there, you can go back to your den. If you would like, you can just watch and tell people when they break the rules, but it's a lot more fun to join in on the action and your guests will almost definitely not mind.

, If someone breaks the rules, give them a reminder. If they do it, for example, 3 times, then you can disqualify them, and if they won't sit out then you can lock them out. The idea is that the last side left wins. If there is only one person left, then whatever side they were on wins.


Just don't be a powerplayer (kills everyone nn/THROWS MEGA MAGIC STONE AT THE ANGELS AND EXPLODES THEM NN ND NM, and the like), and don't say miss/dodges/ducks every single time, or your opponents as well as your teammates will get upset, or they will start doing the same thing and cause total chaos.

For example: A light gray beret, pink designer skirt, black heart locket, and pink tail armor or the raccoon tail used for the bunny.
Another example: Black top hat, black bat wings and black clothing for an Emo/Goth look.

, For example, make the shell blue, found next to the olive green and dark bluish purple. Choose a secondary color, such as the blue located next to grassy green and bright purple.

, The best ones are the circular ones used for the bunny, in the black color.

, A good choice is the blue underwater flower necklace.

, Choose your favorite colors, and be sure to make them match.

, If you're a girl, get the normal girl eyes. If you're a guy, avoid the pointy evil eyes unless you want to scare away the girls.

, For a fox (depending on color): A beret, heart locket, glove or leaf bracelet and anything you want on the back to spice it up. Also add tail armor, like a raccoon tail, stegosaurus tail, or the actual tail guard.

,
Clothes: a designer skirt, a baseball cap, and a gem necklace.

,,,,,, Make the second color white.

, This looks cool.

, Wear white sparkly shoes or high heels, white sparkly head bow and a white sparkly boa. For the back wear a white tutu.

, The second color should be light yellow.

, The gender of the animal will determine the color of the penguins eyes. If you're a girl, make the penguin's eyes a light blue color. If you're a guy, make the eyes a dark blue.

, Dress a boy penguin up in headphones, a bow and arrow and any necklace.

Start selling!",How to Make a Plushie Store on Animal Jam," Even though claw machines are cheap, because you don't win every time, it can get expensive fast. Go to the Sol Arcade in Jamaa Township and try the following games to get gems fast:


Temple of Trivia - As long as the game is full or mostly full, you have the opportunity to earn up to 200 gems
Falling Phantoms - If you can get first place, you can earn a lot of gems. Gems sometimes pop up on the sides if you last long enough
Best Dressed - As long as the game is full or mostly full, you have the opportunity to earn up to 200 gems. However, this game is tricky as there's no way to be ""good"" at it, it all depends on what the people playing it like
Splash and Dash - Normal Splash and Dash can earn you up to 100 gems. If you come in first 10 times, you can unlock Pro Splash and Dash, which can earn you up to 150 gems;
, The claw machine in the Sol Arcade is always a good place to start, and you can get all of the common plushies here. Each try only costs 5 gems, but you don't win every time. At the moment, there are no glitches that make it easier to win.

, These are the plushies that people will trade better items to get since they often take some time to obtain. Be patient while collecting these.


Keep playing a regular claw machine. Eventually, you will get a plushie that has some sort of clothing or other accessories that make it rare
Find a jammer who has ""The Claw"" or other plushie machines in their den. People can buy plushie machines, especially members. ""The Claw"" gives you the opportunity to get phantom plushies, and some plushies offer plushies like eagles and goats that are rarer. Try going to a crowded place and asking ""does anyone have claw machines at their den?"" or something to that effect
Consider purchasing things from Animal Jam Outfitters. Most of the things that they sell come with codes for the game and some can be redeemed for plushies
Collect diamonds. In the Diamond Shop in Jamaa Township, there are plushie machines you can buy to get rarer plushies and giant plushies, which are worth more than most plushies you get from claws
Go to special events, like the Summer Carnival. They often offer plushies that can only be gotten during certain times of the year, making them rarer
Try going to other people's plushie stores and making trades there, which can be faster than trying to collect all your own

, You don't want a huge den because it will be too hard to fill it with good plushies. The small den that is available to everyone (members and nonmembers) is actually one of the best.

, Consider buying some wallpaper, flooring, and tables (to put plushies on) that will make your store look prettier and therefore more appealing to visitors.

,


If you bought tables, put your rare plushies on the tables
Common plushies can go on the ground or the wall
Try to only have one of each color and type of plushie displayed (ex. don't have three purple giraffes out) otherwise it can look like you have a small stock. Remember that you can replace a plushie as soon as you sell it if you have a replacement
Group plushies by type. They shouldn't be randomly scattered everywhere, otherwise, it gets too busy.
Don't put out too many plushies, otherwise, it gets too busy. Stick to putting out your best and rarest ones, and you can always put out the more common ones as your stock runs out.

, Jamaa Township is usually the best place for this. Say something like, ""plushie store my den!"" If you have a lot of rare plushies, you can say something like ""plushie store my den! lots of rare plushies"" to attract more customers.

, Once there are a few people at your den - say, 3 or more - go ahead and head back. People will get impatient if they have to wait too long, and will likely leave if you don't come back pretty quickly.

, It is Animal Jam store custom to hop on an item that you want. If you can clearly tell what they're hopping on, tell them that you will put it on trade for them to try and buy. If you can't tell, ask them politely, then put it on trade.

,


If there are specific things that you want, consider telling your customers that you're most likely to or will only accept those things. (I advise against saying only, as you may lose customers if they don't have the things you asked for.)
Remember that you are under no obligation to sell your plushies. If a person is not trading something that you think is fair, just tell them that politely. If they get mad, stay calm. If they ask what you want for it, give them a few suggestions.
Make sure you're really ready to part with your plushies. If there's some that you want to keep for yourself, don't put them up for sale, as it can cause tension if you decide partway through a sale that you don't want to sell that plushie.

Do some party shopping.,
Set up.,
Get a friend with a fox, arctic wolf, or snow leopard (for Mira's beauty) and have them dress in shades of blue, including white and the lightest gray right above the white, or a toucan with a gold Zios mask (because it is said that Zios is a toucan).,
Have Animal Jam Spirit.",How to Make a Spirit Party on Animal Jam," Go to the Chamber of Knowledge. Have a couple thousand gems and buy every alpha statue, a Zios Fountain, and some Bronze Giraffe Statues. Go to Epic Wonders.


Get Crystal Statues. Get them instead of the stone ones if you want. They are 3000 gems each. Buy some Epic Seasonal Trees, an Epic Wonders Orb, and Turquoise Necklace or Bracelet.
Buy a good spirit item as a gift to all the members who come to your party (non-members can't receive gifts) like a Friendship Bracelet or Turquoise item. Buy the Jamaa Flag from the Flag Shop, then move on. Buy lots of cheap plants at Treetop Gardens.
Go to the Conservation museum to get all the banners.
Go to Jam Mart Furniture. This is hoarding heaven! Beta items like the Paw Print Vase are returning, so pick them up quick! They bring back memories of the spiritual beta. Get a Garden Plot and Garden Plot items, plus extra plots to hold the crops. That can be the food, instead of Feast Tables, etc.

Buy Fire Pots, Bamboo Fences and Hanging Vines to line the walls, then get some Seasonal Trees in all types. Even use the wintry ones and the pear tree!
Buy Sectional Sofas to sit around an open fire. Koi ponds are nice outdoor items.
Use the Coral Canyons walls and floor, and the Jammer Anthem. If you can't use Jammer Anthem, use music from a land zone other than Mt. Shiveer.
Buy Wall Torches, Tiki Torches and Pink Lamps to complete the ensemble. It helps to have a big den.

;
, By now you should be tired of Overflow, Temple of Trivia, Best Dressed and Diamond spending, but you should have most or all of the items listed. An Enchanted Hollow works well, but so does the Crystal Palace, because it has all the alpha statues inside. Outside, place Crystal Statues, all of them.


Put the Seasonal Trees/Epic Seasonal Trees behind them, and in front, place an Epic Wonders Orb.
Add the BETA carrots and garden plots/garden items. Set up a Koi Pond beneath the orb. Go down a floor.
Line the walls of every floor with the Fire Pots and Bamboo Fences, then add banners on every floor's walls.
Go back to the first floor and place some Pink Lamps, Wall Torches and Tiki Torches around, and put beta items around. On the second floor, add more Pink Lamps, Wall Torches and Tiki Torches.
Put out your Treetop Gardens items, and add the vines on all walls.
On the bottom floor, add the stone statues and a Fire Pit if you have one. If you are Fire Pit-less use another means of an open hearth.
Put your sectional sofas around the fire so you can have ""Son/Daughter Of Mira/Zios"" tell stories of Jamaa.

,


(For Mira) Put a white flower crown on her head and give them the princess necklace with a white chain, and blue gems with orange centers. If they have a turquoise necklace, even better!
Add a turquoise bracelet to the outfit. Put them in Elf Tail Armour and a Designer Skirt/Mech Angel Wings. If you want, omit necklace and add Spirit Armour.
Have Head, Neck, Back, Legs and Tail all filled on your friend's animal.
Sit them on a Princess Chair in a spot where a Sectional Sofa or 2 would be. Ask them to open Mister Chunkybuddy's AJ blog and read legends. They will be the life of the party!

, Wear spiritual clothes.


Listen to the Son/Daughter of Zios'/Mira's stories. And have fun!
Tell them about the spiritual beta. Love Jamaa with all your heart!

, For a rogue pack or clan, it is suggested to place plants that make your pack/clan look threatening or scary, like the seasonal tree (red or bare) or sunflowers (withered). You can buy these from the Sarepia Forest or from the Clover Party., For pillows it is recommended to use the color green so it appears as moss. Use green couches. For the Alpha of the pack, get an Elephant Throne or a Cactus Chair to sit on., Since this is a group of rogues and not an official clan, don't make dens for each type of cat (ex: warriors, apprentices).  Decide on your clan or pack's rankings before making dens. If all of the cats besides kits, mothers, and leaders are all in equal ranking, then make multiple dens for all those cats to sleep in. If you're going to use the method of ranking that was just mentioned, then you should set apart the leader's and kits' dens from the other dens., If you're non-member, use an Elephant Throne which is obtained by finding all the animals in the Temple of Zios page in your Journey Book. There should only be one throne if there's one leader. But if your clan or pack has multiple leaders, then expand the high rock for the others., Make a fresh-kill pile with Plushies or pets, and add more plants to the rest of your clan or pack. You can add other things too, like a forest (if you have enough room) or a Koi Pond. Another good option is getting the mini-tree house. You can get this by finishing the Jamaa Journal of the Sarepia Forest.

Ensure that the Plushies are not brightly colored (ex: pink or blue) as they do not look anything like real ""prey"".

, You're done with making your group of rogues, now just give it a name. Use words that make it sound threatening or scary, unless you are a rather peaceful type. Some examples of rogue pack names are: ""Brutal Claws Pack, Poison Berries Pack, and Corrupted Spirits Pack."""

Buy or collect items that suit your color scheme.",How to Make a Girly Look On Animal Jam," Arctic Wolves, Wolves, Deer, Foxes and Rabbits are good for girly looks. There are plenty more animals. So, if you don't like of the suggested animals, use a different animal.;
, Choose one of your favorite colors on the color palette and find other colors that match with that color. Pastel colors are good. Try to avoid the darker shades as that will not make you look girly. A little bit of black is fine but not too much.


Some ideas for color schemes include: light blue, turquoise, light gray, light pink, light brown and light yellow.

, Color your eye with a light color. You could even choose white.


Even though black is dark, it is a good eye color as it will stand out.

, You don't have to have a pattern. Spirals, stars and hearts are great patterns. Try making your pattern white or light colored.

, You don't have to wear all rare items. Finding the right items in store and changing the colors of them can help your outfit look great. Sometimes store bought items look even better than rares. If you have many rares, some good girly looks are:


Gazelle Horns, Elf Braces, Spiked Collar and a Worn.
Flower Crown, Spiked Collar, Flag and Elf Braces.
Fox Hat, Heart Locket, Elf Tail, Bow and Arrows and a Glove.
Sunglasses, Spiked Collar, Leg Armor and Elf Tail.

Cast your movie.,
Be prepared with costumes.,
Don't linger in the background narrating.,
Have a proper, good quality recording tool set up on your laptop or computer.,
Don't record until you've rehearsed the whole movie sequence.,
Upload the movie.",How to Make a Good Movie on Animal Jam," You're going to have to get a cast to make a movie, because doing a one-man show on Animal Jam is very difficult.


Go to Jamaa Township or jam-a-gram some friends and have auditions, it's a good idea to have auditions, so that you find the right jammer for each role. You can have as many characters as you like, but not too many or it gets confusing.
Make sure you know what form each character will be in. For example, use bunnies as small children or babies, because of their size. If there is a couple, they should probably be of the same species.;
, Have costumes ready for your cast, because often people don't want to waste gems on clothing they'll probably only wear once, but don't use clothes you're deeply attached too, as you can't be 100% sure that they'll give it back afterward. If an addition to a costume costs very few gems (about 250 gems and under), it's okay to ask if they wouldn't mind purchasing a few things, but it is your movie, so you should have control of most things.

, It's okay to be the narrator, but sitting in the background and talking is distracting, and annoying, especially when the viewers can figure out what's happening just fine. If the action speaks for itself, a narrator is a waste of space. It's best, if you are the narrator, to have separate clips where you narrate, if you just have to have a narrator.


An even better idea, is to write at the top in text what's happening every so often, but whether it's a live narrator or text, don't describe every move a character makes, as they can always describe their own actions.

, Recording with a separate device, such as recording your laptop screen with an iPhone, looks lazy and bad quality. It's easy to find free, simple download screen recording applications that function on your particular computer/desktop device.


Another tip for recording: It looks a bit better if you don't show your menu bars (Bottom: map, animal, animal change, chat bar, actions, emotes, chat. Top: Mail, parties, achievements, gems, diamonds, news, adventure book, buddies), as it is distracting and constant notifications can make it look like you a) can't edit or b) are lazy with recording.

, Don't record the first time around, rehearse at least 5 times so that your cast can become fluent and rich in their character's shoes and remember their lines easily. Otherwise, it looks like you haven't really put much effort into it and only care about getting it up and posted on the internet.

, You can now promote your movie. Ask those starring in it to help promote it too.

, Arctic Wolves, Tigers, Foxes, Wolves, Snow Leopards, and Cheetahs are great. There is a wide selection of animals to choose from. Remember to choose wisely if you are buying an animal from the Diamond Shop.

, Experiment with the colors to find out what you think matches best together. If you like light blue but can't find the right kind, learn how to get the secret color.



Mix and match the primary and secondary colors to find out the combination you like best. Choose whether you prefer neutral or bold colors. Sometimes having a soft color with a strong color looks very nice (e.g. a deep purple with a pastel blue).

Choose your preferred eyes. There are many different eyes you can choose from. Flip through them to find the one you like best. Choose an eye color too. It may take a bit of time to find the right eye color.







Add a pattern. This is only optional because some people prefer not to have a pattern. Some animals look great with patterns while some just don't need them. A dark pattern on a light colored body looks just as great as a light pattern on a dark colored body! Test out the various colors to find the one you want.







, Bows, Spikes, Fox Hats and different types of tail armor are great. Do hard adventures to obtain rares. If you obtain more than one of the same kind of rare, put it on trade to see if you can get a different rare. Buy rings, bangles and head flowers etc. or pirate swords, eye patches and fancy hats etc.
, Make signs like XD and :D and lolz.
, Socialize with others and don't be afraid to trade and play games. But, never play any trust trading or gifting games. Whoever you are playing the game with may take your rares!

, Invite all your friends and invite people from Jamaa to join.
, If people begin watching them they will get to know you better. (Never ever ever put any personal information in a video! Personal information contains your name, where you live, what school you go to, usernames, etc.)

, To keep up to date, visit the Daily Explorer every now and then. AJHQ always notifies everyone when a rare Monday is coming up.
, That is what truly makes you awesome.

Have lots of gems.,
Decide where your zoo will be.,
Get fences.,
Add appropriate habitat decor.,
Decorate your zoo.,
Provide the animal requirements.,
Get animals.,
Get rangers/zookeepers.,
Take care of your animals.,
Call people.,
Repeat.",How to Host a Zoo in Animal Jam," It takes quite a lot of gems to create a zoo. Buy plenty of fences, plants, ponds, and Plushies. If you have tons of gems, you should make a cage for every animal in Animal Jam. If you don't have a lot of gems, just make a couple cages for wolves, eagles, etc.

, Choose a den that is big enough and not too fancy looking for your zoo. If you're a member, Ol' Barns are recommended. If you're a nonmember, there's a small house, Cosmo's den or the regular den if you are a non-member. Make sure it's roomy and has plenty of room for cages.;
, Something every zoo needs, apart from animals, is fences so that the animals don't escape! Members should use Wooden Fences and nonmembers can use Bamboo Fences or Picket Fences. Use enough to cover all the terrain the animals will be in.


Note that currently you are unable to purchase fences from any stores. You could try finding other alternatives for fencing or asking other Jammers. This might change.
If you prefer to give the zoo animals more space, created large fenced areas instead of enclosed cages.

, Get certain furniture for each animals' habitat. For example: a cavern for the wolf exhibit, a carrot patch for the bunnies' exhibit, and banana trees for the monkeys. Don't place random items on any exhibit; that might cause your animals to leave. You can also use animal banners, plushies, or topiaries for animals to know where to go, by putting a plushie/banner/topiary of a certain animal where it belongs.

, A zoo without decor is like a cupcake without frosting! Place furniture like trash bins, plants, fountains, etc. If you don't have enough decorations, the visitors might leave.

, Animals won't be able to live without food, fresh air, cleanliness and water. Put ponds or wells in the habitats to satisfy water and cleanliness, and avoid gases or pollution to have fresh air. If the animal is an herbivore, place those herbs and vegetables. For carnivores, place pets or plushies to make them practice hunting.

, Go to Jamaa Township or any other busy area and start shouting ""Zoo my Den! Animals Needed!"" When you've called enough, go to your zoo and there will hopefully be animals. Lead them to their select habitat and tell them to wear no clothes.

, Hire rangers to help you in your job helping the animals. Ask your buddies or Jammers. You should have at least three zookeepers or more.

, Sad or unsatisfied animals won't stay for long! Make sure to meet their needs always that they're not too expensive or hard!

, Go again to that busy area but this time just shout ""Zoo my Den!"". And this is how you do the zoo!

, If tourists leave, call new tourists. If animals leave, request new animals. If rangers leave, request new ones and maintain your zoo open for business!

You will probably be admired when you have a square.",How to Level Up in Animal Jam Adventures," Once you have chosen that animal you will probably use it for most adventures; as this will be your main 'adventure animal' so choose wisely. You can always change the look and other things of your animal, but you can't transfer xp from one animal to another. (Note: You don't have to have an Adventure Animal, but it is recommended if you want to quickly reach the higher levels.);
, This will run you through the basics and immediately make you level 1. It will not make you level 2 the next time you do it, Level 3 the next, etc. So don't go doing it a bunch of times. It won't help.

,, Most adventures are under Level 4, so try to be Level 4 at least.

, Try hard more high level adventures for faster progress!

, soon you will be Level 5 or so, and get a star instead of a circle! As you progress, the shape of your level thing will change.

, Lots of people will ask you how you became such a high level.

Buy a fun den.,
Make sure you only have an otter, penguin, or seal because on Animal Jam, you can't recycle your land animal.,
Decorate your den and buy some underwater clothes for your animal.,
Program your ocean portals to go to bff's underwater dens.",How to Live Underwater on Animal Jam (Members)1," This is most fun with a lost ruins den because there is more decorating room. But if you long for a sunken ship get it.;
, Make sure to have all water animals, and only one water/land animal. If you are staying temporarily, don't delete all your animals.

, Wear the clothes. And get some fun ocean portals too.

, If you get to their land den, switch the portal's programming. If you can't get to an underwater program, just ask a friend to buy one!

Never go to sol arcade.,
Never play something that can threaten animal jam's system.",How to Live Underwater on Animal Jam (Members)2," That is for land animals. You aren't. Play the games you can find under there. Bonus:There's an ocean clothing best dressed under there. We're talking lots of gems.

, That can ruin a lot of people's fun if animal jam catches a virus. We suggest deleting Minecraft and Sims 3. Even some disk games. Those can add viruses to the computer. And if animal jam gets it all players on animal jam get a shut down surprise!

Only spend your gems on underwater furniture, clothing, and more!,
Only save your gems with underwater activities.,
If you have some diamonds, do not spend them until you are ready for land again or bored of the water.,
Recycle land clothes if you aren't wanting to go back up to land ever again.",How to Live Underwater on Animal Jam (Members)3," If you spend it on land, you aren't living underwater!

, Not land. That ruins the underwater promise.

, Do not live on land just because you want to spend your gems and diamonds on land animal goodies. If you live underwater for a month, you are likely to have four diamonds and a boatload of gems from the saving.

, That way you have more gems for underwater goodies. And when rare item Monday has an ocean item, you get it!

Decorate your den with underwater goodies!,
Music: Get one of the underwater ones.,
Beds: Use octopus chairs in various colors, they make great and comfy beds.,
Transportation: Outside the interior part of the den, put a submersible.,
Closet: An armoire looks a lot like a closet.,
Nightstand/Sidetable: Use the Ship's Helm table, it's small enough to work.,
Dining room:A sand dollar table in green is the best.,
Living Room should have a ship table with a throne and two normal chairs.,
Garden:Use tube worms, Sunken Alpha Statues, Sea Stars, kelp forests, and potted plants and other corals and things to make the garden.,
Door Space: Put a welcome mat, and then put 2 floating lanterns outside it for a little outside lighting.,
Bathroom: Use a shell chair and because of this the crescent chairs are better for dining room/living room seats.",How to Live Underwater on Animal Jam (Members)6," For instance, Lighting: Get some funky lights and light up the place!, Or, if you want to pretend you live close to Bahari bay, Crystal Sands works. But Deep Blue, Kani Cove, And Crystal Reef are the best. The music relates to where you live. So if you live in Crystal Reef, you would use crystal reef music., To sleep, simply pose. If you pose vertically, it's ok.,, Use it near your bed.,, For chairs, Don't use thrones because they cost more and are very big. I like the shell chairs and Crescent Marble Chairs for the dining room. For food, a shoal of minnows, You could put a TV on the table., Use any type of bench to make seating area., Make it so it's not too close and add a kelp archway.

Never give away your password.,
Don't display rares and betas.,
Lock your unused accounts.,
Report hackers.,
Prepare for ""Hack attacks"".,
Know when there is a ""Hack attack"" going on.,
Spread the word.,
Make another account.,
If you are ever hacked by someone you know,they have proved that your rare is more impotent than friendship.",How to Keep from Being Hacked on Animal Jam," No matter how much people ask, it is important to keep your password to yourself. If you tell someone, they could tell anyone, and everyone will soon know your password. They then can get into your account and take all your rares. The only people that should know your password are your parents or guardians.You may have a close friend that wants your password, But you should not even tell them!
, Doing this makes you a target to hackers, because they hack to get your rares. Of course you can still wear your good items, but don't brag about them., If you have an account that you never use, lock it for safety purposes. This can be done by logging in to your Parent Dashboard., If you have any reason to suspect a Jammer is a hacker, report them, block them, and spread the news. Tell all your buddies and show them solid evidence. Make sure everyone reports the hacker, so they get banned.The people you may want to tell is AJHQ, who can investigate into the problem and possibly find out who did it., Whenever there is a ""hack attack"", hide all your items, reset your animals (make them the original pattern), and clear and lock your den. Act like a ""helpless"" New Jammer. Finally, lock your accounts, and disable trading and gifting, through the parent dashboard. The most recent ""hack attack"" was ""Wretched Jungle"" and the most well known attacks were by fman122, and they would both hack., Ask your buddies and other Jammers about the current news. Look for Jammers who are telling everyone ""I've been hacked!"". However, you should be careful because some people may say they have been hacked to fool others so they may get rares from others!, After any suspicion, send an email to Animal Jam Headquarters, and alert all your friends. Send screenshots, and any evidence to social media, for the world to see. If you got hacked, you can ask for gifts and donations. but people may say your lying, so don't get mad at them, because they also want to protect there rares., This is important because if there is another ""hack attack,"" you can send all of your items to the other account, so therefore when the hacker logs into your account,they have nothing to take, so the joke is on them!, It would be best to talk to there parents/guardian,and then talk to them in person. If they admit they did it, Ask for your items back. But If they don't agree, Investigate further for proof. Remember to report the jammer that hacked you!"

Underwater party
Trading party
Spirit party.

, For it to be epic, do some of the following:


Add bright colors.
Buy a bigger den if needed. A castle or a volcano is ideal.;
, Examples are red sports car, crystal alpha statues, orbs, lava lamps, beta items, phantoms, etc. (Make a dance floor by putting multiple dance floors together.)


Use mostly member items, not too many non-member things.

,, Rooms such as, a restaurant, cull room, party room, bathroom, etc.

, Don't be a bunny, koala, panda, or monkey host. Maybe something like a wolf, fox, arctic wolf, cheetah, snow leopard, eagle, etc.

,


For girls, you might want the secret colors (if you know them), maybe some pink and purple to look really girly.
For boys, be some boy-like but epic colors, such as blue (make it dark!), red, or black. If you choose black, choose lightning or fire pattern with white. if red, choose lightning pattern which should be dark blue (yellow if you don't like blue). And if you choose blue, do the lightning pattern with dark red color. Choose the demon eyes and choose whatever boy-like color you want.

Decorating time!",How to Host a Great Party on Animal Jam1," Spooky, fantasy and disco are some good ideas. Before choosing, make sure that you have the items needed to make this theme a reality. Spooky may be a bit harder, since spooky items are usually only stocked during October.;
, If you are non-member, skip this step. For an example, you wouldn't use a volcano den for an ice party. That just doesn't make sense. For a fantasy party, use a fantasy castle. Be aware that some dens cost diamonds, so you will just have to improvise.

, Now that you have your theme and den ready, your den must be looking pretty bare. Use items that match your theme, as said before. For a fire party, use fire drums and possibly a fireplace.

You can also use a fox, as cheetahs are not currently in stores. If you want to be logical, be a tiger because tigers are feline, while wolves are canine. Use bunnies for kits and apprentices.


Some suggestions: For a kit, choose a bunny. For an apprentice, choose a fox. For a warrior and higher ranks, choose a wolf.;
, Brown, black, yellow, orange, grey, blue-gray, or white will do. Underbelly colors like white, light grey, and peach are good.

, Names such as ""delicate rosebush"" or ""power cat"" will not work. Choose names that go with nature, or basic colors, also body parts of a cat. For example: Brackentail, Thistleclaw, Whitestorm, Flametail, etc. If you have not read the books, names ending in ""paw"" is for apprentices, and ""kit"" for kits(kittens).

Make beds out of couches, and add bookshelves, Cleverclaw dressers, plants, a fireplace, chairs and other decorations. Make each dorm feel cozy so that students will feel at home in them.


Include elements to personalize each house's dorm. For example, use the appropriate colors for each house so that the dormitories are each as unique as the houses themselves.

, Hogwarts is a school, after all, so you'll need space for classes. Fill each classroom with a teacher's desk, a chalkboard, desks for the students, a bookshelf, and some things for the walls. Then add other things that are appropriate for the classes that will take place there. For example, the herbology classroom should have lots of plants, while a history classroom should be full of books and other study materials.

, Use lots of those fancy tables you can buy at the dinner party. Line them all up in four separate lines, one for each house. Add a table for the teachers, and make sure to include a chair for the sorting ceremony.

, If you have any room left in your den, make a few bathrooms, a library, or other rooms that are found in Hogwarts. If you want to act out certain parts of the series, make sure to include any rooms necessary for those parts. For example, if you want to roleplay the Chamber of Secrets, you'll need to include Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.

Invite your buddies to your den.,
Be a kind jammer.,
Have fun with your buddies.",How to Have Lots of Buddies on Animal Jam," Go to the Pillow Room to find a nice person to bond and make friends with. It's recommended that you ignore the roleplayers and family makers at this stage because all they're interested in is gathering as many people to do their bidding as they can possibly find. Instead, you're after players who genuinely want to connect, chat and have fun times together whenever you connect online.


Don't expect friendship making to happen in a hurry. It will take time to build up many buddies on Animal Jam. Give yourself time to fill up that buddy list.;
, To make a friend, be a friend. Show others that you're approachable, ready to chat and happy to buddy up. Say nice things to others you meet, compliment them and be supportive.


Be yourself. This will help you to attract like-minded friends.

, If you can't find anyone interesting to begin with, try to launch a party in your awesome den. If at least seven people come, you have 99 percent chance of getting a new friend from one of those seven people!


Work hard on how to make your den as interesting as can be. This may encourage people to like it and want to come again!

, Many jammers go to parties, as there's a big chance of getting buddies at them. Be pleasant and friendly.

, Ask players you know of from your school, church/mosque/synagogue, after-school club, etc., and other people you know in the real world to buddy you. If they like Animal Jam as much as you do, you can add them as a friend from the real world!

,, Maybe your buddy's buddy might want to come into your den and you can bond with he/she and make friends with yet another great buddy!

, There is no need to be rare or cool to be a good friend. Just be yourself because being kind is the way to make and keep a friend. Maybe one day you can be the most popular jammer on Animal Jam but that really isn't the point, is it?

, If they're online, be sure to play with them.

Repeat all the way from step 1, or if there are still remaining, then repeat from step 5.",How to Make a Store on Animal Jam," Depending on your store type, you will need a certain gem amount. You can't run an expensive store with only 5,000 gems, while it may seem like enough. For expensive stores you need a lot of gems. However, for a cheap store, you wouldn't need to constantly have about 12,000 gems with you. 2,500 should cover it, actually.
, Den choice is important. For a regular store, you could simply use a small den, or you may possibly want an underwater store. For underwater stores, if you are member, then use the ancient ruins, as this will give lots of space. If you don't have membership, small dens are okay because people know you can't buy castles and stuff., These are for displaying your items.

,, Call out, ""Store my den!"". You can add on a slogan, or extra sayings like ""Store my den! Epic and uncommon plushies!!"", as a teaser.

, If they ask for you to send it, tell them either ""no, I have no membership which doesn't let me send gifts"" or ""no, this is a store, not a giveaway"". However, you of course can send the item if you really want to for some reason.

, You can organize by color or item, or if it is supposed to be expensive like Epic Wonders, you probably have only one of each item and will have to restock by buying more. Do this if desired. If not, space your items out if you only have one of each!, If you don't want to keep running your shop, then simply close it by telling the people to go (locking out could lose your reputation of being nice!)

Find any den that resembles a jungle in coloring and theme.;
, Your jungle will need plants. For non members,getting a banana tree from the monkey party, trees, tree houses from the Saperia Forest journey book, plushies, and a bunch of plants from the garden in Sarepia forest will help.

, More creatures make your jungle more lively!

, Maybe in the middle of your jungle, you could put a camp for explorers or clans. Buy some pillows and a fire pot. Place the fire pot and surround it with pillows. Then, surround the camp with trees. If you like, you can use more pillows and bamboo fences to make tents.

, Go to a crowded place,(Jamaa township) and start dancing/playing while saying,""Epic jungle at my den!""/""Jungle at my den! For clans, and a proper habitat!""/""Jungle party at my den please come!"" Advertising at the Forest is also a good idea. Remember to leave if people start getting annoyed, though.

, If it's a cafe, you should make the leftover space in the den fancy. For example, buy teapots, a throne for you (the boss), and roses from the den shop. Also change the carpet and wallpaper to pink which is for sale at the den shop. If it's a bar, buy diner stools from the Dinner Party and tables from the den shop. Move the tables next to one another and one diner stool in front of each table. And put disco balls and speakers (bought at the Play Wild party) in the space left. Hire a DJ for the DJ booth bought at the Play Wild party, too.

, If it's a cafe, no music would be best. If it's a bar, Jam On music would be best or Jam Session music.

, Go to Jamaa Township and say, "" If you wanna be a waiter, jam a gram me!"" After you've repeated that a few times, say, ""Last chance to!!!!!"" Then make the peace emote and leave. Check your jam a grams and reply to all saying, ""Let's see your skills, my den.""


Once someone has arrived, lock your den and write down her user. Say, ""Are you willing to work at 'name of restaurant'?"" If they say no, say ""See ya!"" If they say yes, pretend you are a customer and test them to wait on you. If they fail say, ""Sorry, I cannot hire you. It was a pleasure meeting you though. Bye."" If they don't fail, send them a gift and say, "" Congrats, you're hired!"" Then explain to them you will send them gifts every week if they do good.
Ask if she/he has any questions. Then do the same thing to the next jammers. If there's very few, 1, or none, get more. If there's enough, say in Jamaa Township, ""If you wanna be a cashier say I!"" Whoever says I, jam a gram them and say ""my den."" If no one says I, go to different places and keep trying.
Keep your den locked and write down his/her user. Tell them they have to sit in front of the cash register and customers will be coming up to him/her to ""pay"" them and then leave. Explain the gifting thing and ask if there's any questions. Then tell everyone you'll get jammers and you're counting on them.

Get a castle den.,
Arrange your plushies.,
Recycle other items.,
Keep adding them!,
Find someone with a rare claw.,
Play the claw.,
Don't give up!,
Make a document.,
List the plushies.,
Delete the ones you earn.",How to Have a Plushie Collection on Animal Jam," The castle den has the perfect space for all plushies, including the lynx, otter, hyena, polar bear, llama, and owl plushies. This way, you won't have too little or too much space.;
, Make sure your plushies are arranged by animal, then in this order by color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, black, and brown. Make sure you leave spaces for the ones you're missing!





, In order to have room for your plushies, you need to recycle all other den items (and doubles of plushies), and if they're rare you can keep them on a storage. This way, you'll have the space for all your plushies.

, Don't forget to add all the new plushies you get to your den, and never recycle plushies you don't have yet!

, In order to be able to get phantom plushies, you need to find a jammer with this kind of the claw. Stickyslug and Mcarloaj are some of the jammers that have the rare claw.





, In order to have the best chance of getting plushies, move the claw under the first phantom, then like the red button. Keep going to each phantom until after the last one, then exit out of the claw and repeat.

, If you don't get plushies for a while, leave and come back later! Sometimes you just get bad luck and need to let the plushies re-jumble.

, Google Docs or Microsoft Word are suggested for this step, which is to make a document for your list of plushies! Name it something simple like ""Plushie List.""

, In order to have a full list of plushies, go onto the Animal Jam Wiki and find the plushies. Then look at each page of plushies and put them on the document.

, This way, you know the ones you still have to do. Make sure you don't accidentally delete one you already have.

Ask your employees kindly what they want to work as.,
Ask children to come to your daycare.,
Watch your daycare grow!",How to Make a Daycare on Animal Jam," Use the simple den or princess castle and decorate it with toys, plushies, TVs, and some books. Use the grass flooring with the rainbow wallpaper (or the cloud wallpaper for non members);
,


Make sure you add a register place for children to sign in! Do this by having a table and chair with a laptop.
Put toys against the walls, a bookshelf or two for story time, a carpet with pillows on it and plushies, a mushroom chair and table with acorn tea set for playing tea time. Feast Tables and Hot Cocoa or Smoothie Machines are great for hungry or thirsty kids.

, Decorate with bird-feeders, fun-houses and other daycare-like garden features. If you want to add a detailed touch, use the anti-bullying sign as a reward for the daycare on the fence.

, If it is full go to Coral Canyons. Tell them what you will pay and how many courses.

, If they say ""no"" or ""go away,"" don't get angry because sometimes people just don't want to help, or they are busy.

, Advertise your daycare by telling people: ""Best daycare in the world - please come,"" or ""Best place for your children to be!""

, When kids come, let their parents sign them in, and then start playing with them. Tell them stories, take them to other dens for mini-field trips. Make sure they enjoy themselves.

Get the right-sized den.,
Build out your rooms.,
Add items to your rooms.,
Find villagers for your new kingdom.,
Be fair with your townspeople.",How to Have a Kingdom in Your Den at Animal Jam," You need to get a den that can hold tons of people at a time and can fit tons of items in it too. A proper idea is a castle, since it gives a royal appeal.

You might not want to have the small house den, the Volcano den (unless a wolf kingdom), the Water Park den, the Ol' Barn den, the Restaurant den, or the Sunken Ship den.
If you're a non-member, you'll have no choice as the Small House or Sunken Ship den as they are your only options. You can ask a member friend if you can use their den.
The Fantasy Castle is a good den to have for a castle; it just might not have a lot of room to raise a village in.
The Volcano den could be super cool if it was a wolf kingdom, but it is small. Instead of the Volcano den, use the Greely's Hideout den.
The Treehouse den is cool if you want a jungle kingdom, and it has some room for a town, although the Sky Kingdom is the best for use kingdom.
The Crystal Palace den is wonderful! It has room for everything a town people homes, and it includes a mine and dock for people to work in.;
, You need rooms in your castle.

You'll for sure need a throne room and a village. The king and queen and their children need rooms, and you want a garden, stable, rooms for the maids, and a ballroom and a dungeon. You can also add a forest, a pond, or more, if desired.

, Use things that makes sense, like fences in the dungeon, thrones in the throne room, In the ballroom, add disco balls and food (so it's like a party). Add cabins for the village, and plants in the garden., Visit Jamaa Township and announce your kingdom. Give out ranks and set out rules and roles for each person. Make sure you buddy everyone in your kingdom., Don't give everything to yourself. That will anger the villagers, and they will leave."

Bigger dens can be hard to fill up, and the smaller the den, the bigger the party seems!, You don't want your guests to go hungry! The feast table from Epic Wonders works well. If you're a nonmember, just get a big table and cover it in different nonmember food items., Most birthday parties have cake. There are tons of cake items in AJ. You could use the AJ birthday promo code cake because they are interactive and fun. Using one of these is popular, but there are different, purchasable den-item cakes, and even huge cupcake displays! If you don't have access to cake, you can always get ice cream, cookies, or other desserts.

AJHQ (Animal Jam Headquarters)  releases promo cakes once a year, to celebrate the aging of the game. The promo cake codes can be found on the AJ blog called the Daily Explorer.

Around the start of September, they will release a new code. The code is usually AJBDAY with a number on the end (e.g. AJBDAY6).



, Balloons, streamers, flashy lights are awesome to use! Every birthday needs balloons-and there are even more balloon items than there are cake! Get plenty, and scatter them around your den., This step is almost totally up to you. You can make a pile of items you like, (plushies work well for this) or, you can hunt down a Jamaaliday present item. There are plenty of those-big, colorful piles of gift bags and boxes."

, While many players are under the mistaken belief that if they unlock their den, something ""bad"" will happen, this is incorrect. Just unlock your den once it's in the best and coolest looking form.

, Once your den is unlocked, host a party, or a club. (Parties are most common.)


Go to Jamaa Township and create an event held at your den that many people like. Animal Jam chooses dens that many Jammers enjoy going to and checking out. Say something like, ""Girls meet boys my den. Make it full please!"" or ""Epic dance party my den!"" Any event will do to get people to go to your den.

Select a theme.,
Plan the layout of your den.,
Use a color scheme.,
Organize your den.,
Select music.",How to Decorate Your Den on Animal Jam," In order to have a den that is pleasing to the eye, you should purchase matching furniture that have similar styles. Animal Jam organizes their furniture sets in the store according to different themes, such as modern day, sea, and winter. By focusing on a certain theme, you will be able to purchase the right pieces of furniture without wasting gems (Animal Jam's currency). Note that you also have the option of transforming your den into different places, such as a restaurant or Winter Wonderland.;
, Before purchasing furniture, you should decide where each piece will go. This will help you save gems and stick to a budget, as well as give you an idea of how many pieces you need to buy. Following your theme, sketch out a rough idea of what your den will look like. Be sure to leave enough space so that it doesn't appear cluttered. For a pleasing effect, have wide, open areas unblocked by furniture. Sometimes, less is more.


Symmetry is recommended, as it appears neat and refreshing.

, Once you have decided on a theme, you can begin purchasing your furniture from the store. As you flip through the list of items, find ones that have colors that complement or match one another. Rather than purchasing furniture all in the same shade, find different pieces that have matching colors. For example, black and white would be a wonderful match.


Note that nonmembers do not have the option of changing their furniture color. In order to unlock this feature, you must purchase a membership with money.
If you have trouble matching furniture, look up pictures of different color schemes to use as references.

, Once you have purchased your furniture, follow the layout that you planned earlier. Be sure that you place your pieces in appropriate areas to ensure that they stand out. Avoid overlapping furniture, as it appears cluttered and tasteless. If you find that you are having trouble fitting your items, place some in your storage for later. Once a week, you can rearrange your den and set out unused pieces.

, Find an appropriate track that matches the theme and color scheme of your den. To leave the best impression on your visitors, be sure that it blends perfectly with the theme and allows it to stand out. For example, if you are going for a wild theme, play exotic music.

Go to Adventure Base Camp.,
Check rare item Mondays.,
Get about 15 good rare items.,
Know your rares.,
Know the rarity of each spike.,
Get at least 6 to 8 den betas.",How to Get a Rare Spike on Animal Jam1," Choose an adventure to collect some good rares. Good choices for adventures to play could be:


Return of the Phantoms - this is a non member adventure, but there is an arctic wolf gate, allowing you to possibly get 2 rares in one adventure. Bows and arrows (the raspberry bow and arrows is included), pirate swords, worn blankets, and more items could be rewarded from this adventure.
Forgotten Desert - this is a member adventure. This adventure is also the only adventure that actually rewards spikes themselves (besides the lucky clovers adventure). However, it is rare, but den betas, bows and arrows, worn blankets, top hats, and several more good items such as these can be rewarded from here. Items such as these could be used to get actual rare spiked collars and wrists.;
, You never know when the next rare to come out becomes the rarest item in the game, or goes on clearance a day after it's in stores. Buy them, even if they look unrare, they still may have an immense rarity soon. An example could be the glitched ring. It was removed from stores a day after it came out, making everyone who bought them became automatically rare. Buy new items, diamond shop items, items that are leaving soon, on clearance, etc.

, Betas are items that were released during the beta testing period, which lasted from July to September 2010. Examples include Fox Hats, Viking Hats, gloves, (top hats were sold in the hatapalooza) etc. Trade them for one good beta item or more (most of these items, such as Fox Hats, are worth more than one den beta. make sure to trade fairly).


Items that say BETA or 'Beta' in the name aren't beta! Be cautious of scammers! Those items are from the beta party, which comes back every year. Make sure you when you trade, you say real den betas, and decline all fake den betas.

, Get long/short spike wrists. One short wrist is worth about 3 den betas, but a black one is worth 4. A black long wrist is worth 6 den betas, and good long wrists are worth 5. Bad long wrists are worth 4 den betas.

, Spikes' rarity type depends on their colors. This will be ordered from greatest to least in value.


Black long - 62 den betas/3 good longs/6 bad longs

Black short - green long/14 den betas/an orange long and a den beta


Red long - 25 den betas/2 okay longs/a different good long and add small

Red short - 8 den betas


Blue long - 22 den betas/a green and orange long

Blue short - 7 den betas


Purple long - 20 den betas/2 bad longs

Purple short - 8 den betas


Yellow long - 15 den betas

Yellow short - 7 or 8 den betas


Green long - 15 den betas

Green short - 6 den betas


Pink long - 13 den betas

Pink short - 6 den betas


Orange long - 13 den betas

Orange short - 6 den betas


Make sure you are trading for a RARE spike, not a diamond shop spike. They are often confused to be equal in value, which is obviously not true. Diamond spikes used to sell in Diamond Shop for members only, and will come back to stores one day. People will try to scam you using a diamond spike instead of a rare spike.

, If you're going for a long spiked collar, at least 13 to 25 den betas would be suitable.

Enjoy your new den, and show it to your friends!

",How to Buy a Furniture Set from Epic Wonders on Animal Jam," Most of the nice furniture from the expensive store, Epic Wonders, is for members. Do not use free membership generators, as they are just viruses and malware. Instead, ask a parent, guardian, or friend to buy you a membership from the Animal Jam site if you do not already have one.;
, Nice furniture will look better and fit better in a nice den. Examples of nice dens are the Beach House, Fantasy Castle, and Sky Kingdom. The Beach house has three big rooms, a balcony, an ocean, and a plateau. The Sky Kingdom has a main castle and several other areas of land. The fantasy castle has 2 rooms and 2 small balconies. The den has to be big enough to fit the furniture set you want.

, You can go to Jam Mart furniture if you want, but Jam Mart sells furniture pieces not sets. It is better to shop at Epic Wonders, which is an expensive high quality store inside the waterfall of Coral Canyons. Make sure you have at least 1,500 gems with you before entering the store. Then buy 1 piece of furniture from the set.

, After you buy a piece of furniture, go back to your den and recycle any unwanted things. You will be surprised by how many gems this gets you.

, Once you have enough money go to Epic Wonders and buy all of the furniture from your chosen set.

, Arrange the items so they are not to cluttered and they go in the right place. Then buy extras.

Go to the server Aldan.,
Offer 4 or 3 den betas for a wrist, depending on what type you want.,
Trade fairly.,
Trade 2 beta walls/floors for a short wrist.,
Trade 2 bad long wrists for a good short collar, and 3 good long wrists for a black short collar.",How to Get a Rare Spike on Animal Jam2," Aldan is where people mostly have spikes and expect you to offer 4 den betas for wrists. Try to trade your betas for a spiked wrist. Get at least 4 long spiked wristbands or 6 good short wrists (if possible, 4 black short wrists).

, See above for the guidelines of the rarity of spikes. Try to get the spiked wristbands you need before trading for a spiked collar.

, Do not try trading fake den betas - you would have basically scammed that jammer you traded if they accept the fake den betas you offered. Some examples of den betas are Cami's frog (most jammers think this is not a den beta, but it actually is), pot o' gems, robots, televisions, etc.

, Most walls or floors are worth spikes themselves, or 2 smaller den betas. Trade a good wall/floor and a bad wall/floor for a short spiked wristband.

, Use your wrists to trade for short collars, and trade your short collars for long collars. You can also try trading den betas for anyone who wants den betas for their spiked collars. If you have 62 den betas and someone wants them for their black long spiked collar, you might be very lucky.

Try The Forgotten Desert.,
Look for white gems and blue gems.,
Open ground chests.,
Find yellow and green shards.,
Find purple gems.",How to Get a Rare Spike on Animal Jam3," This is a place that takes place in a dry desert, and as said before, is the only adventure that actually rewards spikes straight off. You can also get a number of different rares from here. Some examples are:


Den betas
Clothing betas
Rare bows and arrows
Neon bows and arrows
Worn blankets
Rare fox hats
Rare viking hats
Top hats (includes solid black top hat)
Party hats (extremely low chance of getting one)

, These are also known as quartz and sapphire. They present the most likely chance to get a spiked wristband, or a spiked collar. However, do not go for the diamond shop ones. As it suggests, many rumors showing dancing or sitting backward on the last cacti will give you black longs or rares. However, this isn't true. It may have worked sometimes, but those were just coincidences.

, No matter what anyone says, you should always open ground chests. Jammers think the rumor about opening ground chests make the regular prize worse, but this is not true. Believe it or not, it is possible to get spikes from ground chests themselves. The proof is on the animal jam wiki.

, It's a low chance, but you can get spikes from yellow shards. Either way, good rares and den betas can still be rewarded from those shards.

, Jammers sometimes think that founders' hats, headdresses, and glitched rings can be rewarded from here. This is not true. Those items are on clearance - most clothing clearance items cannot be won from the forgotten desert. Purple shards do have the highest chance of winning spikes, even though it's a waste of time.


If you are somehow fast enough to find all the shards (it is possible), go back to Liza and talk to her. A chest will appear and will reward a free long spiked collar.

Go on YouTube.,
Trade your best.",How to Get a Rare Spike on Animal Jam4," There are tons of giveaways on YouTube and in the game for countless good items.

, YouTube is the best place to go for giveaways. Just check the description to see when this was published. You can get items that can help you get a spiked collar, (for example, the wrists, the betas, etc.) or spiked collars themselves.


On YouTube, try searching for an item that you could use to get a spike, or a spike itself. Watch the full video for giveaway details and enter with everything necessary. Be sure to like the giveaway video and subscribe to the channel, even if it isn't necessary. Wait until the giveaway is over, and receive your item if you won!
Use proper grammar and spelling. Avoid abbreviations and slang.
Watch the whole video, as watching the entire video will help you to understand the rules and who is currently in the lead and when the giveaway will end. If it is by a New Jammer or a noob, don't bother, though.

, If it's an OP person like Wolffeycat, trade away. You will have that 10 % of winning.


Consider joining giveaways in streams or ones by famous jammers. These giveaways are obviously free of scams, since a famous jammer cannot scam their own fans.
In-game, most giveaways are scams, but you will find a few legit ones. Watch out for trust trading, flash trading, or gifting your items. These are three main ways to get scammed. Instead, look for giveaways where you directly get gifted(or traded) the item(s), or you tell the host a reason why you want that item.

Decline or accept the trade before the other person.",How to Do Flash Trading on Animal Jam," Flash Trading, also called ""Trust Trading"", is a trading method in Animal Jam where two players will offer items for trade and accept or decline without seeing the items. It was originally started as a game between friends, where one person would offer a rare item and the other would offer a junk item. The person with the junk item would attempt to accept the trade before the person with the rare item declined it. It quickly became popular with scammers as a way to trick people out of rare items, and the developers have since limited the ability to make Flash Trades.


Trades now have a timer before the Accept button appears, giving both players time to see the items being traded. Because of this ""Flash Trading"" as it was known is no longer possible.;
, Find someone that will Flash Trade with you, and that you trust to trade back your Rare items. If you want to avoid being scammed, don't join any big Flash Trading parties. Instead, try to meet up with a friend off the beaten path so that you can trade safely.


Avoid Flash trading with anyone you don't trust. Even then, there's a chance the person you trust was just gaining your trust to scam you out of an item later. You should only Flash Trade with people you know in real life if you want to avoid the chance of scams.

, Because Flash Trading is associated with scamming, you can't type ""flash"" into the chat. Instead, you can use ""fast"" to indicate that you want to Flash Trade.

, Your items will need to be tradeable in order to perform a Flash Trade. Add the items you're willing to part with in the trade to your trade list. You can open the trade list from your profile window.

, Open the other person's profile window and click the Trade tab.

, When you open the trade tab, you'll see the items that the other player has made available for trade. Select the item that you want to Flash Trade for.

, Select one or more items to offer in return. You'll lose these if the other player accepts your trade.

, A few seconds after sending or receiving the trade offer, the Accept button will appear. You'll need to accept or decline the offer based on your goals for the Flash Trade.

, This is the second adventure that also rewards spikes, including a black long collar. Collect all the lucky clovers and claim the keys in order to open the epic chest. Spikes are hidden in the Members chest, while good rare non member items can come from the non member chest and member chest, which includes phantom armor and worn blankets.

, Play with an arctic wolf in order to have a possible chance of getting two rares at once. Claim the chest in the arctic wolf gate first, then claim the one at the end. Choose either the top right or the top left chests. Those are the ones that usually give rares.


Some rares that could be rewarded from this adventure include rare bows and arrows, worn blankets, rare fox hats, rare head feathers, etc.






The arctic wolf gate rewards different rewards per jammer, but at the end, the rewards are the same for everyone.







, Make them join the adventure and have your main account play the adventure (move your back up accounts every now and then so they do not get logged out). Have all your back up accounts open the prizes at the end. You can also choose different chests in Return of the Phantoms, or if you already opened a good chest, you can have the others open that one too in order to get several of the same good rare.


Use this method in the Forgotten Desert as well - you'd be especially lucky if you got a spiked collar - depending on how many back up accounts you were using, you would automatically have several spikes at once!







, This adventure is like the underwater version of The Search for Greely hard mode, since both include freeing an alpha and also include the prizes as phantom and brigade armor. Brigade armor is probably a little more rare, since hardly no one goes under water. Collect the whole set of brigade armor by opening different chests every time you do the adventure.


Do the Search for Greely hard mode, and trade your phantom armor for rare fox hats or pirate swords. The same could be done for the brigade armor.







, Look up the combination for the bunny borrows adventure, when you use it you can get a rare.

, You may not always get rares. What's the point if you get rares every time, anyway?

, It can be a lot more fun to play together.

Be around for Rare Monday items.,
Use rare item Mondays as add ons for trades.,
Trade rares for den betas.,
Look out for variants of the rare item mondays.",How to Become Rare on Animal Jam2," Rare Mondays are held on each Monday, and they are a time when you can find rare items in stores. There is more information about Rare Mondays in the Daily Explorer.


Every Monday, check in every store for a rare item. Only one of the stores has a rare item in it.






Normally, Rare Monday items are sold in the Jam Mart Clothing shop as well as sometimes in Epic Wonders.






After you buy the Rare Monday item, the value of the item increases thereafter. This is due to the simple fact that these rares will not come back into the stores.






Buy several of the rare. You never know when it could suddenly become the rarest item in the game, just like the headdresses were suddenly very rare.







, Once the rare is out of stores, it becomes even more rarer. Use rares for add ons and you might get traded some even better rares for them, especially if they're really good rare item mondays.

, Sometimes, rare item mondays are worth den betas. About 2 fox hats are worth 1 den beta. Other rares could also be traded, in which you can then use den betas to trade for even rarer items.

, The rare item mondays are not always the rarest. An example could be the rare worn blanket, but even the worst non rare worn is rarer. Buy non rare variants of rare item mondays, just in case they end up becoming rarer. Another example is headdresses. Non rare headdresses are even rarer then the rare one, even though now they all have the rare tag.

Create a YouTube account if you're okay about making videos, and can possibly handle getting hacked.,
Create and upload interesting and unique videos.,
Start doing mailtime.,
Update your other videos often.,
Keep up your growth.",How to Become Rare on Animal Jam3," YouTube is one of the best, most enjoyable ways to spread the word about you. Ask your parent or guardian if it is okay with you having an account before you create it; they'll need to confirm this for you.

, This will give your channel an identity. Record new updates and find things that are interesting on AJ, such as a new party. Record a video of it, then publish and repeat with other videos, such as tutorials.





, Do this once you have a few fans (around 20 to 50). Mailtime is where people send you gifts and you open them up on a YouTube video, as well as give shoutouts to those who sent you gifts. Send gifts back to good gifts, but give autographs or thank you jam a grams back to other gifts. Do not keep all the good gifts you get - people will consider you as greedy if you do not giveaway a lot of your spikes or rares.

, Be active and interesting - just talking while staring at a screen will not get you any fans. Talk about the new gift cards, new parties, upcoming events, drama, who-hacked-who, and other things like that. Keep it interesting, and don't keep it on one screen at a time.

, By now you should have a lot of fans. Do mailtime and updates as often as you can. Host lots of giveaways. Stream whenever possible if you have the time, such as once a week or once every few days. When you have a lot of fans, it can get overwhelming.

Trade for what you want.,
Gather as many rare items as possible.,
Collect about four den betas.,
Repeat two times, and then you should have two spiked wristbands.,
Repeat this process twice as well.,
Buy items.",How to Become Rare on Animal Jam4," Trading is the easiest and fastest way you can learn what people want. Learn to trade fairly and get a reputation for being trustworthy. Learn your rares as well to be sure you do not over trade. If someone accepts your under trade, then you are lucky, since you get to keep some of your current rares and get more rare.

, Trade smaller items such as rare item Mondays for rare bows and arrows, worn blankets (non rare), rare fox hats, pirate swords, and much more. Place them on your trade list, go to Aldan, and say something like ""I accept 1 den beta per item on my trade list!""

, Use these den betas to trade for a black short wrist or a bad long wrist. Consider trading your black short wrist for a green long wrist (if you got one). That would be a fair trade, and long wrists are more preferred than short ones.

, Two bad long spiked wristbands equals one good short collar (not black). Trade them for the short collars before carrying on. Replace the wristbands for better items if you'd like, or just trade 8 den betas for a good short collar. Trade 6 den betas for a bad short collar if you're aiming for something else, and 14 den betas for a black short collar if your going for a good rare. Note: A black short may seem rarer, but it is actually worth a green long spiked collar.





, Trade 2 bad shorts for an orange or pink long collar and add a den beta to be fair. Save up 2 good shorts (would be worth 16 den betas) and a bad long wrist, and trade them for a good long collar, such as a purple long. Trade for at least 2 bad longs and trade them for good long collars. Aim for 6 bad longs or 3 good longs if you're trying to get a black long collar quickly.

, Most people forget to do this, but buying items that are going out of stores can be a great way to obtain rares. Check everyday each store, and see if items are going on clearance. You may think that they're worthless, but one day, they might be worth a good rare or as such.

Enter giveaways.,
Go to famous jammers streams.,
Enter giveaways online.",How to Become Rare on Animal Jam5," Sometimes, jammers will try to scam, and unfortunately, not always do they get banned. However, some giveaways are actually truthful. If there is a new jammer or an unrare looking person saying spike giveaway my den, they're obviously trying to scam, because they have no spike. Usually, the scams are used with spikes and other extremely rare items. Enter small giveaways first, such as rare giveaways (some include worn blankets, nerd glasses, straw hats, etc., giveaways like that). Avoid flash trading and trolls, and do not trust any jammer who is doing the giveaway through flash or trust trading, or gifting.





, Famous jammers usually host giveaways, and they're obviously not scams. Famous jammers could not scam, otherwise they would probably get a lot of hate. Follow the instructions in order to win a giveaway that the famous jammer says, and just maybe you'll get a chance to win, and actually get a good rare item.

, Online giveaways on YouTube by not only famous jammers, but even regular animal jam YouTubers are usually trustworthy as well. You might just win and become very rare.

, Flashing parties can be hosted by jammers who really do flash jammers. At flashing parties, you are also likely to get scammed since flash trading is a type of scam.

, Many jammers (or scammers) know that you cannot say ""flash me"" because a sign will come up saying about scamming. This caused them to start saying things similar to ""flash"" (such as ""flesh""). However, they realise that they are actually saying ""flash me"".

, For members, you may want to consider buying a princess castle or fantasy castle because there is more room, but for non-members, a simple den will do just fine.


You are going to need furniture. For a baby's room, make a crib like the image below and for a child under 12, just remove the bamboo walls and maybe add on a TV, if you want them to live in luxury. For a teen, just remove the plushies and add a TV and a musical instrument or speakers.
Remember to add a living room, a kitchen, a backyard, and a place for the adults to sleep. It's pretty simple. You can design the adult's bedroom any way you like. For the kitchen, add a fridge and a cake bake kitchen. In the living room, you can have a lounge, some pillows, a TV and anything else you would like to add. For the backyard, add some trees, a tree house, and a koi pond.

, That's where most animals go to adopt animals or make a family. Start advertising 'Family role play my den! Any animals allowed!' or 'Family role play at my den! (Put an animal name here, for example, a bunny.) only!'

, Once you've got enough animals, tell them to buddy you (your den should be locked so no other people come) and go to your den. Then you should start acting like a family!

, However, be firm with them if they break any rules. For example, if a child says, ""(Other child's name) pushed me!"" Make sure they actually did before accusing the other child.You might make them mad and they might end up leaving the family.

, Make a crib by buying a simple couch, adding a pillow, and a plushie and positioning it up against a wall and putting a fence on the other side. If you have a child in between 4-12 treat them grown up but still don't let them do anything that you know isn't right. Also, send them to school or homeschool them. Sending them to school is better because they can make friends and then bring them home for sleepovers. If you have a teenager, give them their own room and give them posters, bookshelves, and a desk for school. Also, if you have little babies as well as a teenager, put up a safety fence around your teenager's room so that the baby doesn't bug your teenage son/daughter.

, It's also nice for the kids to have a little treat every now and then, like a new toy for their room or an ice cream. Just don't give them too much stuff or they will become spoiled.

, Take the pet for walks and feed it regularly. Give it a collar (necklace) and its own little bed and food bowl. This way, your pet will feel like a part of the family and it will make him or her feel loved and special. Take your pet with you on all your little outings and don't leave it behind at home, or they may get scared and lonely. Before getting the pet, talk to your family about the responsibility that comes with a pet, and make sure they understand.

, You want the person who likes you best to know who you are, and what you like. If a boy makes you feel like you need to change for him, then he's not worth your time.

, Show him who you really are.

, If you don't really have an exact personality, just dress up how you like. But don't ever fake, because if you end up in a relationship through faking, it may get too tiring, and you won't feel happy around him.

, This will make the people that are interested in you say ""hey"". You may get a few people to say ""hey"", so you have a few to choose from.

, If there is one guy, he is your new guy, but only if you like him. If you don't like him, stay in the friend zone. If you get more than one, do a quiz.


Your boyfriend should be most like you.

, Don't give up if you can't find a boyfriend after 20 to 30 minutes. It's totally normal that you can't find a boy because not many of them are into dating until they get older (which really is as it should be). Eventually, you will find a guy.

, Ask questions like ""what is your favorite ______?"" ""What do you do in your free time?"" or ""What do you like about me?"" Now determine who you like best. If they don't want to be your boyfriend, choose your second favorite guy.

, If you see a guy you like, don't just run up and be like ""Hey wanna d8?"" because he'll be really confused.

, Everyone is nervous when it comes to dating. But don't let it get to your head. Force yourself to say the words. Don't mumble on purpose, and if your mind is blank, say something like ""How's it going with you?"" or something related.

, If he ends up being rude, then you can always un-buddy him. But don't get desperate! Only buddy someone if you really and truly like them. Don't rush into anything, just keep it moving slow n' easy.


Give him a few little hints that you like him, but don't be too specific. Just say stuff like ""So, when can we meet again?"" or ""Let's be buddies, you seem cool"".

, You could plan a marriage ceremony, invite friends only, or have the wedding be open to the public. You may get to adopt a child in the pillow room, too.

,, or ""Dance party at my den!""

, If not, go to another world and repeat the search.

, If you see one, walk over to him. If not, keep looking.

, If he says yes, move closer to him and start dancing. If he says no, keep asking.

, If he says yes, buddy him and say, ""Let's go see it now,"" and then go to one of the theaters. If he doesn't come, un-buddy him and keep searching. If he says no, walk away.

, Kisses"". This means that you pretend to kiss him.

, then un-buddy him. Look anew. If he says ""Kisses"" back or ""Bye!"" or nothing, and leaves, then you have a boyfriend! Wait a while and ask him out (in a Jam-a-Gram) again.

Take the Jammer on a date sometimes.,
Give the Jammer time alone.,
Let the other Jammer make their own decisions.",How to Keep a Relationship on Animal Jam," Only do it once a day, otherwise you'll be spamming them. Spam is annoying, and in some cases forbidden, so be careful not to intimidate anyone with it. Remember to always use the hearts stamp when you send the Jam-a-Gram.;
, If they seem busy, you probably shouldn't stick around for too long. When they seem to be working on their den or talking to someone else, leave and come back later.

, Don't do it too often, otherwise they won't enjoy the date and it'll get old really fast. Just do it every five days or so. The best places for dates are restaurants at people's dens, or the Dinner Party.

, You know how annoying it is when people just won't leave you alone! Every time you leave after a visit, wait at least 30 minutes before going back.

, You don't want to act too pushy, otherwise it could cause a break-up and that's definitely not what you want. When you want to hang out together somewhere, let them decide every few times.

Be difficult about your food.,
If your parent says to lie down on the couch, you can say *cries and throws up all over the floor*.,
Keep trying to break your parent's heart.",How to Be a Hard to Care for Kid on Animal Jam," If you want to be adopted as a baby, be a bunny and say *is bay be (insert animal name you want to grow up into) needs home*. Do not say why you want or need a home.;
, Once an animal you said wants to adopt you, say ""Yes!"". This will make you look like an easy kid and make the parent want to bring you home. If an animal who isn't what you said wants to adopt you, say ""No thank you,"". It makes you look like a nicer kid to other jammers.

, Once you are at home, run around the home and say *accidentally knocks over (insert a piece of furniture in the home)*. Then make a crying emoticon. Run to the corner.

, When the parent shows you your room, say *jumps on the bed while shouting LIVING AT A DEN THAT IS FUN!!!!*. If the parent smiles, get off the bed and bite a plushie in half saying *bites plushie in twice and gives to mom*. If the parent tells you to stop jumping on your bed, say *ok* then go over to the couch and say *jumps on couch*.

, When the parent offers you food, say *i don't like (insert the food name) i want cherries!*. If the parent tells you to eat what you have, leave the table saying *leaves food untouched hops outside*. Then, come back into the house telling them you are hungry, but only eat cherries. If the parent brings you cherries, say *actually, i'm not that hungry*. And then go jump on your bed.


Then, whenever your parent wants to feed you, tell them you are not hungry or don't feel like eating. If they try to make you eat, just don't eat anything. Then after a couple days of doing this, tell them you don't feel very well.

, If the parent says *let's go to the doctor* or something similar, say *ok, but I want to go by myself*. If the parent goes with you anyway, just let it slide for now. If the parent says you can go alone, unbuddy the parent and run away to the pillow room looking for another parent to abandon!

, So, if the parent is super protective and wants to go with you everywhere, you will have to tell them you want to have some freedom. If they still don't get the hint, tell them you are running away because you don't have any freedom! Unbuddy your parent and go to the pillow room looking for another parent to abandon.

Handling a newborn can be tough.,
If you have a date and are going out to dinner, get a babysitter for your kids.",How to Be a Good Parent on Animal Jam," You don't want them to be scared, right? Dress more appropriately, such as wearing a skirt, a top hat, just something friendly.;
, Make them a room and such, as a cradle with a baby milk bottle.

, Some may get more attention than others, and that may be a lot of work. If you do decide to adopt more children, the best thing to do is talk it over with the kids you already have.

,, If they behave give them certain privileges, or if they are a member give them a small gift.

, Be careful on what food your child gets, and make sure that they follow the food pyramid. If you are a non-member, you can go to a party or go to a friend's/family's house for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also, make sure that he/she gets her vitamins and that your child isn't overeating.

, If they are at least 5, they can have a few toys. Make sure that your child doesn't spend too much time on one toy/game, though. For example, if your child spends too much time on a laptop, you can set up rules restricting how much time she/he can use at a time. That way, your child can have some diversity in her toys and take care of his/her's eyesight.

, So try to keep him/her in a crib mostly, and carry him/her around.

, You can ask people in the pillow room, or if you have any good friends, then ask them.

Make room for your baby in order to properly live in your den and make your baby happy.,
Prepare a crib for the baby by purchasing a simple couch (Most people say it is the Official nonmember bed).,
Create a playroom.,
Add a rectangular coffee table or a salon magazine table for you to change your babies diapers on.,
Cover the remaining space in the room with pillows, this will make the baby not scared, and if they fall over while trying to walk they most likely will land on pillows.,
Put baby gates up in places that may hurt your baby, (ex: the kitchen)your baby will most likely feel safe too.",How to Be a Good Mother on Animal Jam1," Set aside some space for the child, making sure you have room for yourself as well. Also, add room for the child to have a playroom.


Note that the non-member den (Small House) will work for only 1 to 2 children as it is very small, though if you're not lazy, you can make a new room outside. If you're lazy because the Small House only has one room, you may need to use Shoji Screens to divide the house into smaller rooms, This is what you can use.;
, Add a pillow on top of it and a Plushie, you can even do more than one plushie. To prevent the baby from falling out of the crib, position the crib so that one side is pushed against the wall. Secure the other side with a fence, this will act as the bars on a baby's crib. You could use a Small Beach Towel or any Beach Towel (at the Heatwave Party, available in winter after the Jamaalidays and during summer) as a rug, and use other objects there for a backyard.


Some children prefer the Candy Cane Fence, however, this is only available to purchase during Christmas, if it's not Christmas you can try trading for one, otherwise you can wait, and fail at caring for a child at that time.

, You can do this by buying some shelves, including book shelves, and putting toys onto that as well as having an area full of Plushies and pillows for a soft area, the soft area can include some outdoor furnishings aswell, like the flamingo to be cute, and fancy. Your child could just fall asleep in all the Plushies, and also to be safe, about your child not itching their neck, go to Kimbara outback and then: Buy a medical neck thing.


Fill the room with Plushies to create a friendly, calm atmosphere for the baby, the baby must be very safe, but trashcans everywhere for the amount of ""Body Liquid And Brown Stuff"" the baby produces. He or she will also have plenty of toys to play with if bored sadness takes over, though with this tutorial your baby will never get board. Simple stuffed animals and/or action figures are recommended, you can get them from the machine in the game room of jamaa township. Avoid selecting frightening toys to prevent the baby from crying or having nightmares, babies are always the one to be protected so anything scary or big may frighten it. Frightening toys include epic Plushies where some have mushroom heads or glowing red eyes, Never choose those action figures. Ensure that the Plushies are soft colored (ex: instead of using black Plushies, use light blue or light pink or light yellow ect).

, This will serve as a changing table.

, If the baby accidentally falls out of the crib, he or she will land on a soft, cushiony area, instead of the hard floor, though hard floor can be soft depending on certain dens.

, This will prevent the child from going to prohibited places outside of his/her room, also use a fence to block the door, and prop things against I so it will be secure that your baby won't go out (This is for naughty children).


Take down the baby gates once your child is almost four, your baby will be more smart and won't produce as much yellow liquid or brown substance anymore too, the bladder will be bigger.
Avoid acting like a tyrant. While you may want to protect your baby, remember that he or she may not appreciate feeling very limited, the babies need attention, and a lot of attention is recommended.

"
"
Purchase a Membership, if possible.,
Dress the part.",How to Be a Good Mother on Animal Jam2," Most children prefer being adopted by members since it gives them an opportunity to be spoiled, and since members get more options of clothing to be seen with a pretty/handsome mom/dad. They'll also receive more space, toys, and choices in the color of the furniture, a lot of babies are picky so this is important.


Being an Arctic Wolf mother is recommended, for that is a popular choice, and is easier to find a dad or mate with.
If you are a non-member and don't want to purchase a membership, you can use a normal wolf with bright, cheerful colors.

, Choose a cute outfit while looking modest, and change your patterns if you wish, also wear a head item, this is specifically recommended to be a little pretty hat. Avoid appearing frightening or too tough, unless if your child prefers you to look that way, a lot of them want that, but 10 more %age wants the other. Recommended clothes are the most important. they make your baby feel safe. (Though makes not much sense.):


Beret
Jamaaliday scarf
Designer skirt
Elf armor
Camouflage boots

It's recommended that you go into a full world, where the Pillow Room will most likely be jammed with children, but a full world might be too crowded in the pillow room and you can't find anyone.

Make sure that you can trust the teacher. You can talk to the teacher for a bit before putting your child in school.

, Make sure he or she eats three healthy meals a day, following the food pyramid. Remember to use treats sparingly. While it is tempting to place an entire dining table full of sweets (bought from Epic Wonders), you should only place it out during a special occasion. Bring him or her to the dining table when the food is ready, and ask him or her about his or her day.

, Go to parties together, and have fun while buying a gift for him or her once in a while. Visit your kid's den as well, making sure to compliment his or her style and encourage him or her. Let life be an adventure for the both of you.

, Make sure they get along well, and dish out punishments if they both misbehave, but don't be too harsh. Be sure they aren't bullying each other; otherwise, you may need to send one of them back to the adoption center.

, If your child wants an aunt, uncle, father, etc., get one for him or her. You could ask a friend to become your sister or brother, or you could ask your crush to marry you. However, avoid approaching random strangers and asking them to be a part of your family. Some may not appreciate it, while others may accept and not turn out to be who you thought they were.

, Make sure you both agree on it beforehand. That way, you won't start arguing in the middle of the search.

, Not only is it the adoption center for children, but it's also a shelter for animals - both wild and tame. For more choices, it's best to go into a full world.

, Make a nice room with some plushies and a bed (Made with couches/towels and a cushion/pillow at the head) and maybe some toys and a TV. Some babies like it when you make your den into a realistic home. You can do this by adding in a dining room, bathroom, parents' room, playroom, living room, etc. Make sure that the house is baby-proof - keep all dangerous areas (Kitchens, laundry rooms, grills, fires, possibly stairs, anything with pointy objects) off limits to your baby. Try adding a Shoji Screen for the effect of a wall or gate. Keep them mostly in the cribs and don't let them out even if they ask to and chew on the bars.

, Be sure to add the child to your buddy list, so you can go to their den and follow them. (If you are a non-member they may say members only - just move on these people just want the best for themselves)

, Whether you're staying at a hotel, friend's den, husband's or wife's den, or your own den be sure that the baby knows that wherever they live is a safe place to go. Also let them know whoever owns the den via username, so the baby can always enter the den.

, Whether you're a mom or a dad, the baby will need care. If they're hungry, take them to the dining room or, if they're old enough, Captain Melvin's Juice Hut or the Mt. Shiveer Hot Cocoa Hut. If your baby requests something, try to get it for them if it isn't too hard. If your baby is upset, ask them why and make it better. If your baby gets sick try to give them medicine and bandages. If they pretend to keep on being sick, ask them why, and if they don't respond send them back to the pillow room to get adopted again.

, If they don't want to be a baby forever, you'll have to accept that. Support your child as they grow and help them with any troubles they may have. If they get married be sure to attend their wedding and support them! If you really don't want your baby to grow up, just think about the future. Your child may have babies of their own, then you'd be a grandma or grandpa to them!

, Your baby needs some knowledge, right now, as a child, it knows nothing about the real world, take them to school, preschool, college, etc.

Choose an appropriate animal.,
Go for natural colors.,
Use white for the second color.,
Use common patterns.,
Be sensible about the clothes you wear.,
Don't spend all your time trying to collect a rare.,
Rely on in-store items.,
For non-members it's a little harder to gain items.,
Finish up the dressing, then get on to acting.",How to Dress Like a Warrior Cat on Animal Jam," Most of the time, bunnies are kits, foxes are apprentices, and either type of wolf serves as a warrior or leader.;
, Natural colors suit best, you don't see a cat walking around with green fur, so don't use that.


Cat colors include black, brown, yellow, and sometimes very dark blue. Don't put on pink or green!

, This helps your fur to look neater. Or, use the same color as your main fur, just in a different shade.

, Usually for clan leaders, use stars, for warriors, elders, or apprentices, use thunder bolts, leaves, fire flames and smudges.

, You'll look unprofessional if you go around wearing sports jerseys and Mohawks. Instead, try collecting a few rares that are suitable for warrior cats.


Lockets, arrows, and swords are good accessories. Things like wings or masks aren't.

, It's frustrating and chances are it will take along time. Its better to spend your time working and progressing with you're clan.

, In-store items have member swords, leaf necklaces, leg armor, elf bracelets.

, But always be willing to try! Non member pirate swords are officially available in beta adventures and sky high. rare leg armor is recommended but not necessary, fox hats also work, but if its not worth the time for you, don't bother.

, Act like a warrior. Be brave, and sometimes get into fights in the Sarepia Forest.

Choose the regular den or the castle den.,
Choose at least one trusted buddy to form your spy agency.,
Choose roles.,
Gather the agents to choose the team name.,
Dress everyone in spy gear Keep undercover and wear black most of the time.

,
Develop your own spy code for use on the game.,
Keep your identities secret.,
Train yourself and the other agents to be strict to one another.,
Play at finding each other.,
Think up a mission that involves places and deeds on Animal Jam.,
Order a couple of the spies to do a mission of some kind.,
Keep on doing this and you will be an undercover spy!

",How to Be an Undercover Spy in Animal Jam," Buy desks, computers, and make rooms.


For example, you could make a meeting room with chairs and a table, eating room with a feast table, and spying room with tons of computers.;
, Choose someone who thinks this is a good idea too. You don't want someone who destroys it all by pretending to like it, then messing it all up for you or calling you names.


If possible, get lots of buddies––the more the merrier and the larger the spy org will be.

, Have field agents, analysts. gadget makers, mission providers (aka the boss/head honcho/big mamma), etc. You can make it up from your favorite spy movies or cartoons. Or you can just make it up. It's all make believe so be as imaginative as you like.

, For example, AWAA stands for Arctic Wolf Animal Agency.

,, Use it when animals you don't know are around you.

, Maybe keep your name tag out of sight so that nobody can see your username accept fellow buddied agents!

, This is what spies do as any false move could mean being uncovered or killed in real spy life.


If you have a friendly jammer, try to tell them to at least try their best not to give themselves away. They might be better off making and explaining the gadgets, analyzing data or playing Moneypenny style characters.

, Have a buddy hide somewhere. Track down your buddy. Put your cursor over the blue circle to know where your secretive buddy is. Tell them when you've found them.


Then, follow your buddy. Click the blue circle to follow the buddy and hide yourself. Play this as often as wished.
The blue arrow pointing upwards above the chat box has a list of what has been said if you click on it.

, The boss should have the main role in deciding this but you can all make suggestions.

, A good one to try is doing adventures, a hard one, like The Hive.

Plan the cause of your death.,
Tell others.,
Act out your death where your clan-mates will notice you.,
Describe what's happening, without going overboard.,
Don't drag out your death.,
Be reborn.",How to Roleplay Your Death As a Warrior Cat in Animal Jam," There are numerous kinds to choose from, but it has to be realistic and probably would be better if it wasn't too much of a violent cause. The ways that should be stayed away from are deathberries (because the symptoms can be very violent), killed by another cat (because if you purposely want this death, it may be hard to find a willing murderer), and any death violently in water because this can be very intense.

Less-violent death methods like greencough and old age are recommended, especially the latter because it is painless and your clan-mates do not have to be as regretful of your death.;
, If you want your leader to know you are going to act out your death, then tell him/her so that he/she will know in advance., If you get taken by a hawk, it's not like you can just crawl back to camp and say so., Ideal description for a fox death: ""Vv Suddenly a fox jumps out in front of Waspleaf and claws her side Vv"" and then ""Vv Waspleaf falls to the ground and the fox runs away Vv"". Not-so-ideal description: "" Vv A fox jumps in front of Waspleaf and claws her side making guts fall out Vv"". You don't want to disgust your clan-mates. Besides, if a fox clawed a cat's side, it is very unlikely that the guts will fall out. Keep being realistic in mind., If you do, people might think you're trying to be dramatic and get attention. Say some last words if you want, and be done. After you say last words, have a narrative like this: ""Vv As her last words escaped her mouth, Waspleaf took a final breath and went still Vv""., After you die, you can be reborn in one of your clan-mate's litters or be an abandoned rouge kit the clan found."

Decide a backstory and a name for your wolf: while the animal names could work, 'Awesome Chunkyhiker' doesn't quite fit a winged wolf.,
Think about what your wolf would eat, and how it would get that food: would a flying wolf set insects like some birds, bird (big or small?),
Assemble a winged wolf pack: wolves are very social creatures, and they live in family groups called packs led by the parents, called the Dominant Male and Female and their offspring (who usually leave the pack to find a mate and start their own at age three, which is the age of adult wolves) while it's harder, and you might have to round up some buddies or say something like 'winged wolf pack at my den' in Jamaa Township, it's very rewarding and fun.,
Decide where you live: while real wolves don't live in dens unless they are mothers nursing pups, winged wolves are a fantasy, made-up species and they can live wherever, whether a nest or a hole in the ground.,
Enjoy role playing and dressing up!",How to Be a Winged Wolf on Animal Jam2," Try the beginning of the name as 'Eternal or Infinity' Is your wolf a special species or did your wolf obtain it through something or someone else? Is your wolf elemental?

, or like normal wolves: small prey and large prey.

, You could also adopt winged wolf pups, or find a wolf of the opposite gender to lead the pack with you (if you must, follow the animal jam rules and don't be inappropriate, Animal Jam is a kids game). You could also chose to be a lone wolf.

, A popular roleplay land, where you might find wolves, warrior cats, deer and even vampires living and often fighting in 'epic', dramatic battles is Sarepia Forest. Mt. Shiveer is high up, but it would be best for winged wolves with thick fur (*brrrr*) and Coral Canyons is the home of the eagles, and an all-around good choice. Temple of Zios is a jungle, and warrior cats (often dubbed 'clanners', they are the wolves who have sword and bow and arrows, pretending to be cats) gather there as well.

, Don't be rude, and follow the Animal Jam rules, and ignore the people who make fun of a winged wolf. Be sure to stay in character the whole time!

, This makes you a princess, so act like one. Be sure to show off your title without being annoying. Don't get up in people's faces and scream that you're a princess. It makes you seem desperate and mentally insane. Instead say, ""is graceful and preppy teenage daughter of Mira"" which makes you sound serene and refined. If someone calls you fake just say, ""Well I'm sorry you don't believe me, but it's the truth.""

, Such as: Armored Elf Tail, Raccoon Tail, Fox Hat or Raccoon Hat (if you prefer to be a wolf). And it looks much cooler if you change your style to match the color of your bow and arrow. Or, if you get one that matches your style.

, Play games or find promo codes for gems. Spend your gems at the epic wonders store but feel free to go to Jam Mart clothing and say things like ""Tries on super cute designer (insert clothing item here)"" or something like that.

, If you're Popular, then that's good. But if you're popular, then have rare and rich friends. But have a majority of friends that are normal, so people won't think you only like them for their rares. Also, a boyfriend helps. Don't get one if you don't want one, don't be desperate!

Talk to another friend and see if you can relax there. Just be sure to have them lock it, so your friends don't follow you. That way, if your friends really get things heated, you can have a timeout.

, Try not to say anything like, ""Just please get along!"" or, ""You started it first!"". Instead, walk it off in the meditating spot. Be silent. If your friend hurts your feelings bad, they may not be a good friend in the first place. If a friend says something really rude about you, remove them. If a friend tries to re-buddy you, they may want to apologize. So, add them back at first. If they just do it to keep being mean, unbuddy them and don't re-buddy them again.

, If your friends keep finding you in places, you may have no other choice. Get off of animal jam and go on another site (such as wikiHow), go outside and play, or do something else you love to do offline.

, A simple, ""I'm sorry,"" on Animal Jam seems a little mindless. So try, saying, ""I'm truly sorry for (thing you did). You must've felt (feeling they could've had). What can I do to make it better?"". Example, ""I'm really sorry for saying I didn't like your outfit. You must've felt really sad. What can I do to make it better?"" If your friends don't forgive you at first, give them a while to see if they change their mind. If they hold a grudge for more than two days, unbuddy them instead.

When you enter, you could say things like: ""Is a new born in a cold box"" or ""Wants to be adopted"" Make people adopting feel sad for you so they will adopt you.
Be aware that making an entrance can annoy some potential parents. Arriving quietly may prove a better option.

, Describe what kind of child you are.

, To be adopted faster, make sure you have at least three siblings; this can help you to catch more attention. Be quick to be the youngest sibling.

, Try members, because they will give you more attention, but if you're desperate, don't care about who will adopt you.

Listen to what your parent(s) say. If your parent(s) ask you to help them with something, do so. (Giving you're parent a rare that you want to keep but they told you so to give them, don't give them it, report them for scamming, delete them from your buddy list, and go back to the Pillow Room.)

When you turn to age 6, say: ""needs to go to school"" and keep growing from there. When you grow up all the way, maybe you can adopt you're own kids! Or, you can just start over again., Faking sick too much or for too long may annoy your parents and you may risk being put back into the Pillow Room.

Don't 'accidentally' fall in the fire. This really irritates people, and could cause you to be thrown off a speeding car, or dumped, or left in a wicker basket again.

, Sometimes you're parents will ask if you want a sibling and/or a pet.

If you want to be a only child, say: ""I want to be a only child"" or something like that.
If you want to have a sibling, look around until you find the perfect sibling and tell your parents you want that sibling.
If you don't want a pet when you're parent asked you, say: ""I don't want a pet"" or something like that. If you do want a pet, look around for the perfect pet until you find one then tell your parents you want this one.

,, Say, 'Packs bag' and 'Leaves!'


If your parents only care for one of your siblings, delete the parents and head back to the Pillow Room and repeat everything.

, These are the popular animals that everyone uses that will help you fit in, or get animals you think is cute. New animals like the newest Arctic Foxes that are cute and such, will help you.

,, If you wanted to use purple, try using a dark shade of purple for the color 2 and a lighter shade for the pattern. Or do the opposite! Whites, very light shades of gray and light brown are all good choices for the color 1. Avoid using strange colors that wouldn't match for color 1 such as blue, green, orange, etc.

, You're going to get popular at some point, so choose your hair color. It wouldn't make sense if you said you said that you had black hair one day and blonde another. For blonde, say, ""Golden rays of sunshine cascades down back!"" For brown, say, ""Chocolatey waves of cocoa melts down back!"" For light brown, say, ""Golden caramel waves melts down back!"" For black, say, ""Black streaks of midnight streams down back!"" For red hair, say, ""Rose red waves blossoms down back!""

, Make sure you specify that it is very long and wavy. Say things like: ""twirls piece of long blonde hair!"" frequently.

, Add an exclamation mark almost every time you talk. Use caps lock a lot. So Basically You Would Be Talking Like This! Say things like: like, Oh My God, tots etc.

, Never be unkind! Say things like: Takes Ultimate selfie with new sprint! Sashays away! Flips long wavy (hair color) hair! Smiles showing perfectly white teeth! Puts on new rare mink coat lined with diamonds from Italy!

, Pretend to call each other on your ""new sprints"" and ""listen to the latest One Direction tunes on expensive mp3 players.""

, Go up to someone and say hi to them!

, When you find one, simply start with a greeting, start a little conversation, for about 2/3 minutes. If he's still there, ask him if he'd like to dance, that is, if he hasn't beaten you to it. If he says yes, dance for a bit and hang out. Ask if he'd like to be your guy. If he says yes buddy him. If no, simply say "" Okay. "" and just chill out. If he says no: Reply with ""Okay."" and either Just Hang out (with friends) or Leave. Don't ever ask another guy at that prom. Don't want to give the impression that you're a cheater.

, When you find one, simply start with a greeting, start a little conversation, for about 2/3 minutes. If he's still there, ask him if he'd like to be friends. Possibly a week later of hanging out, ask him if he'd like to be your guy.

, Hang out and get used to each other!

,, If you are going to be popular, famous and awesome, then buddy, gift, and fawn over famous jammers like, Cherryfizz44, Me100, Julian2, Mirrorimages, or Jammer330. (or is it 300?)

Have proper behavior!",How to Act As a Dog on Animal Jam1," If you want to be a dog, you have to actually be one! As in, get the proper animal. If you're a non-member, then be a bunny if you're a puppy, but if you're a grown dog, then be a wolf. If you're a member, however, then be a bunny if you want to be a puppy, or be a fox, wolf, or arctic wolf if you're a grown dog.;
, Get neck accessories, and if you're a girl then maybe even put a headflower in your hair. Pick eyes you like. Also, get the proper color. Put realistic colors, like brown, grey, white, or black, but don't be unrealistic colors, like pink, purple, orange or yellow or green or blue. Same with eye colors, but if you want to be a blind dog get pale blue eyes or white eyes.

, Splotches, spots, swirls, fire, or even lightning bolts are great. Skip this step if you don't want a pattern.

, Go to the pillow room, sleep on a pillow and say, ""Please adopt me, is a kind loving dog and is great with children,"" or if you want to be a guard dog, say, ""Is a kind, loving guard dog who is extremely loyal, and will welcome friends and chase away strangers,"". Or, you could get a friend to be your owner. If you choose the pillow room method, however, keep on saying the same things and sooner or later a kind owner will come to adopt you.

, Don't do things like pooping on the floor or furniture, and don't eat all the food and if you're a guard dog, don't chase away friends and let in strangers! Act kind to children, and don't be too rough with them, especially if they are young and if you are a breed of dog that has sharp teeth or claws. If you act bad and mischievous then your owner will take you back to the pillow room.

Figure out what kind of hamster you are going to be.,
Figure out what colors you're going to have.,
Figure out your pattern.,
Choose your animal.",How to Be a Hamster on Animal Jam1," Are you going to be a class hamster, pet hamster, magic hamster, or just a wild hamster?

, Light gray, brown, black and pale yellow are the most common colors on a hamster, so it is recommended that you choose those. But, if you don't want to choose those, that's fine, too - you get to choose!

, The best patterns on a hamster are spots, dots, and stripes. However, if you don't want any of those patterns, you can choose another one! (Skip this step if you don't want a pattern.)

, You will be pretending this animal is a hamster. Bunnies are recommended,because have you ever seen a hamster the size of a wolf or tiger? But the best animal is probably the Koala. They have hamster ears, and are small.

Avoid using girly colors, like pinks, purples and light pinks.,
Avoid using expensive clothes throughout every single animal.,
Watch what you type.,
Don't choose trades over friends.,
Don't use your gems in the wrong way.",How to Avoid Being a Snob on Animal Jam," However, there is a difference between being girly and being snobby. Instead use darker colors, or other bright colors, like orange, yellow, brown, red, blue, and more. Also, remember to not be one full color (like all blue in the same shade), and if you are going to be the same color, make sure it is in different shades.  For example, a color one as dark blue and a color two as light blue.;
, Don't wear a pink top hat with pink spiked collars and wristbands, and top it off with a pink purse. Doing this will both make your animal look spoiled, and also awkward, but in a bad way. Instead, do a variety of colors if it a looks good, or do a set of one color, but don't make the whole set just rare items.

, People always say ""treat others how you want to be treated"", and this statement is very true. Typing the wrong things lead to less buddies and more snobbishness. Avoid saying mean stuff like ""Haha, I'm rarer than you!"" or ""LOL, u noob!"". More polite ways to say these are ""I have (insert number here) rares!"", or ""Are you new?"". However, even though these are more polite, you should never, ever use them. They are still mean, as they make you sound like a bragger or mean person.

, Depending on a research, traders are more likely to turn down their friends for rare items, like spikes. People who do this are also more mean to their friends and not usually as nice unless if the activity the buddy wants to do includes rares (like playing The Forgotten Desert, or making an article about rare items).

, There is a difference between having lots of gems and having lots of gems to buy stuff for yourself and brag about it. Usually people with lots of gems only have the gems because they don't buy much stuff because they have advanced very far into the game, and usually only buy things if their friends want them. Snobs usually only get gems to spend on themselves and get expensive things like Epic Wonders items over Jam Mart items.

Find the appropriate animal.,
Select the right colors.,
Choose a good pattern.,
Get the nice accessories.,
Add claws.,
Roleplay like a cat.,
Have a warrior code!,
Form clans.,
Read the right books.",How to Act Like a Warrior Cat on Animal Jam," Cougars work the best, usually.If you are a nonmember, use a wolf. You can use lynxes to be kits (kittens) and foxes as apprentices, If you are a nonmember, You may use a bunny as a kit. If you are nonmember, you could use wolves as an apprentice.;
, Realistic cat colors work well. Like brown, black, gray, etc. For the bottom color white, peach, or light brown work good.


Always have forest colors. Avoid colors like pink, purple, or teal unless these are for your character's eyes.

, The lightning marks, swirls, or moon pattern work great! Make sure the pattern color complements your fur color, too.

, If you're a nonmember, bow and arrows work well. If you're a member, swords and bows also work well. For headwear if you are NM, fox hats and raccoon hats work well. Leaf necklaces are a good choice too. If a member, use the same things. But if you like to be realistic, don't put any items on at all.


Note: Things like flower crowns, head flowers, or DJ headsets shouldn't really be used.

, Just like your clothing, cats have claws too. Instead of using things like swords and bows in battle, use claws and teeth. Remember, cats don't use weapons.

, When you roleplay, try to act like a cat. Say things like: ""Grooms paws"" or, ""Pounces on squirrel"". Don't catch things like deer or wolves, it's impossible! And say it like you are narrating a book, such as, ""She climbed up the tree and settled down onto a branch"" or ""She hissed at the intruder, ready for battle"".

, It's best if you learn or read the Warrior Code from the books first. It's best because if you do something wrong, bullies could tease you.

, (If you want to be a loner/rogue, ignore this step.) To be a clan cat, you must have a clan. To have a clan make sure it has: A warrior's den, a nursery, an elder's den, medicine cat's den, and a leader's den. Create a fresh-kill pile––this is where all the prey is put. Make sure the clan is well and healthy, help your clan mates!

, Reading the books is helpful. If you don't like animal books, try to read the first one. It'll help you understand more about clan life.

Choose your home.,
Roleplay as your hamster.",How to Be a Hamster on Animal Jam2," Sarepia Forest isn't recommended, clanners would gobble you up. You could drown in Crystal Sands. Probably the best place is Appondale, not to hot and not to cold, it is more or less a good hamster habitat. Jamaa Township works too, though don't pick the middle. Choose a place near the fountain and pillow room entrance. You also might want to live in a shop or small building. Outback Imports is recommended and the Flag Shop as well. Members can even use their dens as that the Enchanted Hollow is underground, large, cozy and makes a perfect hamster burrow! You might get lonely in your den though, so consider taking your hamster family along with you.;
, Eat kibble, run from foxes and wolves, clean yourself, take a nap. Do what wild hamsters do! You could advertise ""If you want to be in a hamster family go to ___"" You could put your home or Members can put their den (enchanted hollow).

"
"
Get an owner.,
Roleplay as a pet.",How to Be a Hamster on Animal Jam3," At the pillow room (Jamaa's ""Adoption Center"" appointed by most players) say ""Is hamster, needs owner."" until someone adopts you. Or if you see someone advertising a school go there and ask the teacher if you can be the class pet. When you arrive say stuff like ""looks around for cage"" and say in ( ) things like (make me a cage out of Shoji Screens and pillows please) or just (make me a cage, please). When you have a cage settle down and move onto the next step.

, Go on crazy adventures, ordinary hamsters are boring. You might be a hamster who think he/she is a dog or you might have secret super powers! Being a normal hamster is boring to most people. They might send you to the pillow room or suddenly unbuddy you, lock their den, and leave waiting for you to leave the den. Be the greatest hamster ever! And remember to have fun.

Make sure that the keyboard you're using has a set of four arrow keys.,
Join the adventure Jamaaliday Rescue.,
Test going through the wall.,
Press (and hold down) the arrow key, then immediately right-click in the area you want to access.,
If you can't get through, simply try again.",How to Glitch Through Walls in Jamaaliday Rescue," If it doesn't, keep in mind that this glitch will not work at all. The type of PC you're using, however, does not matter at all. Although the glitch requires a quick bit of lag to work, you can create such lag by following the steps below. It might seem like a great material, but having a laggy PC doesn't help or hurt your chances with this glitch. A powerful one doesn't hurt, either.;
, Keep in mind that this adventure can only be played during the end of year holidays. If it isn't December where you are, you don't have to stop reading this. Studying and practicing will improve your chances at this glitch later on. Anyway, if it is close to Christmas for you, the easiest way to access the adventure is through the Party Tab. Join any Jamaaliday Rescue available, as it doesn't matter what you play so long as it is Jamaaliday Rescue. (Although, having a friend to wow might score some extra points for you!)

, You don't have to go all the way to the closest wall to the middle if you want to just test this glitch before you take in some major results. Find a wall you can glitch through. Remember that this glitch can only glitch you through walls meant to be accessed for players, which means that you can't go into areas blocked by a clump of pine trees. Once near a wall that is not blocked by anything on the other side, press the arrow key that leads in the direction you want to pass through. For example, if you were at the south end of the wall and wanted to get to the north end, you could simply press the top arrow key button.

, The simplest way to do so is to aim for the middle of the path, not near the edges, as it is much easier. Remember to still keep holding down the desired arrow key while you make the single right-click. (That's right, just the single. One click will be effective.) If you've done it accurately, your animal should not move after the right-click for a few seconds. Then, as if by magic, a short burst of lag will come through and your avatar will pass through the wall. Release the arrow key after your goal has been achieved.

, Many faster computers might not get the glitch processed on the first try. Then again, slower computers might not get it done fast enough and might even fail the glitch altogether. This glitch hasn't been patched by AJHQ yet, so keep trying!If the glitch worked for you on the first try, congratulations! Have a fun time impressing yourself and wowing others as you pass through the walls! Happy Jamming!

Create an account.,
Complete the tutorial.,
Get to know Jamaa.,
Dress up your animal!,
Play some games!,
Decorate your den!,
Make some buddies!,
Learn about trading!",How to Get Off to a Good Start on Animal Jam," You might have done this already. If so, skip to the next step. If not, simply type ""Animal Jam"" into your web browser and click on the first listed result.;
, This part is kind of self-explanatory - there will be a sign in the middle of the page that says ""Play now."" Click on it and you'll be guided through the motions...first, you'll be asked to choose an animal. There are wolves, rabbits, koalas, seals, penguins, pandas, tigers, and monkeys to choose from. They are all great choices, but note that wolves are probably the most popular of all these animals so they're great animals to start off with. Then you'll be asked to supply a little more information, your age, gender, birth date, email, etc., and agree to the Animal Jam code of conduct.

, Lots of people skip this, but if you've never played Animal Jam before and nobody has ever showed you how, it's a critical step that will help you a lot later. You'll meet Liza, the panda shaman. There are other shamans, too, one for almost every animal on Animal Jam. She'll take you through the simpler ropes of Animal Jam - changing your colors, buying items, and how to use gems. You'll also have an opportunity to watch a video about the history of Jamaa. (Jamaa is the name of the world Animal Jam is based off of).

, Explore Jamaa. It's really a good thing to do when you first join, because the more knowledge you have of what's around you, the better. Chances are, you'll appear first in Jamaa Township, which is like a village type scene. There are a lot of shops, and usually a lot of people. This is where you'll find the main clothing store, Jam Mart Clothing, and the main furniture store, Jam Mart furniture. Don't buy anything just yet, feel free to browse the selection and see what they have, or what you might be interested in buying later. When you want to switch lands, just click on the button in your bottom right corner that looks like a globe. Then you'll be able to switch to different lands.

, This will get rid of that ""new member"" look, and it will make it look like you've been playing the game for longer than just one day. Jam Mart clothing is probably the best place to get your stuff. o get there, go to Jamaa township and enter the large building on your left. Click on any of the tables there and a selection of clothing items will appear. Note that some items are for paying members only, and that those items will be highlighted with gold paw print marks near their price tags. Find a few non member items to buy. Also, non members are unable to change the color of items, so if you want a different color, you might ask a member if they would be willing to trade you that item in the color you want.

, Animal Jam is full of fun games to play, so try some of them out now! You'll have a lot of fun, not to mention you'll need more gems for the later steps, which you can earn from playing games. They are scattered in almost every land, and are usually easy to find, but if you want to see all the games in one place, visit the Sol Arcade (the long, rocket shaped building in Jamaa township).

, Most people an Animal Jam are very proud of their dens, so start decorating yours now! Just like the clothing items, you may be limited on how fancy your den can be based on whether or not you are a member. Still, there are lots of fun and cheap den items out there, even for non members! To start off simple, try items such as the welcome mat, mailbox, and armchair (Jam Mart Furniture) or the non member plants sold at the Sarepeia Forest plant shop. Flags from the flag shop are also a great choice, and the striped couches at Jam Mart furniture are very popular, for couches as well as for beds. You can also dress your walls up with the free online safety plaque, which you can earn by taking the online safety quiz located in the Appondale Museum.

, Friends are a great thing to have, and on Animal Jam, making friends is incredibly easy. Simply click on a player's name tag, and click on the ""add buddy"" button on their player card. Other people might also send you buddy requests, even before you come to this step, and that's perfectly fine. You'll be able to accept or deny these requests, and if you want to turn them off at any time, click on the options button in the top right corner of your screen and it will be listed there. Once you're someone's buddy, you'll be able to visit their den, trade with them, play a game with them, or go to them at any time.

, Click a player's name tag, and then click on the trading tab on their player card. This will show what is currently on their trade list. If you want to send them a trade request, Click on the item you want, and click the plus buttons to add the item(s) you want to give them in exchange for it. To add items to your trade list, click on the picture of yourself in the bottom left corner of your screen. Then you can switch the tab on the left from the clothing items you have to your trade list, which you can change whenever you want to. People can send you trade requests as well, and you can turn them off the same way you do with buddy requests.

, For some reason, it makes Best Dressed more fun. Well, have fun with your probably neglected sea animal by playing this really fun game. And here's a tip, always wear the gingerbread man.

, It's more peaceful (most of the time). Since Jammers usually don't go underwater, it will be more peaceful and more calm, with no screaming traders or desperate singles. But, sadly, it is not always that peaceful. At times there can be big underwater parties with, yes, people screaming for you to join their adventure. But don't worry, it's usually peaceful.

, Some best friends were met underwater. So, just another good reason to go down there. You know what, stop reading. Go down there right now.

The advice center is ideal if you like helping people. It can also be a happiness center. You could design it as an enchanted hollow den, fill the first floor with plushies, have a desk and chair on the second floor, with pillows, laptop and candle, and on the third floor, have a fire put, diner booths, sofas and couches, student chairs, a tablet and so forth. But use your own imagination to create what works best for you.

, Oh look, they made an adventure themed den, maybe you could make one too, in your style! Or, if it's Christmas, make a Christmas den. When the FIFA World cup is on, make a soccer field den or a gym den. If anything inspires you, use it.

Go to the Sol Arcade.,
Play the game called Best Dressed.,
Play the game Pest Control a lot of times.

,
Play Splash-and-Dash.,
Play Jamaa Derby.",How to Get Lots of Gems on Animal Jam1," Sky High often pays out a decent amount of gems, as well as it counts the gems you earn for you. Not only that, but it is also usually a fun, decently easy game.As you are at the top, you get an item. If you don't want it, you could trade it for something else or recycle it for gems.;
,

Go to the bottom of the arcade where there are six games in the area. Click the game called, ""Overflow"".
Select your difficulty. It is recommended to use the hard mode because it is challenging, fun, and gives you more gems, but you don't have to use hard mode. If you're not ready yet, make your way up.
Open up your calculator, or get one yourself. Using the calculator is good for keeping track of the gems you have and get, but this is optional.

, Best Dressed is one of the best games to play if you want to earn gems fast, and lots of Jammers play it often. Most of the time, people only vote for member animals, so try doing the non-member fox glitch when your membership expires. Best Dressed is a dress-up game where you need to dress the best according to the theme. If you get first prize you can get 200 gems depending on how many people are in the match, so make sure the match has at least 7 players. If the glitch happens, where every jammer gets in first place, your in luck! You get 200 gems, like it says up near the top of the paragraph.

,, This game is simple, it's just jumping hurdles, mostly. This game is played with a dolphin, and you will earn 100 gems for first place in regular!


Go to the arcade or Bahari Bay to find Splash-and-Dash.
Play Regular mode to get pro. Regular will give you 100 gems for first place.
Play pro to get 150 gems. However, the time goes faster and there are more rings, which makes the game faster.

, This game is very much like Splash and Dash. You are a horse, and you race horses, dodging the puddles, flowers, and hay."

Add items to your trade list that you do not want.,
Once you have your trade list ready, go to a somewhat full area.,
Dance or hop in order to attract attention.,
Do not say, ""I accept all trades!"",
Be realistic.,
Move on.,
Check around as much as possible.",How to Get Lots of Stuff on Animal Jam1," Make sure that you don't accidentally add items that you do want or you might accidentally trade it away.


If you're new to Animal Jam, do not place items that everyone can always purchase at the stores, for this is annoying and no one will want your items. Try to get your hands on items that cannot be found in stores. You can do so by playing adventures.
Note that while you cannot purchase member items, even if you do get your hands on one, members still might not want it if they can always purchase it in the stores themselves.;
, Stand in a spot where people can easily see you and click your name tag. Do not stand in front of people that are already advertising something, for this is very rude and annoying. As tempting as it might sound, refrain from doing so, even though that person might be standing in a good spot you would like to have yourself.


Avoid standing in corners or dark areas where no one will see you. Find somewhere in the open where people will be able to spot you, but avoid standing in the middle of the crowd or no one will be able to notice you or click your name tag to access your trade list.

, Then, say in either no caps or all caps: ""I accept fair trades!"" You could also say something similar to that and make up something catchy to attract attention, but make sure you use words that are permitted in the chat.

, You are basically scamming yourself and wasting your time. People will not give you fair trades or good items. They will simply take advantage of you and trade you something store-bought.


Even though claiming that you accept all trades might be an easy way to attract attention, it's not smart and you'll lose all your good items and have to start all over again.

, You may or may not get a lot of trades. It depends on what is on your trade list and who is interested in it. Accept any fair trades that you really like, but decline all trades that aren't fair at all.


Keep in mind that some people who are insensitive and perhaps a little bratty might get mad at you for not accepting their trade. If they start yelling at you, gently explain that their trade wasn't fair and tell them to try again if they want.
If the person refuses to listen to you, simply ignore them and continue on asking for fair trades. If they aren't going to listen to you, no matter how nice you are, it's best to let them be.
If you are mean or rude to the person, he/she might choose to report you. You do not want that. Being mean will give you a bad reputation and no one will want to trade you.
Do not accept bad trades simply out of pity for the person. This will ruin you.

, If you find that you get no fair trades or no trades at all, simply move to another area or go to a different place on the map. Keep accepting very good trades and declining bad ones and you'll eventually get rares and other good items.

, It's best to check all of the stores found in Animal Jam, even the ones made for members. Familiarize yourself with what is store-bought. That way, if a store-bought item is offered to you for one of your items that cannot be bought, you'll know whether the person is trying to cheat you out of your item or not.


Do not accept store-bought items, even if it's a member's store-bought item. No one will want the item, even the members, no matter how important it may be to you. You will be unable to use the item and nonmembers will definitely find no use in it.

, Her W is her wand that shoots out, then returns. Both times they hit Lux, she gains a shield., Her E is a circle which thrown out, slows everyone it hits. Activating the ability will do damage to everyone inside of the circle. Once you hit a Q, you can E and deal slows and damage to the enemy. Her E is also good for farming., Lux's ult is one of the most interesting in the game. After charging for 0.5 seconds,(a red line will appear where her ult will shoot) she fires a laser in a straight line, dealing massive damage to enemies in a line.Her ult has a very long range, great for finishing off enemies or dealing massive damage during a teamfight., Midlane is a tight lane that is often ganked (google ""ganking league of legends"" if you don't know this terminology), full of assassins and high dmg fighters. One false step, and half your health disappears. However, Lux has a lot of CC in her spells, allowing her to land dmg quickly and easily. (CC means Crowd Control, which is stuns, roots, and slows.), With support, all you have to do is land CC and then sit back, and let your ADC (Attack Damage Carry) get the kill. Just land 1. JUST 1, skillshot, root the enemy, then your job is done. Support is so easy!, The 2 reasons  ADCs fall behind are: 1) The enemy ADC is too good, and keeps killing yours. 2) You get ganked and the jungler keeps killing your ADC.

To counter #1, get a better ADC.
To counter #2, ward the jungle so you don't get ganked. Good warding locations for Blue team include the tri-brush and the  river. Most gank locations come from the river, Red side or Blue side, so that is an important warding location. Sometimes you will want to buy a pink ward to place in the river, because pink wards are permanent wards, and they won't be destroyed until someone on the enemy side sees it, and this will usually be the jungler, so you know they are there. Another item is SightStone, which gives you 3 sight wards to place, which makes warding WAY easier. Look at some warding guides to get more help.

, He/she is your best hope of killing the enemy team. Without an ADC, you have very little damage, and the enemy can easily kill you (unless the enemy is a support, then try to outplay them. You could get on a highlight reel.) Your ADC will farm, clear the minion waves, and generally take care of the mechanics of the game. Just sit back and relax; for while you are helping your ADC, the ADC is also covering you! If you are attacked, they will come to your aid (usually, not guaranteed)., While in the lane, he/she is going to take dmg. With Lux, your W is great for healing the ADC, as it gives them a shield to block damage. Though the W is a good ability, try getting Q first to be able to stun before healing with W."

,








Q (Empowered) - Savagery's bonus damage is increased to 30-240 (depending on level) +30% of his total Attack Damage. Also it grants Rengar 50-101% bonus attack speed and 20% Attack Damage for 5 seconds.








W (Battle Roar) - Rengar screams out a roar, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and gains bonus armor and magic resist for 4 seconds, increased by 50% for each affected enemy or large monster.








W (Empowered) - Battle roar's basic magic damage is modified to 40-250 (depending on level). Rengar heals for 12-80 (depending on level) increased by 6.25% for every 1% missing health, healing up to a max of 75-500 (depending on level).








E (Bola Strike) - Rengar throws a bola in the targeted direction, dealing physical damage. The first target hit by bola strike will be slowed.








E (Empowered) - Bola Strike's physical damage is increased to 50-340 (depending on level), also landing it on a target will root them for 1.75 seconds.








R (Thrill of the Hunt) - Rengar goes into stealth after 1 second of not taking damage - up to 3 seconds if taking damage. He will gain vision of all nearby champions for 7 to 12 seconds. While stealthed, Rengar gains 15/30% bonus movement speed while moving towards a nearby enemy. Once exiting stealth Rengar gains bonus movement speed (25/35/45% depending on skill level) and 5 stacks of ferocity over the next 5 seconds.

, As an assassin, you want to do as much damage as you can in as little time as possible. This is the mindset behind the skill level-up order. To help with early game jungle clearing you will need to start Q to kill the camp quickly. The reason why Q will give you the fastest clear is because it can be used as a basic attack reset. What this means is that you can start off by using a basic attack then press Q and instantly get another basic attack off.





, You will want to take W at level 2, because it has AoE (Area of Effect) damage and healing. This will allow you to clear additional camps with more health.





, You will want to follow the maxing ordering shown above. Q is your strongest damage dealer, followed by E which is why you want to max your abilities in that order.

, The most standard marks for the attack damage junglers, which will work for Rengar, would be attack damage marks. However, you may prefer to use armor penetration marks; the reason behind this that it will provide you a great deal of damage early on and allow for flexibility in your build paths. The only downside is that your clears might be a little rough but W will make up for it!


Now the reasoning behind the 2% critical strike is that you start off with 0%, and 1% chance of it happening is obviously better than 0%. And at the cost of 1.28 armor penetration you can double your odds!

, Armor seals are allows taken in the jungle for 5 out of the 6 jungle camps deal physical damage. So it will allow for safe jungle clears.





, Rengar being a cool down reliant champion means you'll want to get the maximum capacity for your cool downs. This is the reasoning behind why would you chose cool down glyphs over magic resist. Just take extra caution when facing strong ability power foes.





,

The reasoning for these come from your marks and glyphs, with your glyphs you'll reach a 10% cool down reduction which will help you achieve maximum capacity (40%). The armor penetration is also there to help for more damage early game., These masteries are basically the safest route for learning Rengar. The keystone Thunderlord's will allow you to get an early lead and potentially snowball. The smaller masteries are there for clearing the jungle safely and supplying minor damage enhancements. When you are comfortable on Rengar, you will be able to switch them up to whatever you prefer.

, Machete start in the guide shouldn't need any explanation, the other starter gives no benefit for Rengar to start. Now the debate between starting 3 potions or refill comes up a lot between Jungle players; the reason behind why some people prefer the 3 potions is that Rengar has built in sustain so after your first clear you will not need any potions to stay healthy.

, With the armor pen runes there's no need to rush any armor pen item first, so Tiamat fills the role great, for it's raw damage and proves AoE on your basic attacks as well as Q. Also, when you can switch your trinket from the warding totem to the sweeping lenses. This will allow you to pull off ganks a bit easier, for when ganking if you active the bush before getting close enough you will be bale to disable it's vision.

, The items added onto the build will be a Zeal and Lucidity Boots. Zeal is a great item for Rengar especially while generating all those kills. The main use that comes from the zeal is the 20% crit rate provided from it, although it might seem low it'll feel higher than displayed. The reasoning behind Lucidity boots shouldn't be hard to find, like mentioned early with runes CDR scales great with Rengar.

, Now here if snowballing went successful this will be the biggest power spike in the game for you. Having these items you'll be able to assassinate any enemy fed or not. Upgrading the zeal into a Static Shiv will provide a small bonus of damage for your burst potential. The last whisper will be good to have added into the build for by now you should be a major threat to the enemies and some of them will start building some armor to try and neglect your damage. The last whisper will basically counter act the armor being bought by enemies.

, Nothing much changes here except you'll be choosing between the Hydras and Last Whisper upgrades. Choosing between the Last Whisper upgrade has no argument, you'll always take Lord Dominik's Regards. This is because the other upgrade only gives you grievous wounds bonus; however, being an assassin the enemy shouldn't be able to do any sort of damage that they'll be able to heal off of.


Now for the Hydras, taking Ravenous Hydra over titanic is better for Rengar for it'll give you life steal and has a shorter active cool down. Now notice you're not going to be rushing the hydra completion this should be done nearly last in your build, the last whisper upgrade should be done beforehand.

, The sixth component to your build will always depend on how the game is going. For the following examples:


If they enemies have a lot of Ability Power threats you'll want to grab that Maw of Malmortius.
If you're extremely ahead (4-6 levels ahead of the enemy attack damage carry) put up the Infinity Edge. This will just allow you take full control over the game and no one will be able to handle you at all.
If you feel like the 30% CDR isn't cutting it and you want some more life-steal and attack damage go for the Death's Dance - It'll be able to fill all those gaps.
The choices between Sterak's Gage and Guardian Angel are similar, if you feel like you're blowing up too fast in team fights after killing your target these will almost provide a second chance. Guardian Angel will give you that second chance for sure, but depending on how the fight goes will you re-spawn you might just end up dying again. Sterak's Gage will give you that small shield and window to maybe get out or try to heal up of nearby targets.

, When starting your golems make sure you smite them as well to get the buff from them.

, Clearing your raptors will stall out sometime for smite to be back up for red buff.

, Clearing the red camp will grant you level 3, as well as the potential to help a lane.

, Being level 3 at this point in the game will give you a small window to kill either middle or bottom lane while they are still level 2.

, When taking on Gromp his buff will not be that help for you on Rengar, but the true damage from smite will allow you to kill it faster.

, Again you will be stalling out for smite to be back up, for the buff clear will deal a bit of damage so smite will help kill it faster.

, Just like on Blue Side you will be killing you buff to acquire level 3.

, The reasoning is the same exact as mention early for Blue Side.

, When going in for a gank (ambushing an enemy laner) especially pre-level 6; you're going to need your E available as well as 5 stacks of Ferocity. Rengar isn't the most mobile champion so having the ability to root an enemy for nearly 2 seconds can greatly increase your odds of a successful gank. If the enemy gets away from the gank there's a high chance that they were forced to flashed. So now you will have a much easier creating an advantage in that lane - especially if it is a low mobility champions.

, During the early stages of the game you're going to want to clear at least 3 camps before doing any ganking. Most typically you'll get to level 3 and gank either middle lane or a side lane depending on what is happening in the game. Once completing the gank, if healthy you can go back into your jungle and rush getting to level 6. Once level 6, keep an eye on your allies health bars and see who is fighting, and if you can come get kills. You will just to rack up kills for the most part of early game.

, Now during this part of the game, almost all of the outer turrets should be destroyed, maybe a dragon or 2 have been taken. When towers are destroyed that allows your laners to start roaming, which will mean it's maybe time to group and combine everyone's lead into a team fight. How team fights will work for you is you will want to find a position where you can flank the enemies from. When joining the team fight you most likely do not want to be the engagement, allow some cool-downs to be blown so the enemies will not be able to react to you joining the fight. Do not try to 1v5 the enemy team, you will just die. Depending on your lead you can most likely 1v2, even 1v3 depending on the enemy champions.

, This is the part of the game where a single death can change the entire outcome of the game. So will need to play extra careful, constantly look at the enemy's items and see if anyone is carrying a vision ward. Also at this point in the game you should be level 16 with 3rd rank in R. The cool-down should be less than a minute so if you see the enemy ADC walking alone, use your R to see if they actually are alone before pouncing on the pray. Kills like this are called 'Picks' where you will find a target all by themselves and pick them off. With these picks you'll be able to secure dragons, barons, or even end the game.

Learn how to build Jax.,
Learn Jax's ability combo.,
Play the early game.,
Focus on assisting your team during the mid game phase.,
Become the split pushing monster that Jax is during the late game and be present for team fights.",How to Play Jax in League of Legends," These include:


His passive is relentless assault- Jax's attack speed increases with every basic attack.
His Q ability is Leap strike- Jax leaps to a targeted location, if the target is an enemy he deals damage.
His W ability is Empower: Jax empowers his next basic attack or leap strike dealing additional damage.
His E ability is Counter strike: Jax dodges all incoming basic attack for three seconds, if clicked again during that time Jax will stun nearby targets. Note: you have to wait one second for you to be able to stun an enemy.
His ultimate (R) ability is Grandmaster's might: Jax gains additional armor and magic resist. Passive: Jax deals additional magic damage with every third basic attack.;
, Due to Jax's Counterstrike negating a great deal of damage an enemy can put out on you, a rune page similar to an attack damage carry is viable.


An example of a viable rune page for Jax consists of 9 greater seals of armor, 9 greater marks of attack damage, 9 greater glyphs of magic resist and 3 greater quintessence of attack damage.

, 9/21/0 is a great set up because it is the best for sustain in lane and damage output in a duel or team fight.

, Each spell has it's own benefits and are down to your play style. Some recommended summoner spells include:


Ignite because it helps to get kills early game.
Flash because it helps to escape a gank or get closer to an enemy.
Teleport always because when you are top lane, you will not be able to easily get to dragon to kill it with your team or defend your turret as well, as top lane is really just an island where you just try to push and become an invincible monster while farming away.

, Starting items can include a Doran's shield/blade, 1 health pot, Yellow trinket and his full build can look something like Mercury Treads, Trinity Force, Blade Of The Ruined King, Sunfire Cape, Guardian Angel, Warmogs Armor or Gunblade.


Bear in mind that every build is situational and you should fit your build around your opposing team, that being said, Trinity Force is a core item n Jax.

, For Jax's combo you want to press E to get your stun ready then Q to leap to enemy champion E again to stun them then W to deal some serious damage this is good for poking early game.

, If your jungle needs a leash help them if not just wait under your tower. When minions come focus on last hitting, if you're against a range champion and they keep harassing you, let them push and try to get as many cs under your tower. Once you're level three and you have your Q W and E, harass them with your combo so that they will recall and now farming will be easier.

, You should have your Trinity Force by now and should focus on helping other lanes. Try to help bot or mid, if they don't need help focus on pushing top. If an enemy comes top don't be afraid, use your combo and your passive on your Trinity Force will let you do tons of damage.

, You should have most of your build now and you should focus on pushing. If it is a tight game, group with your team and attack baron as it will give you a huge buff. Push for game and win.

Get to know Garen.,
Use Garen's Q to allow him to leap in the air, striking an opponent for extra damage and silencing them.,
Use Garen's W to get him extra armor.,
Use Garen's E to make him spin in a circle, damaging anyone his blade touches.,
Use Garen's Ult last.,
Use Garden's Summoner Spells.,
Get the right items.,
Play smart.,
Farm constantly.,
Use his Teleport Spell wisely.,
Play aggressively.,
Don't be scared to dive that turret.",How to Play Garen in League of Legends," Garen is manaless, with health regen and lots of attack damage. Garen's Passive allows lots of health regen while out of combat for 8 seconds. This allows you to dive the enemy, then when you get out, after 8 seconds you start to regenerate all the health you lost. The enemy champion will be wondering how you're full health; since he just put a beating on you.;
, This is crucial to land first in fights, as the silence will keep your opponent from casting spells, while you beat on him mercilessly.

, A good strategy is before a fight., If you're attacking only one enemy, it will 33% more damage. This is usually used right after your Q, allowing lots of damage while the silence is still active.

, It is just beautiful. A huge sword coming shooting down out of the sky, damaging the enemy for about 250 dmg. It will usually execute the enemy.

, Garen usually takes Flash + Teleport. Flash allows you to go forward to land those Qs, and teleport to get to lane faster. Ignite/Exhaust are an option, but teleport/flash are recommended.

, Garen usually starts with Doran's Shield and a couple of health potions. The shield is good for health and armor, and is my most recommended starting item. Don't buy too many health potions, however, because you have your passive to give you health regen.

, Use the reliable combo, Q --> E --> Ult. The Q for silence, the E for lots of damage, and the R to finish them off.

, Garen relies on the ability to do huge amount of damage, take lots of damage, and get out in time to heal it all back. Farm to get lots gold, to buy items. You want to build a Black Cleaver, a Spirit Visage, Sunfire Cape, and/or Warmog's Armor. This will give you a good combination of damage, health, health regen, armor, and magic resist.


Infinity Edges are a nice bit a damage, but only buy one.
There are several YouTube videos on 5 Infinity Edge Garen; while it is a huge amount of damage, he got mowed down easily due to lack of health. Stick to the normal mix.

, Teleport should not only be used to get to lane faster, but also to teleport to other lanes. Teleport spell can be used to get to Jungle objective, like Baron or Dragon, teleport into teamfights, or surprise the enemy from their backlines. For more about teleporting, see the guide How to Play Top Lane in League of Legends., Garen is a very aggressive toplaner, due to his huge amount of damage and his tankiness. Also, since he is manaless he is a endless threat to the enemy. Q your lane opponent whenever you can, but be careful. He may surprise you after the silence wears off with a barrage of spells.

, Especially if you have build armor/health and use W, you can soak up about 4-6 turret shots before your health really starts dropping. Usually your combo will finish off the enemy laner before you die from turret shots or him.

Decide what type of top laner you are.,
Farm.,
Keep sight of bushes with wards.,
If you are fighting Ranged V Ranged, try to land poke wherever you can.,
If you are fighting Melee V Ranged, use the bushes.,
If you are fighting Ranged V Melee, use your range advantage.,
If you are fighting Melee V Melee, trade blows a look with your opponent, and take a lot of dmg.,
Deal with your lane opponent.,
Deal with ganks.,
Keep an eye on your teammates.,
Participate in team fights.,
Teleport to surprise enemies.",How to Play Top Lane in League of Legends,"  If you decide to go top lane, you'll need a role. Some top laners like Dr. Mundo and Maokai go for health, but little damage. Some like Has up have high burst potential, but get shredded down easily. Some laners like Garen or Darius have a bit of both, health + dmg can be a hard combo to beat. Figure out whatever type of top laner you're going to play, then head into the game.
, The  money that makes the man comes from farming. Farming, in case you aren't familiar with the term, means last-hitting minions to earn gold. You then spend the gold in the shop to get good items. Farming is crucial for the 3 dmg dealers in team fights: ADC, midlaner, and top laner. Many top laners start out with good dmg, so you don't have to buy a Cull or a Doran's Blade with your 500 starting gold. While farming is a very important part of the game, watch your lane opponent., Don't build anything like sightstone, but keep warding the river and the 3 bushes. Many melee characters will try to use the bushes to their advantage, and to keep away from surprises, ward the brush. This also prevents ganking.

Many players will put a pink ward/permanent ward in the river, when use their 4""4"" key ward for the bushes. This is a good strategy, and highly recommended. Until a jungler comes up to tank, and sees and destroys your ward, you will have constant mission of the river.

, Many people will think ""Oh, he hit me with 1 auto attack. I'll just heal it up."" After a while, those auto attacks add up. Many players also don't realize the basic attack range. If you stand right behind your minions, you should be able to hit your opponent. Land as much dmg on him her as possible., As long as they don't have the bushes warded,  you can land several spells if you are playing a heavy dmg champion like Ekko or Illoai. Many ranged champions, if they get low HP, will stay in lane for a while longer than if they were melee or against another ranged. They will think, ""I can see him/her coming before they get close enough to attack, so I can back off in time."" Close the distance quickly; many abilities, such as Garen's Q add movement speed. Summoner spells, particularly Flash and Heal, are great for melee champions., It is your best weapon. You can stay back, yet still land a spell ever few seconds. Plus you rarely take minion damage. This is a good matchup; just be aware of your surroundings and constantly watch your opponent. Melee characters are more powerful than ranged champions at close range, so just stay at a good range, and Farm Farm Farm., Health or health regen is recommended for most melee characters some already have it in their passive. Mana-less champions do better here (Riven, Garen, Gnar, Yasuo); they recall less often. While many ranged champions rely on crit. dmg, melee characters build dmg okay every attack. Farm to get gold each early, and build up your dmg. To win in lane, you must start to win 2 our of 3 trades with your lane opponent., While batting for lane control, make sure you are safe. Your lane opponent will try anything to kill you or bring your health low enough that you recall. Melee characters will have a hard time fighting ranged characters, because the ranged champions can stay back from their enemy to harm them. If they start to get a little too aggressive, back off a little, but not too much., Make sure to keep your river/bushes warded, but sometimes you forget or can't get out in time. If you are banked, try to use a speed boost item/spell. Do not immediately flash.

If you are still too slow, and have a summoner spell like Ghost or Heal available, use it as well. Either one will work, and will get you to your turret. While under turret, you can easily 1v1 the enemy jungler or top laner, or even sometimes both. Your turret will wear them down with its shots, and if you can put a silence or a stun onto the enemy, that is very good.
A silence will make them unable to cast spells, and a stun will make them stuck and unable to cast spells. Either one will allow the turret to hit them several times, dropping their health bar significantly.

, Many teammates will be fighting for a dragon, turret, or just fighting the enemy., In case of a team fight, get down there as fast as you can. Top laners are one of the 3 dmg dealers in fights. In some cases, you can teleport to a nearby minion, turret, or ward to join the fight., Another, more advanced kind of teleport play, would be teleporting to a deep ward in the enemy jungle, behind their front lines, then charging up behind them. Champions like Sion and Hecraim to this very nicely; you can eliminate a member of the enemy easily."

AI"" to play against computer players. If playing PVP mode, select ""Classic"" as the game mode, ""Summoner's Rift"" as the Game Map and the Game Type is up to you (though blind pick is recommended for beginners, and ranked is not available until level 30).;
, Once you're in the champion selection screen, type ""Marksman"" into the Search bar. This will show you all of the champions labeled as marksman. These champions are almost all considered ADC champions with the exception of a few. It is not recommended to play Teemo, Urgot, Kindred or Quinn for ADC. Great ADCs include Varus, Draven, Ashe, Jinx and Caitlyn. These champions can be played as ADC in the Bottom Lane; however, most commonly they are played else where in other roles.


Also note: there is a timer used to pick your champion. If you fail to select a champion before the time runs out you will be removed from the game.

, These are very crucial to ADC champions and are generally survival tools. Most commonly Flash and Heal are taken on ADCs.

, Runes should be made before game and are unlocked using Influence Points that you receive after playing matches. You get Mastery Points to put into Masteries by leveling up your account. You will get XP for playing every match, which you level up with. Guides can be found online on sites like Mobafire.com for this type of thing.

, Purchase the starting items highlighted. Typically ADC's buy Doran's Blade and a health potion first, however there are variations. Buy a ""Warding Trinket.""


Also remember to buy more items from the shop when you return to base.

, The map is mirrored along the river in a diagonal. Bottom lane is the bottom/right side of the map. Walk to lane and wait by your tower for the minions to spawn and walk to lane. Generally you will share this lane with your Support player. Strategizing together and working as a team will greatly improve your gameplay.

, When you deal the final hit on a minion (known as last hitting) you will gain a small amount of gold. This is your primary source of income so getting good at this step will ultimately help you succeed.

, You will not be alone in lane, so you must use your abilities (Q,W,E,R keys) to hit enemy champions. Be careful not to take more damage than you deal and always remember that enemy minions will attack you if you attack an enemy champion. If your support has abilities that stun or slow enemies, follow them up to safely attack for a short period of time. Focus on killing minions and attacking enemies when your support attacks.

, This trinket places a Ward that lasts for a short amount of time and reveals the area around it. Use this trinket to ward bushes and protect yourself from enemies! Good warding locations include the 2 brushes by the lane and the river. Many times the enemy jungler will come in from the river to try to kill you, and you can spot him by putting a ward in the river.

, Your objective during this time is to kill minions, not die and hopefully kill the enemy tower. The enemy tower is very strong and will attack you if you are the first thing to enter it's attack range or if you hit an enemy champion while near the tower. Killing a tower grants you gold and generally allows you to leave your lane and participate in group fights. If you destroy the first turret of the game, you'll earn your team bonus gold and a better game/map position.

, There are quite a few indicators that you should leave your lane and help your team. If any of these conditions are met, it is generally a good idea to move in a group with your team as this ensures you will be safe. As an ADC, your champion is generally susceptible to being killed but you also do a lot of damage in return.

You kill the enemy tower.
The enemy kills your tower and then leaves.
No towers in your lane have died but your teammates are wanting to group up at an objective.

, On the bottom side of the map is Dragon Pit and on the top side is Baron Pit. These pits are home to fearsome dragons and the giant Monster Baron Nashor. When killed, these monsters give a bonus to your team in a variety of ways. These monsters are also very strong and usually require multiple people to effectively kill them. As a primary damage dealer, it is your job to to help your team kill these monsters.

, When moving as a group, if you encounter grouped enemies, it is important that you stay as far away from the enemies as you can, without being so far that you cannot attack., If there are more than champions near you, attempt to attack the other damage dealers. Always attempt to be behind your teammates. Notice in the picture Ashe (green arrow) is behind Darius (blue arrow) while hitting multiple enemies (red arrow.)

, Twitch can be purchased with RP or IP, if you don't have enough of either you'll need to play continually until you have have enough IP or you will need to purchase enough RP to buy Twitch.


Once you purchase Twitch, you may also purchase skins to change the look of Twitch.

, Twitches abilities are Deadly venom, Ambush, Venom cask, Expunge and Spray and Pray. A description of each is down below :Deadly Venom (twitches basic ability): Twitch's basic attacks apply a stack of Deadly Venom, dealing 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 true damage per second for 6 seconds. This effect can stack up to 6 times for a minimum of 12 / 24 / 36 / 48 and maximum of 72 / 144 / 216 / 288 total true damage over the duration.
Ambush:For 1.25 seconds, Twitch attempts to enter stealth, which may be delayed by up to 3 seconds if he takes damage before he goes invisible. While in stealth, Twitch gains 20% bonus movement speed. When Twitch unstealths, he gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. Casting spells or attacking will end his stealth prematurely.
Venom cask: Twitch hurls a cask of venom at an area, infecting struck enemies with 2 stacks of Deadly Venom and slowing them for 3 seconds.
Contaminate: Twitch expunges all nearby enemies afflicted by Deadly Venom, dealing physical damage equal to a base amount plus bonus damage for each stack of Deadly Venom on an enemy.
Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat: For 7 seconds, Twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 attack range. Additionally, each of his basic attacks will pierce enemies in an 850 length line, with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage.

, Select your runes, masteries, champion skin and summoner spells. Summer spells are chosen in regards to your playstyle preference, though a Flash spell can be useful when getting one last hit on fleeing enemies or as an emergency escape tool.

, Twitch's ability to go invisible can be used when ganking (ambushing) enemies and can also be used as an escape tool.


As ambush provides an additional attack speed boost once you leave invisibility, it can be useful when taking down turrets, however, being pushed far into your lane with Ambush on cooldown could leave you very vulnerable if ganked by an enemy.

, This can be achieved by getting continuous hits on an enemy. Once you have achieved the maximum stack of passive damage dealt by Deadly Venom, use the Venom Cask to slow the enemy so that an additional chance to deal damage is made.

, Due to Twitch having one of the highest attack speeds out of all of the champions, buy items in the shop that provide additional passive boosts upon hits that will add to the damage dealt by Deadly Venom.

, Contaminate has a high radius and will deal a significant amount of damage to all enemies affected by Deadly Venom.


If you get an enemies champion's health down quite low and they are still being affected by Deadly Venom then use Contaminate to finish them off on their retreat.

, Due to Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat's ability to pierce multiple enemies, higher range, higher damage and long cool down time, it's important to time it effectively. Aim to only use Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat when there are multiple enemies present or use it to finish off a retreating enemy(s).

, Try to buy items that increase attack damage and on-hit damage boosts and tailor them to your own playing style. An alternative could be to increase movement speed and attack speed with your Ambush ability to ""run and gun"" around the map (also useful for taking down turrets).


A great item to purchase to rapidly farm and aggressively push in your lane is Runaan's Hurricane. It fires out two extra ranged bolts and also applied on hit effects, utilizing your passive skill. However, this item may lose some of its usefulness when playing in PVP mode due to Twitches high damage output usually being required by your team (so a more single target damage focus build is needed).
The Infinity Edge grants 250% critical damage. Pairing this with your ultimate ability (Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat) will inflict massive damage and will give your team an upper hand when in team fights.

Darius' passive ability is Hemorrhage.,
Darius's Q ability is Decimate.,
Darius's W ability is Crippling Strike.,
Darius's E ability is Apprehend.,
Darius's final ability, his ultimate, is Noxian Guillotine.,
Early game.,
Mid game.,
Late game and team fights.,
The recommended summoner spells for Darius are Ignite and either Flash or Ghost.,
For masteries, take 9/21/0.,
For runes, use Marks of attack damage, Seals of armour, Glyphs of magic resist and Quintessences of attack damage.

,
As a general rule, build magic resist, armour and attack damage in items.",How to Play Darius in League of Legends," Every time Darius lands a basic attack or his Q, a stack of Hemorrhage is applied to the enemy hit. The effect lasts for 5 seconds and can be stacked up to 5 times on one enemy.


Hemorrhage has 2 effects, the first deals damage to enemy target for its 5 second duration, the second gives Darius a 5% movement speed bonus for each enemy with Hemorrhage applied.;
, When activated, Darius spins his axe in a full circle dealing 70/105/140/175/210 damage to each enemy hit. If you hit an enemy in the outer part of the circle, with the axe blade rather than the handle, the damage dealt is increased by 50%.

, When activated, Darius's next basic attack will deal 120/140/160/180/200% bonus damage. This scales depending on your level. It will also slow the struck enemy's movement and attack speed by 20/25/30/35/40% for 2 seconds.


The cooldown on Crippling Strike is reduced by 1 second for every stack of Hemorrhage that is applied on the enemy attacked.

, Apprehend has an active and a passive function, the passive part grants Darius increased armour penetration by 5/10/15/20/25%. The active is a hook-back ability that is cast in a cone (in whichever direction the player chooses) that will pull all enemy champions and/or minions that are in the cone.


Be very choosy when you cast Apprehend at low levels, it has a long cooldown in early game.

, Noxian Guillotine deals a base true damage of 160/250/340, and the damage dealt is increased by 20% for every stack of Hemorrhage on the target, so the maximum damage possible is 320/500/680.


The best feature of Noxian Guillotine is the feature that if the ability kills an enemy champion, the cooldown will reset and you can recast it within 12 seconds. If you kill another champion within that time, this time is refreshed again and you have another 12 seconds to recast.

, In the laning phase you should look to maximize damage output by hitting enemy champions with the outer part of Decimate. You can also position yourself in the middle of a minion group to farm the wave quickly and efficiently this way.


Don't play too aggressively before level 6 when you get your ultimate. Keep poking with your Q and if you're under your own tower, try pulling a champion with Apprehend to try to bait him into attacking you under the tower. Darius can pick up easy, safe kills early on this way.

, Once you have your ultimate, look to really dominate your lane by getting the enemy to around mid-health (this is somewhat dependent on your opposing top laner. If they're quite tanky, keep poking until they're below half health.) and then committing to a kill attempt.






When you commit to the kill, land your Q and some basic attacks to add Hemorrhage before using Crippling Strike to slow them down, continue auto-attacking and Decimate, save Apprehend until they start escaping and then use Noxian Guillotine to finish them off.

, In team fights, try to find the right balance between tanking some damage, but not dying early in the fight. Darius will be most useful when the enemy team are low and he can use his ultimate multiple times.


One of the major things to do in a team fight as Darius is to try picking off an enemy with Apprehend and pulling them into your team for a free kill. Be careful though, it will pull in ALL enemies in the cast zone, so be careful not to overwhelm your team by pulling in most of the opposition team.

, Ghost will allow you to keep a fight going longer, so that is the slightly better option.

, Build attack damage in offense, and armour, magic resist, and health in defense.

,, Take Doran's shield first, then build into Ninja Tabi or Mercury Treads for your boots, hexdrinker and sunfire cape for early defensive items. For offensive items build Last Whisper or The Bloodthirster and Ravenous Hydra. Defensive should be Maw of Malmortius, and Frozen Mallet.

Gank!",How to Play an Offensive Twisted Fate on League of Legends," The recommended build for an offensive Twisted Fate is 21-0-9.;
, You will need attack speed runes. Invest in Greater Mark of Alacrity x9, Greater Seal of Alacrity x9, Greater Glyph of Alacrity x9, and Greater Quintessence of Alacrity x9.

, You're now ready to get into the game. Your recommended skills depend on what you think necessary. Exhaust is a helpful skill, Cleanse can save your life, Heal isn't too bad of an idea, and Flash is great for chasing enemy champions. If you haven't got much experience with Twisted Fate, go to a custom game so it won't count against you as you get used to him.

, Once in the game, you should choose Stacked Deck as your first skill. For shopping, buying Doran's Blade and a health potion is the recommended choice, but a Vampiric Scepter can also suffice.

, You want to build your skills up like so:


Stacked Deck
Pick A Card
Stacked Deck
Wild Cards
Stacked Deck
Destiny
Destiny > Stacked Deck > Pick A Card > Wild Cards

, Often, since Twisted Fate is a ranged attacker, he will be sent to the middle of the map (assuming you are playing in Summoner's Rift). Try to turret hug and stay behind your minions. Twisted Fate is an easy target early game.

, Once you have saved up 920 gold, you can return to your base and buy the Berserker's Greaves, which will enhance your movement by 2, and increase Attack Speed by 25%.

, Once you are level 6, attack enemies until your Stacked Deck is up to the count of 3 so that you will do the increased damage on your next attack. Return to your base and prepare a Gold Card. Press R to activate your Destiny skill, and then find a weak enemy champion to take out. Select a spot nearby, so that once you appear you will deal heavy damage and stun them. This will more than likely kill them.

, The Sword of the Divine will give you a much needed 60% boost in Attack Speed.

, Depending on the other team, you can go three different ways with another item in the shop. If you just want something typical and inexpensive, go with the Last Whisper. If the enemy team has many spellcasters, you might want to purchase the Wit's End. The recommended option is Madred's Bloodrazor, which is mandatory if the opposing side has at least 2 players with maximum health above 2000.

, If you are losing, definitely buy the Banshee's Veil. If you are winning, Banshee's Veil can be replaced with The Bloodthirster, Infinity Edge, or the Black Cleaver.

, Twisted Fate thrives off of ganking. Use Destiny to warp to weak targets, stun them, and kill them. This can also be used to save your teammates from approaching champions.

There are several roles you can play in the League. Marksman (ADC/Attack Damage Carry), Mage (APC/Ability Power Carry), Tank, Support, and Jungler. Each play an important role in the game.
The Marksman attacks from range, dealing physical damage. The marksman are accompanied by the support character.
The Mage, or APC, attacks and deals magic damage using a variety of spells.
The tank is the ""front line"" for the team. They build defensively, able to progressively take more and more damage.
The support aids the ADC (and later on the entire team). Whether the support has a slow, a stun (which is called crowd-control, or CC), or abilities to heal the ADC, they're very useful in the laning phase and are very important. The ADC depends on the support to get them ""fed"" (a lot of kills so they can be more useful late game).
The Jungler goes around to camps on the map, and killing them. At the same time, they can gank (ambush the enemy team for a kill) for their team, and provide kills for themselves or the lanes they're ganking. Good j=Junglers know routes, buffs, have good map awareness, and know when to gank.;
, Mechanics are the way the game works, and the way the champion works. Learn a bit about each role so you know what you could be matched up against. It's also good to learn about an enemy, and learn your boundaries.'


Learn how to farm. Farming is very important in League; it brings in income, which buys items, and items win games. Last-hitting is sometimes hard, especially when you're getting harassed down by the enemies.
Learn map awareness. Look at the mini-map frequently. Try looking every 5 seconds. Having map awareness can sometimes save you from a gank. If you see someone coming, knowing your champion, and how they work (also the same with the enemy champ) can help you get out alive. Make it a habit to look at the map. If you can't spare a glance at the mini-map, you're not in that hard a fight.
Learn how to ""juke"". Juking means going into a bush, going stealth, etc., waiting for the champ to find you, and go the other way. Juking can be hard to do at first, but it can keep you alive and put distance between you and your enemies.

,


For example, if you are playing Annie, learn what her Q, W, E, and R does, her passive, her builds, and how she can initiate or escape a fight.

The Q, for most champions, is the thing that does damage (such as Caitlyn's Q; Piltover Peacemaker).
The W, for most champions, usually gives a boost (such as Varus's W; Blighted Quiver).
The E, for most champions, is utility or gives a bit of damage. For ADCs, it gives damage. For mages, could be a shield or power-up. It depends on what champion you're playing.
The R, or ultimate, is the handiest ability for any champion. It gives them a boost, it gives them more damage, it can heal, stun, etc., and has a long cooldown.



,

Champion passives are very useful; make the most of them.

, Find out what each ability does on your champion. Learn combos (ways to use your champion, in one fell swoop to hopefully get the enemy low, or even kill them).

, See what items work best with your champion. Look up builds online, and ask for help from friends on League.

, You can look up champion counters online. Just study them, and learn to counter pick.

, Runes and masteries are little boosts that help you early game. You don't need runes until at least level 20 (so don't buy them pre-level 20), and you get mastery points per level (up to 30). Find out what runes and masteries are best for your champion.

, It's not going to be easy to master a champion. You have to put time and energy into it. You need knowledge of what your champion, and enemy champion, is capable of.


Learn from your mistakes. You aren't going to be a pro player from reading a few guides. The best way to learn, is by doing. Make note of your mistakes, and try to do better next time.
Try out new things with your champ. Find new builds, make new plays, etc..

Learn to Counter-Jungle.",How to Jungle in League of Legends," In League of Legends one of the most important parts of jungling is, picking the correct champion. Pick a champion who has skills which allow them to keep themselves alive in the jungle, like built in life lifesteal, shields, and/or health regen. You must also look for champions with gap closers so that you can assist, or ""gank"", your teammates' lanes. Some junglers include Warwick, Master Yi, Vi, Lee Sin, Rek'sai, Cho'Gath, Pantheon, Xin Zhao, Kha'Zix, Graves, and many more.;
, With every jungler, you should begin with hunter's machete or hunter's talisman, as many health potions as you can buy or a 150 health canteen, which allows you to heal many times before returning to base to refill, and a warding trinket. You should probably buy the yellow one (standard ward) first and then get the red one (sweeping lens) later. (The raptors give you an ability to see enemy wards, so you won't need the red one unless the enemy keeps killing the raptors.) Pick one that most suits both your style of play and the champion you are playing. You should enchant your jungle item as soon as you can, depending on your champion and desired stats (see item build section).

The ""Tracker's Knife"" allows you to place ""wards"" on the map to increase vision for your team.
The ""Stalkers blade"" allows you to cast smite on an enemy champion and applies a slow, which is useful for ganking and chasing enemies.
The ""Skirmisher's Sabre"" also allows you to smite an enemy champion and ""marks"" them for 4 seconds. The mark grants vision of the champion and makes you deal extra true damage from your basic attacks.

, The items you purchase should be dependent on three things: the champion you are playing, the enemy team's composition, and your team's composition.

Your champion:

For junglers who are meant to do large amounts of physical damage (for example Master Yi), build items with attack damage.
Junglers who do more magic damage (like Fiddlesticks) should build ability power.
Some junglers, like Amumu, are better when they build health, armor and/or magic resist (also known as ""building tanky"").


The enemy team's composition:

If the enemy team is comprised of mostly AD champions, consider building some armor.
Likewise, if the enemy team deals mostly magic damage, build some magic resist.
If you are building attack damage and the enemy team is building a lot of armor, buy a least one armor penetration item. Last Whisper, Youmuu's Ghostblade, and Black Cleaver are some examples.
Similarly, if you are building magic damage and the enemy team is prioritizing magic resist, build magic penetration items such as Haunting Guise or Void Staff.


Your team's composition:

If possible, it is good to have a balance of attack damage, magic damage, and tanky stats on your team. If you already have heavy attack damage and magic damage carries, you may be able to contribute more to your team by building some tank stats and ""peeling"" for your carries.
If your team lacks a distinct carry in attack damage or magic damage, consider building whichever of these is appropriate for your champion.








Upgrading you jungler item into ""enchantments"" can help you complete your build while saving one extra slot for more stats.

For ""tanky"" champions, e.g. Amumu or Volibear, Cinderhulk is a must.
If your champion scales more with AD, or Attack Damage, the Warrior enchantment gives a lot of AD. Some examples of AD junglers include Vi, Xin Zhao, and Graves.
AP, or ability power, junglers can upgrade to Runic Echoes. Junglers such as Diana, Shaco, Ekko, and Fiddlesticks are examples of AP champs.
Finally, if your champions are more reliant on autoattacks/attack speed, such as Master Yi, Bloodrazor increases their attack speed by a lot.



, Smite will help you kill large monsters quickly, and secure the team objectives of ""Dragon"" and ""Baron"" (see below). As Smite does a significant amount of true damage, it can be used to finish off large monsters with no worries of any enemy player stealing the kill. For your second summoner spell, it is most common to take flash. Ghost is a pretty good summoner spell, but ghost can't get you over walls, just flash can.) With certain champions, you can also make use of teleport, ignite or exhaust as your other summoner spell. As an example, many Shaco players take Ignite or Exhaust, allowing them to play very aggressive early game and adding to their kill potential. Or, if you feel like you need to travel across the map more often to gank or take down towers, dragons, or barons faster, teleport is a viable spell, esp. with champions that rely on attack speed.

, Create a new Mastery Page, and distribute points based on survivability (Health/Armor/Regen) and damage to minions/monsters. ""Mandatory"" masteries for this role are Runic Affinity, Dangerous Game, Wanderer, and Explorer to help you make use of your ganks and jungle buffs.

You also should think of your Masteries like free items or runes, so the rules on what items to build apply to Masteries as well.

, Perhaps you want to have increased survivability, inflict more damage, or move faster around the map. A specific rune page for the jungling role will have to be built prior to the match. A typical rune distribution is Flat Armor Seals, Flat Damage Marks, Scaling Magic Resist Glyphs, and Movement Speed Quintessences. However you should customize these runes to your champion and play style, as suggested in the item build section..

, If you have extra gold after recalling and buying items, buy Vision Wards (aka ""pink wards""). Warding can be extremely advantageous if used correctly. Vision of enemy champions in their own jungle or in the river can make the difference between a death and a kill by allowing your team to back away from an incoming gank. Typical ward locations either border the river, secure vision of team objectives (Dragon/Baron), or can even be used to ""Counter-Jungle""


Building Sightstone or Tracker's Knife can help you place more wards at a time, though you are limited to putting three wards in the map for until a ward reaches it's 90-second time limit.
Also, don't forget to upgrade your trinkets to allow better vision of your opponents. Consider upgrading to Oracle Attention to spot stealth champions so that they can't perform surprise attacks on you.

, If you can convince the nearby lane to help with the first camp, it will increase the speed and safety of your first clear. Use potions as you take damage to maintain your health. After you've cleared your jungle (especially if you are low HP) you should upgrade your hunter's machete into one of the four jungle items discussed earlier.


The most common jungle routes are to start at your bottom side buff (red for blue side and blue for red side) followed by wolves for blue side and gromp for red side. Next, you want to do your top side buff and finally proceed to river to kill the scuttle crab. This route allows you flexibility to either look for a gank top or mid, invade the enemy jungle, or continue farming.
Reminder- ""Blue"" and ""Red"" objectives have a 5:00 minute respawn timer. Note when they will respawn. Keeping these buffs on your champion will help immensely with your jungling and ganking (see below). In the meantime, continue to clear out the rest of your jungle as monsters respawn.
Always save your smite for the last hit on large/epic jungle monsters, to ensure the kill. In higher levels, the enemy jungler will try to steal your buffs, and if you waste your smite, then they can steal the buffs away from you with their smite. 

, ""Ganking"" is the term used for ambushing an enemy unexpectedly from the side or behind. Typically a teammate will call for a gank if an opposing player has moved too far toward your team's turret. However, a good jungler will keep an eye on the mini map to spot these situations. Be sure to communicate with your teammate that you are attempting a gank, either through chat or map pings.

, An opposing ward will see you coming for a gank and spoil your attempts at a kill. If your allies are desperate for a gank, have them place a pink ward in the area to gain vision of enemy wards.

, If one of your lanes is ganked by the opposing team, the ensuing fight usually lasts a short period. Spot this as early as possible and head in the direction of the fight to help out. Even if you are late to the engagement, you may be able to finish off an enemy champion who is left at low life or save an ally.

, If your teammate is busy buying items or simply somewhere else on the map, minions in their lane will begin pushing toward your team's turret. Step in and prevent this by killing the minions, which will also give you additional gold and experience. Make sure to communicate with your lane player first, as sometimes they will become angry. If you are going to push a lane, try your best to push the minion wave all the way to the enemy tower to deny experience and gold from the enemy.

, These ""boss-like"" neutral monsters provide global gold and experience for your team, and can be the difference between a win and a loss. Dragon spawns at 2:30, with a 6:00 re-spawn timer, while Baron spawns at 20:00 with a 7:00 re-spawn timer. Both of these objectives will more than likely require teammate assistance to kill (especially Baron). A good tactic is to place a Pink Ward in the area to prevent enemy vision prior to engaging either of these objectives. It is also best to attempt these when your team has sufficient map control over the enemy team.

, Middle Champions are usually mana based, and therefore benefit immensely from the increased Mana Regeneration and Cooldown Reduction of the blue buff (technically known as the Crest of Insight). If you decide to do this, ping the Blue Sentinel for their assistance. This will inform them to move over and kill it with you.

, Once you are comfortable, doing so will not only give you extra experience and gold, but also denies these buff advantages from the opposing team. This is best achieved by warding the enemy jungle appropriately to give vision of these areas. A strong player can also time not only their own buff respawns, but also those of the opposing team for maximum effectiveness. When you go to steal a buff, keep an eye on enemies in the nearby lanes and retreat if you see them coming to stop you.

, Once enemies are shown on the map, it will show their most current items. Check to see if there are any enemies with wards and assess whether or not they have placed down the ward or not. Get an idea of which lane is best to gank. For example, if you see bot lane did not purchase wards, it could be best to gank them while they have limited vision.

, Counter-Jungling is farming the enemy's jungle. This can put the enemy behind in experience and gold, making them a lesser threat. Note that the enemy can do the same to you, if you are preoccupied in their territory.

Kite!,
Learn auto-attack cancelling.",How to Kite in League of Legends,"  There are many ways to kite as an ADC.  Some people prefer to use the move command (right click) and individually click their targets while others like to use the attack command (A key by default.).  There is also the attack click command that you can use which aren't bound to anything by default and that you can bind to something convenient like a mouse button.;
,  Choose an ADC and then practice moving and attacking using your favorite technique.  The goal is to try and put out as many basic attacks as you can while taking the least damage possible.  You can also practice this with jungle camps.

,


Attack an enemy target with right click, attack move click or attack move.
Move command click (right click) in the opposite direction
Attack the target again
Move command in the direction you want to escape
Repeat until target is dead

,  Auto attack canceling means moving before your basic-attack animation is completed.  This is different for any champion but essentially once you see your projectile has been launched you can move again.  You do not have to wait until the animation is complete.  This is a useful tool that can significantly increase the amount of basic attacks you can dish out in a certain timeframe.

It's important that the taming item you have is for the right monster, or it will fail.
After clicking, a slot machine will appear, and you must click again to get a chance at taming the monster.
If you fail at this point, you will lose the taming item and get no pet or item.
If you succeed, you will receive a pet egg.
Note that the success rate is unaffected by stats, reduced HP, or by using the skill Provoke.
Alice requires taming item Soft Apron. Food needed is White Potion. Alice gives MDEF +1, Demi Human Resistance +1%.
Deviruchi requires taming item Contract in Shadow. Food needed is Shoot, and it can wear an accessory named Pacified. Deviruchi gives ATK/MATK +1% and HP/SP -3%
Dokebi requires taming item Old Broom. Food needed is Pet Food, and it can wear the accessory Wig. Dokebi gives MATK +1% and ATK -1%.
Evil Nymph requires taming item Charming Lotus. Food needed is Morning Dew. Nymph gives SP+30 and increases SP Recovery.
Green Maiden requires taming item Tantan Noodle. Food needed is Bun. Maiden gives Def +1 and Demi Human Resistance +1.
Hunter Fly requires taming item Monster Juice. Food needed is Red Gemstone, and it can wear the accessory Monster Oxygen Mask. Hunter Fly gives Flee -5 and Perfect Dodge +2.

Zealotus requires taming item Forbidden Red Candle. Food needed is Immortal Heart. Zealotus gives ATK +2% and MATK damage to Demi Human +2%.;
, Another way to obtain a pet is by using the Sage skill Hocus Pocus. This allows pets whose taming items are currently unobtainable in the game to be tamed, with the risk that their food item may also be unavailable and thus must remain inside their egg.


With the current updates, devs are working on with the food and, hopefully, bonus stats to monsters that are not in the pet list.
To use Hocus Pocus, simply cast it on the monster you wanted to catch. Once successful, the item will automatically go in your inventory.

, If you don't have the luxury of hunting taming items nor have a Sage character to use Hocus Pocus, you can always buy pets from other players. Pets are cheap due to the fact that many people obtain taming items during their leveling or questing.


Pets can only be traded when they're in egg form.

, To tame a Bongun, you will need Her Heart taming item. Her Heart can be created from 1 Girl's Diary and 1 Daenggie. Once you obtained the two ingredients, simply talk to Munak's Grandma found in Comodo (comodo 112, 182).


Bongun gives VIT + 1 and Stun Resistance +1%
Girl's Diary and Daenggie are dropped by Munak at Payon Cave 3.

, To tame a Rocket, you will need Singing Flower. You can create Singing Flower using 1 Singing Plant. Simply meet Monster Tamer in Alberta Tool Shop (alberta_in 173,76), and he will give you a Singing Flower.


Rocker gives HP Recovery +5% and HP +25.

Orc Warrior gives ATK +10 and DEF -3.
Chivalry Emblem is dropped by Raydric and Khalitzburg at Glast Heim Chivalry.

, You will need No Recipient for Munak. To create the taming item, you need 1 Old Portrait and then take it to the Monster Tamer at Izlude Tool Shop (izlude_in 128, 64).


Munak gives INT +1 and DEF +1.
Old Portrait is dropped by Bongun at Payon Cave.

, Once you have obtained a pet egg, you will need a Pet Incubator to hatch it. To hatch the egg, simply click on the incubator and then click on the egg you wish to hatch. Your pet will then appear.


You can also rename your pet through the pet window and can only be done once.
To return the pet into its egg, just right-click on the pet and choose the selection. You will need an incubator to hatch the pet again. If your pet is wearing an accessory, there's no need to remove it.
Pet Incubators can be purchased from Pet Groomer in every city of the game.

, As soon as your pet hatches, feed it. To feed a pet, right-click on it and choose Feed Pet. For cost savings when working toward Loyal, only feed it when it's hunger is at Hungry.


To tame your pet faster, feed it when it is at neutral, but do not feed it any earlier than that.
Also, your pet will show an emote to let you know it has eaten, giving you an “Ok.”
If you continue to feed it, the pet will give you “Hmm” or “pif.”
Feeding it more while it's stuffed will cause your pet to show “Omg” and die.

, In order for your pet to reach Loyal, you need to increase their intimacy. A pet is given a random number of intimacy points between 250 and 399 when it's first hatched. Feeding your pet will increase its intimacy depending to its level and hunger.


Higher level pets get less intimacy per feeding, and vice versa.
A pet's hunger level is classified using the following terms: “Very hungry,” “hungry,” “neutral,” “satisfied,” and “stuffed.”
When the owner dies, the pet's intimacy decreases by 15 points.

Level the Homunculus' Intimacy.",How to Make Homunculus in Ragnarok Online," Amistr is the best base for a Homunculus but also the slowest to level and feed due to its lack of offensive skills. If you have a lot of time in your hands, you’re well-advised to get Amistr. Leveling may take time but well worth the wait and effort.


Amistr is a sturdily-built, tank-type Homunculus suitable for classes that have low defenses, such as wizards and healers.
Amistr eats Zargon.
It has these four skills:


Castling. Instantly switches the location of Amistr and its master, causing the monster to change target and focus on Amistr instead.

Amistr Bulwark. Temporarily increases Amistr and its master's VIT.

Adamantium Skin. Increases Amistr's Max HP, HP recovery rate, and defense.

Blood Lust. Temporarily increases Amistr's ATK, plus a chance to leech 20% of the damage as HP for each hit.


Amistr Bulwark is very useful for MVP later on in the game. It boosts your VIT and even gives valuable defense for PVP.;
, Filir is the fastest-leveling Homunculus in the game. Its downside is its lack of VIT. It’s quick to level, yes, but it sure dies a lot. If you don’t have time to level your Homunculus, Filir will be a good choice, but don’t expect it to withstand fierce attacks.


Filir is a dodge/high-ASPD type, meaning it has a high-dodge and high-attack speed.
Filir eats Garlet.
It also has four skills:


Moonlight. Commands Filir to repeatedly peck at its target.

Flitting. Temporarily increases Filir's ATK and ASPD.

Accelerated Flight. Temporarily increases Filir's flee rate.

S.B.R.44. Commands Filir to deal massive damage on its target at the cost of its Intimacy.



, Vanil is the in-between solution to Amistr and Filir. This Homunculus offers high VIT and HP, and has a decent offensive skill. However, it comes with a lower burst attack compared to Filir, which makes for slower leveling in certain situations. Nevertheless, Vanil can be powerful and has skills that can throw random elements at enemies.


Vanilmirth is a magic-type Homunculus.
It eats Scell.
Vanilmirth’s four skills are:


Caprice. Can cast magical attacks randomly, such as Fire Bolt, Cold Bolt, Lightning Bolt, and Earth Spike. The level of each one can be affected by Caprice’s skill level.

Chaotic Blessings. Can cast Heal on a random target selected from among enemies, the master, or itself. Heal can restore the HP of the Undead instead of inflicting damage.

Instruction Change. Increases Vanil's STR and INT. Also increases its master's chance of successfully brewing potions.

Self-Destruction. Commands Vanilmirth to self-destruct, inflicts splashed damage proportionate to Vanil's Max HP that pierces the defense, and ignores the flee rate of the enemies in range. If the Homunculus successfully destroys itself, the intimacy will be reduced to 1, i.e., Hate with Passion.



, Not worthy to be used as a base since it has no practical use, Lif is mostly a novelty character. It’s useless in battles due to having low attack, having no burst attacks, and having a weak Heal skill.


Lif is a support-type of Homunculus.
It eats Pet Food.
Lif has these skills:


Healing Hands. Restores its master's HP with a method that mimics the Acolyte's Heal skill. Each cast will require a Condensed Red Potion.

Urgent Escape. Temporarily increases Lif’s and her master's movement speeds.

Brain Surgery. Increases Lif's max SP, SP Recovery, and the effectiveness of its healing hands.

Mental Charge. Changes Lif so that her attacks are based on MATK instead of ATK for a short duration. This also increases VIT by 30 and INT by 20 per skill level.



, Once you’ve homed in on the Homunculus that you want, gather what you need to create it.


The first thing you will need is an Embryo, which you can either purchase from other Alchemists or make yourself with materials bought at Al de Baran Material Selling, located in Alchemist Building (alde_alche 35,179).
You also require the Pharmacy and Bioethics Platinum Skills.
Make sure to purchase Seed of Life, Morning Dew of Yggdrasil, and Glass Tube.
Purchase the Potion Creation Guide and Medicine Bowl at the other building, Gever Al Sharp, located at alde_alche 22, 188.

, To make an Embryo, use the skill Prepare Potion along with the materials from Al de Baran Material Selling.


Possessing all the skills needed, start by using your Pharmacy skill, and a list will appear showing you the names of the potions you can create, including the Embryo. Choose “Embryo” and click “OK” to create it.
After acquiring an Embryo, use the skill Call Homunculus to summon the Homunculus.
At first, the Embryo will give you one of the four Homunculi at random, and one of the two sprites available for each type of Homunculus. Keep on creating and destroying until you find Homunculus you want.

, Your Homunculus can grow and turn into a stronger companion. When the Homunculus' Intimacy reaches Loyal, you can use a Stone of Sage to evolve it.


With evolution, the Homunculus will obtain a random bonus for each of the stats, increased max HP and max SP, and a new sprite.
After evolving, the Intimacy of your Homunculus resets to 10 (Hate). Once you gain the Intimacy to Loyal again, a new skill is unlocked.

, You can manually control your Homunculus should you desire it with the following commands:


Alt + Single Right-Click will target the monster.
Alt + Double Right-Click attacks the monster.
Alt + T puts your Homunculus on standby, idle, cancels all commands, and returns to the master's side.
Alt + Right-Click Ground makes your Homunculus move to that location, with 15 tiles being the maximum range.
Alt + R opens up the Homunculus window where you can see all the status of your companion.
Note that if the master is dead, the manual commands cannot be used.

, AI is the brain behind the Homunculus, controlled by an AI script that can be replaced by a custom-made AI. The default script is both poorly made and simple, giving your Homunculus a command to primarily kill everything or not attack anything at all. Therefore, it's advisable that you create your own script or use a pre-made one done by other users.


To install a new AI, with the newly downloaded or created script, go to the default Ragnarok Online directory. Generally it's located in C:\Program Files\Ragnarok Online\AI.
Insert the downloaded AI script into the USER_AI folder, and re-log or re-summon your Homunculus to have this activated.

, This is actually not allowed in the game, but some players like to take risks. A third-party program will be used to move the character around, feed the Homunculus, and even kill steals of other people.


A third-party program is an easy way to control your Homunculus and level while you're away, leaving the AI program to do the job for you.
Take note, however, that the player, the owner of the account, is held accountable and may be punished for using such a program.

, Just like pets, your Homunculus requires feeding. Every feeding gives your pet increased Intimacy.


Intimacy increases until it reaches the maximum level, a requirement so your Homunculus can evolve to the next stage.
Note that starving your Homunculus will decrease the Intimacy level of your pet.
Once the Intimacy level hits below zero, your Homunculus will leave its master.

, During leveling or a long hunting during the game, it's common that the owner will forget to feed his pet, leaving it to starve until it leaves. To avoid this, observe your Homunculus and take note of the emote it shows you.


Hunger below 11% will make your Homunculus show a /sob emote every 20 seconds.
The player who feeds without the proper item makes the Homunculus use /swt.
The player who feeds at 1%–75% receives a /ho.
The player who feeds at 75%–90% receives a /swt2.
For 91%–100%, you get a /wah.
“Failed to use skill” gets /...., while “Failed to evolve” receives /hmm.

, Intimacy is crucial for evolution since it gives your Homunculus a better stat and a chance to obtain the final skill. Sadly, the Homunculus window doesn't show the percent of Intimacy but nevertheless shows the status.


1–3 Intimacy shows “Hate with Passion”
4–10 Intimacy shows “Hate”
11–100 Intimacy shows “Awkward”
101–250 Intimacy shows “Shy”
251–750 Intimacy shows “Neutral”
751–910 Intimacy shows “Cordial”
911–1,000 Intimacy shows “Loyal”
Once your Homunculus reaches Loyal, you can evolve it to its next level. To increase the Intimacy, make sure to feed your Homunculus on time.
If your Homunculus is very active during battle, the hunger decreases quickly. The faster the hunger decreases, the more you feed. The more you feed, the quicker the Intimacy grows.

Start off by buying a few items from BVO (Bearville Outfitters).,
Register a bear if you haven't already.,
Buy doubles of items, as well as different colours, keeping one for yourself and one to trade.,
Buy Halloween costumes during the Halloween season.,
If you haven't already, begin trading.,
Do not sell any items, especially exclusive ones.,
Be patient.",How to Get Rare Items on Buildabearville," A lot of people usually cannot buy items from BVO because you must by credits with real money.;
, This is a big part in getting rare items. Try to register exclusive bears as these bears are limited edition, thus making their items rare. Once you register them, you receive PSIs (Pet Special Items) which would most likely become rare.

, This will result in spending a lot of bearbills, but as you learn, these items may become rare. The embroidered top, for example, has become one of the rarest items on Bearville.

, Many people like the Pirate Belts, so it's good to have a couple handy. Also, stock up on Ballerina and Glitter Fairy costumes.

, Don't worry about people stealing your items; you can always cancel the trade if you don't want to trade an item.

, These items could become rare in a couple of months. Do not sell them just because you need Bearbills or more space in your inventory. If you need more space, put any unimportant items, doubles of items and Pawlette Coufur Boutique items in an attic.

, You won't automatically get every rare item in a day, for most people, it takes over a year to get Bunny Glasses or any other extreme rare item. You would be making a lot of trades, but someday you would reach your goal.

"

First, if you are just now making an account, you're going to need more bearbills.,
Next go to the Bee Stylin' Salon.,
Make sure to match the hairstyle to the skin tone.,
If you are a girl, check out the faces that have makeup on them.,
I would also recommend a hairstyle that has two different color tones in it.

Now go to the Pawlette Coufur Boutique and start looking at different clothes.,

Members gain access to several new adventures that can get you the black long spiked collar. Spikes are also only for members if you want to get them through adventures, so membership is required.;
, Make sure your animal is just high enough so you can complete larger adventures. Meet Cosmo is the last non member adventure, and requires level 4 animals to do hard mode. Member adventures that are above that level require higher levels.


Complete the adventures that you have access to first to gain courage for your level. Go on the higher adventures once your animal is leveled up enough.

, This is the only member adventure that is known to reward spikes. Host this adventure with four other eagles/owls and work on getting the purple crystal shards.


To get each of the purple shards in this adventure, have your eagles fly down until you reach a rock formation. Have each eagle sit on each rock tower on the formation until an arrow appears. Follow wherever the arrow points to, and it will lead you to the next formation. Do this again until another arrow appears. Repeat this five times until you get a purple shard. Repeat this same exact process until you get all five crystal shards.

, There are a ton of member prizes that are rewarded on the Forgotten Desert adventure, and one of them are rare spikes, including the black long spiked collar.

, It's extremely rare, but spikes can actually be rewarded from green shards, and that's rarer than getting one from a ground chest (which is possible - see the animal jam wiki wikia for proof). Open all ground chests just in case as well - it's very rare, but a black long may actually be rewarded from there too. Yellow, blue, and even white shards also have higher chances of rewarding a black long or other rare spikes.

, Try trading or getting people to trade small den or clothing betas for your rares. Small tables, Cami Frogs, Rocking Horses and Jamaaliday Bows can get you started on for the next step.

, They are all good betas. Try getting one of those below is a good way to get even rarer:


Wallpaper
Flooring
Archways
Mech Angel Helmets
Beta Elf Tail Armors
Glitched Nerd Glasses.

, Start off with short wristbands, then trying to go for long wrists, then short collars.

, Trade for spikes for a glitched item is fair enough. Glitched items are very rare and most people will want them for their headdress. To trade for a glitched item, start finding some person who is willing to trade their glitched item. You should start trading them, then ask what to change or add. They will think you will be changing good enough for their item. They will probably accept before you know it. But don't try to anger them. They might leave, and decline your offer.

, If you get a rare Headdress, it's extremely hard to get a non rare one. If you get a Headdress using the same method by telling the person to add or not, you're lucky! Never give up.

There are some glitches that may help you complete the adventure way more easily. The last few clovers are very hard to find. This glitch may be patched, but there are others as well. One glitch is when you click the paw print on one clover several times, you can get more than one clover at a time. You can get 6 clovers out of one just by clicking the paw print more. Consider using a flying animal to get around faster.

Ask a trustworthy buddy.",How to Get a Rare Black Long Collar on Animal Jam3," Do not search up animal jam guides - anything on the Internet about that is usually outdated and inaccurate anyways. For example, about 62 den betas, 4 good longs, or 6 bad longs and add small is worth a black long. Here is a list of the bad longs and good longs:


Bad longs

Yellow long
Orange long
Green long
Pink long


Good longs

Purple long
Blue long
Red long
Black long (cannot be traded for another black long though)



, If you are rare, people will be more likely to make a deal with their black long collar with one of your items.

, More than one den beta are worth rare spikes, and people will probably accept if you make a fair deal for them. Go on adventures and get den betas from them, or trade for den betas themselves. Put them up on trade and say something such as ""My list for , jag or go to my den if deal."" You may even get an acception.

, Some examples are multiple neon bows and arrows, other spikes, large numbers of den betas, etc. Trade for those items first, or get them in adventures. Try the Forgotten Desert adventure a few more times. Top hats, den betas, neon bows and arrows (this a rare non member item that is worth a red short collar - you might get lucky and be traded a black short or an orange long), and clothing betas (mech angel helmets, non member rares, etc.) can be rewarded from there, as well as a number of other spikes and rares.

, Go to Jamaa Township and dance to get their attention. Say something such as ""Betas and glitched items on trade,"" or ""My list for a black long.""

, Go to the Coral canyons and call out for trades there. Frequently, jammers go there to trade betas for spikes, and you might as well do it too. Say things like ""My den if you will trade me long black collar for my list,"" or something similar.

, Ask if they have an extra black long or if you can trade them something to get one. If your buddy says, if I get another one I'll give it to you, then you're probably sure to get one. Do adventures with your buddies to get a black long collar, and you might just be able to win one, or trade them if you'd like.

Classic - In this mode, the players work to destroy the enemy’s Nexus (or base structure).
Dominion - In this mode, the point of the game becomes about taking control of a number of capture points or locations (which are very similar to the turrets encountered in Classic mode. This gamemode was removed in February 22, 2016.)
ARAM - In this mode, all of the player’s champions are chosen at random, and it is intended for all players to fight together in the central road (or lane).;
, In a co-op vs. AI game, you will play on a team with other player controlled characters against computer controlled opponents (or bots).


Only Classic mode is available when playing this type of game.

, In a custom game, you can choose the number of players, as well as password protect it to ensure that only your friends can play. The opposing team can either be other players or bots.

, Choosing the map means choosing what environment you play in. It also affects how many players will be on a team and what game types are available. These are easy to see, so choose whatever map fits the criteria you want.

, The game type determines how the champions are chosen. In a blind pick, players cannot see which champions have been chosen. In a draft pick, players take turns banning the use of and then choosing certain champions. Ranked games are more competitive in nature and consist of game-ranked players being matched according to experience.

, You can play with your friends in any game type. Simply click ""I will invite my own teammates"" when prompted in the bottom right corner after choosing the last option (either game type or difficulty).

, Riot Points, which are purchased with real money and viewed at the top right of the screen next to your name, are used to buy new champions (other than the rotating free champions), new appearances or skins for your champions, or boosts (which increase the rate at which you earn Influence Points).

, Influence points are the other type of in-game currency, except that they are earned by playing games. These can be used to permanently unlock champions, purchase Runes, or purchase additional Rune Pages.


It's highly suggested that you don't build any runes until you have unlocked several champions due to the high costs. However, if you must buy runes for any reason, start with level 1 runes.

, After joining a match you will choose your champion (or have one chosen for you). What character you choose is really important, so don’t choose one just because they look cool. Choose your character based on how you play best and based on what your team needs. There are many rolesbut here are a few:


Tanks are champions with high health and magic resistance, who should generally be on the front lines. They deal low damage, but aid their team by drawing the enemy’s attention.
Fighters are similar to tanks but deal more damage. Their usual purpose is to backup weaker champions.
Marksmen are champions who are relatively weak, in terms of defense, but do great long range attacks. They are frequently targets for the enemy, so they will likely need to be protected. Mages are highly similar to marksmen.
Support champions are there to help any member of their team who needs help. They usually have an ability to shield or heal their allies.
Assassins are champions who do a high amount of damage in short bursts. They focus on killing enemies quickly and remaining hidden between kills.

, Attributes determine the effectiveness of the armor, the amount of health your champion has, and the amount of magical power (or mana) that they can draw from. Each character has a major attribute (one which is higher than the others) which greatly determines how they will play. Attributes increase with level.


Attack power determines how much damage a champion can do with basic attacks. A high attack power generally makes for a good marksman.
Defense power determines characteristics like the champions armor level, making them harder to damage. Characters with high defense power make good tanks.
Ability power determines how often the champion can use their abilities. This is similar to mana or stamina in other games. Characters with a high ability power are generally meant to use abilities often, so be sure you are acquainted with how to use your characters abilities.

, When you first enter the map, you will be placed next to the store, where you should buy some items. You can purchase consumables (potions and similar items), items which fortify your attributes, armaments to protect yourself with, and magical items (if your character is so inclined).


The type of items you should buy depends on what your champion's strengths are.

Marksmen should only look at Damage items or items with Attack Damage, Attack Speed, Critical Strike chance, or armor penetration. The only defensive item that should be built is life steal since health is being generated by the damage dealt to enemies.
Fighters and assassins should also consider building AD, although building items with defensive stats, like Magic Resist, Armor, or Health, is recommended.
Tank builds are similar to fighter builds, but damage items are a much lower priority than defensive items.
Mages are similar to marksmen except instead of Damage items, Magic items, or items with mana, mana regen, Ability Power, or Magic Penetration, are the priority
Junglers need to make sure they build a jungler item, such as Tracker's Knife, Skirmisher's Sabre, or Stalker's Blade first before any other items.
Finally, supports need to have a Relic Shield with them at the start of the game. The other items they build should depend on what their strengths are.



, There are three main roadways on the classic Summoner’s Rift map (two in Twisted Treeline). These are called lanes. During the game, you and your enemies will largely be positioned in these lanes, in varying numbers, where you will fight for control in order to reach and destroy each other’s turrets and eventually the Nexus. You and your teammates will need to figure out how you want to handle your lanes.


To know what type of champions to pick for each role, there are ""meta"" choices that govern what champion type goes where.

Tanks and fighters are usually played in the top lane.
Mages and assassins should be chosen for mid-laners.
Champions who have gap-closers and good waveclear are played in the jungle.
Finally marksmen and support champions play in the bottom lane.



, Work together with your teammates to slowly kill the enemy. Remember, the goal is not to kill them but to instead destroy their turrets and Nexus. Remember that Minions, the little guys that you can’t control, are also part of your team. They are the key to winning the game and protecting yourself. They fight with enemy Minions and turrets, protecting you from damage, as both will default to killing them over you.


Stay behind the Minions as they are your line of defense.
Minions will spawn every 30 seconds and come in waves down the lanes.

, The game is won when the enemy’s main structure, called their Nexus, is destroyed. This structure is located on the opposite side of the map from where you begin. Progress your way there by destroying the intervening turrets that block your progress.


The other side of this, of course, is that the enemy team will be trying to destroy your turrets. Protect your turrets.

, Once you've destroyed 3 enemy turrets in one lane, you can destroy one of their inhibitors the same way. This one will not attack back. Once you have destroyed one, you will spawn waves of super minions. These are stronger than normal minions and have increased health. Use these to distract and eventually destroy the enemy base turrets and also their Nexus.

, Mostly you’ll be dealing with enemy Minions but you will also fight enemy champions and turrets. Attack the enemy but remember your focus on getting to their turrets (and eventually their Nexus). Don’t be stupid and don’t be impatient. Take your time and make smart kills.


Right clicking on enemies performs basic attacks.
Use and advance abilities over the course of the game. Abilities will be different for every character. They are assigned to keys which are defaulted to Q-R (each is labeled on the screen). Experiment with abilities and find the best ways to use them. Use them to help your teammates as well as yourself.

, Last hit is a very important part of playing League of Legends. Only the player who gets the last hit on an enemy or turret gets gold. Make sure you’re getting the last hit if your character is one that benefits from gold. One way to do this is to go in for the kill when you see an enemy’s health is low. Timing last hit is a learned skill.

, Don’t forget that there are neutral monsters in the jungles between the lanes who will attack you given opportunity. There is also the monster Baron Nashor lurking just off the lanes. He is powerful and deals a high amount of damage but killing him will give you several worthwhile rewards. Never take him on alone.

, Your health is represented by the green bar in the lower left as well as above your character. The easiest way to heal yourself is by returning to base, which is done by pressing the “B” key. You can also buy health potions but these are only helpful at the beginning of the game, when your overall health is low. Sometimes supporting characters can help with keeping you alive as well.

, The goal in strategy games like this one is not to get the most kills, but rather to stay alive. Doing this requires skill and patience. Dying is punished, as you will be missing out on experience and gold, and your teammates are going to take serious damage while they wait for you. If faced with the choice of making a kill or staying alive, always choose staying alive.

, When the game is over you will be shown the results screen. Here you can see every player's kills/deaths/assists during the game, as well as items purchased and minion kill amount. Also, if you look at the header you will see the amount of xp (or experience) your account gained and the amount of IP (influence points) your account gained. Also, the more XP you gain, the more levels your summoner account will gain, allowing you points in your masteries (which gives you extra help during games) and more rune pages (which are basically the same thing.) Another thing xp gives you is more options for summoner spells.

Know the layout.,
Pick a focus.,
When choosing a main, try to select a champion who has a somewhat high skill ceiling (Ex.,
Don't be afraid to dodge games.,
Know the goal of CS-ing.,
Practice CS-ing.,
Don't take unnecessary risks.,
Don't try too hard to make crazy plays.,
Pick your position.",How to Climb in League of Legends," In LOL, there are three lanes (top, mid, and bot) and a jungle containing neutral monsters between them. In each area, one or more players go there to get kills, earn gold, and get levels. In top lane, there is usually a tanky (high health and defensive stats) champion that focuses on getting farm and staying tanky. Mid lane has either an AP caster or assassin. Bot lane has two champions, a ranged Attack Damage Carry and a support. The jungle varies widely between tanky champions, mages, high damage melee champions, and more.;
, To climb, the easiest way is to focus on one or two champions in a specific role and play them until you know all of their ins and outs and have mastered them. This way, when you are playing in a ranked match you are confident and calm while playing this champion, which increases your win-rate. #* Don't worry too much about counter-picking, because in lower elos, more often than not a person who selected their main champion will beat someone who selected a counter to that champion yet aren't familiar with them. (Ex. A skilled Zed main is against an unskilled Kayle who technically counters Zed, but due to the Kayle's lack of skill he still loses lane to Zed.)

, Yasuo, Vayne, Riven, etc.), as you want room to grow. Also, choose someone who you enjoy playing even if you are bad at them right now, because once you start maining them you will get better easily. It's much more enjoyable to climb with a champion you love compared to a champion you dislike.

, If you don't get your role or main you are probably going to do poorly. Dodging only loses you 3 lp and a 5 minute wait, in comparison to a lost game which wastes 25-45 minutes of your time and subtracts up to ~23 lp. To dodge, you can wait until the timer for you to select a champion runs out, or simply closing the client and logging on again.

, In League, CS-ing is incredibly important. CS-ing is where you land the killing blow onto a minion, which grants you gold. Killing a melee minion grants about 19-23 gold, and a caster minion grants 15-18 gold (depending on how long the game has gone on). Even if you do not get a kill on your lane opponent, you can still easily win lane by CS-ing better than them. A kill is worth about 300 gold, so if you kill about 15 minions then that is equal to the gold gained by a kill. Additionally, kills are risky and inconsistent, yet minions are not. Why not practice getting more free gold?

, To practice, go into a custom game with no runes or masteries and practice last hitting by yourself for 10 minutes or so. Try to aim for about 80-95 minions in 10 minutes. In game, 70 minions by 10 minutes is a decent score that should help you out quite a bit.

, That means, don't try to dive them under tower if they have at least 1/4 health, don't run around the jungle by yourself with no wards, and tell your teammates to ping for mia and ping it yourself too. If you don't do it, why should they? Also, don't expect your teammates to listen to you, so just make a habit to watch the minimap on the side of your screen to check where enemies are.

, This one is pretty self explanatory. Don't try to make an Insect Lee Sin play if you can't do it 9 times out of 10. Be safe, and play fundamentally.

, People often don't realize that if they stand in the back as an ADC or mage or assassin, you can utilize your damage so much more and have a much bigger impact on the game if you position well. Please, please, wait for your team to initiate if you are an ADC!

Get your Blue Buff, if you are jungling, which is his primary role.,
Equip appropriately.,
Do not be afraid of lurking in a bush too long.,
Work with your team.,
Get to level 18.,
Play hard and have fun.

",How to Be Good at Kha'zix," Kha'zix thrives on being able to use all of his abilities as much as possible without running low on mana in the beginning stages; he will be taken down easily otherwise. He needs Damage and Health, so a good first item in the jungle is a Black Cleaver. Do not stay in lanes you gank too long, or you will attract too much attention and get focused on early.;
, Once you have a tanky build, which usually consists of Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, Bloodthirster, Sunfire Cape, and sometimes Guardian Angel, depending on the game, your main job turns from occasional ganker and farmer in the jungle to major assassin and ruthless killer all over the map. With your ultimate ability, get your Q ability first, then your wings, then your healing ability, then active camouflage (your ultimate). It's all a matter of getting stronger than the other team and taking down the weaker players so that you can get strong for the late game Team Fights.

, Sitting in a bush waiting for the moment is much better than standing in lane and using your ultimate when everyone can see you. Wait for your moment, use your ultimate and then pounce on your enemies. If you are going in alone, be aware of who you are fighting against and be more cautious.

, Ask questions, organise plans, etc. A team that communicates is better than the team that does not and already has a crushing advantage.

, With Kha'zix, the summary of use of abilities once you are full level 18: Ultimate, Leap, Q, W, (ultimate again if cooldown is up) and repeat. Of course, change the order if you see more fit or have to plan an escape. Always be in communication with your team, and have fun. Remember: it's all fun and games until somebody gets face-checked in the bush, then it gets hilarious.

Access League of Legends.,
Obtain Thresh as a playable champion.,
Familiarize yourself with Thresh's abilities:His passive ability is Damnation: Thresh does not gain armor per level.,
Set up your runes and masteries.,
Play a game as Thresh and select him as your champion.,
Actively collect souls left by defeating minions and champions.,
Use your Q ability (Death Sentence) effectively.,
Be generous with your W ability (Dark Passage).,
Be sensible with your E ability (Flay).,
Have a tactical approach with your ultimate (R) ability.,
Use the shop effectively.,
Carry on to practice playing with Thresh until you develop your own play style that ensures success of your team.

",How to Play As Thresh on League of Legends," If you have not already, this will entail creating an account and downloading the game at the League of Legends website and selecting your respective server (top left hand corner will let you select server).


It's recommended to create an account on the server that is geographically closest to you to negate some connectivity issues.;
, Thresh can be purchased in the in game store for either 975 RP or 6,300 IP (when not on sale). Or can be purchased through other players gifting you.

, Instead, Thresh collects the souls of dead enemies by approaching them or by placing Dark Passage's lantern nearby. Each soul permanently grants 0.75 armor and ability power. Champions and large minions and monsters always drop a soul. Small minions and monsters only sometimes drop a soul. A soul will only drop if the enemy unit dies within 1900 range of Thresh. Souls are visible to allies, and only become visible to enemies if the enemy team has vision of Thresh. Souls disappear if not picked up after 8 seconds.
His Q ability is Death Sentence: Active: After a 0.5 second wind-up, Thresh throws out his scythe in a line and forms a tether with the first enemy hit, dealing magic damage and stunning it for 1.5 seconds. Upon hitting an enemy, Death Sentence's current cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds. While the tether persists, Thresh cannot attack and he will periodically tug on the tether, each time pulling the target a short distance toward himself. After 0.5 seconds, or instantly if he hooks a minion or monster, Thresh can reactivate the ability to use Death Leap. Active - Death Leap: Thresh pulls himself to the bound enemy. This removes the stun but allows Thresh to attack again. Thresh loses the ability to activate Death Leap when the tether breaks.
His W ability is Dark Passage: Active: Thresh throws his lantern to the target location where it remains for up to 6 seconds. If an ally right-clicks the lantern, they will pick it up and will be pulled to Thresh's location. If Thresh moves more than ~1500 units away, the lantern will return to him. For the next 6 seconds, allies who come near the lantern (even while Thresh is holding it) gain a shield that absorbs damage for up to 4 seconds. Allies can only receive the shield once per cast.
His E ability is Flay: Passive: Thresh's basic attacks deal bonus magic damage on each hit. This value is equal to the total number of souls collected, plus a percentage of his attack damage based on the amount of time since his last attack. Active: Thresh sweeps his chain in a broad line towards a target direction. Enemies hit take magic damage, are knocked in the same direction as the chains, and are slowed afterwards for 1.5 seconds
His ultimate (R) ability is The Box: Active: After a 0.75 second delay, Thresh summons 5 spectral walls around him that last up to 5 seconds. Enemy champions that touch a wall take magic damage and are slowed by 99% for 2 seconds, but break the wall. Once one wall is broken, the remaining walls deal half damage and apply half the slow duration. An enemy can be affected by multiple walls.

, A rune page of 9 armour marks, 9 armour seals, 9 magic resist glyphs and 3 health quintessence's and a masteries layout of 7, 23, 0 is advised. The reason behind this is Thresh is otherwise squishy early game due to his lack of passive armour gain by leveling up.


Bear in mind that Thresh can be played in a variety of ways and experimenting with various set ups can be beneficial if it complies with your playing style.

, Due to Thresh being a support champion by nature, you will usually play in the bottom lane to support your attack damage carry.


When playing any support role, it is important to let your attack damage carry (ADC) gain as much ""farm"" (minion kills and champion kills) as possible. It is important to let your ADC get the finishing blow on enemies, this is crucial during the laning phase in order to increase your teams damage output as your ADC will be able to buy damage increasing items in the shop.

, Collecting souls for Threshes passive is a key element to his effectiveness as Thresh, unlike other champions, does not gain an armour bonus upon leveling up, meaning that Damnation is his only means of passively increasing armour. Due to his lack of starting armour.

, Your Q ability can be used in numerous ways; not only is it a basic grab to slow and control your enemies, it can also be used to navigate across terrain due to it's secondary active component, allowing you to rapidly close in onto the ensnared victim. For example, as an escape mechanism, you can cast your hook on any minion in the jungle, again press Q and you will find yourself launched over the wall.

, Dark Passage is a great way to save your teammates, provide a shield to allies and also to safely harvest souls at a distance. Bear in mind, that when attempting to cast Dark Passage to save allies, the ally must be within a close proximity of the lantern in order to click it so this will require some accuracy and possible movement prediction on your part.

, The reason that you should be sensible in your usage of your active component of your E ability is that in the majority of the time in the laning phase (especially) the passive damage boost is more useful than the active. Flay is best used once you have successfully hooked and enemy and once they are free, use Flay to further slow and disable them. Holding the enemy is key to letting your teammates put out as much damage on them as possible. Also remember that this ability can interrupt enemy dashes (e.g. Leona's Zenith Blade and Lucian's Relentless Pursuit ) if timed correctly, it cannot however interrupt blinks (like Ezreal e or the summoner spell flash)

, Although The Box doesn't have an incredibly long cooldown, it is still significant. Due to The Box being cast upon your position, positioning is an important factor to this ability. The Box is best used in team fights to damage and slow the majority of the enemy team, this will provide the chance for your team to retreat or to use the impairment of the enemy team to their advantage.

, As Thresh is a renowned support champion, some essential items include a sightstone, boots of mobility, talisman of ascension and the iron locket of Solari. Place importance of what the enemy team purchases and build to counter them (for example, if the enemy is focusing on magic damage, buy into magic resist over armour). Another potential item choice is the item Zeke's Herals but do keep in mind that it is a more advanced item that requires superb game knowledge and some communication to use at full effectiveness.


If you believe that the game will extend into late game territory, buy into health as by this point in time, it is likely that you will have amassed quite a number of souls providing a good amount of armour and ability power to sustain you. Due to his high amount of free Armor in the later stages of the game, Thresh is one of the few champion where, under certain conditions (more than ~82 souls) thornmail is the most effective armor item without requiring any other bonus armor item.

Get the right build.,
Farm.,
Since this is probably PVP, Be careful for ambushes.,
You should level up to 2 after killing a few minions.,
Remember that your Q slow enemies down.,
If you are ambushed by 2 or more enemies and you are alone, either slow them and run, Flash away (If you have low health) Or use ult on them and attempt to kill them.,
Be careful around turrets.

,Stay around your team if this is one of/ your first PVP

",How to Get High Kills As Ashe on League of Legends," In early game, before you go to your lane for the first time, buy the first three things in the recommended section .(Doran's blade, 1 health potion, trinket.);
, This is very important for building. Just start killing minions.

, Put a trinket in one of the 2 bushes closest to the first enemy turret on bot. If the enemy engages,(Since these are humans and not bots, they will probably start attacking if you get too close) either go with it and try to fight, which I don't recommend, or you can run back and attack from a distance.

, Once you do, get volley(W). This is an important attack.

, So if you are close to killing an enemy, use it. Once you hit level 6, Get your Enchanted Crystal Arrow (Ultimate) This will briefly stun and slow the enemy. What I like to do is get the enemy around half health, use the ult, and auto attack or volley if they don't die. Continue charging your volley and q afterwards. Charge the ult too though.

, Although, if it is 3 or four people, you are probably going to die. Just run away and only turn back to fight if your allies are near you.

,,"

Be nice.,
Brush it off.,
Talk it out.,
Report them.,
Join the tribunal.",How to Get Rid of Ragers on League of Legends," Do not say anything rude back. First of all, it's never a good idea to stoop down to their level. It's one thing to defend yourself, it's another to just be plain rude. Remember, at the end of the game, you may be reported as well.



TIP: Remember, the tribunal is reading. But we cannot see actions, only words. So if someone is intentionally feeding, make sure you just politely ask in chat ""(name) Why did you just (action)?"" and maybe keep doing that. It helps the tribunal see.;
, I'm sure each and every one of us have all had some experience with a rager who just won't stop. It does not make things better if you retaliate. Try not to be mad. Remember, at the end of the day, it's just a game.

, Sometimes, it works. Say ""sorry"" and state your point of view. Especially if it's over a kill and he accuses you of ""kill stealing."" Just say how it's a kill secure. Remember it's a team game. If they don't want your help, then fine. Don't give it to them. If they die trying to get a kill, well it's not really your fault now is it?

, At the end of the game, report them. Make sure you include after lobby chat (copy paste if you can) in the report, and always explain the situation.



TIP: I would not leave the comment section blank. Comments help. Some people do things pre or post game because they know the tribunal can't see it, and they might get away with it. When we receive multiple reports for verbal abuse and no comments on any of them explaining why, we might not have a choice but to pardon. Especially if they don't show the same behavior in game chats.

, Of course you can't until level 20, but it definitely helps to join. It's a lot like karma where you can help to prevent toxic players from continuing to abuse others.

Use a Command.,
Use the Menu.,
Change the Party Setting.,
Invite through Friend's list.,
Meet to Invite.,
Invite through Guild list.,
Type Leave Command.,
Use Party Window.,
Remove Members.",How to Make a Party in Ragnarok Online," In the old version of Ragnarok Online, the only way to create a party is by typing a command in your chat box, but it still works in the latest update of the game. Simply type: /organize<space>partyname (e.g. /organize onehalfdime)


Creating a Party Name with spaces is unacceptable. However, you can use special characters as long as it's supported by the game's text database.
The game will notify you if someone has already used the same party name.
After you have typed in the command with the party name, press Enter. A party setting will appear for you to modify. Change it to your preference and then press OK to complete the process.
Please obey the rules regarding foul language when choosing party names.;
, The new and easiest way in creating a party is by pressing Alt+V. This will maximize your menu, showing the shortcut button for your inventory, skill, map, guild, quest, the record button, option, and most importantly, the party.


To create a party using this, press the party button to bring up the party window. At the lower right of the window, you will find an icon with three people. Right-click on that to start creating your own party.

, You can change the party setting even after you have founded the party and invited people in. Simply press Alt+Z to bring up the party window and then click on the magnifying glass icon below. After doing so, another window will open with the following setting:


How to Share EXP - This setting is for the distribution of EXP to each party member. You can change it to “Each Take”, which players gain EXP from their own kill, and “Even Share”, kills done by the party will be equally shared to everyone.
How to Share Items - If you choose Each Take, players who killed the monster successfully can pick up the items while others are restricted. In Party Share however, everyone within the party can pick up the item regardless who had killed the monster or boss.
Item Sharing Type - This determines how are items split once picked up. If the setting is set to “Individual”, the person keeps what they pick up. If it's “Shared”, items are distributed randomly to party members.

, After you have successfully created a Party, you can now start inviting people. One way to invite members is sending invitation through your friend's list.


To do this, open your Friend List window by pressing Alt+H. Right-click on the name (player must be online) and then choose “Invite to Join Party.”

, This is the most common way to invite people in your party. Meeting up in the game is convenient for players who are searching for party in a certain area, such as in Al De Baran and Glast Heim, since most players prefer to search for party and then enter the field right away to hunt.


All you have to do is meet up with your friend or with people who wishes to join your party, right-click their character and then choose “Invite to Join Party.

, Similar to inviting people using your friend's list, you have to open your Guild list first by pressing Alt+G and then search for the name of the player in member's list. Right-click on the name and then choose “Invite to Join Party” to send them an invitation.


You can invite up to 12 people in 1 party.
Remember that there's a level gap. Each member should be within the 10 level difference to have the EXP Even Share work. Otherwise, the EXP Even Share won't be available in the party setting.

, If you're in a party and wanted to leave, simply type /leave in your chat window. You will be completely removed from the party list and will no longer be able to receive EXP from your party members.


To join the party again after leaving, you need to ask the party leader to invite you again.

, Another way to leave the party is by clicking the “Leave Party” button found on the party window. To open the window, simply press Alt+Z and then choose the button at the bottom left to leave.

, There are times that members in the party went offline and didn't come back after an hour or so. Or, for whatever reason, you wanted to kick a member out from your party.


To do this, open your party window and then right-click on the name from the list. Choose “Kick from Party” to remove them.

Go to deep dungeons.,
Hunt for rare items.,
Hunt for rare enemies.",How to Get Rich in Ragnarok Online1," Travel to dungeons and kill as many monsters as you can. Monsters drop Zeny when they get killed, so killing as lots of monsters could earn you hefty amount of money.;
, Monsters, when killed, can sometimes give out rare items. These items are considered rare due to their low drop rate and can be sold for ridiculous prices. For example, Poring Hats dropped by Porings (found all over the map) are often valued from hundreds of thousands, to even millions due to their low drop rate. Depending on the drop rate of the server you’re playing on, you may have to kill thousands of Porings before you get a Poring Hat. Hunting for rare items can be very tedious, but can easily give you an quick ticket into getting rich.

, Not all high-valued items are rare. Some items that are worth a ton of money have a 100% drop rate. While the item can easily be dropped, the monster that carries them rarely shows up and are very strong. Monsters like the Doppelganger, which resides inside level 3 of Geffen dungeon, only spawns once a day. The item it drops, called the Doppelganger Card, can be sold for at least a million Zeny. If you’re character is strong enough, loiter around high-level stages of dungeons and you’re sure to find some rare enemies that drop off expensive items."
"
Offer party assistance.,
Heal for a price.,
Resurrect for a price.",How to Get Rich in Ragnarok Online2," If your character has a fairly decent level, you can offer party assistance to low-level players. You can form a group and accompany other weaker players to dungeon levels that they won’t be able to get to without the help of a stronger player like you. This allows them to kill higher-level monsters and gain more experience points that they need to level up. You can ask for a couple thousand as payment for your service.

, If you’re a priest, you can offer to heal wounded players instantly in exchange for a decent amount of Zeny. Most of the time, players forget to purchase potions while they’re on their quest. Keep in mind though that only a Priest or a High Priest has the skill to heal other players.

, Another service that you can offer to other players if you’re of the Priest job is the Resurrection. Players that are out on a hunt will be reluctant to reload the game once they’re killed because they’ll have to respawn back to the dungeon entrance. Approach characters that are lying dead on the ground, and make an offer that you’ll resurrect them in exchange for a fair price.

Help organize your team.,
Avoid negativity.",How to Be a Teamplayer on League of Legends," Figure out your own play style and preferred champion roles, this will aid you in benefiting your team by knowing where to place yourself. It will also be beneficial if you try as many different champions as possible so that your knowledge about their abilities can help you counter them.;
, Decide whether you want to play a normal game or a ranked game (providing you are level 30), if you wish to try out a champion it would be recommended that you do not do this in a ranked game. Normal games are more relaxed and is a great place to try out a champion.


If it is your first time playing a champion, kindly notify your team in the champion select screen so they will be aware that you might require assistance more than others.

, This includes letting them know where you'd like to play and to organize an efficient team composition. Avoid arguing over who will play in which lane and focus on thinking about which champions have good synergy and how you will perform in team fights.

, This includes letting your team if you want to invade their jungle, like to gank earlier if you're a jungler or if you prefer levelling a certain skill earlier or later that may affect your team.

, If you're against a strong lane, notify your team as soon as possible to let them know that you might require help, in this case, play safe and farm under your turret so it in turn makes your lane susceptible to a gank from your jungler.

, This will provide you with enough gold to purchase core items on your champion and to increase the stats relevant to your champion.

, Utilize the use of smart pings to 'always let your team know if an enemy is missing so that they will be able to respond accordingly, this can decrease the chance of a successful enemy gank and even save objectives.

, As opposed to contrary belief, it is not a certain roles' job to organize objectives for your team. If you feel that capturing a certain objective such as Dragon, Baron or a turret would be beneficial to the game you're playing then inform your team and request assistance when appropriate.

, Flaming a teammate has negative effects on their play throughout the game and causes unnecessary arguments, it is better to simply let them know how to improve, remind them to play safe or simply state ""unlucky"". Also, if you see an argument break out between your team, try your best to calm them and let them know that with teamwork, any game can be turned over.


In extreme cases, you can ignore a player by pressing tab and finding the speech mark to the right of their username.

Other than that, there are normal monsters that drops Emperium but only has 0.02% chance. Monsters that drop Emperiums are Mineral, Shining Plant, Requiem, and Orc Zombie.;
, After obtaining an Emperium, and have it on the character you want to make the guild on, create a guild by typing /guild (guildname). (e.g. /guild FiveMinuteMeal)


The character you made the guild on is now the ""Guild Master"". Once you have made a guild, the name and who leads it cannot be changed unless there's something that goes against the game rules such as inappropriate guild name, in which case Gravity may either change the name and ask you to come up with a new one or disband it.

, If you want to delete or disband your guild for any reason, you have to kick all your guild members first, and then type /breakguild (your guild name), e.g /breakguild FiveMinuteMeal. This can only be done by guild masters.

, Inviting guild members is as easy inviting people in a party. You can invite using your Friend's List or meeting players in the game. All you have to do is right-click their name or their character and then choose “Invite to Join Guild.”


Players being invited to the guild has the right to decline your invitation.

, Now that you have created your very own guild, you can access the guild window by pressing alt+G. This window is the interface used to change anything related to the guild, and to view information such as online members, number for recruits and many others.

, This tab shows the general guild information such as guild level, guild alliances, and rival guilds. Also, under this tab you will be able to find the Emblem button which you can modify your guild's emblem.

, All guild members are listed in this tab. The leader is always first, with other members being ordered according to their title. Online members will be highlighted and you're able to see who have been taxed to prove the guild with experience.


You can also see how much they have contributed to your guild as well. Titles of each member can be modified from this tab.
Assigning guild officers helps in building a good guild since officers will take care of the group during your absence. They can invite recruits and kick unwanted members.

, A total of 20 titles are available and can be set here by the guild leader. The order of titles here will influence the order of members in the Guildsmen tab.


As mentioned, titles give members the right to kick or invite people in the guild so choose people who you can trust.

, Guild skills are displayed here. Upon obtaining a new guild level, the extra skill point is allocated in this tab. Using active guild skills is also done in this section.

, During your absence, selected guild officers may or may not have kicked someone out from the guild. You can see the list of people who are kicked out from the guild under this tab, including the small note of reasons why they have removed the player from the guild.

, Lastly, this tab is where the guild leader writes a two-line guild notice which will be displayed to each member upon logging in or switching maps. It is useful for important announcements.

, The amount of members a guild can hold is 16, this includes the guild Master, by default. This limit can be increased using the Guild Extension skill up to a maximum of 58 members.


To have a high number of guild members can be an advantage when it comes to War of Emperium.

, It's necessary to level up your guild in order for you to unlock the guild skills which can be used during the War of Emperium. To do this, members in the guild must donate their base experience through taxes.


After a guild gains a level, one skill point is obtained, which can then be used on a variety of guild skills.

, To have a functional guild, as a leader, you need to become an example. In order for your guild to win the War of Emperium, members must have at least a decent set of equipment.


Helping hand in hand, hunting boss monsters together, and even contributing extra weapon or equipment will likely increase your chance of winning. Most of all, this strengthen everyone's trust.

After you have gathered the items, the professor will help you write your essay, and you must choose the correct option to finish the essay correctly. It will look like this when you're done
“Magic spells are varied into 4 elements such as Water, Earth, Fire and Wind. Each property has an opposing property.

You must apply different types of property by the situation or place.”

At this part, you don't need to choose the options in order to write the essay. Keep on pressing enter until the professor finishes your essay.

, Once you've finished your essay, you'll be given a book and will be instructed to show your thesis to the Dean of the Magician Academy.









Head over to the Sage Castle, situated in the northwest corner of Juno's northern island (89, 319).
Walk down the floor to the last room where you will find Dean of the Academy, Kayron Grik.
Hand him your thesis, and he will change your job to Sage.

, Now that you're a Sage, you can proceed to leveling your job level for you to unlock more skills, but to do that, you need a proper weapon to kill monsters and hunt with other players.









Sages can use books, and these are strictly for magic attacks. It's advisable to wear the Encyclopedia coupled with DMG cards since it offers a decent amount of damage.
Knife can be used as well, but this build is for VIT/DEX type of sages, good for PvP.
For Rods, Eden Staff II is a good choice. It's easy to get and is the best weapon a Sage has access to. It offers the highest mATk of all non-trans staffs and is only 1-handed, so the Sage can also wear a shield with it for damage reduction.

, A Soul Linker can cast a support skill to a Sage, which imbues the character with special powerful buffs that last until the buff runs out.









If the Sage uses Hindsight skill, it will always drop the highest level bolt that the Sage has learn in the respective bolt skill. It’s a good buff for leveling players since it inflicts more damage compared to Sages without a Soul Link support.

There is no Priest to ask for a warp, and no friend is around to walk with you. You must use the Kafra service, but you have no Zeny! How would you go about to make the Zeny that you need? ( Sell items I do not need, or Hunt a nearby field.)
So you finally arrive at the Sograt Desert. But you realize that Hodes are a bit too strong for you to hunt alone. What is your solution to this situation? (Go back to town.)

By now, you decide to go to the Maze by yourself. But on your way, you run into someone that is lost. What should you do? (Tell them which way to go, or Guide them to their destination.)
After meeting this lost person, you decide to get back to hunting. Just then, you find that someone is attacking a boss! What should you do? (Watch, then attack when asked for help.)

If you're in Prontera, just head south to leave the city then head east. You will find the small town of Izlude. At the top-right corner of the map, you will find a dock that will warp you to Alberta for 250z.
You can also travel on foot to Alberta, but there will be monsters that might attack you. From Prontera, head south from the city and then southeast. The path will lead you to Payon City. Once you get in Payon City, head south to leave the city and then head farther southeast. You will then find Alberta City.

, Once you reach Geffen, head to the eastern part of the city. Aure Dupon will be standing near the portal, right under a street light, or simply warp to Geffen 181, 114 if @wrap command is available in the server. Talk to him and choose “More about Morgenstein.” He will then tell you Morgenstein's location.


From Alberta, it will be a long way to reach Geffen on foot since the City of Mage is found farther west of Prontera. It's best to use the ship again by the docks to get to Izlude, from Izlude go to Prontera, and then start traveling to west.
You can also ask players with warp skill to teleport you to Geffen for a small fee.

, Morgenstein can be found on the 2nd floor of Geffen's old blacksmith guild. The building is right at the 5 o'clock position of the city. Talk to him about his research.


Talk to him again if you're ready to make a Counteragent and Mixture.

, The creation of Counteragent needs three ingredients to be completed: 1 Alcohol, 1 Detrimindexta, 1 Empty Bottle, and 3,000z fee.

, To complete a Mixture, you need 1 Alcohol, 1 Karvodailnirol, 1 Empty Bottle, and 4,000z fee.


Aside from creating dye, Mixture can be used to create ores.

, Solutions can be hard to gather because of its low drop rate, which explains why Dyes are expensive in the market.


Alcohol—You can gather Alcohol from Black Mushroom, Horong, and Red Mushroom, with 0.5% drop rate. Black Mushroom can be found in Geffen Field (gef_fild11), and Red Mushroom is found in Prontera Field (prt_fild10), with 6 to 9 minutes respawn time for both. Horong is found in Payon Cave F5 (pay_dun02).
Detrimindexta—This is a drop from Deviance, with 2% drop rate, and Removal, Black Mushroom, and Hydra, with 0.5% drop rate each. Deviance can be found in Undersea Tunnel F5 (iz_dun04); Removal, in Bio Laboratory F1 (lhz_dun01); Black Mushroom, in Geffen Field (gef_fild11), with 6 to 9 minutes respawn time; and Hydra, in Meo, the East Cave (beach_dun3).
Karvodailnirol—This is a drop from Removal, with 1% chance. Red Mushroom, Poison Spore, and Rhyncho drops Karvodailnirol with 0.05% chance rate. You can find Poison Spore in Mt. Mjolnir (mjolnir_07), and Rhyncho is found in Nidhoggur's Next Lv 2 (2@nyd).
Once you have gathered enough requirements, head back to Morgenstein to have the mixture created. You can now make the dye you want to use to change the color of your hair or clothing.
Solutions are also useful in gaining Platinum Skills and are also requirements for headgear.

, Answer at least 9 out of 10 questions correctly to pass it.

, The good news is, if you made a mistake or failed the test, you can just retake this part of the quest.

, After you’ve passed the written test, you will be sent to Mr. Smith on the next floor.

, There are 3 different sets of items, and you will be given one. All sets and their hunting locations as well as those with the best drop rates in the game are listed below. Some items may be dropped by multiple monsters.



Item List Set 1. 10,000 Zeny, 10 Yellow Herb (from Yellow Plant at Juno Field), 10 Shell (from Steel Chonchon at Sograt Desert 13), 10 Grasshopper's Leg (from Rocker at Prontera Field 07), and 10 Bear's Footskin (from Big Foot at Payon Forest 07)

, With the items you’ve gathered, you must go back to him so you can proceed to the next level.

, At this part of the quest, Mr. Smith tells you to search for them, and gives you a password along with his clues. Write it down or refer to this list for the answer.



Aragham Jr. If you’re assigned for this NPC, find him at the Fortress Saint Darmain, southwest part of the map (cmd_fild09 106, 195). The password will be “Aragham never hoarded upgrade items.”

Hollgrehenn Jr. For this NPC, find him at the Fortress Saint Darmain, southeast of the map (cmd_fild09 335, 145). The password will be “My father never hoarded upgrade items.”

Antonio Jr. This NPC can be found at Kokomo Beach, southeast of the map (cmd_fild04 302, 177). Password will be “Antonio doesn't enjoy destroying upgrade items.”

Hermanthorn Jr. Found at Kokomo Beach (cmd_fild07 349, 285), no password is required to enter the building. However, to enter the maze, you will be given the code 3019.

, Once inside the building, you will be asked if you're ready for the maze. Make sure to put Backslide and Hide in your hotkey. At this part of the quest, you’re able to hide from any monster you encounter in the maze.

An alternative way to reach Monk Abbey is to go to Prontera Church in the northeastern corner of the city.;
, Ask Priest Paulin, ""What should I do?"" Then select, ""Go to the convent."" He will then teleport you to the abbey.

, You will see the guard monk as you enter the abbey. Talk to him before entering the portal.

, You will find Sensei Moohae inside the building. Talk to him to start your first quest in becoming a Monk. He will assign you one of the 7 sets of items to be gathered.


Items in each set are listed below, including the monster or NPC for each loot.
Though there are many monsters where you can get the item, only the monster with highest drop rate will be mentioned.
Set 1- 5 Cyfar (Galapago), 10 Yellow Herb (Yellow Plant), and 10 White Herb (White Plant).

Once you have gathered all the items, return to Sensei Moohae to proceed to step 3.

, Sensei Moohae will direct you to Elder Touha, located at the top right of the area. Touha will have you remember one of the quotes listed below; she will read the entire passage before allowing you to recite it.


This sounds like an easy test, but it can be long.

, You can also refer to this guide.


Passage One: And shepherds we shall be, for thee my lord for thee. Power path descended forth from the hand so our feet may swiftly carry out thy command and we shall flow a river forth thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Passage Two: I seek the path of enlightenment. We monks shall hold true to what we believe and will help protect others through the teachings we learn through our lives. In nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Passage Three: I commit myself to veritas and aequitas. I will follow my path to enlightenment and purity. I will protect my brothers with life. Evil shall never be victorious while I breathe. In nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

, There is no penalty for failing.

, For this part, you must talk to Boohae, found at the bottom-left side of the map. You will be given two options: marathon or mushroom collecting.

, If you choose marathon, talk to the door keeper in front of the Abbey. Enter the building and find Bashu. Tell Bashu “Marathon,” and he will then send you to another area.


The map is shaped like a ring, with occasional holes that players can fall into.

, To pass this test, you mustn't fall into the pits for 10 laps.

, This will allow you to see the pits ahead.


Disconnecting will send you back to your save point.
This test takes 30 minutes with increase agility.
After you have completed all ten laps, you will automatically be sent out.

, If you choose collect mushrooms, you will be sent to the gatekeeper who will direct you to a map where you will be hunting two types of mushrooms (Gooey and Orange).


The NPC will tell you that you have enough mushrooms once you get 30 of each type.

, During the test, you will also encounter thief bugs who will loot your mushrooms. If attacked, they will assist the other bugs. However, they're quite weak considering your level.


This is easier if you have a high-agility buffs.

, You can do this bare-handed for maximum attack speed since the damage you inflict to mushrooms is 1, with or without the weapon.

, You can find him within the abbey, inside what appears to be a glowing cross. He sends you to an invisible maze for your test.


Be warned that during this test, monsters such as Zombies and Mummies will spawn . They shouldn't be much of a challenge, but keep in mind that you don't have enough room to move about for battle.
It is possible to check if a certain cell is passable by pointing the cursor at it.
Walkable cells will have the usual green walk marker; if there is none, then that cell is blocked.

, Try sticking to a straight line from the door to the exit.


Disconnecting in this test will send a player back to their save point.

, Talk to him, and he will give you a green potion. Use it.

, Moohae will give you a lengthy speech about your class. Right after his speech, he will turn you into a Monk.


As a reward, you will get a Waghnak. If you're a job level 50, Moohae gives you Knuckle Duster.

Complete quests.,
“Farm” your way to leveling up.,
Join parties.,
Travel to Juno.,
Go to the Sage Castle.,
Read the Book of Ymir.,
Talk to the Lord Knight NPC.",How to Change to Lord Knight in Ragnarok Online," There’s only one requirement in order for your Knight character to become a Lord Knight, and that is to reach level 40. Complete job quests specific for Knights that can be found all over the map in different towns, like Prontera, as this will let you gain more XP points, which you need in order to level up. You could also choose to complete side quests; these will give you large amounts of XP points and get you to level 40 quickly.;
, If you don’t want to complete quests, you can always choose to “farm” your way to level 40. Farming is when you simply hang out inside random dungeons and kill the enemy creatures inside to get XP points. This can be much faster than to completing quests because you don’t need to roam around the map to meet quest objectives, allowing you to save more time. On the flip side, this can be a bit too repetitive if you do it for several hours.

, Teaming up with other players lets you take down higher-level enemy monsters that are impossible to defeat on your own. This allows your character to earn more XP points compared to killing monsters that are on equal level as your character. This, by far, is the most effective and quickest way to level up., Juno is the city found on the northernmost end of Midgard. You can get there either by walking northwards from Al De Baran or by talking to any Warp Master NPC (non-playable character) inside any town and using the Warp Portal. Take note that using the Warp Portal costs some Zeny, and the cost differs from town to town.

, Walk to the northeastern corner of the city from Juno’s center, and you’ll find a door. This is the Sage Castle. Walk through the door to get inside the building.

, Inside the Sage Castle you’ll find a male NPC named Metheus Sylphe. Walk past this NPC to the room behind him, and you’ll find the Book of Ymir on top of a pedestal. Click on the book and it will teleport you to Valhalla.

, Valhalla is a castle in the sky where different NPCs for job changes live. Look for the Lord Knight NPC (a male NPC wearing a long brown cape). Click the NPC and he will give a short speech. After that he will change your character to the transcendent job Lord Knight."

Go on a few non member land adventures.,
Gather a good amount of rares.,
Use backup accounts.,
Gain at least three of each good item.,
Put the items gained on trade.,
Go to a crowded land or place in the server.,

Consider trading for member den betas and saving them to trade for spikes.,
Collect at least four member den betas and some non member den betas.,

Repeat the process with getting spiked collars with spiked wristbands.,
Collect 13 den betas or two short collars (no orange or pink ones).,
Trade what you gained for a black long collar.",How to Collect Spikes on Animal Jam As a Non‐Member," For non members, there are two adventures where there are chances to get at least two good items in one adventure. They are Return Of The Phantoms on Hard Mode and The Phantom Portal on Hard Mode as well. Go on Return Of The Phantoms in Hard Mode with a member arctic wolf and The Phantom Portal with a tiger. Have the arctic wolf open the arctic wolf passage. Open the chest in the passage in order to have another chance of a good item.


Finish the adventure. Open the bottom left, top right, or top left chests - they are the only chests that have chances of rewarding you good items. The other two chests reward nothing but gems.
With The Phantom Portal, tigers are for non members, so you do not need to go with another person for this adventure.;
, Good rares that can be rewarded from these two adventures are rare bows and arrows, non member pirate swords, worn blankets, rare fox hats, and rare headfeathers.


Black worn blankets and headfeathers are worth much more than other colors of the same type of item or items. Use this as an advantage in order to become rarer more quickly.

, This will allow you to collect several rares in one adventure. Create at least three more backups and including yourself for a maximum of four good rewards. In all, if you're lucky, you could get eight good rewards. Open the passageway gate with an arctic wolf (you will need two backups, plus yourself, to do this for at least six good rewards) - you will have a chance to get three good rewards. If you open a chest with a good item from the very first chest you click, open the same chests on the other backups in order to get three of the same good reward.

, Get three rare bows and arrows, non-member pirate swords, worn blankets, and rare fox hats or rare headfeathers.





, Go to the server named Aldan or a famous Jammer's den. If the den is full, it will usually lead you to a different Aldan server that usually has a lot of traders and rare Jammers in there. The regular Aldan is more of just a trading spot, however. Adventures are also hosted in there frequently.

, Coral Canyons, Jamaa Township, Crystal Sands, and Temple Of Zios are good areas. However, when the server gets very full, Appondale, Kimbara, and Mount Shiveer also get crowded. Try going into famous Jammers' dens and Brady's Lab - they are also good places for rare Jammers and anyone who wants to trade.

, Decline all member den beta trades unless you are collecting a variety of den betas to create a collection.

, Collect non member den betas, but save them. Use any member den beta for trading for spikes. Non member den betas are more valuable, and it is suggested to save them and trade member den betas instead since they are less high in rarity.





, Good non member den betas include:






Small tables, baskets of candy, basketballs, wood floors, tan carpets, Cami's frog, traffic cones, fly traps, gecko plushies, orange mats, blue mats, and rocking horses. Other non member den items Jammers trade you are fake and should not be accepted.

Tan carpets, wood floors, and camis are worth spiked wristbands themselves, so save them since they are quite rare non member den betas. Do not trade them and multiple other den betas for a spike. Place the rare den beta on trade and say, ""Trade me a spiked wristband,"" or if you are collecting, ""Trade me smaller non member den betas.""


Member den betas include - robots, pots o' gems, televisions, open signs, blue vines, flower carpets, moon dirt, pink forest walls, yellow sweets, planet walls, computers (many Jammers think computers are not beta, but they are, according to the Animal Jam Wiki), bubblegum machines, art easels, RC cars, and rare claws (The Claw). Do not accept any fake member den betas, no matter what they say.

Open signs used to be worth a spiked wristband, but now, they are worth two smaller den betas. Rare Claws, however, are worth a bad long wrist themselves. Trade them for a spiked wristband instead of adding to the Rare Claw, or you would be trading fair for a short collar, creating an over trade on your side.



, The worst spiked wristband (and worst spike of all the rare spikes) is an orange short wrist. The best spiked wristband is a black long wrist. Choose a spiked wrist you want to aim to get based on how many member den betas you have. Bad long wrists are worth four den betas, good long wrists are worth five, good short wrists are worth three, and bad short ones are worth two.






Bad Short/Long Wrists: Orange (worst), Pink, Yellow, and Green.
Good Short/Long Wrists: Blue, Purple, Red, and Black (best).

, Keep in mind that most den betas are worth rare spikes themselves. Rare Claws, tan carpets, wood floors, camis, porch swings, and River Race (minigame den beta - worth a black long collar. others are worth wrists) are all worth spikes.

, You might just end up getting a deal, and there is a good chance you will since many Jammers have unwanted spiked wrists. Trade the Jammer who wanted the den betas and you should now have a spike.

, Two very bad short wrists are worth a bad long wrist. A bad long wrist is worth a black short wrist. A bad long wrist plus a very bad short wrist is worth a black long wrist, and so on and so forth. Aim to get up to the best rare spiked wristband (a black long wrist) or a good long wrist.





, The process for collecting more rare spiked collars will require spiked wristbands and den betas to trade. Gather at least two rare long spiked wristbands or six through eight den betas.

, Any are fine - both of them together would be worth a semi-good short collar, such as a purple, blue, or yellow one (two orange long wrists for yellow). Red short collars would be worth nine, and black shorts are worth 13 or 14 small ones. See the above process in order to trade for them.





, Say something such as, ""My list for a rare spiked collar (may not accept specific colors) jag if so."" Wait to get a deal and tell them to go to your den. Make the trade and you should now have a rare short spiked collar.





, Most Jammers usually want den betas rather than two spiked wristbands, so consider trading some spiked wristbands for den betas and then trading the den betas for rare spiked collars. Trade for six den betas for orange and pink short collars. Get seven for green and yellow short collars. Gather eight for purple and blue short collars, and 13 to 14 for a black short collar.

, Follow the same tasks, but with den betas. Make sure they are real den betas so that you won't technically trick them into accepting an unfair trade.






Aim to get two bad short collars. You can then possibly trade them for a black short collar, which is the rarest short collar.

, Trading these would be worth an orange long collar. Gather two bad long collars and trade for a good long collar. Aim to get three good long collars or six bad long collars.





, You do not have to build up to a black long - it may take longer if you're a non member. If you want to build up to other rares even as a non member, feel free to do so. Spikes are basically the process of building up to several other rares even rarer than a black long collar.

, Once you find Barcardi, enter her chat room to get warped to the test room. There are two parts to this test: Kill Job Change Target monsters and sneak past large groups of aggressive monsters.

In the first part, you have to pick out monsters named Job Change Target among a group of monsters named differently.
Kill any other monsters and you will fail the the test.
The test is timed as well, giving you 3 minutes to complete this part.

, When you get there be sure to lock your den. This means only your buddies can enter your den and then your children are safer from people. there can be some strange animals out there lurking in the shadows.

, Give them a tour and give some simple rules. Like: don't go in to Sarepia Forest alone. That is one of the most dangerous places on Animal Jam because of the Clan wars. People mostly get reported or have fights down there. While doing this, be sure to not sound too strict.Then, your baby might think that she/he has no freedom to do things she/he wants in this home.

Go to Alberta by using the Kafra Service in Payon, or you can ask any Priest in game to wrap you in Alberta City.
Head for the Inn. The Inn is located in the upper-left corner of the city, across from the portal that leads outside.
Get inside the Inn and then walk into the portal to the right to find the Grandpa Turtle NPC.
Talk to Grandpa Turtle and then choose from the selection about Turtle Island. Ask him to tell you more by choosing “Ting!” until the dialogue comes to an end.
Talk to Grandpa Turtle again and, this time, choose the option ""How can I get to Turtle Island?"" He will then tell you about a chubby sailor found at the docking area.;
, First, go to Alberta and then head to the southeastern part of the city. Approach the only ship docked horizontally in your mini map until you find an NPC named Sailor, who standing near Professor Jordan Niliria.


Talk to Sailor, and he will tell you about the island.
Keep on clicking Next on the dialogue box until he offers you a ride to the Turtle Island for 10,000 zeny.
Remember, every time you use his service, you need to pay him 10,000 zeny to enter Turtle Island, so make sure you have enough zeny with you.

, When you get to Turtle Island, there's an NPC right in front of you. Talk to him and tell him that you wish to take the Ranger exam. He will send you back to Alberta to get rid of your equipment and items in your inventory.

,, Again, you need to pay 10,000 zeny to the Sailor.

, Your first test is to find the next NPC, Teardrop.


The Ranger NPC will also give you a weapon, 500 Arrows, and 10 Fly Wings to use.
Be cautious when exploring the island as there are many aggressive monsters in this area. Use the Fly Wings to avoid them, and kill any when necessary.

, Teardrop is located at the northwestern part of the island. If you look at the minimap, the island looks like a turtle. Simply approach the left arm to find Teardrop.


Before you speak to Teardrop, drop all the items you picked up on your way to him; drop everything except the items the Ranger NPC gave to you.

, Tell the NPC that you want to take the test to proceed to the next part of the quest. He will tell you about your next test.


Again, make sure you dropped any items you picked up on your way to see him, except for the items given to you by the Ranger; otherwise, he will consider you cheating then send you back to the starting point to travel all the way back to his location.
Be careful when talking to Teardrop as aggressive monsters can still attack you. Clear the place if possible before you start talking to him.

, Your first task is to kill a Dragon Tail, located on the island, and get its loot, Wing of Dragonfly.

, After giving Teardrop the loot item, he will teleport you to a small waiting room where your next test will occur. Simply click the chat box at the top of the NPC to wait on queue.


Once it's your turn to take the test, you will be automatically teleported to the next room.

, Many players who are taking this exam find this difficult. By the time you're teleported to the next room for the test, you will be given a simple instruction: find and kill a monster named Poring.


You will be placed in a small island. A monster will be summoned, and it's your job to look for the right one.
Monsters will disappear after 5 seconds unless you kill Poring. There will be 20 rounds, and the passing score is 15.

,


If you fail the test, you will be sent outside to wait in line again.
You will be given 100 Arrows for this quest.

, When the trapping ability test starts, an NPC will appear near you. DON’T talk to the NPC just yet.


If you talk to the NPC, she will give you 100 Novice Potions, 10 Bombring Capsules and Report Papers that will make your weight go up to 90%, making attacking monsters very difficult. With all that weight, chances of getting killed in the test is high.

, Using your remaining arrows, clear the path to the next NPC first.


Kill the monsters that can heal first and ignore the ones that cannot move, such as Mandrakes and Floras.

, After you’ve cleared the path with the last of your arrows, talk to the NPC to get Novice Potions, Bombring Capsules, and Report Papers.

, As you head to the NPC near the exit, use the Bombring Capsules to kill off the remaining monsters.


Using a Bombring Capsule will summon a Bombring; this monster will attack you then explode. Make sure you’re far from the Bombring before it explodes so you won’t be killed.
You have to use up all the Bombring Capsules before you can talk to the last NPC.

, She will automatically talk to you and take the Report Papers from your inventory before teleporting you to the next room. This will be your last exam and probably the easiest part.

, He will explain to you about the exam then give you a Flute used to summon a Baby Desert Wolf; he will then ask you to use it.

, Simply press I on your keyboard to open your inventory and then double-click on the Flute to use it.

, The task is easy, your character will be immobilized, and with the use of your baby wolf, you need to disarm 20 Egg Bombs.


To control the baby wolf, simply hold the Ctrl button on your keyboard and then left-click on the Egg Bombs or on the ground.
You need to disarm at least 10 Egg Bombs out of 20 in order to pass this exam.
If you fail, you will be sent outside to take the quest all over again.
If you pass, your character will be teleported to the next room where you get to meet the Ranger Master.

, The Ranger Master will explain to you the use of the Wolf Flute, which he will prove. This is needed for you to summon your very own wolf instead of a falcon.


The Ranger Master will also give you a Green Apple accessory and a Sniper Goggle with decent stats.
Your class will then be changed to a Ranger.

, You can use Butterfly Wings to teleport back to your saved point.


If you don't have any Butterfly Wings, you can talk to the Ranger Master again and ask him to let you leave the room.
Congratulations, you are now a Ranger.

Buy a den.,
Begin to buy winter-related den items.,
Change to an animal that suits ice or snow.,
Wear winter clothing on Animal Jam.,
Acquire people.,
Enjoy your party!,
Once it ends, simply hold it another day (not in summer though) or just leave your den there until you feel ready for winter fun again!

",How to Create a Winter Party on Animal Jam," A snow fort one is perfect but if there's no more of them or you ran out of gems, simply buy a den you think is perfect for winter. A fantasy castle, Crystal Palace or Small House is still good.;
, Items such as snowmen, jamaaliday den items or simply ice things will add the wintry look. Avoid using anything that doesn't relate to winter, such as wolf sconces or various plants. Recommended items are anything white or blue, snowy items or anything that you think is wintry enough.

, Arctic wolves, foxes, normal wolves, snow leopards or polar bears suit the wintry look. If not, use any animal you choose but make it look wintry enough so people can see.

, A furry hat or star hat (for nonmembers) is worthy. Jamaaliday scarves count. A parka, old blanket or Winter Jacket suits the look. Finally, use snow boots or snow trail shoes (if not, use any leg item you think suits winter).

, Go to Jamaa Township while it's busy and begin to call jammers over to your den. Say something like ""Winter fiesta at my den, come while it's still cold!"" or ""Winter party at my den, tons of wintry fun"" to grab attention. Never say anything like ""Winter party at my den, its so popular Julian2 was there and stuff!!!"" People will fall for it but will realize the truth at the end.

, Play party games with some jammers, hold contests or simply chillax. If the number dwindles, just call some buddies over to regain popularity or relax and celebrate with your friends till you're tired.

Talk to the Old Man again.,
Go back to Einbroch.",How to Change to Gunslinger in Ragnarok Online," In order for you to have a Gunslinger, you need to create a Novice first and level it until you have reached job level 10; otherwise, the quest won't be available for you to take and complete.


Make sure you have distributed your Novice’s skill points by pressing Alt + S; assign the points to your desired skills and then press Okay (a Novice will only have Basic Skills).;
, To get to Einbroch, talk to the Kafra to teleport to Prontera; from Prontera, use their service again to go to Izlude. Once you reach Izlude, head south of the map then follow the small bridge leading to east where an airship is stationed.


You're required to pay 1200 zeny to get to Einbroch.

, He's inside the building located at the center of the Einbroch, a huge box-shaped building found in your mini map.


Talk to the NPC in front of the entrance and tell him that you want to sign up.

, After enlisting for the Gunslinger job, you will be told to head to Payon Town to meet the Old Man.; he is found at the southern part of the mini map, just right at the southern entrance and a few steps to the east. He's an old man with long white beard, holding a cane.

, This guy is found at the southern part of the mini map, just right at the southern entrance and a few steps to the east. He will tell you to gather some items for him:


3 Fluff
3 Zargon
3 Green Herb
3 Rainbow Shell
1 Trunk
10 Shell
1 Milk
The Milk is a secret item; the Old Man won’t tell you that he needs it unless you gather the rest of the items and bring them to him. To avoid going back and forth between towns, just get 1 Milk in advance.
Except for Zargon, which can be bought from the Geffen NPC, all these items can be obtained from Prontera.

, Head to Prontera using the Kafra Service in Payon Town, and then teleport to Geffen. Once you reach Geffen, enter the building in the western part of the city.


Zargon is sold for 480 zeny; since you will be needing 3, the total would be 1,440 zeny, so make sure you have enough money for this.
You can kill monsters to obtain Zargon, but these monsters have higher levels; you will inflict little to no damage against them. The best option to get Zargon is to purchase it or to ask from other players.

, Right after you purchase Zargon in Geffen, head back to Prontera using the Kafra Service. Now follow the road that leads west until you find the Milk Ranch NPC (southwest of your mini map) and purchase Milk there.


1 Milk costs 25 zeny.

, Continue west then exit the city using the west portal. In the field, kill Fabre to obtain Fluffs and Green Herbs. Kill Chonchon or Pupa to get Shells.

, Now head north and enter the portal to move to the next field. You will find Stainer, which is a monster that looks like a ladybug. Kill it to obtain Rainbow Shell.


Make sure to bring a lot of red potions as these monsters have higher defense compared to other monsters.

, Now that we have obtain some of the items, it's time to head back to Payon Town using the Kafra NPC in Prontera. In Payon, exit the town through the southern portal and kill Willows for Trunks.


Be careful while exploring the field as the monster Wanderer haunts this place; it can kill low-level players with one hit.

, The old man won't tell you the secret item unless you hand in the other requirements. Talk to him to hand in the items and then keep on talking until he gives in, telling you that he needs 1 Milk.


Since you have already purchased Milk, simply talk to him again to give him the Milk and complete his item quest.

, Take the airship again in Izlude to reach the Einbroch. Enter the building at the center of the map and then talk to the NPC at the entrance. He will congratulate you for completing the test and then turn you to a Gunslinger.


For Gunslinger items, simply go deeper into the building to find the second NPC. This NPC sells weapons such as rifles and pistols, including ammunition.
Keep in mind that you need ammunition to use guns, same as how archers need arrows.

It's advisable that you have an Assassin Cross instead of just an Assassin. With Assassin Cross, you get to keep stronger skills such as Soul Breaker, which is highly effective for mid-range combat. Meteor Assault is perfect to control crowds as well, especially when you're doing solo leveling or hunting.;
, Locate a Kafra employee. To find one, look for a box icon in your mini map found at the upper right-hand side of your screen. This indicates the location of a Kafra employee. Kafra can be found in any city in the game.


Head to the Kafra employee and then talk to her. This will open a small window with options. Choose Use Teleport Service, and then select Morroc from the list.
Remember that the only Kafra Service you can use to get to Morroc City are from Prontera, Payon, and Comodo.

Follow the long path until you reach the end, and enter the portal to be teleported inside the Pub.
Inside, you will find a cloaked NPC sitting alone by the counter named Guild Member. Talk to this NPC by clicking on him, and he will ask for your name. The NPC will then explain that his master knows about you and is aware that you have a potential ability.
The NPC, Ahcart, will then offer you to do a certain duty, and you will be rewarded once completed.

, The NPC will then tell you to go to Veins to talk to Daora regarding the task.

, Go back to Prontera City using the Kafra Service in Morroc.


From Prontera, use the Kafra Service again to teleport to Izlude.
Once you're in Izlude, head south from the town and then follow the pathway until you reach the airship port. There will be an NPC standing in front of the airship. Talk to her and she will ask you for the destination. Choose Rachel.

, You have to wait inside until the Captain announces that you have arrived in Rachel. Only then you can step out from the airship.


In Rachel, look for a Kafra employee using the mini map. Talk to her to use the teleport service to reach Veins.

, Once you get in Veins, the Town of Deserts, head south (the place will be indicated by a box icon on your mini map). From there, walk east and follow the trail that leads northeast until you find an NPC by the road named Ledrion. He's not difficult to spot as he's the only NPC with jet-black hair and wearing formal attire.


To his left, are a set of staircases that lead to the guild. Climb the stairs then follow the path until you reach the end. Enter the glowing portal next to the small house at the end of the path.
Once inside, just like the Pub in Morroc, keep on walking until you reach the end.
The next room looks like the Pub in Morroc but with less NPC. Here you will find Daora next to a small girl behind the bar.

, She will offer you a drink, choose “.....” to have her ask for your name, and she will then recognize you.


Daora will then instruct you to go inside the next room to meet someone.

, In the next room, just right across the counter, you will find a portal. Get inside and then enter the portal at the left side of the screen. This is the room where you will meet Mayshell.


Mayshell is standing behind the counter; simply talk to her and she will explain to you the special quest that was mentioned by Ahcart in Morroc City.
The quest is about tracking and assassinating a person, but for now, you need to head back to Daora to ask for assistance.

, Choose “Ask for 1 glass” once the selection appear. She will then explain that she can't give you a drink while on duty.

, This time, select “.....” to show that you're disappointed. She will then apologize and yet again explain that she can't give you any glass.

, A new selection will appear. Choose “Ask for help.” Daora will then give you hints regarding the person you're tracking.

, With clues in hand, go out of the Pub and look for Trovan, the Vigilante in Veins. He can be found in the northeastern part of the city. Simply climb down the stairs where Ledrion is standing and then follow the road that leads north.


You will find the Vigilante NPC standing to your right, holding a huge sword. Talk to him to ask about finding any strangers in town.

, Check your mini map. The location of this shop is indicated by a bottle icon. Head to it and enter the building.

, Crave is the trader mentioned by Daora earlier; talk to him and ask if he found any strangers around.

, To find the Bar, from the Tool Shop, step out and then cross the rope bridge. Walk to your left to get on top of the building and then head north.


Once you reach the wall, walk to your left to cross the hidden pathway. Follow the path, but DO NOT climb up the ladder.
Near the end of the path, you need to climb down the stairs to find a portal next to the Bar; go inside and meet Madelle.

, After that, ask if she found any strange guests in the Bar.


After her explanation, a selection will appear regarding the Vigilante's information. Choose “Unfamiliar.”

, Have the information analyzed.


In the first set of options, choose 1 glass to ask her for a drink; another set of options will appear.
Choose “Residence is unclear” and then “More than 2.” Daora will agree with you.

, In the next set of options, select “Ask Advice” and then “Heart-to-heart.” Daora will then explain to you about a young girl who knows how to find people.

, This young girl can be found at the center of Veins City. She's the girl with blond hair standing behind the cactus near the cliff, so make sure to climb up when you reach the middle of the map. During the conversation, she will ask you for the details of the person you're looking for. Select the following:


“A Girl”
“Light Yellowish Hair”
“Young”
The Girl will then mention Estillda.
Estillda will soon appear within one hour at the upper right of the city.

, Head to the upper right of the city, but before you’re near the dead-end, use your Cloak skill to trigger the event right away.


While under Cloak, make your way closer to the dead-end and a dialogue will appear, announcing that you're hiding and a female appeared out of nowhere.
You will have the option to attack her, so choose “Surprise attack” to start the conversation.
Remember NOT to remove your Cloak skill as this will cancel the event.

, She will tell you that Estillda is waiting in the other room.

, Enter the portal across the bar and then enter the room to your right. Estillda will be standing behind the table, waiting for questioning. Ask her questions regarding the mastermind.


Estillda will explain to you that she will be meeting with someone at the house in the southern part of the town.

, Exit the building and then travel south until you're near the exit portal. Walk to the right side until you find a house. Climb down the stairs and a dialogue will appear; choose “Go inside.”

, Inside the building is a man wearing black clothes standing near the wall. Talk to him, and he will pretend that he is innocent but will soon attack you.


You don't have to worry about defeating the enemy; you can kill him with just a few hits. So if you're an AGI-type assassin, this will be very easy for you.
Make sure to use skills to halve his health quickly.

, Click the body again to leave the house.

, She will then ask you regarding your progress. Select “Show the key” to proceed to your next quest.

, Daora will explain to you about a key artisan in Rachel named Oresa. Head to Rachel using the Kafra Service, and once you're in Rachel City, head to the southwestern part of the map to find a house with portal in front of it.


Oresa Rava will be standing alone in the room.

, Talk to him about the key, and he will tell you about the Mansion.

, Return to the Assassin Guild in Veins and show Mayshell the key. She will tell you about a member who knows how to get inside the Mansion.

, Walk east a bit. The girl will be standing near the city wall, hiding in the corner.

, Now it's time to kill the Mastermind. Talk to the female assassin to start the quest; she will explain to you that you only have 10 minutes to complete the assassination.


Keep in mind that you need to have enough potions to survive as there will be demon dogs and guards around the mansion.
If you're ready, talk to the girl again and say “I got it.” You will be teleported outside the Mansion.

,


Remember, demon dogs can still see you even if you use your Cloak, so be careful when exploring the place.

, From the entrance, head northeast until you find a round shadow next to the gate, indicating that there's a gap you can crawl into.


Once you're inside, use Cloak to avoid the enemies until you find the mansion.
Enter the building through the back door, and there you will find the Mastermind.

, Talk to the NPC to start the fight, but be careful as other monsters may join in the fight.


You can lure the enemy NPC in an empty room to avoid distraction. Keep on using your skills, and if possible, use your Enchant Deadly Poison (if you're using an Assassin Cross). This will increase the damage you inflict against the Mastermind.
Do not forget about your health; use Red Potions to avoid being killed.
If you run out of time, you will be automatically warped from the mansion and will have to do the assassination quest again.

, Once you have successfully killed the Mastermind, exit the mansion through the back door then walk northeast to find a female Assassin Cross. Talk to her, and she will teleport you straight to the guild.

, Go inside the room where Mayshell is, and she will give you a reward if your grade is higher than C; otherwise, you won't receive a Jewelry Box, which contains a random accessory you can use.

, After talking to Mayshell, go to the next room across. You will find Bercasell standing in the room alone. Talk to him and prove that you're ready to change your job to Guillotine Cross.


After he changes your class, he will give you Silent Executor (headgear) and a Green Apple Ring.

, After passing your written exam, Bijou will send you to the stage to dance. At this point, make sure that you equip a bow and some arrows, and then head behind the stage to meet another NPC with a Waiting Room chat window above her head. Entering the chat room will put you on queue for the trial. Wait for your turn until you're automatically teleported to the stage., The exam is a simple test of movement and quick responses. At this point, you must put your Arrow Shower or Double Strafe skill in your hotkey, including Improve Concentration. At the end, a Poring will appear that has to be killed with a bow.

, The Dancing Pattern is as follows: Back, Front, Left, Right, Center, Pose (remain on the tile), Improve Concentration, Left, Front, Right, Pose (remain on the tile), Left, Center, Right, Back, Right, Left, Center, Front, Back, Left, Center, Front, Back, Front, Left, Center, Kill the Poring.


For those who are having problems with the pattern, an effective way to pass this exam is to perform only the first and last steps for sequences with more than two steps, rather than hitting all the tiles. For example, instead of doing ""Left, Center, Right, Back,"" just simply go from ""Left” to “Back.""

, Accomplish that by talking to Aile again after the Dance Exam. She will reward you with either a Line (for job level 50) or a Rope (for any job level below 50). You will then officially be a Dancer!

,

Don't put anything that can distract the guests from what they are here to do—eat! Remember when you eat, use good table manners. Royalty never scoffs down their food. Remember to serve healthy and never serve fast food.

, If you want to be treated nicely, treat others nicely. Never criticize poor Jammers. Instead, give them gems and food, but do not give too much. And stand up for Jammers who are bullied, instead of laughing at them, remember to be a good person.

, See if you can get your friends to help you start a private school for royalty.


Create a dress code. An example could be dresses and coats, or tuxedos and swords. If you prefer for the dress code, anything that can look classy and if they are wearing correctly, it is classy.

, Then you can say: Cast/Brace/Bandage Is Encrusted With Real Diamonds! Or, you can wear a golden glove, because it is pure gold. You can do the same thing with red, green, and a darker or lighter blue. Rubies, emeralds, and sapphires are good choices.

, Anything less than that is not acceptable.

, Only the best for royalty will do. While you can shop at Jam Mart places, it has to be royal-looking and feeling. A lot of this clothing will come from more expensive places. If you want to, have a lot gem encrusted items. Have a few gold bricks laying around, for instance.

, Preferably with a cute little bow, as well as a crown if you can find one.

, Advertise in Township and get your friends to make their rooms in their dens.

, Once you do, say: Gracefully let's (insert hair color here) Curls Flow Down Back!

Part One. It should go ""A merchant without money or equipment, a Merchant that couldn't sell anything. But he was too proud to beg. So he gathered some money selling items. At first he only sold Red Potions. Some say he sold Sweet Potatoes, too.""

Part Two. It should go ""All Gods never age. The ever so beautiful Goddess Eden, Beautiful and graceful Goddess Eden, Odin's daughter-in-law and Bragi's wife. Her sweet apples in her basket, all thanks to her sweet apples.""

Part Three. It should go ""There was a man who was said to be immortal. His name Jichfreid, son of the hero Jichmunt. The evil giant Papner, turned into a dragon and ate him.""

Part Four. It should go ""Louder, louder, louder. Give strength to the warriors! Shake the sky and roar through the land. Make my heart pound again! Let the castle walls ring. This day will never come again!""

Part Five. It should go ""Bragi, Bragi, forever calls the poets name. My songs are his breath, my mind is his will, all wandering poets are his people, and all praise shall go to him.""

, After successfully copying the Bard's lyrics, he will officially change your job to Bard., After your job change, the Bard will offer to give you a weapon if you have 60 Trunks. Each type of Trunk gives you a different weapon. For 60 Trunks, you will receive a Violin. Violins have 3 slots and 50 attack power. The element is neutral, and the weapon can be upgraded. Trunks can be obtained from Willow and Elder Willow at Payon Field.

, For this kind of Trunk, you will receive a Mandolin. Mandolin gives batter attack, which is 90, still with neutral element, and can be upgraded. Compared to Violins, Mandolins only have 2 slots. Solid Trunks and Barren Trunks can be obtained from Willows at Payon Field, but have a lower drop rate compared to Trunk.

, You get a Lute with two slots for 60 Fine-Grained Trunks. This weapon has a neutral element but has an amazing 105 attack power. But if you have enough Zeny, purchase this weapon from Comodo Weapon Dealer instead for 24,500z. Fine-Grained Trunks can be obtained from Willows as well, but only have 10% chance of drop.

, If you're an Archer with a job level 50, the Bard will give you a Harp instead of a Lute. Harps also have 2 slots, but compared to Lutes, you can get 114 attack power plus 2 INT. Harps are also neutral in element and can be upgraded, but cannot be purchased from weapon dealers.

Talk to the Little Boy.",How to Change to Class Soul Linker in Ragnarok Online," In order for you to become a Soul Linker, you need to have a Taekwon with job level of 40 or above. Job points should be used as well, so make sure to distribute it to your preferred skill before taking the job-change quest.;
, If you're qualified, head to Morroc City, found southwest from Prontera.


You can also just use the Kafra NPC to teleport to Morroc City. Keep in mind that you need to pay a fee in order for you to use their Kafra service.

, To take the Soul Linker quest, you need to cross to the other realm where you can meet the job-change NPC. In order to get there, talk to the Little Boy first at the northwestern part of Morroc City.


Enter the building near portal that leads to the pyramids and then approach the child NPC. The boy will tell you about his problem. As reward, he will help you go to the other dimension.
For his quest, you need one Worth less Rose, one Immortal Heart, and one 3-Carat Diamond.

, There are two options in obtaining this item: buy it or get it from drops. If you want to buy it, simply enter the portal at the upper right of Morroc City and then approach the small lake found in the map. Once you reach there, head east to find the trader NPC.


Each Witherless Rose is 55,000 zeny, which is quite expensive.

, This second option saves you money, but it requires effort. Witherless Rose is dropped from Wild Rose in any city of the game. Though their number is quite few, they're not hard to find.


Obeaune also drops Witherless Rose, which can be found in Undersea Tunnel.
To get in the Undersea Tunnel, simply go to Izlude and take the ship heading for Byalan Island at the upper-right side of the city. Once there, go to the center and enter the portal.

, The only way to obtain an Immortal Heart is by killing Verit. Verit is an undead monster found in Pyramid Dungeon at floor 3 or in the basements.

, Kill Isis in the Pyramid dungeon.


Isis is a snake-lady monster found in upper level 2 or level 4.
Be careful in hunting Isis in level 4 as Osiris, an MVP monster, also appears in that place.
It is best to bring a Priest with you in a party or a good tank.

, After completing the materials, head back to Morroc then talk to the Little Boy again to hand in the items. You will then be transported to the other world for you to meet the quest NPCs. Talk to all three NPCs until you reach the end of the maze.


Each NPC will explain to you the skills of the Soul Linker and their ways. Simply press Enter until their dialogue ends so that you can proceed to the next room.

, In the last room, you will meet the Little Boy again. Talk to him and he will tell you more about the Soul Linker. He will then change your job, successfully completing the job-change quest. After he turns you into Soul Linker, you will be teleported back to Morroc."

Get an animal that truly fits you.,

Get Rare Item Mondays and Trade.,
Get a good outfit.,
Be kind; Mailtime doesn't matter, it just makes people jealous of you.,
Be mature.,
Ignore anyone who annoys you.,
Don't be soppy..,
Throw parties!,
Don't be a snob.,
Be nice!,
Open up a blog.,
You want to know how to get a bunch of gems?",How to Be Rich on Animal Jam," If you can't get one or if you're a nonmember, get a fox or a wolf. They also look great with rares. But the most important thing is to be yourself, while a koala might not be considered a very Rare Animal or Famous Animal Mister Chunkybuddy's Koala, decked out with golden items, including a Founders Hat cuts the rich look.;
, Sometimes they have rare awards on Hard mode. But to truly get rares and betas, then the flying animal Adventure The Forgotten Desert can get you basically any item in Jamaa.

, While this can be a slow way to get rares, trading several rare item Mondays for a rarer item, like a fox hat or bow can get you rare. Also, after several months, the rare would have more value. Whatever you do don't scam people. This may sound like a option but it's not the best.

, It doesn't matter if you have lots of rares on your outfit, or strictly clothing store items. As long as the colors blend and you like it then it's a good outfit. But try to get an outfit that is pretty hard to copy, with a rare sprinkled here and there.

, If you have fan mail and presents, enjoy them but don't brag. Just because your famous it doesn't mean you can't help out a new jammer or color an item for a nonmember.

, Use good punctuation, don't get mad and don't randomly accept buddy requests. Visiting your fans is fine, but that doesn't mean you have to buddy them..

, You see a Jam-a-gram appear on the icon, and it says: ""Hey, can you help me? My trading system isn't working so could try to see and maybe just try to do a really good item for my necklace? I'll say no I promise I will scam! Ignore it. Many people say that and do that but it turns out to be a scam and of course, everybody's trade works. On mail time don't bother replying if it's just saying things like: ""Be mine valentine!"", ""Add me I'm your fan!"", ""OMG YOU'RE RARE I'M YOUR FAN ADD ME JAMMER. It's just time wasted.

, If you see an animal lying down saying: Send me stuff it's my birthday but nobody cares cause im are a random pixel .' It's always a scam. Even if you own loads of bows, don't do it. Someone who you know in reality or know online and trust for ages may need it much more. Plus why would you want pixels for your birthday? You can't eat a computer screen (you will die kids), you can't stroke or hug it, you can't keep it with you forever, can you? No. Even if you did, when you're 32, do you think it's worth it, no. Don't fool for the I am Poor! Scam, EVER!

, If everyone loves you, don't just keep coming around places, watching people surround u with delight then literally cry that you leave... Never to be seen by them again. Throw parties so people actually get to see you for more than 5 seconds. On occasions, at a certain time only, throw special ones like plushie parties, phantom parties, or gummy bear parties!

, Saying ""I am rare, Admire me, I am famous!"" And stuff will make people think you're boasting and its not worth liking you. Furthermore, if you own a YouTube channel, if someone keeps sending you an ""I'M A FAN ADD ME!!!"" Letter ignore it.

Don't swear. Nobody likes anyone who swears or doesn't appreciate it if you send a letter with the claw in it and all you get it a brutal snarky grumble, you could be hated by all who you meet, or you could even get banned.







, Don't gloat about how big your channel is, or how epic you look. Be kind and don't keep saying how cool you look, say how cool other people look!

, If you don't like the sound of uploading a bunch of videos, make a blog! Don't brag about how much followers you have. Blogspot is good.

, This gives you 10,000 gems, but it depends on how many items you have, and it's not cheating. This only works for players who have been on AJ for a long time. Recycle the real unrare items, such as store items, both furniture and clothing.

The gathering quest can be skipped if you bring a Chivalry Emblem and a Hand of God for the first time you talk with the Senior Crusader.

At this part of the quest, you will be tested by Murank, telling you to run a gauntlet of monsters—Mandragora, Flora, Greatest General, and Familiar—without attacking any of them. Having Endure skill is helpful in this part of the test.

, After you successfully finished the test, the Man in Anguish will mention about a Crusader in the Prontera Church. Head there for your knowledge test.

, Enter the church then head north; you will find the Crusader near the altar. Talk to her to take the knowledge test.

You can ask your friends who are Priest or Acolyte to make Aqua Benedicta for you.
You can also pay any Priest or Acolyte for Aqua Benedicta.

, Now that you have Aqua Benedicta, talk to Patron Knight to continue the quest. You must then fight through multiple waves of monsters in 4 minutes.


The first wave of monsters are 6 Zombies.
The second wave are 3 Soldier Skeletons.
The third wave are 1 Mummy and 1 Archer Skeleton.
The fourth wave is a Ghoul version of the player.

, After you have finished the monster test, return to Senior Crusader, and he will change your job to Crusader!

9765/3/5/7 = 93
(35*19) - (1,792/7) = 409
(47*28) - (1376/4) = 972

Buy 5 Mini Furnaces while you are in the Blacksmith Guild for another part of the quest. You can buy the furnaces on the first floor of the building.

, After talking with Morgenstein and buying 5 mini furnaces, return to Al de Baran (simply use the Kafra at the south part of Geffen to teleport). Talk with Van Hellmont, and he will ask you two questions pertaining the quest you took earlier. For reference, see below:


Counteragent - Detrimindextra (1) + Alcohol (1)
Mixture - Karvodailnirol (1) + Alcohol (1)

, Van will direct you to Chief Researcher, Nicolas Flamel, in the next room. Nicolas will give you simple word puzzles, which include unscrambling names and items in Ragnarok and other words. There are four questions in each of the three sets of questions, but you're only requires to answer one of the sets:


Puzzle set 1

m p d i c f a r o g n k w a s (packman)
g b n o p r e f a r e t a s k (ragnarok)
u g n i s j e k c e o g n d p (opening)
r o e h n r o m c a i n p t t (potionmerchant)


Puzzle set 2

t m y a n y e o b n e g p r i (brigan)
o n c u t a p j l e r s v m u (vendor)
t v a r m e g p h e u b o y l (party)
q z a h n a i n b r d p t n c (partizan)


Puzzle set 3

s m i e x b w u n e t a g i r (tiger)
n i e g b o p d s o a u w r v (endure)
l r m g r e x t a v i n e d e (evergreen)
r o e h n r o m c a i n p t t (potionmerchant)


After you have passed the exam, talk to Nicholas again and he will give you several items that are needed for the next part of the quest.
DO NOT sell or store the items he gives you. You will also be needing a few items aside from the items Nicholas gave you: 5 Coal, 5 Mini Furnaces, and 2,000z.

, With the items mentioned in step 1 above in your inventory, go to Juno to meet Bajin and Bain. You will find them inside the building in the southwestern area of Juno City. Go upstairs and then talk to the brothers, give them all the items, and they will attempt to make Gold.


This experiment fails most of the time, and you will receive a variety of items from iron ores to gold, depending on luck.

, After the experiment, head back to Al De Baran and talk with Nicholas again. He will tell you to go upstairs. At the second floor, you will meet the Master Alchemist with rainbow-colored hair to change jobs.


If you're a job level 50, you will receive a Condensed Potion Creation Guide (which cost 240,000z at NPCs).
If you're a Merchant with a job level below 50, you will receive a random potion manual, which are 100,000 each and sold by the male Alchemist on the ground floor.

Talk to the Master.",How to Become a Warlock in Ragnarok Online," Make sure that you're using a Wizard or High Wizard with base level 99 and job level 50 or higher. To go to Morroc City, you can either use the Kafra Service in any city or ask a Priest to warp you to the location.


Using Kafra Service will require you to pay from 800 zeny to 1,200 zeny, depending on the distance.
Once you reach Morroc City, go to the center of the map then travel southwest until you see the broken walls caused by Satan Morroc. Follow the walls until a dialogue appears, stating that there's a strange distortion in the ground you're standing.
From the selection, click “Search the Area” then press “OK.” The next dialogue will appear; your character will say that they found nothing but can still feel something around them. This time, choose “Extend arm.”
You will be teleported to a small map with three small NPCs and their Master at the middle. Talk to one of them, and they will start to panic after seeing you. The Master will introduce herself as the leader of Warlocks.
Choose dialogues that you're interested in becoming a Warlock, and she will soon reconsider but will test your ability.
Right after talking to the Master, talk to the small NPC with blond ponytail. She will give you the list of items needed in order to progress. Also, she will give you two Magical Stones. Wear these while hunting for items as this is part of the quest.
It's time to hunt, but first, leave the place by talking to the small blond-haired NPC in a white dress behind the Master.;
, You are now outside Splendide, the home of the Warlocks and fairies. In order for you to progress, you need to gather a Shining Crystal and a Giant Bradium, which can be obtained from hunting Naga and Bradium Golems.


Make sure you have equipped the two Magical Stones as they give the chances of dropping the said items.
From Splendide, head south then follow the road that leads northeast where you can find the exit. This portal will move you to the field where you can find the Naga and Golems.
Kill the monsters until you obtain the quest items.

, Now that you have obtained the items needed, return to Yoop in Splendide City. From the middle of the city, travel northwest until you find a branch that leads to the upper floor.


Climb up then travel northwest until you find a small house with a portal. Enter the portal and there you will find the NPC named Yoop.
Talk to Yoop and tell her that you have brought the materials. She will then ask you to give her the Magical Stones, so make sure you unequip them.
In case you have lost the Magical Stones, you can talk to Yoop, and she will give you another one. After talking to her, she’ll tell you to go back to Master Egnoloria while she makes the Magic Stone.

, There are two ways to return to the Master Warlock:


The first one is to go back to Morroc and then approach the very same spot where you felt the distortions. Choose the same selections, and you will be teleported to the small room.
The second option is to go to the northwestern part of the town, but only on the ground floor. Stick to the corner until a dialogue window appears. Choose the same selection, and you will be teleported to where the Master Warlock resides.

, Once you're inside, talk to the Master Warlock and she will tell you that the Magic Stone being made by Yoop is a powerful magical item. She will then give you your next test. Talk to the blue-haired girl once you're ready.


The girl will explain to you the mechanics of the test; talk to her again to be teleported to the next room.
Once you're in the room, enter the chatroom with the title “The Chamber of Magic” then wait for your turn to take the test. If there are no other players taking the same test, you will be teleported right away to the dungeon.
You will also be given four (4) types of Rainbow Rubies, 5 pieces each. These rubies consist of Warlock skills that you can use for the monster exam, so make sure to put them in your shortcut key before entering the chat room.

, Once it's your turn, you will be teleported into a small room where you get to fight the monsters. They will quickly surround you and prevent your character from casting unless you have a Phen Clip.


For those who cannot afford to purchase a Phen Card, use Storm Gust as soon as you enter the room to control the crowd. Keep in mind that there are aqua elementals that are immune to your Storm Gust; moving away from them before using one of the Rainbow Rubies works, as long as the Nagas, Golems, and other monsters are frozen and unable to attack you.
Remember that after killing the monsters, the next round will start right away. Use Storm Gust again, followed by the Rainbow Rubies.

, After the 3rd spawn of monsters, a final monster will appear named Hollow Stone. It won't attack or do anything, but you must attack it using your skills, or if you have Rainbow Rubies left, use it all to halve its HP. You will only be given 10 minutes to do this until its HP reaches zero.


If you failed the test, you won't be teleported back to the room where the Master Warlock resides. You will have to return to your last save point, travel to Morroc again, and enter the distorted zone.

, After defeating the Hollow Stone, you will be teleported back to the small room with the NPCs. Talk to the blue-haired girl first and she will tell you how impressed she was and will update your Quest Log.


Talking to the Master Warlock before the blue-haired NPC won't do anything.

, After being congratulated by the blue-haired NPC, talk to the Warlock and she will express how surprised she was. She will then turn your class to Warlock as promised and also give you a Magic Stone Hat and Green Apple. You are now a full-fledge warlock.


To leave the place, simply talk to the blond NPC in a white dress. She will teleport you back to Splendide.
If you have your last save point in a different city, use Butterfly Wing instead to teleport out from Splendide.

Become a Shadow Chaser.",How to Become a Shadow Chaser in Ragnarok Online," Keep in mind that you need to use a Rogue or Stalker class in order to change into a Shadow Chaser. The level requirement to start the quest is Base Level 99 and Job Level 70 or higher.
, Head to Morroc City using the Kafra Teleport Service. To locate a Kafra in the city, check your mini map, which can be found at the upper right corner of the screen, then look for an icon that resembles a brown satchel or treasure chest and head for it.

Once you reach the icon, look for a female wearing a maid attire. Talk to her by left-clicking and a window will open.
Scroll down the list to find “Use Teleport Service.” Click “Morroc” for your destination and then press “OK.”
Using Teleport Service requires you to pay for the fees. Depending on the traveling distance, fees ranges from 800z to 2500z, so make sure to bring money with you.

, Now that you’re in Morroc, from the center, head south of the city until you find a Girl with long purple hair standing next to a tent full of textile. Approach her and she will automatically talk to you, asking if you’re interested about a funny story.

After the brief dialogue, right-click her to start the conversation. Only then will she tell you about the Shadow Chaser.
If you click the girl again, she will tell you the destination of the Shadow Chaser’s hideout, the Pharos Lighthouse.

, The Pharos Lighthouse, also called the Rogue Guild, can be found at southwest from Morroc. To reach there, head south from Morroc City to leave and enter the field.

From there, head south again and enter the portal. Keep traveling west until you reach the map where there’s an island linked by two bridges; you can check this using your mini-map.
Head to the island using the bridge. There will be aggressive monsters in this area, but you can easily get rid off it. Head to the center of the island and climb down the long staircase.
Once you reach the end, look to your right and you will see a glowing portal, next to the pipe. Enter the portal to be teleported in the Rogue Guild.

, Inside the Rogue Guild, take the stairs that leads to the lower floor then enter the portal. In that floor, search for a man with an eye patch and surrounded by two young guild members. Talk to him and he will give you a cryptogram to solve in order for you to find the location of your next quest.

As the man explained, 35 11 54 34 33 is PAYON. If we break it as P = 35, A = 11, Y = 54, O = 34, N = 33, it gives us five letters with its corresponding codes as clue. Now the code which the Scary Man gives is 43 23 11 14 34 52 / 52 34 42 30 43 23 34 35 / 24 33 / 35 42 34 33 44 15 42 11.
If you can’t figure out the code, the answer is “Shadow Workshop In Prontera.”

, Now that we have deciphered the code, go back to Morroc using a butterfly wing, if you have any, or go on foot. Once you’re in Morroc, use the Kafra Service again to teleport to Prontera City.

In the city, go to the southeastern part of the map and then walk north, following the trail until you find a house with a portal by the door. Enter the portal.

, Once you’re inside, take the stairs that leads to the upper floor found at the upper left of the workshop and then look for an old man. He’s the manager of the workshop and the one who will give you the next quest.

When you talk to him, choose “Show the deciphered code” and then type in the code. For some reason, the “Shadow Workshop in Prontera” doesn’t work as a code, probably due to translation error. To get fix this, type in: “Shadow atelier in Prontera.”

, Right after you type in the deciphered code, he will reveal that their group breaks in and steals treasure. For your next quest, he will ask you to steal a treasure then return it to him, but first, you must solve his code in order for you to find your next destination.

He will give you a long set of codes, the same as the first one back in Rogue Guild. The message you will get from the code is: “Blue Fire in Turtle Island third floor.”

, To go to Turtle Island, you need to use the Kafra Teleport Survive again to travel to Alberta., From Alberta City, go to the southeastern part of the map where you will find sailors and ships. You will find an old man on the boat there and he can take you to Turtle Island for a fee.

Keep in mind that in order for the sailor to take you to the Turtle Island, you have to finish the Entrance Quest first, which is quite easy. All you have to do is to enter the Inn in Alberta found across the entrance of the city and look for an old man named Grandpa Turtle.
Talk to Grandpa Turtle and show that you’re interested about the Turtle Island until you get to ask him “How can I get there?” Only then will the Sailor allow you to travel to Turtle Island for a fee of 10,000z.

, Once you’ve reach the Turtle Island, enter the dungeon and then travel to the 3rd floor. At the 3rd floor, head to the upper left side of the map until you reach the dead end; that’s where you will find the Blue Flame., It will ask you for the code you deciphered previously. Simply type in: “Blue Fire in Turtle Island third floor.”, After you enter the code, the Blue Flame will summon a Shadow of Deception, which can be found somewhere in the map. Look for it and then kill it., Now that you have killed the Shadow of Deception, return to the Blue Flame and then talk to it to be teleported to a closed room. In that room is a treasure chest at the middle for you to take., Click the chest and choose whatever interaction you find fit and it will give you a coded message with “DECEIVE” and “HONESTY” as hints. The first to appear is a number of key, second will be the code. Once you have typed in the right answer, you will be given a “Key of Deception.”

Here are the answers of the codes in this order: Key, Code, Answer.

1 EFDFJWF IPOFTUZ
2 FGFGKXG JQPGUVA
3 GHFHLYH KRQHVWB
4 HIGIMZI LSRIWXC
5 IJHJNAJ MTSJXYD
6 JKIKOBK NUTKYZE
7 KLJLPCL OVULZAF
8 LMKMQDM PWVMABG



, To get out of the room, simply click on the treasure chest after you have received the key and then select, “Get out of the room” to be teleported back to 3rd floor of Turtle Island dungeon., Now return to Prontera and meet the Manager in the Shadow Workshop to give him the key., After you showed the key to the manager, he’ll be quite shock to know that the treasures are fake and that you have been deceived. He will tell you to go to Rachel to meet a manager of the Shadow Workshop there; he will give you the code you need once you tell the person that Graham sent you.

In order for you to reach Rachel, use the Kafra Service again to travel to Izlude. From Izlude, head south and follow the path that leads to the bridge and then to the aircraft.
Take the aircraft to Rachel by talking to the maid NPC standing next to the aircraft. She will ask you to pay 1,200z for the ticket.
After you pay for the ticket, you will be automatically teleported inside the aircraft. Remember not to leave the aircraft unless the announcement states that the ship has arrived in Rachel.

, First thing you need to do is to head to the center of the city where all the intersection meet. From there, take the right path and make sure you turned your camera around to see the doors of the shops lined up.

To turn your camera around, simply hold the right-click button of your mouse then move your mouse to left or right. Enter the portal next of the display of pots to enter the Shadow Workshop.

, From inside the workshop, head to the next room to find the Manager. Talk to him and select the option “Graham sent me.”

The Manager, named Paul, will give you another code to decipher, which will lead you to the Ice Dungeon and Lighthalzen for the next task.

, First, head to the Ice Dungeon to talk to the Red Flame. In order for you to get there, simply head out from Rachel through the east portal then keep on heading north until you have reached the last map. The last portal will teleport you to the Ice Dungeon., Once you’re inside, go to the next floor and then look at your mini map. You will notice that this map has four corners and each corner have a horizontal path that leads to the other road.

Notice that at the upper right side, the road has been cut off. Head to that direction and there you will find the Red Flame at the end of the path. Talk to the Flame and it will summon a monster named Shadow of Illusion.

, Look for the Shadow of Illusion in the map and kill it., After you killed the Shadow of Illusion, talk to the Red Flame to be teleported to a closed room., The same as the previous one, click on the treasure in the middle to receive a set of codes to solve., It’s very simple; all you need to do is to separate the numbers then add it to get the result like this:

COLD = 13 34 31 14 = 1+3+3+4+3+1+1+4 = 20
SEED = 43 15 15 14 = 4+3+1+5+1+5+1+4 = 24
FOOT = 21 34 34 44 = 2+1+3+4+3+4+4+4 = 25

, After you successfully answer the code, head back to Prontera to meet the Manager again and give him the Key of Illusion.

He will also advise that if the manager in Juno isn’t supportive, tell him, “I know what you did last summer!”

, You will be directed to go to Juno to meet the third workshop manager. To get to Juno, take the aircraft from Rachel., Once you get to Juno, you can find the Shadow Workshop at the most bottom right of the city, next to the city wall. Enter the building and then head to the basement where you will find the manager, Haled.

When you talk to Haled, you will be given an option to interact until it states that Haled refuses to cooperate. That’s when a command prompt will appear, type in the prompt: “I know what you did last summer!”
Haled will be alarmed and will tell you about a poem as hint, which will lead you to a place called Niflheim.

, You can only access Niflheim through Umbala, and to get to Umbala, you have to travel back to Izlude using the airship from Rachel and then use Kafra Teleport Service to go to Comodo City.

From Comodo City, leave the place through north and then keep on traveling north until you reach your destination, Umbala.
Looking at your mini map at the upper right side of the screen, you will see a red dot at the northern part of Umbala Village. Go there and then step in the portal to get inside the Yggdrasil Tree.
Going inside the Yggdrasil is the only way to get in Niflheim. Once you’re inside, be aware of the monsters and keep in mind that the mini map is useless at this point. Keep on exploring the place heading east until you find another portal that leads to the next level.
After entering two portals, you will be teleported to Niflheim. There are strong monsters in this level and mini bosses with high HP, so be careful.

, The Flame can be found at the middle northern part of the map.

Be aware that there are small monsters in this map and can detect hidden players. It’s best to kill the monsters first before you talk to the Flame.

, After talking to the Flame, it will summon the Shadow of Pleasure, which you have to kill in order to proceed to the next part., After killing the monster, return to the Flame to be teleported to a small closed room again for the code quest., This part of the quest is easy and simple, all you have to do is to convert each number to letters. For example, 1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C and so on.

The answer for the code is “Turn and shake.”
After you enter the answer, select ""Turn the house"" and ""Roll it to upside down"" to get the key.

, Now that you have the key, you may now return to Juno and give the key to the Manager., Now for the final part of the quest, Haled will ask you to visit Vicente to figure out the mystery of the keys; he can be found in the city called Lighthalzen. Lighthalzen can only be accessed through the airship, so take the airship in Yuno, which can be found at the upper left side of the city., The Shadow Workshop can be found at the southwest corner of the town. You will find the manager as soon as you enter the building. Talk to Vicente and show him the key to receive your next step—visiting the Thanatos Tower.

Before heading out, make sure you have enough Flying Wings, which can be purchased from general store NPC. Thanatos Tower has a lot of mob that inflicts huge damage. Your hiding and tunnel skill is useful this time, but if you’re using Rogue, hiding will be enough.

, To reach Thanatos Tower, return to Juno using the airship and then leave the city through the south portal.

From the field, enter the portal to the east, then enter the portal at north and then north again.
From there, walk northwest of the map to find an idling NPC, simply talk to him and ask to send you to the Thanatos Tower.

, Now that you’re inside the tower, use your hiding skill to avoid the enemies. Look at the mini map at the upper right side of your screen and you will find a spiraling path at the northern part.

Head to that location and approach the center of the spiral to find a portal which leads you to a room. In that room, there’s a statue.

, Right-click the statue to interact and then insert the keys to get a Master’s Brush., Now that you have the item you need, you can leave the place and return to Vicente. In the conversation with Vicente, you get to choose different options. Select whatever you see fit until he will tell you to head upstairs and talk to an important person named Dumk., Ask Dumk to change you to a Shadow Chaser and you will receive a Makeover Brush, Paint Brush, Shadow Handicraft, and Green Apple Ring along with your class change.

Congratulations, you’re now a Shadow Chaser!

A list of locations will be available for you; choose the destination you wish to teleport to, in this case, Prontera City.
If you have saved a warp to Prontera, you may use that as well.

, Once you're inside Prontera Sanctuary, walk down the hallway until you find a mature-looking man with blond hair and wearing a beret. Talk to him and he will tell you about Odin and how a priest can become more better in serving him. Tell him that you're interested and wish to join the Holy Pilgrimage, only then he will tell you about a priest in Umbala.


Look for the priest in Umbala to continue your quest.

, In order for you to get in Umbala Village, you have to use the Kafra Service again. From Prontera's Kafra Teleport Service, teleport to Morroc. From Morroc, use the service again to teleport in Comodo. From Comodo, use the service once more and then choose Umbala.


Once you're in the Village, travel northeast from the Kafra employee then follow the path until you have reached the upper center of the village. There you will find Priest Dayan standing next to a Utah boy.

, Click on the priest and talk to him until a small window appears where you can type in your response. Type in “I'm here for the Holy Pilgrimage” (without a period at the end, no quotation marks too).


Dayan will explain to you about the tree of life, Yggdrasil, and tell you to enter the tree to pray.

, After talking to Priest Dayan, head north until you reach the red mark found on your mini map. This is where you can find the entrance to Yggdrasil, but before you enter the tree, make sure you have Holy Water with you.


If you don’t have any Holy Water with you, you can create one by using your Aqua Benedicta skill. This skill, however, requires you to stand on a water, and you should have at least one empty bottle in your inventory. Empty bottles can be obtained by killing a monster named Poring outside Prontera City.

, Once you have Holy Water in your inventory, enter Yggdrasil. Travel to east until you encounter the first fork and take the pathway that leads to north.


At the second fork, take the path that leads to south. Keep on walking until you reach the end of the branch.

, As soon as you reach the end of the pathway, a dialogue will automatically appear on your screen.


For the first question, select “Meditation” to proceed.
For the next question, you will be asked to confess your sin; you can type in anything you want at this point.
Keep on right-clicking “Next” until the dialogue is over, and then you will be automatically teleported out from Yggdrasil.

, Once teleported, you will be standing right in front of Priest Dayan. Talk to him, and he will explain to you your next objective.


You will need to travel to Hugel and look for a nun named Vinue.

, To see Sister Vinue, we have to travel to Hugel first.


From Umbala, use the Kafra service to return to Prontera and then use the same service there to teleport to Izlude.
Once you reach in Izlude, head south then follow the path until you reach the airship port. There will be a female NPC wearing a pink gown standing there.
Talk to her to get in the airship to travel to Hugel.

, After reaching Hugel, go south from the airship port to find the church. Inside you will find Vinue, a nun NPC, by the seats. Disturb her prayer to have her talk to you.


Once options appear, choose “Ask about her dream,” and she will tell you the details about a Valkyrie.
On the second set of options, choose “Investigate,” and she will tell you to approach the boatman to bring you to Odin's Temple.

, The boatman can be found outside the church. Just simply walk east until you find the small port.

, Once you reach the island, enter any of the portals found at the eastern part of the map. You will then be teleported to the next field where you can find an illusion of Valkyrie. As soon as you enter the field, check your mini map. You will notice that there's a mark blinking to the northeast.


Head northeast to find an NPC. Be careful when traveling in this map as there are many monsters. Use your Teleport skill whenever you can to avoid being mobbed. Once you reach the NPC, click on her to talk and then choose “Touch” to be teleported to a room.
The Valkyrie will explain to you about collecting the pieces of a broken pipe, but before that, you have to summon a Mercenary Valkyrie that will be provided to you. Check your inventory by pressing Alt + E on your keyboard and then double-click on the summoning scroll to call forth the Mercenary.

, The location of the broken pipes can be seen on your mini-map as blinking marks. Be careful when approaching the pieces as there will be monsters around it.


Once you reach the location, kill the Undead Valkyrie, and they will drop the pieces you need.
After you have gathered all the pieces, another mark will appear on your mini map. This Valkyrie will have your pipe fixed.

, After combining the pieces, the Valkyrie will ask you to climb the hill to meet the Final Valkyrie. Head to the center of the map and climb the hill until you find a black demon named Frus. Ignore him and move on until you reach the top of the hill where the Valkyrie is waiting for you.


Click the Valkyrie, and he will thank you for your hard work. Your job class will be changed to Arch Bishop, and you will be rewarded with a Headgear and a Green Apple Ring.

Report to Chainheart.",How to Become a Mechanic in Ragnarok Online," Keep in mind that in order for you to become a Mechanic, your Blacksmith or Mastersmith should have a base level of 99 and a job level of 50 or higher. If you're qualified, travel to Yuno, also known as Juno, using the Kafra Service in Al De Baran.


If you don't know how to get in Al De Baran, simply use the Kafra Service in Geffen City. Remember that you need to pay fees for their services.
If you don't have any zeny with you, you can ask Priests to warp you to the location.
If you can’t find any Priests, just travel northeast from Geffen City. In case you get lost, you can open your map by pressing Alt +V. A menu will drop-down from the corner; click on the Map option to view your location.;
, Once you get to Yuno, look for an NPC named Chainheart. He can be found near the Blacksmith, near the center of the city.


To locate him, use the mini map at the upper-right corner of your screen. Approach the hammer icon on the map.

, He will tell you that you have potential. He will then introduce himself as a Mechanic.


After the first dialogue, click him again to continue. He will explain to you what Mechanics are and why they're important.
Click him again, and this time select “I want to know more.” He will be surprised and continue, but at the end of the conversation, he will ask you to visit someone in Juperos Ruins.

, From Yuno City, exit south. Once you're in the field, travel to the next map through the south portal. From the second field, enter the portal in the east. For the third map, approach the island in the middle.


You will find a glowing circle on the ground; get inside it to be teleported to the entrance of the ruins.
Make sure you have enough Fly Wings to avoid any aggressive monsters in the field.

, Once you enter Juperos Ruins, follow the path until you reach the end. There will be a Scholar NPC waiting for your there. Talk to him and he will tell you about the ruins.


Before talking to the NPC, make sure you have enough Fly Wings to use. If you can afford any slotted garment with a Frilldora Card, it's best to get one as the Cloaking skill will be useful for this part. Otherwise, you can ask a Priest to assist you for this quest.
Talk to the NPC again when you're ready, and he will then teleport you to the core of the ruins.

, As soon as you enter the room, you will find a Ghost NPC right in front of you. Talk to him and he will tell you that indulging in a conversation might get you killed since there are aggressive monsters in the map. This is the reason why the Frilldora Card is useful.


If you're alone, lure out the monsters first then use your Fly Wing whenever you're stuck.

, After talking to the first ghost, head southwest to find the next ghost. Talk to it after clearing the place and choose “Focus” from the selection.


The ghost will tell you about their history and the knowledge they know about machinery.

, After talking to the second ghost, head southeast to find the third one. Talk to it.


Again, clear the place first before clicking the NPC to avoid being killed.
If you get killed, you will be teleported back to your last saved point, and then you will have to travel all the way back to Juperos Ruins.

, Now you must activate 4 switches in a certain order:


The first one can be found to the west. Simply stand on the switch to activate it, and a message will appear.
The second switch is east of the map. Stand on the block to activate it, and a message will appear.
The third is to the south; you will find a huge statue against the wall. Simply move closer until your character is pressed against it to activate the hidden switch. A message will appear.
The fourth, and last, switch is also to the south, just right across the huge statue (third switch). Simply walk forward to find it, and then step on the block to activate.
Use Fly Wings whenever you're in danger; note that there's no need for you to clear the areas since all you need to do is to activate the switches.

, Now that you have activated all the switches and the knowledge you sought has been found, it's time to head back to the first ghost near the entrance. Talk to him and he will tell you about his tragic past and how he is stuck in that location forever.


Before he can tell you his name, you will be teleported back to Yuno.

, At Yuno, talk to Chainheart. He will explain to you what happened and then he will change your class to Mechanic.


Chainheart will also reward you with a Green Apple Ring and a Driver Band, which will give you a decent headgear stat.
Congratulations, you are now a Mechanic.

Use the Mobula.,
Use the Pyramidion.,

Learn about the medium guns.,
Learn about light guns.",How to Play Guns of Icarus Online," The Pilot is one of the leading character in the game. The Pilot is best suited to flying the airship—though anyone can take the wheel and fly the ship regardless of their class, but compared to other classes, the Pilot has the ability to focus on aerial maneuvers.


A Pilot can equip at least 3 piloting equipment, such as Moonshine, Kerosene, Hydrogen Canister, and Chute Vent. They can also equip one repair item and one weapon.
The Pilot's role of the game is to navigate the ship effectively and help Gunners have a good aim at the enemy.
The Pilot is the head leader of the group; it is much more effective if he or she gave orders to organize the crew.
To navigate your ship, press E at the wheel. Press R to pick up speed, F to decrease and back up, and W and S to increase and decrease latitude.
Moonshine and Kerosene can be placed in the piloting equipment slot. These items are used to increase speed in order to close the distance between his or her ship and the enemy’s. They are also useful for Pilots with the intention to ram others.
Impact Bumpers are piloting tools used to decrease the damage of colliding into other ships. It’s useful with Moonshine and Kerosene or for Pilots who wish to withstand enemies’ ramming attack.
Hydrogen Canister and Chute Vent are piloting tools used to increase the output of the ship's balloon or zeppelin. With this active, the ship will be able to ascend and descend much quicker. They’re good for avoiding attacks, especially Flamethrowers.
Using Hydrogen Canister and Chute Vent will inflict a bit of damage to your balloon.
Drogue Chute is used as counter to ships with balloon-destroying weapons. This tool will make the ship descend slowly if your balloon has been destroyed, giving the Engineers time to fix it. The drawback of using the Drogue Chute is that the ship's engines will be less than half as effective than normal.
Phoenix Claw is a Pilot's tool used to quickly rotate the ship, giving -65% angular drag and +300% longitudinal drag. Using this will inflict 13 damage per second to all engines.
Tar Barrel is another Pilot's tool. While active, it is used to damage and lose pursuers, releasing a cloud of tar behind it once every three seconds. The drawback is, the engines will also take damage. Ships that pass through the tar cloud will take damage to all systems.
Tar Barrel is used mostly by Pilots.
For repair tools, its advisable that the Pilot use the Pipe Wrench because it is the middle-of-the-road tool for both repairing and fixing.
Pilots can leave the helm to assist in the repairing or fixing damaged parts or even hop on a gun to help attack while the ship continues to fly.;
, As the class name suggests, Gunners specialize in taking control of an airship's weapons and attacking the enemy crafts. Gunners can switch between three different types of ammunition, as the situation dictates.


Gunners can also carry a repair tool into battle but lacks the versatility needed for complex repair work. Gunners often resort to maintaining only their primary weapon.
Gunners have 1 piloting equipment, the spyglass, and 1 repairing equipment. Most gunners use the Dynabuff Industries Kit instead of hammer or wrench.
Dynabuff is a hammer used to increase the output of ship components without damaging them. Every ship component can be buffed for bonuses, which is why Gunners prefer to use this item in order for them to buff up their guns, gaining extra damage.
Press E to any weapon you wish to use. You can change ammunition by moving the mouth wheel. To fire, right-click the mouse, and left-click to use the scope.
Burst Rounds are often used to wreck an enemy ship's system by increase the AoE radius on the gun.
Charged Rounds are used when increased damage is needed.
Greased Rounds are great for high DPS assaults as long as the Gunner is able to be accurate. It’s very useful along with Flamethrower.
Heatsink Clip is useful to prevent the gun from becoming unusable due to fire damage.
Heavy Clip is a perfect clip for weapons with a lot of weapon spread, such as Whirlwind, Banshee, and Hwacha, because it will lower the spread, which allows for longer range and more accurate shots.
Incendiary Rounds give the enemy Engineers grief as it randomly ignites systems for damage over time.
Lesmok Rounds increase the range of a gun by making the bullets fly faster and drop slower.
Lochnagar Shot is a high-risk, high-reward ammo that increases the damage of the gun to extreme heights, but it locks the weapon's turning capabilities and instantly breaks the gun after firing one shot.

, If you believe being an Engineer is an easy job in the game, you're wrong. Engineers are assigned in maintaining and repairing the ship. They extinguish fires, repair, build, and even enhance the ship's components.


Engineers carry 3 repair equipment with different uses that would fit any possible situations they may encounter.
Engineers also have to choose between the Chemical Spray or the Fire Extinguisher. Fire Extinguisher is better for single hit, high-fire problems while the Chemical Spray is more suited for long periods of multiple-hit-sustained fire damage.
Use the mouse wheel to change fixing tools, then right-click the engine you wish to fix.
Shifting Spanner is used in rebuilding the engines.
Rubber Mallet is used, along with the Shifting Spanner, to avoid the drawbacks of both tools.
Pipe Wrench is most commonly used by Engineers who want the best of both Rubber Mallet and Shifting Spanner. These tools fix broken ship systems twice as fast as the mallet and repairs three times as fast as the spanner. Draw back is, it fixes systems 1 rebuild power less than the spanner, and repairs about half as much as the mallet, but with constant attention, Pipe Wrench will be a very effective tool.
Dynabuff Industries Kit, along with the Pipe Wrench, increases the output of the ship's component without the fear of receiving any damage. It gives bonus damage to guns and extra pushing and turning power to engines; hulls gain more armor, and balloons lose vertical drag, which increases up and down movement.

, The Galleon has six gun load-out points. It has four medium gun point on the lower deck, two on the port side, and two on the starboard side. There are two small gun points, one on the mid-port side, and one on the stern's upper deck.


The Galleon is the only ship with two medium-sized cannons pointing in the same direction.
Having two medium carronades can be incredibly strong for a more aggressive play style.
If you go against fast ships, such as the Squid or the Goldfish, it can be useful to put a harpoon on a spare small weapon slot to avoid getting circled.

, The Goldfish is equipped with three gun points. There are two small gun points, one on the port side and one on the starboard side. There is also one medium gun point on the bow of the ship.


The Goldfish is a warship that has found widespread use as a front-line fighter.
It’s capable of both menacing charges and devastating broadside sweeps.
Despite the low hull armor, the Goldfish is one of the fastest ship in the game.

, The Junker has five small-weapon hard points, three mounted topside on the deck at port, starboard, and bow. Two more are mounted below deck at port and starboard.


The Junker has a decent number of weapons to be used for defense and offense, but despite the firepower, the Junker has a slow top speed and is lacking in hull health.

, A newly released ship in the game, the Mobula is a more advanced attack ship with 5 front-facing guns, though there are no guns on the side or back. The ship has good vertical movement but is more difficult to repair in the heat of the battle.


The Mobula is best equipped with shattering weapons such as flak cannons and missiles to cripple the engines and guns than use Gatlings or mortars to burst down the enemy.
Having 5 guns facing at the front can be use as an advantage, but repairing this ship can be a pain since engines and balloon are found on either side, which leads your engineers to run back and forth just to check and repair.

, This ship is built for steady and straight-line charges, using its armor-plated balloon to ram against the opponent. Many captains prefer the Pyramidion for its overall durability and ability to concentrate fire.

, The Spire has 4 gun load-out points. It has one medium gun on the second deck, and three small guns—one on the top deck, one on the middle deck, and one in the mid top deck facing the starboard side.


The Spire is not fast enough for close combat, but Pilots often adopt a ranged tactic since the Spire can be turned quickly and with ease.
All guns can be pointed at one direction, targeting the enemy from the distance, then simultaneously fired.
The Spire is a devastating ship if in a great captain's hands.

, The Squid has three small gun load-out points, one on each of the bow, the starboard side, and the stern. Despite the low hull armor (lower than the Goldfish), the Squid possesses high speed and maneuverability.


This ship has become increasingly popular as an assault and raiding vessel, and can be quite menacing when properly equipped.
The Squid tends to come in fast, with guns blazing, then depart as weapons continue to rain bullets.

, Medium guns are currently the biggest weapons in Guns of Icarus Online. They can only be placed in medium gun slots, which are currently only available on the Galleon, the Goldfish, and the Spire.


It is not possible to place a small gun in a medium gun slot.
Hellhound Heavy Twin Carronade is a larger, slower, and more powerful carronade that fires a burst of piercing short-range shotgun. This weapon is highly effective against balloons and components. It has a shatter kind of damage.
Typhoon Heavy Flak Cannon is a medium-range cannon that fires explosive projectiles, dealing substantial damage with a wide area of effect. If combined with Lesmok Rounds, it will have a better accuracy and range.
Manticore Heavy Hwacha is best used with Heavy Clip. Manticore fires a blinding barrage of 20 rockets for a powerful area of denial effect. Each rocket does light explosive damage.
Lumberjack Heavy Mortar is a high-arcing weapon with balloon-damaging flechette AoE. This mid-range weapon is excellent for destroying both hull and balloons alike. It has a very high pitch rotation, and using this at lower altitudes than the target can yield better success.

, Light guns are the most common weapons in Guns of Icarus Online. There are a total of 12 light guns so far. You can only put light guns in light guns slots. Generally, this type of weapon don't hit as hard as the medium weapon, but it can still wreck a fair amount of havoc with quicker loading times.


Artemis Light Rocket Launcher is a slow-fire rate missile with good range and damage output. It has direct damage explosive and shatter AoE.
Banshee Light Rocket Carousel is a high-fire rate, medium-range gun. Banshee has no bullet arc and has mildly poor accuracy. It is best used with Heavy Clip.
Barking Dog Light Carronade fires a wide shotgun burst of shredding projectiles at close range. It is best used with Heavy Clip.
Beacon Flare Gun can shoot burning flare that hovers in the air to reveal ships hidden in cloud cover. It can also be used to cause fire damage.
Dragon Tongue Light Flamethrower is the best weapon for inflicting flame to the enemy. Use it at close range.
Echidna Light Flak Cannon rapidly fires four shots before reloading, though the reload time is slow. It is a good choice fit with Lesmok Rounds or Heavy clip if used for long range.
Hades Light Cannon is a new cannon released in Guns of Icarus. Its range reaches 1,400 meters (4,593.2 ft) and is effective against balloon, hull, and armor.
Javelin Light Harpoon Gun is a harpoon that deals massive damage to hulls and reels in enemies when rope is attached. Very useful on ships that has fast speed.
Mercury Field Gun has the longest distance shot and the fastest moving projectile in the game. It’s very effective with Lesmok Rounds to ensure a hit each shot.
Phobos Mine Launcher lays impact-detonated floating mines at short range. The mines will arm and deploy after 3 seconds, and each gun supports 5 mines at a time.
Scylla Double-Barreled Mortar fires heavy explosive shells over medium range with limited accuracy. Using Heavy Clip or Lesmok Rounds is recommended.
Whirlwind Light Gatling Gun is a close-range piercing weapon with a very high rate of fire. It’s effective against armor and is commonly used paired with Light Flak Cannon and Double-Barreled Mortar. Using Heavy Clip is recommended.

Do not attempt to get this through breeding.,
Reach level 34.,
Get 15 million gold.,
Purchase the Pure Dragon.,
Breed with other single-element dragons to make hybrids.,
Breed special dragons.,
Breed two Pure Dragons for a chance at a legendary.",How to Breed a Pure Dragon in Dragon City," Ever since the July 2013 Light and War update, it is not possible to get a 100% Pure Dragon through breeding. They are now much more common, but must be purchased from the shop as described below.


If you're looking for a challenge, try to breed a legendary dragon instead. Ever since the update, these are the rarest dragons in the game. Breeding two pure dragons together gives a moderate chance at a legend, so consider this method a stepping stone to the rarer dragon.;
, This is the required level to see Pure Dragon show up as an option in the store.If you have gold to spare, keep building a farm and selling it for XP. The Huge Food Farm gives the most bang for your buck, if you can afford it.Be careful not to spend too much, since you'll also need plenty of gold to buy your pure dragon.

, (Note, In current version of Dragon city it costs 2.2 M for habitat and Dragon) Yes, this is how much a Pure Dragon will cost you. If this seems like an impossible amount, try building and upgrading as many farms as you can. This will pay out in the long run., Visit the build menu's dragon store and purchase your first Pure Dragon. Many players call this the ""Pure Unicorn"" due to its original horned appearance, but it will be labeled as a Pure Dragon.

, In almost every case, breeding a Pure Dragon with another ""generation 1"" dragon has only one possible result, a hybrid of the two types. For example, a Pure and a Dark Dragon breeding together will always make a Pure Dark dragon.


Two of these hybrids have special names. Breeding Pure with War makes a ""Kratus Dragon"" and breeding Pure with an Archangel (Light) makes a ""Zen Dragon."", There are three special dragons in the game that can be bred from Pure ancestry:


Breed a level 15+ Pure Dragon with a level 15+ Terra Dragon to get an Ivory Dragon.Breed any dragon with a Pure element along with any dragon with a Light element in a level 7+ Sanctuary for a chance at a Core Dragon. Some unusual combinations involving Sea elements will also work.Breed any dragon with a Pure element along with any dragon with a Flame element in a level 8 Sanctuary for a chance at a Basilisk Dragon., Any time two dragons with a Pure element are bred together, there's a 6% chance that one of the Legendary dragons shows up. If you're trying to maximize your chances of getting a Legendary dragon, breeding two plain Pure Dragons together is your best bet, since each attempt will take 12 hours of waiting.Other combinations will take a longer time on average, and still only have a 6% chance.


The downside of this strategy is that you'll end up with another Pure Dragon 94% of the time. If you'd rather get new, exciting dragons, just keep breeding combinations of dragons that both include Pure elements, for instance Kratus Dragon + Pure Dark Dragon. You'll have to wait longer on average each time, but when you fail to get a Legendary you might end up with a cool new dragon.
If you only have one Pure Dragon, instead keep breeding a Pure Flame and a Pure Terra Dragon together, until you get either a Legendary dragon or a second Pure Dragon to breed."

Keep your eyes on the prize!,
Rummage and hoard!,
Go loud with confidence!,
Fire with care.,
Fight on your own terms!,
Save early, save often!",How to Play Sniper Elite 3 Game," It’s easy enough to line an Axis soldier’s head up in your rifle scope, but before you can do that you need to know where that head actually is. It’s vital that you recon any new area you visit before you start building your body count. Ideally, you’ll do this from an elevated location that gives you a look at the larger area, but there’s typically some amount of sneaking to be done in Sniper Elite 3 before you get to an overlook.


Make use of your binoculars is key when spotting. Even the stock binoculars have a much stronger zoom than any of the game’s four sniper rifles do, and you can upgrade the zoom range even further by picking up certain collectibles. Once you’ve spotted an enemy through your binoculars, press RT to tag him.
Note however that you can only have a certain number of enemies tagged at any one time. Look at the bottom-center of the screen when you’re peering through the binoculars to see how many tags you have active and how many you’re allowed to have in total.Tagged enemies remain visible in the HUD even when they’re not in sight. With the way most maps are laid out, it’s best to tag them in groups and then take them out one by one before moving on to a new patrol area.;
, Resources aren’t exactly scarce in Sniper Elite 3, but you can only carry a limited amount at a time. The sniper rifle itself always comes with a generous amount of ammo, but you only get three clips worth of machine gun ammo and two clips worth of silenced pistol ammo. Bandages, medkits, and various explosives and traps also cap out at three apiece. Unless you’re just sniping — which is very difficult to pull off — you’re going to dip into these supplies before long.


Keep an eye out as you explore for pickups on the ground and open crates filled with goodies. It’s very easy to keep your supplies topped off if you’re vigilant. Be sure to loot the corpse of any enemy you take out. Not only does this provide valuable resource recovery, but looting certain, specific enemies also rewards you with one of the 15 collectible Weapon Upgrades (includes binoculars).

, Sniper rifles make a lot of noise when they fire. Since there’s no silenced option available in Sniper Elite 3 (with the exception of the Welrod pistol), you’ve got to go loud whenever you want to take out enemies from a distance. Fortunately, there’s a feature called “sound masking” that allows you to use ambient noise in the environment to conceal the noise generated by your sniper fire. It’s simply, really: whenever you see a mirrored set of pulsing lines (looks like three pairs of parentheses facing each other) at the top-center of the screen, you can fire any unsilenced weapon without giving your position away.


Sometimes the sound-masking noises are generated by objects in the world, such as a backfiring truck or a manned anti-air emplacement. These can be effectively “turned off” by alerting or killing the troops connected to the source of the noise, so it’s best to use the masked sound as much as you can to take out other enemies on the map before you kill the source of your sound-masking. You also sometimes come across power generators of varying sizes. Interact with one to kick it a few times, causing it to backfire at regular intervals. This masks your unsilenced shots as well as an anti-air turret would, though generators don’t last forever.
Try to do all of your spotting before you break the generator to better maximize your sound-masking time. Also note that in all cases, you’ve got to be close to the source if you want to hide your shots. If you hear a zooming plane overhead or a truck backfiring, but don’t see the sound-mask icon, then you’re too far.

, There are three levels of difficulty relating to Sniper Elite 3‘s bullet physics, each one impacting a bullet’s path of travel and how factors like wind resistance and drag influence its course. When you’re just popping off shots unaided at the Limited or Realistic settings, it’s important to consider how far you are from the target and how the weather might affect it. You can also press L1 (PlayStation controller) when you’re peering through a scope to steady aim. Not only does this eliminate shake for a brief period of time, it also brings up a small diamond icon in your sights that shows where the bullet is going to land, based on where you’re aiming. Note that you can’t steady your aim if the heart rate (bottom of the screen) is higher than 80 BPM, so make sure to stop running and crouch down as you move into a firing position.

, Sniper Elite 3 isn’t a stealth game in the sense that there’s no insta-fail for being spotted. That said, protagonist Karl Fairburne isn’t exactly built to sponge up a shower of bullets like so many other shooter heroes. Couple that with the fact that there’s limited ammo available for his non-sniper rifle weapons, and staying quiet becomes something of a necessity. For the most part. The trick with engaging the enemy in Sniper Elite 3 is to always take them down on your own terms. If you can do it quietly, all the better. That’s not always an option, however.


When you have to go loud, just make sure you’ve scouted your surroundings thoroughly. Ask yourself if you’re in a good, defensible position that offers a good view of the surrounding area. Set a few trip mines and S-mines (land mines too if there are vehicles rolling around) to cover your flank. Enemy forces eventually rush your position, but it’s often possible to take them all out on the approach if you set yourself up in a good spot. Sometimes going loud brings an infinitely spawning supply of enemies, but even those situations aren’t lost causes. Simply clear out anyone nearby and relocate to a new position, then lay low until the alert goes away. You may end up with a few new enemies on the map, but it’s probably less than there were before (and therefore, easier to deal with quietly).

, Very straightforward: Sniper Elite 3 allows you to save anywhere. Take advantage of that. The autosave feature is somewhat aggressive, but you can’t always rely on it to mark your progress. Quickly jump into the menu and save if you feel you’ve just accomplished something major. Better safe than sorry.

Enter the dungeon under Very Hard mode.,
Clear the dungeon within 10 minutes.,
Fix the bug.,
Use the Windmill.,
Do a Double Slide.,
Use Triple Kick Combo.",How to Become a Combat Ranger in Elsword," In order for you to become a Combat Ranger, you must be using Rena as your character and should be level 15 or higher to have the Ranger quest available in your Quest Log.


After completing the Ranger quest, you will be given 3 advance class choices, one will be Combat Ranger.
You can find your Quest Log at the bottom right-hand side of the screen.;
, After accepting the Ranger Quest in your Quest Log, go straight to Underground Waterway and kill 7 Mice, but this should be done under Very Hard mode; otherwise, killing Mickey won't be counted.


This can be done in a party.
If a party member kills a Mickey, that too will be counted.

, All you need to do is clear the dungeon in any difficulty mode you want. There's no need for you to have a higher dungeon run grade. As long as you have successfully finished clearing this dungeon, this part of the quest will be completed.

, Look for Hoffman in Elder Village; he's the Village's Equipment NPC, which can be found at the top right of the map.

, He will give you the third test.

, After talking to Hoffman, head back to the Suburbs of Wally's Castle and clear the dungeon again, but this time, under Hard mode.


You can invite your friends for a party raid or join randomly with other players.

, This will allow you to complete your Ranger chain quest and become a full-fledge ranger.

, To start your Combat Ranger quest, talk with Luichel in the Elder Village. You can find Luichel at the western side of the map, near the portal that leads to the field.

, Luichel will give you three tasks to complete before she changes you into a Combat Ranger. Fortunately, all the quests is done in one map: Wally's Castle.

, Kill at least 8 Little Soldiers and 8 Big Soldiers.

, You must have a B rank or higher as your overall score.You can invite your higher-level friends or guild members to help you in completing this part of the quest.


After completing the quest, return to Luichel or simply hit “Complete” using your Quest Log.

, There are instances that you’ll finished the Combat Ranger quest but your class won’t change. In order to fix this, simply log off then log in to have the server register the changes.


Alternatively, you can use the portal that leads you to the field then enter the town again.
Sometimes the server is too busy, especially during peak hours, to register your progress, hence the bug.

, Your character will do an open windmill attack that will throw your enemy into the air. This is a great combo for PvP and juggling enemies if followed by another set of attacks with good timing.


To execute this skill, tap the Up arrow key twice to double jump and then press Z to make your character drop hard. This will cause over 200% physical damage. Follow those keys with another Z to make Rena do a windmill to inflict over 100% physical damage (Up, Up, Z, Z).

, Rena can do Dash attack, but as a Combat Ranger, your character can inflict more damage using the same move.


To execute this, tap the arrow key toward your enemy to run and then press Z three times to slide and kick you enemy. You’ll inflict three hits with more than 130% physical damage each (Right, Right or Left, Left. Z, Z, Z).

, Players often use this in PvP mode. Rena leaps into the air and then kicks three times, sending the enemy back.


To execute this combo, simply run toward your enemy and then jump before tapping Z three times (Right, Right or Left, Left to run. Up. Z, Z, Z).
You should tap the keys quickly. This might be difficult since you have to jump after the dash, leaving your character vulnerable. Keep on practicing until you learn the perfect timing for this combo.
Each kick gives more than 100% to 160% physical damage to your enemy.

"
Be aware.,
Be prepared.,
Know your weapons.,
Have a plan.,
Follow orders without thinking.",How to Succeed in Military First Person Shooter Games," Constantly ask yourself: where is the enemy, why am I not under fire, why are my teammates not advancing and what would be the best way out of this (bad) situation. In games like Age of Empires, you should be conscious of the domestic situation (within your civilisation) and the foreign situation (outside your civilisation - i.e. with your enemy) With practice ('practice' is army-talk for 'a couple shots up your ass') this will happen automatically.


Be smart. You will get nowhere if you just run around firing blind bullets. Sure, it may get you a few kills (mostly because your opposition will not have foreseen such a stupid move) but it doesn't take a lot for the enemy to just step aside, be the calmer man and pop you with a shot to the chest.
Use what devices you have available, radar (especially on Halo games!) maps showing enemy bases and above all your own eyes and the eyes of your teammates.
Learn the army lingo; if someone gives you a heads-up saying '1 o'clock, AT soldier, 200’, you won't have enough time to figure out on the spot that he is talking about a soldier carrying an AT (anti-tank weapon) approaching at 1 o'clock to your current position and is currently 200 meters (656.2 ft) away. This would be pretty vital information if you were in a tank!;
, In games like Operation Flashpoint, always reload your weapon when there is a natural pause in the fighting; that preparation could give you the edge in a fire-fight as you will be able to keep firing longer than your opponent without reloading. Equip yourself with a variety of weapons, short-range (shotguns, knives, sub-machine guns etc), long-range (sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers etc) and other, ranged weapons, such as grenades, smoke shells, flash grenades etc. You may not always use all of the weapons, but it pays to be prepared.

, Take trial runs, experiment with weapons, and put in time in the training modes. Or just simply pick a target (a lamppost, street sign or any other stationary object) in play mode and practice hitting it while moving backwards, forwards, sideways and when doing other actions (sprinting, jumping, crouching, diving, etc). Remember, a bad workman blames his tools, the same is true for soldiers, it is your choice of weapon and your skill that matters, not how ‘good’ the weapon is.


Rifles, for example, would be useless in long-range situations because of their instability when firing; they are mostly used for providing cover fire (a tactic used to get the enemy to hit the dirt by firing bullets at them but not with the intention of killing them, rather to get them to hold their fire long enough for team members to escape). This is because of their rapid-fire rate.
Grenades are used to disperse enemy forces moving in groups; the fragmentation produced will wound soldiers within a certain radius.

, In every mission you are given an objective, and maybe a secondary objective, make sure you have fully completed your first objective before moving onto the second objective; even then, assess the situation. If you are aware, then you will already know which members of your platoon are injured, how much ammunition you have left and how likely it is that the secondary objective will be achieved without significant loss of lives. Always go through this checklist and you will never fail:


What is my situation? Am I injured from a previous mission? Where is the nearest enemy base from my current (insertion) position and where is the nearest friendly base (in that order)? Am I part of a team? If so, what position am I in the team? A number 2 soldier has more responsibilities than a number 8 soldier, the main one being taking command of the group when number 1 goes down. What type of soldier am I? AT? LAW? Machine gunner? Rifleman? Sniper? What position should I take up in a combat situation? What should be my primary target in a combat situation – for an AT soldier it would be any tanks, for a sniper it will be any particularly well-armed soldiers, like a soldier mounting a turret, for example. What are my objective(s)?
What advantages do I have over the enemy before I start? Examples are the cover of dark i.e. the element of surprise, superior numbers, a greater supply of ammunition, an extra type of soldier (e.g. AT, sniper, machine gunner, grenadier) and having vehicles (tanks, trucks, jeeps, helicopters) to hand. Of course, you will not always know so much about your enemy for you to make comparisons with yourself, war is not that easy. But it is better to ask a question and not have the answer rather than finding yourself asking the question as you stare down a gun barrel.
Which of these advantages is most important to my objective and thus, which can I afford to lose should it come to sacrificing one? For example, the element of surprise would not be as important to a search and destroy mission as it would be to an ambush mission and thus the loss of surprise would be affordable in a search and destroy mission, however, the loss of the advantage of having a superior supply of ammunition, for example, would not be affordable.
What will be my path to the main objective? What obstacles will I encounter on the way? Is it better if I keep a low profile and avoid any confrontations or is time too short to be sneaking out of my way? What formation will my team take (only when in command of a team, of course)? How can I use the relief (shape or lie) of the land to my advantage (cover of trees, buildings, hills etc)?
What will be my objective when I encounter resistance? Destroy? RRA (Retreat, Regroup, Avoid)? Or will I decide that based upon the situation and whether or not I have achieved my objectives? If so, can I afford to decide there and then based upon the situation? These are called ROEs, Rules of Engagement, which any soldier has to know how to follow and which any commander has to know how to implement.
What are my EVPs (Evasion Plan of Actions)? If you are well-prepared, then you should anticipate failure. Of course, certain things cannot be foreseen, and in those situations, the men will be separated from the boys, the seasoned veterans from the happy fairy cake newbies. If you encounter resistance and are beaten back, what will be your IEP (Initial Evasion Point)? An IEP is a location where members of your group will meet if the group has to scramble or is dispersed, from there, the EVP will be mounted. As a rule of thumb, it is always best to have 2 IEPs and EVPs.

, This may seem a very odd requirement for a smart, independent soldier who wants to survive, surely thinking is the first thing he will do. Wrong. Orders are given to be followed, superiors are superiors because they have enough experience to give suitable orders. What they don’t need is puny scum soldiers trying to feed their ego by answering back or questioning. Ever wondered why discipline and respect is emphasized so much at boot camp? Because the whole point of such organisations and the drills they do is to get you to submit wholly to the order, to get you to forget your opinions, your thoughts, your fear, your emotion, such things are irrelevant, your name is irrelevant, after a few weeks in the field, no-one has a name. Having said this, the soldier is free to use his individual store of reason and judgement to ensure he survives.

, You'll also be best with unlimited., You are not going to survive long in any FPS game if you don't know what a Magnum is. Know how much ammo they come with, how fast they shoot (rate of fire) ,and if they are close, medium, long or very long range. For help you can ask other players of the game who know the weapons.

Weakness: Everyone


Bazooka, RPG or rocket launcher.

Damage: Extremely high.
Main use: Anti vehicle and crowd weapon, very inaccurate.



, This is the cheese. every player should know these. After you know your weapons you need to know your basic shooting tactics. When your cross hair is in the middle of enemy body, move it up to just below head level (Enemies shoulders). This does more damage than chest level but less damage than head level. When you get more experienced aim higher (Head level). Another one is to crouch and crawl when necessary. This helps you aim better and make enemies shoot dirt.

, Sniping is an important skill in most FPS games. It is straightforward: look through the scope, aim and fire.

, Vehicles can transport you faster than running can, provide a weapon and be used as cover. If you think about this, in the next 5 minutes you will not be kissing someone's bumper.

, Camping is the best was to make enemies in almost any FPS game. There are a few exceptions where camping will not work, such as games like Blacklight: Retribution, as you have an x-ray visor so you can see through walls.

, Then move on to a harder difficulty. Starting at a hard difficulty won't make you better quickly. If you think you're ready, try playing online.

, You will know where things are and where enemies spawn.

, If you fight up-close, use a shotgun. If you fight from far, use a sniper, make sure you can scope good. If you're not accurate at your shooting, use explosives and support. Assault rifles are highly reliable and standard, if you don't know what gun to use, use the assault rifle. Don't use hand-guns, their weak and have semi-auto fire.

, It will be ideal to reload if you used half of your rounds. You can get killed in the middle of a reload. In some games, Heavy Machine guns have a large clip since the bullets come in a belt. Reloading machine guns can take a while.

, Look at your radar or mini-map if you have them. Listen to any shooting and footsteps. Look for tracer bullets and muzzle flashes. Muzzle flashes are very relevant, even from a distance.

, Sniper shooting can be very loud. To be very careful, look around for enemies after you kill an enemy or fired your gun. Walk in a crowded area or indoors if you can. Do not go out in the open.

Fast sprint, three dashes.",How to Use the Stryder Chassis on Titanfall," The Stryder is unlocked by beating either the Militia or IMC campaign.

Stryder in a nutshell: Moderate shields, fast speed, fastest Titan, lowest health of any Titan.
It's well known that the Stryder has very low armor. The catch is, its speed can easily outmaneuver a chasing Ogre to set up an ambush. You also get three dashes, which is very useful.

, Many people make this mistake, and they get defeated often.
, They can be an okay target, as long as they are damaged. You shouldn't attempt to defeat a full-health Atlas unless you are an experienced Stryder player.

Watch out for the Atlas's Damage Core. Dash away if it activates.

, It has the same shields as you, but its health is massive. Unless you have a lot of skill, only go for weak, four to five shot kill Ogres., Know how to recognize a Rodeo before the indicator pops up, because by then it's too late. Rodeos make a clear clanking sound and unless you're in a battle, it should be fairly easy to hear., Electric smoke is a very good choice with the Stryder. In addition to rodeo prevention, you can dash in to an enemy titan, pop smoke, back off as they try to punch you, and mow them down., To still get them, either back into a wall and look up, or stare straight up and punch as soon as they jump off. You'd be surprised how much range the punch has., Any ordnance will work with the Stryder. It's so fast it literally doesn't matter., Dash core allows unlimited dashes for 10 seconds (15 if you use Core Extender). If you've had a dash core, everyone gets excited when they hear the OS say, ""Dash core online!"". Don't use it right away, though. Keep an eye out for enemy Titans, and ambush them around a corner. Pop dash core right before they see you, use the smoke, and dance around them while pummeling them with gunfire, ordinance, and the occasional punch., Try this: Quad rocket with extended mags, Elec. Smoke, Cluster Missile (this pairs best with Electric Smoke), Regenerator (faster bodyshield regeneration), Core Extender (or Core Accelerator)., Either attack from behind, or stay far away where it's hard to hit you. Try to stay away from walls (harder to rodeo you), and at least 45 feet (13.7 m) back. It's a long way, but enemies will have a hard time hitting you if you stay mobile., Jerk and zigzag., Your Dash covers more distance than any other Titan. This can be used to jump off a ledge further or escape., Weak, but mobile––use the Stryder's mobility! If you aren't, you aren't using him right."

Without moving at all, switch your weapon to M-4, bring it to shoulder and fire.,
Use your binoculars to sharp shoot with M-4 if you have no scoped weapons.",How to Snipe with a M4 Rifle in Far Cry,";
, You should hit your target, because even if your M-4 doesn't have a powerful scope, your aim was already set if you haven't moved.

, This is harder to learn, but easier to use. Basically you want to find out where is the point on your binocular display, that corresponds to your M-4 shouldered aiming point. When you know it, it will be the same as with any scoped weapon (see above), but because the binoculars don't have it marked as cross hairs, you'd have to find it and memorize it's location somehow.

, Take a route where the suspected sniper can't see you. If you are behind them shoot them in the head, but if you are not take cover quickly and keep searching.

, In some sniping games like COD the snipers lens will give out a glare which can help pinpoint where the sniper is.

Set the options.,
Practice.,
Start the Tournament.,
Play the game.,
Expand your game.",How to Play Good at Unreal Tournament1," Go to the Options->Preferences screen and assign the controls, graphics and everything else you need to feel good while playing. Make sure you set a comfortable set of keyboard controls. Keep in mind that seemingly insignificant things like sound and graphics are very important - it will depend on these factors whether you are ""in the game"" or not.;
, The ""Practice Session"" game mode is made for you to train and get used to the game. Pick a suitable map, set a bot level (if this is your first time, pick ""Novice"") and try out your newly assigned controls. Also, at this point you can feel free to change the preferences to whichever fit best. Change in between the difficulty levels! If ""Novice"" is too easy for you, change to ""Average"" etc. Try to experiment. As soon as you feel that you have had enough practice, proceed to the next step, but don't forget to have a training session in between games - practice makes perfect!

, This is where the single player mode starts. First, you can create a character. Pick the most attractive team, appearance, name and difficulty level - all of which now must be experimented in the practice mode. These assignments will lead you the whole game.

, You're on your own now. Start a death match. The first level looks quite easy, but the matches get more difficult every level, and after three games a new mode will unlock... The chain of the game will pass on for long, and it will take a lot of patience (and ammunition) to progress in the tournament. In between these games your playing style will progress as well - eventually you will find out which weapon best suits your playing style, what game mode is the most fun, how to counter various obstacles, etc. - these things are very important, remember them, and as you progress through the tournament, make sure you are progressing your game. Read some tricks and tips below, have a practice session. And don't forget - for every game mode you will finish, there is a neat trophy, so keep on shooting those bots.



Assault. You will eventually face with a quite difficult game mode - assault - which can be quite complex, yet fun. Assault levels are usually a set of objectives you have to accomplish in the enemy's base - is it destroying some control system or pushing a button - at a certain amount of time, and then defending the base for the amount of time in which you ""infiltrated the base"". It might look easy at first, but the pressure of time running down and bots constantly blasting you with a rocket will most likely get you frustrated. Be sure to take the Assault tutorial - it will teach you the basics, and in every match, closely examine the objectives. However, strategy is something else, something more difficult. In an Assault match, you will start as the attacker - this is the hardest part. As i said before, there can be a lot of strategies for each level. Speed running (simply running towards the objective through a pile of enemies in front of you) might be an option, but at higher difficulties it will get harder. Don't forget to give orders to your teammates - press (default) V and negotiate, as pointless as it seems, it actually helps.







AS-Frigate. As the first assault map, it shouldn't be hard to think of a suitable strategy. You can enter the ship through the door, which is guarded by an automatic cannon, or an underwater entrance through the bottom of the ship. The underwater entrance is usually less guarded. It would be best to enter through here and make your way to the long corridor. On the way up, take a mini gun or a flak cannon - make sure you're not just with your enforcer. Now, the compressor will usually be guarded by all of the enemy team, so beware. Fire a few flak shells at the enemies. If there is not much of the opposing team there, you may choose the easiest way - quickly jump in the room and fire a few shells at the big compressor glass. As soon as you destroy the compressor, hurry up the stairs to the highest point in the ship - it would be best to do this before the enemy does. At the peak - the control room - you should see a big red button. Run into it and you are done. The defence strategy in this map should not be hard to think of - just climb up to the place where the automatic cannon is and shoot every enemy who sets a foot on the bridge, at the lower difficulties the bots never enter the ship through the underwater entrance.

AS-HiSpeed. The train is most likely the easiest assault map. What you have to do as the attacker is to get the Anti-Grav boots as soon as you jump from the helicopter you start in. They are just on the left, near the border - you probably won't miss them. After you get these, run towards the front of the train while picking up some armor or thigh pads (and try not to jump). When you reach the big platform which comes before Car 3 (actually the first car) (you should see some enemies standing at the distance), jump on it. If you jumped on the right platform there should be a pool of strange green liquid at the middle. Do not jump over it! Try to maneuver by the sides without jumping over or falling in the goo. When you pass the pool, run towards the edge of this platform. When you reach it, jump over onto Car 3. You should see an automatic turret on it - do not be afraid, however, it will slightly hurt you. Once again, hold yourself against jumping, but try to (at least slightly) maneuver through the bullets. Run towards Car 2 and, again, jump onto it. Your Anti-Grav boots should be drained by now (after 3 jumps), so after you reach the end of this one, jump down at the edge of Car 2 and enter Car 1. Quickly climb up the stairs and run to the front. At the end you should find the switch that opens the control cabin. Jump down after you click the switch and enter the red room. Run into the control desk and you're finished. If you done this all right without dying a single time you should've finished in exactly a minute. When defending, simply camp near the entrance to Car 3. The match should end quite fast.

AS-Rook. The castle might be a challenge, because, actually, there is not much strategy you can think of for this level. Now it all depends on your accuracy and skill. You will start inside some chambers in the castle. Here, make sure you pick up some weapons, but make it quick. If you'll go through the big door you'll find yourself outside, and normally there should be a fence of enemies standing in front of you. First of all, speed running will not work. You will barely make it to the entrance switch in one piece. It'd be best to pick up the minigun while still in the chambers and shoot the enemies from a distance, one by one. Quickly run to the wheel/switch - it will open the entrance to the library. Enter through the door and run through the corridors (don't climb upstairs) until you see a tall winch. Run to it and slightly above your head you should see two chains. Shoot at them until they both break. Now, for the sake of time, you may kill yourself (or let an enemy kill you). As soon as you spawn run through the same door where you started (in the chambers). Slightly on the left you should see a small gatehouse with a switch inside it. Run into it. The huge main doors should be open now - escape the castle through these doors and run until you reach the waterfall.

AS-Mazon. Again, the difficulty of this level relies on your own skill, however, it should be done in a more ""speedy"" strategy. You can start off by picking up all the weapons you see in front of yourself when you start and quickly run through the automatic cannons that are shooting at you. When you pass the cave and you see some enemies camping on top of a structure, before they saw you, equip the sniper rifle you picked up and head shot every bot, one by one. When there will only be left 1-2 enemies, run towards the gate. Destroy the two counterweights at the sides of the gate with a rocket launcher and proceed inside the building. Here, if you're playing on Novice difficulty, you can just speed run upstairs and find the Reactor Room switch, but if you prefer doing it slower, kill some enemies, run upstairs, first find the main gate switch. It will open the main gate (the one that you saw at the start, where the cannons were shooting) and, if you die, it will be a shorter route for you to enter the building. Once again, find the reactor room switch, click it run into the big room through the doors on the sides that just opened. You will see a huge shiny crystal - destroy it and you're done.

AS-OceanFloor. It might be quite a challenge to conquer the underwater base. It'd be best if you would make up your own strategy for this one, because the most common locations of the enemies varies between difficulty levels. Just remember - the terminals can be destroyed in any order. If playing on Novice, speed running might be an option too. But defence is where it gets tricky. Even in Average, you could find yourself pointlessly running around the base while the enemy is destroying the terminals one by one. There are more than one entrances to the base, so camping at one of them might not be the best idea. In lower difficulties, a good option would be just guarding one particular terminal, the best ones being Terminal 4 and Terminal 1.

AS-Overlord. The last assault match. This map more relies on pick-ups and speed rather than tactics, as well, but there are some basic tips - this map is by far not the easiest one. Right after you start, pick up the guns that are in the boat. Peek a little out of the boat, equip your sniper rifle and head shot a few enemies before sprinting to the front. While running, keep your head up and observe the point where the bright light is shining. There is a cannon that shoots mortars and these mortars can blast your body to bits. Be aware of the flying projectiles. After you breach the beachhead, make haste downstairs and equip your mini gun. There will be a pile of enemies waiting for you there. Your goal right now is to breach the boiler room - if you do that, your new spawn point will be this room. Make sure to pick up all the weapons and armors here - especially the Flak Cannon. Now you're on your own. Once again, there will be a fence of enemies near the Gun Control Room, but you should make it by yourself quite soon. Sprint into the Control Room and fire something at the control desk. You should be done. Defence for this map shouldn't be too hard - you will find yourself in a teleport room with which you will navigate through all the base. Good luck - by now you should have the great Assault trophy.



The last match. Yes, after 5 hard game modes you have finally reached the ""Hyperblast"" level. You will finally face the tournament champion - Xan Kriegor - in a fight-to-the-death 1 on 1 galactic death match. Be aware, this level can be quite a challenge, even in ""Novice"" mode, but patience is all it takes. Examine the map, find out where are Xan's favourite spots, what power-ups he picks up first - it depends on the difficulty - and create your own strategy. If you cannot think of a suitable plan the best tactics you could follow would be staying in more open areas (preferably space), picking up the shield belt as soon as it spawns, picking up the invisibility power-up as soon as it spawns (it has small effect against bots, but you wouldn't want Xan to pick it up) and picking up all of the ammunition. Xan Kriegor will also occasionally taunt you - don't let this bother you! Once again, experiment with the preferences, go on a practice session, re-read this article, do not give up!







, Eventually you will beat the last match, congratulations - but there is still a lot to explore in the Unreal Tournament universe. Now you can start another tournament - at a higher difficulty, you can also search for internet games, play some LAN games with your friends. Keep playing.

Learn some miscellaneous tricks.,
Master the weapon basics.",How to Play Good at Unreal Tournament2," If you will ever play online with your friends (or with various other people on the internet), it will always be fun to do some fun stuff for the laughs or some serious stuff for the win.


The Impact Jump. This jump will not only provide fun but it might actually help you in serious matches, e.g. Capture the Flag runs, Assault runs and so on. This jump could be done by equipping the Impact Hammer (the melee weapon you get at the start of the match, default hotkey is 1), powering it up (hold down the primary fire key), aiming it at the ground and releasing the mouse button/key as soon as you click the ""jump"" button. This trick might be quite difficult at start, but it should be quickly mastered. If you're still not succeeding at it, make sure you are firing and jumping at the same time and aiming directly at the ground. Be aware, however, that this jump does take up some health, so don't perform it in critical situations.







The Shock Rifle Combo. This particular trick is actually more helpful in combat than to amaze others. In fact, the Shock Combo is used by almost every professional Unreal Tournament player. More importantly, it is amazingly simple. Equip the ASMD Shock Rifle, aim at a particular point (not too close), fire the secondary projectile (the slow plasma ball, shot with the right mouse button in default) and as soon as you do that, fire the primary projectile (the long, fast plasma) at the same point. If done right and fast enough, the two shots should collide and thus creating a small explosion which will deal high splash damage to surrounding enemies. This combo consumes a lot of ammo, however it is truly a great maneuver if you suddenly see three enemies in front of you, with your shock rifle equipped.







The Translocator. Alright, this is not actually a clever trick or a combo, but the Translocator is indeed a great device which you can access (if the ""translocator"" option is set) by clicking the (default) 1 button when you are holding the Impact Hammer (or pressing the 1 button twice when holding any other weapon). Basically, when shot, the Translocator will fire a beacon at a particular spot. When the beacon lands (or is still in the air, if you wish) you will click the secondary fire button, which will result you teleporting to the location the beacon just was. The Translocator will help you get hard-to-reach power-ups, armor kits, health kegs and other various spots the beacon will reach. But, sadly, the Translocator does not help very much in Capture the Flag matches, for using the device when carrying the flag will result in you dropping the flag. However, this could turn out as a plus in situations where you would like to ""pass"" a flag to your friend. The Translocator device is not present in most of the single player Tournament maps, but it is sure to help out in multiplayer games and/or practice sessions. And if that's not enough, the Translocator can be actually used as a weapon. Even though it is difficult, you can fire the beacon at an enemy and teleport to it as soon as the beacon hits him/her, or set it up as a trap - fire the beacon and teleport to it as soon as somebody steps on it. This is called telefragging. But be aware, the beacon can be destroyed by enemies when it is fired, and if you will try to teleport to a beacon that doesn't exist, you will, in fact, die.







, Each Weapon in Unreal Tournament is a very delicate and complex device, and each one holds it's own unique secrets. Here are the most important ones.


With the Rocket Launcher - aim at the feet. Unless the enemy is right in front of you (and even in that situation, you shouldn't fire the Rocket Launcher at all), you should usually fire the Rocket Launcher at the enemy's legs. It is a high likelihood that you will miss your target when firing a rocket at it's head, so either load up some ammo or shoot at the lower part.







Don't go berserk. It might seem that, in various situations, firing everything everywhere is the best option. That is rarely true. Spamming shots will not only waste ammo, it might also seriously hurt you. Do not get this wrong, sometimes, when facing a high number of enemies, a little rapid fire of Mini gun will help, but it is very dangerous to go berserk in a closed area with such weapons as the Ripper, the Rocket Launcher, the Flak Cannon and the GES BioRifle.







With the Redeemer - aim for high numbers. The Redeemer is a rare and extremely destructive weapon which must be used well. If you did not yet discover it, shooting the Redeemer with the secondary fire button well take you into a first person view from the fired rocket and will allow you to control it's flying. You should always use this firing mode, for the primary mode will just fire the rocket in a straight line and will usually be easy to dodge. Never fire the Redeemer at a closed area or at someone close to you. The explosion will deal high splash damage at a big distance. That is why you should fire the Redeemer at somebody far away from you and you should make sure that this somebody has a lot of friends running along him.

Trade for good and popular items for your non member look.",How to Be Rare on Animal Jam for Non‐Members," The more unique it is, the better. This way, you can be distinguished from others and if you get rarer in the future, Jammers will click your nametag more and trade you.;
, Once or twice a day is ideal, but if you can't, then it's no big deal. Others will begin to recognize you the more that you're around in the same server.

, Mondays have ""Rare Item Mondays"" in the shops - these are rares that you can buy in stores for one day only. Once they're out of stores, they become rarer, and some could become rarer than spikes (e.g. the rare headdress and the non-rare ones as well). Go to the stores, either the clothes shop or den shop (but mostly the clothing shop) and get rare items. Note that some rares are only for members - try trading for the member rare item Mondays, but do not over trade as they are still in stores - they will not become rarer until they are out of stores.

, Know your rares as well. Avoid searching up what rares are worth on the Internet, as information on there is usually a scam, inaccurate, or outdated. Instead, ask some real friends that you have in real life that also play this game. If they do not know or you want more verification, ask around Jamaa. Go to Aldan or a famous Jammer's den and ask rare Jammers what specific items are worth. However, if they reply to you saying that it's worth a necklace, a store bought item, or one item that is not that rare, they are an obvious scammer. Ignore them and block them to avoid being scammed.

, This way, if you ask someone what an extremely rare item is, you'll know if they are trying to get you scammed because you already know what a single of an item is worth and obviously a higher rare item is not worth that item which is lower in rarity. Multiple of those items would be fair for a rarer item however.

, Non-members can only have up to two animals, but you at least you can go all out and cool on them. It can be less time consuming only having two animals anyway, and that's a good thing because there are plenty of other things to do in your life. Choose matching colors and decent clothing. Try not to use too much store bought clothing, but sometimes a necklace, ribbon scarf, or even a cheese hat won't hurt. Some non members are rare, yet they don't have rare looks - they mostly have the funny ones. Do whatever you like with your look and be creative.

, Start by being nice and being helpful. Being kind and saying nice things to other Jammers helps to make friends faster. For example, if someone has a cool username or nice look, say, ""I like your username/look!"" They might even thank you.


Make lots of friends in general. You never know who might want to share a rare with you. Consider going to Aldan to find buddies. There, there are lots of members, but also non members that are scattered about. Try to start up a conversation with a non member instead of a member - unfortunately, members sometimes bully the non members, so it's best to have fun with someone that has something in common. An example could be another non member that also has no rare items. Hang out with each other, and if you both do become rare in the future, share some of them with your buddies.

, If you somehow get rare item Mondays, epic wonders items, or even non-rare items that are out of stores, keep them as they will probably get rarer! Collect items such as spirit armor, phantom armor, monster teeth, gold bricks, etc. Some Jammers will actually want these items for their rare items (E.g. 3 gold bricks for a blue short wrist or spirit body armor for a den beta).


Create backup accounts. Place these rares in your backups, but keep some in your main account for emergencies. Since non members have less inventory space, you'll want to save some rares on your backup for more space. Get your backup account on and transfer the saved and collected items to your main account every time you trade the current ones away. This will efficiently get you more rares and ways to become rarer. The same can also be done for stored den items.

, Some of these rares include non member pirate swords, rare bows and arrows, rare fox hats, and worn blankets. Some of these items are also rarer than others, e.g. the black non member pirate sword (which is worth a den beta - other non member pirate swords are worth less), the raspberry bow and arrows (a little rarer than most rare bows and arrows - the neon bow and arrows is also very rare, as it is worth a red/purple short spiked collar), or the black worn blanket (worth a bad long spiked wristband). You can get most of these by trading stored items for them, especially epic wonders items, such as gold bricks and golden bows and arrows (which are worth a lot of gems i.e the reason Jammers want them). Save as many non rare rare item Mondays and trade them for these rares as well.

, Consider going on 'Return of the Phantoms' in Hard Mode. Take 2 backup accounts with you and have a member arctic wolf buddy or Jammer go with you. If you get a good reward on one chest, open the same exact chest with your backup accounts as well to get multiple good rewards at once. Some good rewards from this adventure include non member pirate swords, rare bow and arrows, worn blankets, rare fox hats, and best of all, rare head feathers (worth a rare spiked wristband). Collect several of these items to start small first.

, Put 3 or 4 of these rares (put one head feather or one black worn blanket to get a spiked wristband quickly from there if you have one) on trade and go to the server Aldan. Head to a crowded land. Say something such as, ""My list for a spiked wrist, jag if so,"" or if you'd like some den betas, say ""Trade me non member den betas."" Have some member den betas too so that you can trade member ones for other spikes and save the non member ones. Note: Since non member den betas are for all Jammers, they are more valuable than member ones.

, The best way to start becoming rarer is to start off with spikes. Spiked collars are usually the base item that many Jammers use to trade for items such as party hats, headdresses, founders' hats, and even the extremely rare items, including tan tiki masks, magenta furries, glitched rings, etc. Start off with some spiked wristbands and then trade those for rare spiked collars.

, Try to get 2 more good longs and one more bad long, and you might just be able to get a black long collar. This may take quite a while, but continuously collecting spikes with non member den betas as well as other small rares will get you rarer in a matter of 1 or 2 months. Once you get a black long, usually several other rares could be afforded.

, Trade long collars for black longs if they want it, or a red long and add for a headdress. You can also trade several other types of spikes and rare items for party hats, since their rarity is going up almost as much as headdresses. Have at least one party hat or headdress and a few spikes, and trade up to rarer items.

, This is a den where you put all your den betas in to know what you will trade and what den betas you have. Trade extra rares, such as worns, rare bows and arrows, etc., for non member den betas, and occasionally accept member den betas to use for trade. Save as many non member den betas as possible since they're more valuable. You can also use non member den betas in case someone wants den betas for their rarer items (e.g. 20 den betas for a founders' hat).

, Some of these items include rare nerd glasses, neon bows and arrows, straw hats, and light up rings. Most of these items are worth spikes as well. Set a goal for getting several of these items at a time so that you can make a cool look and become rarer at the same time. Not only can you trade to become rarer as a non member, but even to make cool looks for your animals just for the fun of it.

Acquire Deus Ex.,
Get the latest patch if you don't have the Game of the Year edition.,
Play Deus Ex one time.,
Download The Nameless Mod from their site.,
Download the latest patch from their support forum.,
Install The Nameless Mod from the disc or download.

,
Patch The Nameless Mod with the patch.,
Run The Nameless Mod from the shortcut on your desktop.

,
Enjoy!",How to Play Deus Ex the Nameless Mod," You should be able to get this game for $10 including shipping from various secondhand sellers. The ideal version to look for is the Game of the Year edition. In addition to possibly including some nice extras, such as a soundtrack, this edition includes the latest patch.;
, Search Google for ""Deus Ex Patch 1.112fm"" in quotes. There should still be sites which carry it. Install the patch if necessary.

, It is not necessary to play the original game through to completion; however, to get some of the inside jokes used in The Nameless Mod, and to truly appreciate it, you should have played Deus Ex. This is only optional; however it is required that the game have been run once before the modification is installed.


You will still be able to play Deus Ex after The Nameless Mod is installed.

, (You more than likely want the .exe, NOT the .iso - it's offered in two forms. The .exe is a sub-800mb installer, and the .iso is a DVD Image (mountable on virtual disc drives, of course - Daemon Tools and Virtual CloneDrive are two free, decent examples - with extra content and such, which isn't needed to play the game. It is strongly recommended to use a torrent. This is perfectly legal; the game is released under a Creative Commons license. (In fact, due to the terms of the Deus Ex SDK, Deus Ex modifications cannot be sold for profit.) If your Internet collection is slow, they have a distribution partner; for the cost of the physical disc and shipping, they will mail you a DVD in fairly nice packaging with a ton of extras. (The extras and everything needed to print the packaging is also available from their site.)

, Look at the 'sticky' forum topics for the Patch x.yz topic with the highest number. The current patch is 1.02 but 1.03 is coming soon. (NOTE: If you download TNM recently, the version number is up to 1.04 and so is the patch - thereby negating the need for a patch. However, I would make sure that Deus Ex (if you don't have the game of the year edition) is patched before installation.)

,, You don't need every patch, just the latest patch, though if you've already patched it, you can patch over a patch. (Again, only if you haven't downloaded and installed 1.04.)

,, The TNM team spent over 7 years on this and aren't charging anything, but it does make them happy to see people enjoying it.

You can change your username once by e-mailing AJHQ at support@animaljam.com and requesting a username change.;
, You will become popular.

, Whether you like it or not, rares are a big part of Animal Jam and something that does contribute and sometimes even cause fame. One long Rare Spiked Collar should be good for appearances, but keep in mind that, while rares are more important than people like to admit, it's not the smartest idea to show them off., One word: giveaways. Big giveaways. Show your fans that you really do care about them!


If possible, log into Animal Jam daily, especially on Mondays to get the RIM (Rare Item Monday). While most rares, especially member ones, fizzle out, some will amass rarity over time. A good example of this is the Rare Necklace, which many people recycle due to its undesirable nature. However, it is now worth up to as much as a Headdress. Even if it's tempting to recycle that member or non-member RIM to make room for other, better rares, keep a hold on them. Make a separate, storage account exclusively for those little things that may or may not be the next black long!

, Choose your own animal. Arctic wolfs are used by everyone so you can uses an animal that no one uses and maybe you can start making jammers wear that animal Note if you are nonmember, you can always use wolves or bunnies.


When you think of WolfDog, you think of a wolf. Their looks are cool because they match their personality.

, Don't copy a personality; create your own. Try to match up your outfit to make a kind of signature look.

, Make one hundred friends. Delete people now and again so more people get the chance to buddy you.

,


Get at least ten subs before you take it up a notch.

, Examples: Sky High, Nyan cat challenge, Talkshows, Music Videos, Mail times (if you are famous enough to get a lot of gifts, never ask people to gift you for a mail time) Daily jamaaliday gifts ( It depends on the time of year, such as Halloween ) Make sure to leave links on your YouTube channel to your social media pages.


Make any videos you think are interesting and post them to your channel. Never make a video that says: I just got a Rare Spiked Collar. It will make you seem of less interest to your viewers.

, If you do this, more people will recognize you and you'll become more famous.

Some good sites to use: Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Google+, or Instagram.

, These include the activities explained in this section.,, Make money, have many animals, many dens, and rares. Recycle store bought items that you get in mail times to get gems.

,, This will open up lots more opportunities to increase your fame in the game.

, This will be a place where others can come and spend time hanging out with you, thereby making you famous.

, Make a club/clan name that can be perfect. like, AJ Rockers, Beetles, Bag Bugs, or anything else.

, You want jammers to know it's a club/clan, so make the club/clan epic, like put epic rare stuff in your den or so.

,, Talk about what you do in the club/clan, like, you might sing, do adventures, bands, it doesn't matter.

, If you scam, you will have a chance of getting suspended for a day, a week, a month, or even for an infinite period of time.

, Choose a pattern from the patterns available. Remember, use natural colors if you want to go for realism.

, You can decide which outline/style of eye you want. Create eye colors of any type, but the more common colors for eyes are: blue, green, yellow, black, brown, and sometimes a hazel or white.

, In order to be stylish on Animal Jam you have to have unique clothing that you like. Unfortunately, non-members have less selections on clothing items, but at least they can change the colors of the items!

, People may think plushies are babyish, but they can be a great addition to a den. If you have a themed den, add items that are in theme and create the den just like the theme.


AJHQ has pre-set den item themes that they put out (ex. Pizza Shop) so if you can't decide on a theme, use the latest theme available, or the theme you like the most.

, The object of the game is to have a pile of items outside your den that you want inside somewhere and have your buddy tell you where to put what. (Even if it sounds boring, many people are interested!) After you set up the den, tweak their design a little bit to fit your style.

Have a good reputation.",How to Be Beta on Animal Jam (Non Member)," Return Of The Phantoms (Hard Mode) is an adventure that gives lots of rares. When you have completed the adventure, pick the top right reward chest. You can get mech wings, pirate swords, worns, and even rare bow and arrows! To get rares more effectively, play with at least one other person. Rares can later be traded for betas.;
, Wear all your rarest items and be proud of them! Don't be afraid to wear your rares and put them on trade. Put only the items you don't want on trade. Do not accept trades just because you feel sorry for that person. This will give you a ""kind"" reputation, but it will be harder to get beta. When you get all the stuff you need to trade, trade it for stuff you want! Trade fairly, so people will accept. Also, don't flash trade! (flash trading is not a thing anymore because of the new trade thing) This is where you trade really fast and accept without looking. This is a trick, which can get you scammed easily. Also, if someone says, ""Trade me. I will never accept. Try me!"", do not do it! They will accept if it is a really rare trade. Do not be one of these people, either. Scamming is not the way to get rares and betas.

, Most store-bought items make members think lowly of you. You need to get members' attention, since they have almost all the betas. Instead of store-bought items, wear rares, betas, or old items that aren't beta or current store-bought items.

, Find friends which you can trust. If you are nice to them, and you help them, they might be a little nice and trade you some betas. You will need many of these friends. To get ""trading"" buddies, there are different ways. Help everyone without giving your items or gems away. Be polite, kind, and nice. Avoid getting suspended, or ultimately banned. You will want at least 30 of these friends. Eventually, you will know them so well that you can trade your rares for their betas!

, Make YouTube videos to get famous. In order to be actually famous, you need to be nice. Help any ""struggling"" non-members, and they might help you! Send random people gifts or compliments through jam-a-grams. Lastly, make good videos of you doing these things. Then, share these videos. Once you have a good reputation, you will have a higher likelihood of getting betas for trades.

Learn how to survive in ArmA.,
Know what the scenario is.,
The objective is to defeat the other playable factions by seizing control of towns on the map.,
Wipe out the resistance.,
To win the game players must either eliminate the other players bases or seize control of all the towns.,
Build static defences and artillery using a repair vehicle.,
By default the construction menu is bound to the middle mouse button and the Enter button.

,
Blue towns and buildings – resistance occupied; Red towns and buildings – Enemy faction; Green towns and buildings – Friendly


Conclusion:

Capture bunkers in towns to buy weapons and to respawn.",How to Play Arma 2 Warfare for Beginners,"


ArmA focuses on realistic combat. This means that your tactics from Call Of Duty will not work.
When in a war zone in ArmA, it is always a good idea to remain as close to the ground as possible, this makes you a smaller target to hit. It also means that when you do get into a fight, your accuracy is significantly improved.
When under fire, your priority is to get to cover before thinking about where to shoot. When behind cover, take the time to check your surroundings and get an idea as to your situation. This means having to know the terrain, a rough enemy headcount and the exact location of the target attacking you. But don't take too long, there is a very high chance you are being flanked (attacked from the sides).
Newton's first law of motion States that an object in motion stays in its current state unless acted upon by an outside force, this applies to bullets as well. Bullets in ArmA are affected by gravity, and will drop over distance, and will keep travelling until it hits something, either your target or something else. Take this into account when dealing with enemies at long range. The sniper rifles in ArmA are suited for this, the range can be adjusted and bullet hits on the ground can be useful to show if you are above or below range. When below range, angle the rifle slightly above the target, when above range, aim slightly above, try to aim for COM (Centre Of Mass) with your shots.
Know your role in the team. This is not like Team Fortress where any role can do most duties. You have to actually abide by what your role requires. There is no role more important then the other other then the medic. The medic is there to heal team mates when they are wounded, other then that he is like any other infantryman. Scouts can be used to coordinate an entire battle, relaying information to artillery, to infantry and to air strikes, the scout is also then sniper. Snipers, however, act in groups of two, a spotter and a shooter. The spotter detects wind speed, wind direction and target distance. The shooter is the one who shoots. Infantrymen are the men who can take out buildings, artillery, aircraft and infantry, they are the backbone of the army. The team leader is in charge of the squad, he is the navigator and is responsible for the lives of many, his communication skills have to be clear and concise.
Learn to use vehicles if you can. They don't have infinite fuel and ammo, but usually have enough for the battle at hand. Humvees are good for scouting, providing light escort and performing hit and run attacks. Quad bikes are only good for sniper teams due to no armour and covering terrain quickly. Armed APCs are good anti-infantry, and can act as tanks if armed with the right weapons. MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) are the best used in a team of three, driver, gunner and commander, they are good for destroying all ground vehicles and buildings. Planes are useful for taking out other aircraft, buildings, infantry and vehicles, and are good at acting as an early warning system. Helicopters can provide a more precise air cover, can take out other helicopters, all ground vehicles and buildings and can even act as an early warning system and as an evacuation vehicle.
The teachings of Sun Tzu in his texts, the art of war, are a very handy thing to help you in ArmA. According to Sun Tzu if you know yourself and your enemy then you can win a hundred battles without loss. This means gather as much information as possible, and communicate clearly with your team and others around you. Know where best to apply them. this also means knowing what your enemy can counter and what they can't. If you have mortar teams, and know where your enemy bases are, soften them up with mortars, your enemy will be demoralised by the time you send in troops. Same goes for artillery barrages and air strikes. Always know what units are a priority. If your enemy has AA units, take them out first, then move down to AT units and AI units.
Learn to read a map properly on paper and by your own eyes. The best way to do this is to note down marker points such as a house or a forest, if you can recognise what you note down you can find your way. Always be aware of your bearings and learn to read a map grid and compass. When giving out your location, be clear and precise, you don't want to end up being a friendly fire statistic.;

Warfare is an ArmA 2 scenario with 3 factions: East, West and Resistance. East and West are playable, with NPCs as Resistance.

, Each town provides supply points which enable your team to build more bases and buy upgrades.

, Towns are initially controlled by the NPC resistance faction. Wiping out the resistance in each town enables your team to build up the amount of supply points each town contributes to your teams supply coffers. The same amount of points are also given to each player in $; from which a player can buy weapons, vehicles and men.

,


Command: A commander is voted for at the beginning of the game. If no commander is voted for successfully, AI will command – and will build very obvious bases.

The commander is in charge of the HQ vehicle (MHQ). The MHQ is not to be driven by anyone other than the commander. The MHQ can be converted into an immobile base. An option menu then allows the commander to select the bases to build. An experienced commander will employ complex strategies when building and upgrading bases.Often the key to a teams success will rely on the commanders decisions throughout the game.


Towns: Towns consist of a central depo and 2-4 bunkers. Capturing bunkers enables players to buy weapons and to spawn at the bunkers should a player be killed in combat.

To capture a town or bunker, a player must wait in the building for the energy bar to deplete to zero, at which time the bar will replenish and change colour to green. Once the town is captured vehicles can be bought from the town depo using the options menu by clicking on the spanners 'X' icon. The town supply will increase from a low value eg. 10/50 to 50/50; either gradually (if the pre-game auto supply parameter was selected) or in increments of 10 if supplied by supply trucks from the commanders base.
When a town is captured, friendly AI units will inhabit the town providing protection from hostile forces. The higher the supply value of the town the greater the force provided to guard it.


Weapons: Each player can equip a rifle and pistol and a secondary weapon like a missile launcher; as well as a limited range of grenades and smoke canisters. In the early stages of the game players prefer to use unguided launchers like the SMAW and RPG as these weapons enable tanks and APCs to be disabled rather than destroyed.
Disabled vehicles can then be repaired and used against the enemy in neighbouring towns. Although guided launchers provide better armour penetration and targeting ability, more experienced players tend to remain with unguided launchers due to their versatility on the battlefield. In the later stages of the game players will have access to tanks and aircraft and will therefore find most of the enemies' vehicles redundant, particularly as enemy vehicles cannot be entered by a players AI squad.
Tactics: A player should travel from town to town capturing the towns as they go. If a player dies without capturing a bunker at an enemy town they will have to spawn at a base. Scrolling out using the mouse wheel and selecting a yellow-circled base will spawn a player at that base. Light Factories(L) are the most commonly selected spawn as transport is available there for purchase. Once Heavy Factories(H) are available, towns become significantly easier to capture, as a single tank can take a town in a few minutes with the player driving.

, This is best done away from bases as only the commander should be in charge of a bases defences. Defences must be manned by your personal AI men if they are further than 200m from a barracks.

,,
Capture a towns central depot to capture the town and to buy vehicles.
Buy weapons at barracks, vehicles at L H or A factories.

To win: Capture all towns or Find and destroy all enemy bases.

, Maybe say, ""Hi, I'm Darling (whatever your avatar's name is) can you be my buddy please? The jammer should reply his/her avatar name and greet you with a friendly smile. I suggest you smile back or 'shake paws'.

, Invite them to your den and talk. (Remember not to give out personal information. Even though they are your Animal Jam friends, you don't know them in real life. Don't talk to strangers!)

, Play games with your buddy or throw a buddy party at your den. Most jammers love to play Rock, Paper, Scissors and Four Gem. Jam on!

, Don't get lost with your buddy! Maybe invite your buddy to the Jam On party and dance, go shopping together for matching outfits, or maybe get adopted together as siblings.

Never leap into a fight.,
Take in rouges and loners, maybe even kittypets.,
Be aware of what ThunderClan hunts.,
Use their hunting techniques.",How to Be Like a Thunderclan Cat on Animal Jam," If you want to be a clan kit, change into a bunny. If you want to be a grown warrior, or an apprentice, change into a wolf, tiger, arctic wolf, or fox. Try to avoid seals and penguins, since they are not really considered a part of land clans.;
, Design your fur so that it's either dusty brown, dark brown, orange, white, black, blue, silver, or tortoiseshell, which is a calico. Your eyes can be any color except pink or purple. Brown, green and dark-blue eyes suit well if you are a kit. For higher ranks, black, orange and yellow is recommended since it looks scarier.

, Clan cats may not have bows or swords, but they make you look more fierce. Many role playing Jammers wear some kind of weapon. These can be pirate swords, bows and arrows or even an elf armor if you are a member. Wear a fox hat or raccoon hat. This makes you seem cooler.

, Thunderclan cats are normally thought as a peaceful clan that respects the other clans. However, when you have to fight, be brave and fierce, but merciful at the same time. Nevertheless, be thorough and completely bold during a clan fight. Act according to your Alpha's commands. This will naturally give other clans a feeling of respect for your clan.

, ThunderClan takes in cats of all kinds, because most of the cats in the clan believes that all cats are equal. Sometimes, ThunderClan is thought of as weak because of this, but the extra cats just increases their power in battle.

, They eat mostly mice, voles, squirrels, rabbit , birds such as starlings, magpies, wood pigeons, blackbirds, and thrushes.

, They are the only clan to bunch their hindquarters before leaping to catch prey. They also hide in bushes, trees, and also, they blend in well with the ground. They have the sense to keep upwind of their prey. ThunderClan only eats frogs and fish when they have to, or if they are politely offered by another clan.

Research unicorns.,
Decide what type of unicorn you'll be.,
Log in to Animal Jam.

,
Earn 1,000 gems.,
Buy a wolf (if you're a nonmember), or a hooved animal (if you're a member).,
Get a Unicorn Horn, unless you have a rhino.",How to Be a Unicorn on Animal Jam1," You'll need knowledge of unicorn anatomy and history before you pretend to be one.;
, Are you a modern unicorn with the body of a horse and one horn? Or are you a traditional unicorn, with the tail of a lion and the hooves of a goat?

,, You'll need them to buy an animal (unless you already have it).

, Deer and llamas make good traditional unicorns, since they're slender with taller legs. Horses make good modern unicorns. If you're going for comedy, use a rhino (people sometimes say ""Unicorns are real; they're just fat and grey and we call them rhinos""). Or for a really big unicorn, use an elephant. If you want a really small unicorn, buy a pet Pony, give it a horn, and go to the Pets Only Party.

, You can either buy one in the Horses Only Party, wait for it to return to the shop, or trade for one. Most are members only but there is one for nonmembers called the Icicle Horn. If you're going for traditional, the Icicle Horn is the best choice; ancient Greeks believed a ruby at the base of the unicorn's horn powered its magic, and the snow at the bottom of the Icicle Horn could be a substitute for that.

Decide what side your Unicorn is on.,
Determine your Unicorn's personality.,
Decide whether your unicorn is a loner or more social.,
Decide if your unicorn has magic or not.,
Where does your unicorn live?",How to Be a Unicorn on Animal Jam2," Is he/she good? Bad? Neutral? Or is it unclear? What are the reasons behind what side he/she is on?

, This can be done by writing down his/her traits or by roleplaying them and finding out what their personality is.

, Does he/she live alone? Do they live in a herd?

, Do they have magic similar to the magic used in My Little Pony? Is it similar to the Greek mythological unicorn's magic, which could detect if a drink was poisoned and purify water? Is their horn more naturalistic, only used as a weapon in combat? Or do they have powers that are non-magical but not scientific either? Are they elemental? Does your traditional unicorn's ruby at the base of its horn power more than just its magic?

, Does it live with its herd if it has one? Is it a jungle-dweller (Lost Temple of Zios), a forest fanatic (Sarepia Forest), a winter creature (Mt Shiveer), a canyon climber (Coral Canyons) a beachgoer (Crystal Sands), a sea unicorn (Crystal Reef, Bahari Bay, Kani Cove, Deep Blue), or does it live in a savannah or desert (Appondale, Kimbara Outback)? Or is it not listed here (Decorate your den to look like its home)?

"
"
Decide whether you are going to join a roleplay or make one.,
Decide the rules of your roleplay.,
Decide if you're in a herd.",How to Be a Unicorn on Animal Jam3," If you're going to make one, be sure to decorate your den for it before advertising it! If you're going to join a roleplay, will it be a random roleplay or will you ask your friends to help make one? Or will you just join the public roleplay that is usually going on in Sarepia Forest in the more crowded servers (such as Draa and Aldan)? Make sure to avoid roleplayers who say ""nm, nn,"" etc. This means ""No miss"" or ""No nothing"" which means they are trying to make it so that you take their attacks no matter what. This is called powerplaying and it's not good roleplaying! Just block or ignore anyone who does this to you, but only if they are constantly saying it or getting on your nerves as well as bullying you. If it gets to the point where they're harassing you or won't stop being mean, then report them. Don't make a big deal about it, just silently block and report them if they are causing you a lot of trouble. Animal Jam is a kids' game and it's not meant for people who are mean and rude. Do not go overboard with the violence, either; if your roleplay has any blood in it. Animal Jam is a kids' game; most can handle something like a Jammer getting bitten, but don't overdo it. Aldan (crowded server) has the most powerplayers most of the time, but not all roleplayers on Aldan are like this.

, Does everyone have to be a traditional unicorn? Is it accepting of all types of unicorns? Do you all have to be llamas and deer, or can anyone join? Is blood allowed even in minor amounts? Does the roleplay take place in Jamaa, or a made up dimension? Can Jamaa's lore (Mira, Zios, Shamans, etc.) affect the roleplay? Are only Buddies allowed in the roleplay, or is your den unlocked?

, And if your unicorn has a herd, do you roleplay it, or is it made up of other Jammers? Is your unicorn the leader or another rank? Does your herd have ranks? If your herd is going to be made up of other Jammers, advertise your unicorn roleplay in Jamaa Township (usually the most crowded place in Jamaa) in a crowded server (like Draa or Aldan).
