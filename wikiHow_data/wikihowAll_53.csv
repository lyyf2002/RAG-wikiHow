Pick an animal and a color.,
Pick out some clothes if you want.,
Choose a pattern.",How to Be Adopted As a Dog on Animal Jam1," Wolves or Arctic Wolves are a good choice, since they look the most like dogs. When picking colors, choose a light brown for Color 1 and a dark brown for Color 2. You could also choose a black and a gray, or an orange.;
, You could wear any type of Blanket, Leaf Bracelets, and maybe a Spiked Collar if you have one. If you don't have a Spiked Collar, choose a regular necklace in your favorite color.

, You can do any pattern you want (even polka dots if you want to be a dalmatian). If you want, do the square-ish swirls in color 2 for an Arctic Wolf.

"
"
Choose an animal.,
Use brown, black and white colors.,
Wear any necklace or collar item if you want/need to.,
Make your entrance in the pillow room.,
Confirm what you are.,
Act like how you want to be seen.,
Embody your puppy personality.,
Avoid ways that you can steal attention from housemates.,
Do not destroy furniture (unless they are your own toys).,
Grow up eventually.",How to Be a Puppy on Animal Jam," Since Animal Jam doesn't offer dogs, you'll have to choose another canine, like a wolf or fox. Several common animals that are usually used as dogs include either of the wolves, foxes (members only), and bunnies. Bunnies and foxes are commonly used as puppies, but if you want to be a big puppy, arctic wolves (members only) are acceptable as well.
, These are the natural colors of dogs. You can use any color, but sometimes, certain Jammers like to bully those who aren't colored like actual dog.

If you do decide to use unnatural colors, report and block any bullies that get in the way. Reporting and blocking mean Jammer will make you seem like the better person, and you won't be accused as bullied instead.

, Necklaces or collars are unnecessary when being a dog, but you can wear them if you want to. Sometimes, necklaces and collars can tell you apart from any other creature when you are attempting to get adopted as a pet. Necklaces can be bought in just about any shop, but collars are hard to find sometimes., This is one of the many ways you can define your personality as a pet puppy. You can wander in to seem curious, get thrown in inside of a basket, which prompts that you are sad and abandoned, or arrive with scars to seem as if you need some sort of medical care. Almost anything is good as long as you don't go overboard., Sometimes, people can mistake puppies for children and dogs for mothers. This can be easily fixed by simply saying that you are a dog. If you want, you can tell others your personality and breed is as well., If you want to be seen as playful, play around with potential adopters or with fellow adoptees within the room. If you are shy, have some trouble approaching some of the Jammers in the room. You can even be aggressive, as in, you will pick a fight with almost anything in the room., You cannot contradict yourself in the house, or else you may be kicked out. You also must show your personality by doing actions around the house. If you are loyal, you follow your master's every command, and if you are friendly, you like to be pet and play with your housemates., You can get sick every once in a while, and you can get injured sometimes, but you shouldn't do it so often that you seem like you want every eye on you. Instead, try giving attention to your housemates. If you share the spotlight with your fellow housemates, then at some point, they will shine the light on you. Being an attention hog could also get you kicked out of the household, where you will have to repeat the process of being adopted., Destroying couches, tables and beds will make you seem like a very destructive dog, and could be your one way ticket to leaving the house. Especially don't destroy your house mate's stuff, as the owner bought those things for them, and can make you seem like you hate that particular Jammer. The only thing that you can break, however, is when it is your own toys. Dogs break their own toys most of the time., You can't be a puppy forever (unless you want to), and therefore, you must grow up.

Change your animal to an animal that is bigger (unless you are an arctic wolf). This will indicate that you have grown up.
Say ""Grows up"". This will tell everyone in the household that you have grown into a bigger (and hopefully better) dog.
Act more mature. Your constant play times are over (unless you really don't want them to be over), and you must learn to take care of younger housemates. Younger housemates must be taken care of appropriately, since you are a dog and cannot bottle feed a baby.

"
"
Make your entrance.",How to Be Adopted As a Dog on Animal Jam2," Enter the Pillow Room and say, ""-Is dumped into Pillow Room inside small Dog Carrier-"" When someone opens your carrier, cuddle into their arms and say -Licks face with tongue- That is their cue you want them to adopt you.

"
"
Once someone adopts you, buddy them and go to their den.,
If your owner has a child who wanted you as their pet, be nice to them!,
You can be sick!",How to Be Adopted As a Dog on Animal Jam3," They may have a daughter or son who wants a pet, they might have a house of pets, or they might just want a pet for themselves. I try to go for the adopters who just want a pet for themselves. You are, of course, allowed to have a different opinion.

, Play games like 'fetch' with them and be nice to them. Do normal dog things like eating kibble, sleeping, sipping your water, and playing with dog toys, but don't throw up your kibble all over your bed and toys, then pretend to keep getting sick.

, Your owner will always give you bandages or medicine. But if you keep pretending to be sick, they might send you away, delete you, or give up and leave you sick. Just pretend to heal right away and go back to normal as if nothing happened.

Choose an animal.,
Choose the colors.,
Choose your outfit.,
Go to Aldan.,
Be unique.,
Protect yourself.,
Stay strong.,
Ignore powerplayers.,
Keep protecting yourself.",How to Be a Stray Cat on Animal Jam," Choose bunnies for kittens. Maybe Lynxes and Foxes will work. If you like, maybe use a wolf.
, Use realistic cat colors. Try gray, black, white, etc. The eye colors can be anything you want. Patterns could be the moons, lightning bolts, or spots., Use stuff like the leaf bracelets and elf tail armor. Or, just stick with nothing at all. Again, these are just ideas., Since Aldan is one of the busiest servers in Animal Jam, it is recommended for a good place to roleplay. Then go to Sarepia Forest. It's another place for roleplaying., Say things like ""The stray cat pounced on a mouse."" Or, say something like ""The stray Siamese cat laid down on a pile of leaves and slept."" If your a kitten, say something like ""The small kitten playfully tackled his/her siblings."", If a bear attacks you in your roleplay, say something like "" Tackles the bear, sinking claws into it's neck."" Or, if your attacking another cat, say something like ""The stray cat pounced on the other cat, biting it's neck."" You need to be strong while roleplaying!, Don't be useless and say ""The stray cat backed away, and ran off,"" because the enemy could follow you. Say ""The stray Bengal cat hissed and bit the -Type of Animal-."" You don't want to die, do you?, If the enemy powerplays, report and block them. Don't powerplay either, because it ruins the fun. If you don't know what powerplaying is, then I'll explain it. Powerplaying is when something heals itself when it can't or says ""nn ( no nothing )"" and ""nd ( no dodge ). "", If nothing is attacking you, still be aware. You never know if a wolf or another cat could pounce on you! Say things like "" The stray Bombay cat stayed alert of the dangers. """

Make sure you have a decent cover, behind doors or buildings...etc.,
But make sure your head isn't exposed to the enemy, that way, they don't get a chance to get your head.

,
Do not stay in in the same place after making a kill; the enemy will more than likely come back for revenge after the respawn.

,
For guns that have a lot of recoil (meaning when the gun goes all over the place when you shoot), click once or twice for accurate shots.

,
If you are a person who holds on to the ""shoot"" key, aim mostly for the chest, because the gun will typically move upwards towards the head.

,
But if you are skilled (you wouldn't be reading this anyway),do not just shoot all over the place, aim for the neck.

, It's the easiest way to access the servers that host Renegade.

, It should detect Renegade. Then, click on the 'C&C Renegade' button to find a server and start playing.

,, In Renegade you earn money that you can use to purchase units. Usually, the more a unit costs, the better it is.

, Shooting these areas does more damage. You do over ten times more damage hitting an infantry man's head than his body.

, This is a basic weapon that every infantry character has. Once you run out of ammunition with your main weapon, the pistol becomes necessary. 4 or 5 shots to the head will kill any infantry unit, and you have infinite ammo with your pistol. You can get out of some pretty tight spots if you are proficient with the pistol.

, You can dodge in tanks by moving backwards and forwards quickly while shooting at the enemy. The slower your tank, the harder it is to dodge,but the more armor the unit has.

, Detonate your ""Remote C4s"" at the same time your ""Timed C4s"" explode. This ensures that the enemy won't be able to repair the building(s), and thus save them, before it gets destroyed.

, Remember the old ""offense is the best defense"" policy? In this case, it really is. If you force the other team into a defensive position they can't attack you without risking losing one or more of their buildings.

, While practicing won't make you perfect, you can get very close, and it's fun to watch the other players' comments in the chat box at the top of the screen after you've nearly destroyed them.

Shock-rifle, arguably the most useful weapon. Primary; a hit-scan doing 40 damage. Secondary; a slow moving bolt doing 45 damage. Combo; Shoot the secondary with the primary shot and BOOM. Long to medium range.






Mini-gun, Primary, powerful machine gun, inaccurate. Secondary, extremely accurate machine gun, at expense of damage. Close to medium range.






Link-gun, Highest DPS weapon, although easily dodged. Primary shoots green bolts. Extremely useful in close combat. Secondary is a constant stream doing 50 damage per sec. Close range.






Rocket launcher. Primary shoots a single rocket, medium range. Secondary charges a 2 to 3 rocket barrage. By keeping the right button pressed and clicking left, you can shoot a 3 rocket spiral. Medium close range.






Flak cannon, Primary, shoots out hot chunks of metal, in a shotgun like fashion. Useful in close combat. Secondary is a grenade/mortar, direct hit does 90-160 damage. Close to medium range.

Have fun!,
Don't forget to serve food!,
Last to know!",How to Be a Good Jammer on Animal Jam," Wear what you want but don't boast about it. If anybody catches you boasting, they may block or report you.;
, You may be reported or he will see before getting reported and ban you for a week\month! Make happy, cool and neat dens! Use mats to make smiley faces bored faces or a face like this :O! Don't be afraid of showing off expression!

, Say nice thing like Hey, I love those shoes you are wearing! Don't bully if someone bullies you or another Jammer jammer report and block them! Try to help them but if the keep doing bad things stop and get on with life.

, Have parties for friends or just to have fun! People may make fun of your den but that's OK! Just block those mean Jammers, or if they're saying something really horrible and refusing to leave you alone, report, because you have your rights!

Avoid Jammers that say, ""If you like me, come to my den!"",
Make yourself ugly.,
If there is an animal that has the skin color (light orange/peach) on with no clothing and wants you to come to their den or do something with them, don't do it.,
If you are a boy or girl and an animal with the opposite gender sleeps or hops right in front of you, they may want you to mate with them.,
Report, block, and leave.",How to Avoid Mating on Animal Jam," Sometimes there are Jammers who want to talk about bad things with you in their den, don't risk it and always say no. If both of you are ""friends"" and suddenly they want to meet with you offline that is very bad.


Don't ever meet with anyone offline, no matter who they are.
Report and block any Jammer that tries to mate with you or asks you to meet offline.
If a Jammer wants to meet offline, make sure you tell your parents after you've blocked and reported them. It's a very bad thing for them to do.;
, Usually, the people who are inappropriate and say things like ""Come to my den if you like me"" are girls who are attracted to boys. If your animal is dressed in dark colours, blues, reds or oranges, they will assume you are a boy, regardless of your real gender. If your animal looks good, they will likely say something like ""You are cute"" or ""Wanna be my day? (as in date)"". Either way, if you make your animal less visually appealing, you probably won't be approached by these creeps.

, They might be trying to look like they're naked. (<-- good way of ruining a kids game, Jammers.) Report and block them if they say inappropriate stuff.


Some animals just like these colors though, so don't go reporting them for nothing. Just if they are acting inappropriate.

, Get up and move away if you think that is what they intend to do. If they start showing you that want to mate tell them firmly no, then block, report them and leave.

, If you do these three things you are awesome and not a drama seeker. Many people will stay where there is a person mating and say things like ""Yuck! Stop now! I am going to barf!"" but they don't leave. If you stay and keep talking the animal will think you want to mate and keep asking you too. Always leave as soon as possible.

Lock your jam a grams and block them so they cannot send you anymore. The same goes for the jammer wall., This will get the bully suspended or even banned. Before you recycle any rude jammer wall posts or jam a grams they sent to you, report them, then recycle them.

Don't say words that aren't very acceptable!,
Do not mate or use mating terms!,
Don't share personal information!,
Don't use generators!,
Be nice!",How to Avoid Being Suspended on Animal Jam," Inappropriate dialect is the most common way of getting suspended, and using inappropriate words will kick you off for one day. Spelling something similar to a bad word can also ban you, for example, taking a letter out of a bad word will still get you banned, unless if you say ""dam"" as in a beaver's dam.;
, Mating became so popular in Animal Jam, that AJHQ had to edit the game and make someone stand up automatically if they were sleeping and got jumped on. Doing this will suspend you, along with using mating terms, and many people do not like it either.

, Sharing personal information that is small such as your age and state is not big enough for a suspension (but you still should not unless you are really okay with it, but remember to stay safe!), but important info such as your phone number can get you a suspension. Sharing important info like your phone number to your buddies you know in real life can still suspend you (AJHQ doesn't know you know each other in real!), so if they ask for it because they forgot it or want it, then tell then you can't because it would cause a suspension. Suspensions for personal info last for usually 3 days.

, Rule number 4 of the Animal Jam rules is about not cheating—don't use generators or third parties. Using them can actually break the game and take away the fun for everyone, and this also includes scamming.

, Posting any mean, offensive, obscene, threatening, racist, harassing, and even fake content can actually make WildWorks (part of the Animal Jam creators) can delete your postings, and even block you from using the site and take away your membership! This goes for usernames too!

Know the difference between scamming and deception.,
If something seems fishy, it probably is!,
Look out for these common and pesky scams!",How to Avoid Being Scammed on Animal Jam1," Deception is when a Jammer gives you an item for your item that isn't what they told you it would be. Scamming is when a Jammer wants to get something from you and give nothing back.


Agreeing (even if accidentally) to a trade through the trade system is not a scam. It's just a bad decision (or an accident).
If you accept a trade that you thought was a good idea at the time, but now regret, you weren't scammed. That's trader's remorse.;
, If something about a specific Jammer's offer or request seems off, don't take them up on it.


Exercise caution. Don't trust just anyone in the chat. People can scam you easily if you accept whatever people ask for in the chat. Keep your precious and hard-earned items to yourself.

, It's easy to get tricked into one of them.


The ""Trial Run"" Scam is when a Jammer asks if they can try out your item before they decide if they'll trade you for it. Don't fall for it! If they insist, request that they trade you your items first, and if they aren't happy with the trade, you can always trade back. Just be sure you don't turn into the scammer and refuse their trade-back.
The ""Gift Exchange"" Scam is when a Jammer asks that you perform a trade through the mail. That should be a huge red flag to you! Always, always, always use the trading system. It's the safest way to ensure you don't get scammed.
The ""Birthday"" Scam is when a Jammer demands a gift from another because it's supposedly their birthday. This isn't a scam!!! its just saying that you need to give them something! (if you agree, you're accepting that you're giving a gift and probably will get something back!), it's annoying and often deceptive, since who knows when their birthday truly is? In this situation, don't report, just ignore unless they begin to harass you.

Go on a less busy server.,
Avoid flashing parties.,
Avoid people saying flush/flazh/fish/flesh etc.,
Avoid people that tell others to flash them for more than 5 seconds.,
Put bad items on trade only.",How to Avoid Being Scammed on Animal Jam2," Joining less busy servers increases your chance of avoiding jammers who flash other, because there are not many people there. Definitely do not go on Aldan, that is the over all busiest server..

, Flashing parties can be hosted by jammers who really do flash jammers. At flashing parties, you are also likely to get scammed since flash trading is a type of scam.

, Many jammers (or scammers) know that you cannot say ""flash me"" because a sign will come up saying about scamming. This caused them to start saying things similar to ""flash"" (such as ""flesh""). However, they realise that they are actually saying ""flash me"".

, The accept and decline buttons usually pop up after 5 seconds, and, somehow, there is a rare occurrence for a Jammer to have something called auto accept. Jammers with auto accept ""come"" when the accept and decline buttons instantly pop up (this happens when the trade starts), but it is very rare.

, That way, they can't really undertrade you.


Add a few Rare Item Mondays to your list. You might get some good trades.
Put in a few other things. You'll get more trades. Or, put in your best things for trade. If you like the trade, you can always accept.
Put a few betas on your list, such as gecko plushies and maybe a Cami's frog.

"
"
Be polite but firm.,
Report them.,
Block them.,
Warn others.,
Remember that another Jammer can make their own choices.",How to Avoid Being Scammed on Animal Jam3," If you're not interested in their trade, tell them so. If they continue to harass you, block them. Being rude to them will only get you reported!

, Don't threaten them. Don't offer second/third/tenth chances. Just silently report them for scamming. It's that easy.


Don't ask for items in exchange for not reporting them. That's scamming and being a bully.

, If you don't want to hear them, block them. Blocking is one of the easiest ways to avoid Jammers who get on your nerves or make you feel uncomfortable.

, Don't be rude about it. Tell other people who are thinking about becoming ensnared in a scammer's trap about what they're doing.

, If you've made them aware of the consequences and they still want to go through with it, back off. You'll only make other people angry and risk being reported yourself.

,


If you're a great gray, be a light brownish grayish color on the colorpad. (Optional: add white spots if you think they look good. The rounded ones or the splotchy ones).
If you're a spotted owl, be brown and have white spots, rounded or splotchy.
If you're a snowy, then have yellow eyes and be white. Be all white if you're a boy, have black spots if you're a girl.
A barn owl should have white color 2, brown body, and black spots that are rounded.
A lesser sooty owl should have black color 2 and gray color 1. Be all black if you are greater Sooty owl.
If you are barred, have a black color 2, white color 1, or be creative and search a barred owl to look like the picture. These are just a few suggestions, and if you want to be a different kind of owl, look a picture and reference from that.

, Use any type of gauntlets from the diamond shop, or anything else that resembles a pair of claws, to be your battle claws.

, The helmet is, however, optional, as in the books they usually only wear battle claws into battle even though they are favorably drawn with helmets.

, Consider the Treehouse den as the base for your Hoole tree. The Fantasy castle works in a pinch, too.

, Section off the rooms that will be the owls dens/nests. Then make them have a nest, big enough for at most 3 owls.


A full moon rug from the wolves only party works, as does yellow mats from the den item mart.
For the dining room, use gecko plushes for the nest-maid snakes, or something snake-like. Put the nut-teaset on their backs and you have the iconic dining tables used by the Ga'hoolian owls! Be sure to make at least 3.

, You can place objects outside of the tree if you're using a treehouse, because owls and eagles will be able to fly to those places.

, Then create the chaw rooms and don't forget Bubo's forge!

, If your server isn't busy, find one that is.

, Call out where people can click your nametag, ""Guardians of Ga'hoole roleplay at my den, owls eagles and bunnies!"". When you have a favored amount of people, tell them the owl dressing advice shown in this article (above).

Be the right kind of animal.,

Accessorize.,
Choose your colors.,
Have an appropriate fairy personality, be sweet, help others, and just have fun!,
Adopt the habits of a fairy.",How to Be a Fairy on Animal Jam," Usually when people imagine fairies, they imagine small, cute creatures with wings. On Animal Jam, the best animals for non-members are bunnies and koalas, while members should choose foxes, eagles or a toucan. However, there is no one specific kind of fairy that you should be - choose whatever animal you like best.;
, Simple fairy wings are easy to get for both members and nonmembers. There are varieties, but if there are other available options then feel free to get them!


For members, there are a few other versions of the fairy wings to choose from. In a few shops there are fairy wings to customize. But if you are a dark fairy, use the dragon wings.

, You can buy cute necklaces and hats that will make you look much more like a fairy. The lollipop necklace from the summer carnival is the best for fairies, but you can wear whatever accessories and other clothing you want.

, Which colors you should choose depends on what kind of fairy you are. If you are a water fairy, your best choice is probably a few different shades of blue. For fire fairies, choose red and orange, choose appropriate colors for other types of fairies. But remember, this all depends on what you like.


Since the latest Animal Jam update, there are tons of colors to choose from. Remember, you can change your colours whenever you like!

, Personalities on fairies drastically range from perky to fiery to sullen. Choose a personality that fits your fairy, and make sure to consider the type of fairy you are - a fire fairy is more likely to be quick-tempered and lively, whereas a water fairy might be calmer and just go with the flow.

, For instance, most fairies love to dance. Express this by dancing in many different areas, including Jamaa Township.

, Even though you're role playing an animal, there's no need to be on the offensive. Don't bite, scratch, or hurt anybody. That sort of behavior starts fights.

, Sarepia forest is a common fighting ground. Only visit it to buy flags, complete your journey book, and watch Sarepia theater videos. Do not linger there for any other reasons or you may end up in a fight.

, If someone tries to start a fight, ignore them. They are less powerful with you ignoring them. If they try over and over and it irritates you, go to your den, which should be a no-fight zone (see next).

, Here is how. Lock it up. That allows no strangers inside your den––only buddies.


Memorize the username of the fighter, just in case they try to come into your den by switching animals and buddying you. If they ask, decline their request!
If a buddy starts a fight with you, go to your den as usual. If they leave you alone, it's okay to keep them as a buddy but if they continue the fight in your den, unbuddy them.

, If they are a real life buddy on Animal Jam and they start a fight, unbuddy them for a bit, to allow the two of you to cool down. Then add them back. If they continue the fight when you add them back, get offline and ask them to please stop in real life.

Add a sleeping place. For this, you could use the regular striped couches,vine rug, or flat couch and add some pillows.;
, For the food bowls, you can use either the regular bowls, or the pet bowls found in Claws 'N Paws.

, In case your kitten gets bored, add some mouse plushies, also found in Claws 'N Paws. Add some other plushies too, just in case.

, You can use a sandbox,sand pyramids,or sand table because they have sand and a border to keep the litter (also known as sand) inside. If you don't add this, the kitten will poop anywhere.

, This is located next to the Sol Arcade in Jamaa Township.

,


If there are no kittens, you can adopt a baby and turn it into a cat, just in the same way that you can adopt a cat and make it act like a baby.

, If you find a kitten (or baby), walk up to it and you can either say ""I adopt you. My den,"" or, ""Aww, you're so cute! Do you have a family? Can I adopt you? Carries to den.""

, If it has a name already, don't change it. If it wants you to name it, pick a cute name like, Batman, or Cutiepie or Sugarcane. Most importantly, don't name it something like unpleasant, such as killer or ripper.

, If you have any kids, tell them not to pull the kitten's ears or tail, and not to chew on its paws, or to throw the kitten, or hurt it in any way. Make sure they don't harm the kitten at all.

, If you go to a restaurant, either make an extra account for a kitten-sitter or make sure that the kitten does not do anything bad. You shouldn't hire a baby-sitter whom you don't know, because you never know what they might do. They might ignore the kitten and text the whole time you are out, or they could abuse the animal and kick it or scream at it or do something bad to it.

What kind of animal is most preferred by you? If you prefer more mature players, choose a kid or teenager, as people who role-play as babies or toddlers may not fit your skill set as a parent. However, if you would love to care for a cuddly baby instead of a kid old enough to talk back, choose a baby!;
, If you are going to choose a baby, get a bed or couch and put it up against the wall. Then secure it by closing it with any kind of fence. Next, make a playroom with plushies, books, and toys put strategically around the room. Make sure to remove or, if possible, hide all dangerous items from your den. If you are going to choose a child, put out a sofa or bed, but do not put up fences. Make the playroom cheerful and colorful, but a bit more grown up. Incorporate a bicycle or telescope if you wish. If you chose a teen, just get a sofa or bed by itself, and decorate with more grown-up items. Instead of a playroom, try to make a game room or lounge. Decorate it so it has a mature color theme,such as grays, purples, blues, and blacks. Avoid pastels or overly bright colors.

",How to Be Better at Shooting Games," Here's a little chart to let you know if you're new to FPS games:

Assault Rifles are close to medium ranged weapons.



 


Sub-machine Guns are close to medium but are more of a use to use in between.






Heavy Machine Guns are more experimental as they lack accuracy.






Shotguns are strictly close ranged weapons but are very effective in close range.






Snipers are purely used for far ranged, but some people have have proved this wrong and use them as close as Shotguns. They have the potential to kill an enemy in just one shot






Melee are obviously close ranged. when the enemy is at an arms distance






The range of grenades varies widely in games, but are generally for medium range and used to flush out enemies in vantage points or in groups.





;
,, If they're far away use your rifle. If they are charging use your pistol, if they are in one group mow em down with your machine gun.

,,,,"
"
Understand that there are three important factors that contribute to skill in an FPS: accuracy, movement and strategy.
,
Develop accuracy.,
Use movement to engage and evade enemies.,
Combine aiming and moving.,
Ducking ( For snipers ): Unlike bunny hopping, ducking is harder to learn.,
Moving Side to Side: Move side to side while remaining accurate.,
Follow smart strategy.,
Useful weapon Statistics.",How to Be a Pro on Rush Team,", Aiming is the foremost important factor in judging skill. This is a factor that can hardly be taught. Aiming accurately must be learned through self practice. For snipers, you have to get the ""feel for it"" and base clicks on intuition, especially for quick scoping. For rifles, aiming for head shots during close range combat is highly essential since that is the quickest way to kill your opponent. Make it a habit to aim for the head every time you use your rifle., The second most important factor in judging skill is movement. Unlike aiming, this can be taught.

In Rush Team, you have 10 stamina bars. Running uses up approximately 1.3 bars/second while jumping depletes 2.5 stamina bars/jump. When you run out of stamina, you will have to wait for the stamina points to recover. Stamina recovers at a rate of 2 bars/second.

, There are two techniques that pros use: bunny hopping and ducking.

Bunny hopping: Bunny hopping requires the user to jump back and forth while aiming in between, usually to the side while facing forwards. Not only does doing so annoy some of your opponents, it will ultimately ensure your survival while allowing you to kill as many enemies as you can. Never shoot while you are jumping. It is highly inaccurate. Instead, jump the aim, then shoot (and repeat).

, The process is the same, except that you are adding in a crouch right after each jump. The benefit to this is that it decreases your chances of getting hit. The downside is that it is harder to control, makes aiming harder, and slows down overall movement. Jump, then aim, crouch and shoot (repeat)., Moving side to side makes it more difficult for enemies to hit you., ""Play smart"" is the third aspect in determining skill. This is a very broad range that contains a tedious amount of discussion. To simplify things, these are key points to know:

When low on health, retreat and get to a health box. Depending on the map, it may not be safe for you to sit and wait to recover hp. In those cases, you can rely on your teammates to cover your back. Keep track of their positions. If they are near you, pay attention to their movements. If they are killed, you can determine whether or not an enemy is nearby. From this little piece of information, you can decide on what move you will make next.
There is no shame in using your teammates as decoys while you kill steal them from behind.
Getting headshots in FFA matches will grant you an hp bar. Hp bars stack up so it is very important for you to get at least one headshot while having full hp. This will allow you to survive one hit from the m40 sniper.
When using the M40 or AWF sniper during an all weapons match, be aware that you do not have to wait for your (M40)sniper to reload completely before you can use; you can reload one bullet and then switch your weapons back and forth so that the sniper can be used immediately. However, it is recommended that you have at least 3 bullets ready at any given time with the M40. These 2 snipers AWF and the M40 are considerably lighter compared to the other counterparts, which means they also impact less on your movement while handling them at the given point.
When facing multiple enemies, kill the ones that are more of a threat first.
Memorize how many hits it takes to kill with each weapon.
Chose the weapon which you think suits best for you.

, There are wide range of weapons to chose from this game and can impact the way you play your game. This section will break down the categories of weapons to chose from and the advantage and disadvantages of them.


Melee Weapons- Fire Axe and Fire Axe Vip are the dual handed weapons which swing fast and can 1 hit kill your enemy only provided the fact that you don't end up hitting them in their leg. Katana is similar to the Axe but it has a longer range but suffers from slow swings compared to them; this weapon is also 1 hit kill in most of the circumstances. Fists and Butterfly have a quite fast swings where Butterfly being a knife which stabs twice as fast compared to Katana and Fists punching at same speed; but the draw back being their damage output where Butterfly will require 2 hits to down an enemy and same for fists ( but they will down your enemy in 1 hit if you will hit them in their head). Wood Bat and Metal Bat also have really fast swings but they only do about 80% damage so it will require another hit to kill your enemy.

Grenade Types- Normal grenade, Grenade Gold, and Grenade Forest - have a normal fuse and do full damage only if it placed near the blast radius of the enemy.Grenade Blue - being the smaller version of the normal one but you can carry 2, they have shorter fuse, they also they do less damage in their blast radius.Grenade Red has a longer fuse compared to the others and does full damage.

Pistols- Berretta- a pistol which holds 15 rounds in it's magazine and has fairly good RPM and it does about 2 bars of damage. Colt - which holds 10 in it magazine and has slower RPM compared to the Berretta but does more damage on about 2.5-3 bars. Desert Eagle and Eagle Silver - Pistols which holds 7 rounds and does significantly more damage compared at stealing about 5 bars which means 2 hits will down your opponent but this gun has slow RPM. Eagle Silver - Pistol which is very similar compared to the other Eagles but has slightly better RPM. Snub - Pistol which is similar to Eagle but takes away 6 bars of health and holds 5 on it's magazine and also suffers from longer reload. M1911 a pistol which holds 11 in it's magazine and has the highest RPM compared to the other pistols and does about 2 bars of damage.

Decide what gear to use.,
Have Secondary Weapons.,
Wear Armor.",How to Be a Good Sniper in Urban Terror1," After all, how will you snipe anyone without a proper sniper rifle?


Sniper Rifle. The most important choice you have to make is which sniper rifle to use. The SR8 is the most popular weapon for sniping in Urban Terror. It is extremely powerful and accurate, but has a very low rate of fire. One shot from the SR8 anywhere on the body or head will kill instantly, even if the opponent is wearing Kevlar. Getting hit in the arms or legs will deal 50% damage. There is also the PSG-1 which is semi-automatic and fires much faster. It does not have the power of the SR8 though. One hit from it on an unarmored torso will deal 97% damage, but if the opponent is wearing Kevlar, that is dropped to 63%. Headshots with this gun are always fatal though, so if you feel that you have the skill to pull off headshots on a frequent basis, it can be quite powerful.
Sidearm/Pistol. Another important consideration is whether you pick the Beretta or Desert Eagle. The Beretta has more rounds and better long range accuracy, but does very low damage. The Desert Eagle is much more powerful, but has half of the ammo capacity. Which one you pick is mostly up to personal preference. Try both out and see which one you like better.;
, Secondary weapons are a fairly controversial subject. Some snipers prefer to skip them in favor of equipping extra gear, while others appreciate the extra firepower. Again, this is a personal choice and one that should be influenced by your personal play style and the situation. Some people will equip a secondary and play almost as if they are using it as their main weapon, only using the SR8 when they see an opportunity at long range. Others will keep it merely as back up in case someone gets too close. How you do or don't use it is up to you. There are currently three secondary weapons available. The MP5, UMP45 and SPAS. The MP5 has as extremely high rate of fire, but is fairly inaccurate and does low damage. It is useful or close range and spamming enemies. The UMP45 is more powerful but fires slower. It is generally more useful at medium to longer ranges. The SPAS is a shotgun which can be very powerful (It can do up to 75% damage to the head, really close up and 50% to the chest. The other bonus is that it does not matter if they were Kevlar or nothing it does the same amount of damage AND if some one gets hit, takes them a long time to bandage giving you time to run or rush.), but has a very specific area of usefulness. You must be extremely close to the target and know what you’re doing with it to be successful. I’d only recommend that experienced players use it, and even then the other two secondaries are generally much better.

, After you pick your guns, you will need to decide what armor to wear. This is largely based on your play style, the situation and what gametype you are playing. Kevlar will drain your stamina at double the normal rate, slowing you down. This is something important to consider. For example, a sniper in a Team Survivor match will probably want Kevlar so that they will survive longer, but one in Capture the Flag may decide not to use it so they can move to capture or defend the flag quicker. A helmet will not slow you down but will use a gear slot. Helmets are generally more important when playing against more skilled players. If you aren’t wearing one and find yourself dying to a lot of headshots, it’s probably time to throw one on.

Higher mouse sensitivity will allow you to turn much faster and react more quickly, but requires a bit more effort to make precise shots.






Lower mouse sensitivity allows you to make precise shots much more easily, but will leave your reactions vulnerable to players that might attack you from behind.





;
, If the game has a single player mode, try playing it on 'hard' setting until you are confident with the controls and your abilities.


Don't worry too much if you occasionally struggle with computer AI—real players are much different from regular bots, which may or may not benefit your gameplay.

, You want to have the best connection that you can get, so that you have a minimal latency. You should consider a minimum DSL connection to ensure a stable latency.

, By doing this you will have less lag and be able to move through maps more easily, as well as be able to react to your opponents' attacks more quickly. Sadly, they can do the same.

, A player should never disregard sound in a first-person shooter. It can help you not only to distract other players, but also to determine whether other players are nearby. Headphones provide a closed in area, as opposed to speakers, giving you a ""heads up"" on an opponent's location. Headphones are also good for snipers in that way they can quickly learn if someone is sneaking up behind them. The better headphones are more expensive, so you may want to either save up or get cheaper headphones.

,, While many first-person shooters give you a multitude of weapons to choose from, this does not mean that all of them are best to use at any given scenario. For example, if your opponent is up next to your face, you may want to reconsider shooting a rocket at him/her, lest you kill yourself.

, Disregarding ""spawn kills"" and other random errors, ask yourself what went wrong. Were you moving too slowly, or possibly not moving at all? Were your movements predictable? Just because there is a good player out there that might be giving you a difficult time, doesn't mean that you can't improve your gameplay by learning his or her style.

, The only way to achieve this is over time. However, once you are familiar with them, it will be easy to find enemy spawns, checkpoints, etc.

, A moving target is obviously much more difficult to hit than a stationary one. If someone is shooting at you, there is absolutely no reason why you should try to make yourself easier to hit.

, Know what to do if you get caught off guard or get in a gunfight with multiple foes. In games where players have lots of health, running away into cover is often the best option. In games with low health, it is usually better to attempt to shoot the enemy because you will probably die before getting to cover.


Many games have specific ""moves"" you can do to help dodge enemy fire. These include wall-bouncing in Gears of War, Drop-shooting and head-glitching in Call of Duty, and strafing randomly in Halo. Talk to other players or watch online videos to learn these tactics.







, Avoid strafing to the left and right repeatedly, or running in one direction for too long while a player is attacking you. Any player can give ""lead"" his or her attacks to quickly defeat you.

, This holds more true for objective games such as Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. Never stand out in the open, and always have some form of cover.

, Many players despise campers, or players who stay in one undisclosed spot and attack passersby, but you should recognize that it is nothing more than another style of play. Thus, you should keep the following tips in mind:


Don't camp in the obvious camping locations. Camping spots that are created specifically for the purpose of camping are the worst. These would include sniper balconies, the top of huge towers, other ""secluded"" locations that stand out in the open. Every experienced player knows where these locations are, and you're essentially a sitting duck by standing there.

As a rough standard, any camping spot that has a weapon spawn is probably a well-known camping spot.


Don't stay in one spot for too long. Even beginners will pick up on your game after two or three kills, and will develop a strategy to sneak up and take you out. Find a spot, make two or three kills, and escape to another spot.
Don't camp too often. You might incorporate camping into your gameplay from time to time, but you shouldn't base your entire style on it. You will become too predictable of a player, and your opponents will quickly learn how to defeat you.

, Which can help your teammates if they encounter the enemy player or at least the keep him out of action to recover his life/shield.

, Health, armor and the right weapon are a winning combo. Don't face an enemy until you have the right weapons. You won't do your team any favors by dying over and over because you face your opponents under-equipped.

, It gives your body energy and helps keep you feeling alert. 3 apples can give you as much energy as half a can of Red Bull without the crash!


Eating 3 apples gives you as much energy has half a can of Red Bull!

, This means finding teammates to follow and support. Pay attention to what's happening (has your flag been captured?).

,, For example, don't try to use a pistol to snipe someone from across the map.

, For example, if you are walking through a corridor and you see a door, don't use your mouse to turn, but the strafe keys. While strafing towards the door, aim at every place where an enemy could hide. That way, it's harder for an enemy to attack you by surprise.

, In some games, some objects are destructible and can lead you to a situation worse than before. However, if it is provided to you, shields that are launched by the user (holo shield in Ratchet & Clank, shield gun in Unreal Tournament 2003/2004 or bubble shield in Halo 3) can be much more effective.

, On any shooter, you need fast reflexes to adapt to a rapid and fast-paced environment. Reaction time decides who wins and who loses. To build your reaction time, practice the more complex moves with a friend.

, Get a better graphics card, CPU, RAM upgrade etc. if your frame rate is unacceptable to you. Better frame rate means that you'll see enemies with more fluent movement and be able to react faster.

Move closer to the router.,
Close any background programs and websites.,
Reduce the number of devices using Wi-Fi.,
Use local servers.,
Connect your device to your router via Ethernet cable.,
Restart your router and modem.,
Call your Internet Service Provider's customer service line.,
Replace your router.,
Upgrade your Internet package.",How to Lower Your Ping in Online Games," If you are using a Wi-Fi connection, decreasing the space between your gaming device and your router will increase your Internet connection strength, which will in turn decrease your ping.

While this step isn't likely to fix your ping issues entirely, it's a good rule of thumb.
Items such as walls, floors, and other physical obstacles will impede your wireless signal.;
, Having bandwidth-heavy programs like Netflix, YouTube, torrenting services, and even other games running will severely affect your ping. This applies to background programs and websites on all devices, not just the one on which you're gaming.

If you have any background downloads, pause or cancel them.
Non-Internet-based programs won't affect your ping, though they may affect your game's performance.

, Routers and Internet connections can only support so many devices, and each in-use device will detract from the available connection speed and increase your ping.

If you live with multiple people, this might be impossible. The next-best thing is using an Ethernet connection.
Consider putting your mobile devices in Airplane Mode while you game, since doing so will pull them off of the Wi-Fi network without forcing you to use cellular data.

, Playing on a server in your country (or, more specifically, on your side of the country) will dramatically decrease your ping if you're used to playing on other countries' servers. While you may have to sit in a lobby for a few minutes before you can join a game, the higher performance is worth the wait.

Many games allow you to sort game servers by location or country. This can help you connect to the closest server possible.
Most games display your ping or a series of bars representing your ping next to specific servers.

, As long as the router isn't the problem, your ping will almost always be lower on a wired connection than on a wireless one.

If this doesn't lower your ping, your router is most likely causing your low ping or the internet connection coming directly from your ISP could be to blame.

, If your network equipment has been running non-stop, it may not be functioning properly. Removing the power cables from both the modem and the router, waiting thirty seconds or so, and then re-attaching them will refresh your Internet connection and potentially lower your ping.

It may take a few moments for your network to come back online after plugging the router in.

, Before taking action toward replacing your router, call your ISP to make them aware of your latency issues. They may have a less expensive answer for you.

This is easier and cheaper than replacing your router, which is the logical next step.

, Especially if your router and/or modem is more than a few years old, replacing your unit will have a noticeable effect on your Internet connection strength, speed, and consistency. Similarly, your ping will also likely go down when you install a new router.

Be sure to research your router thoroughly before purchasing it.
You may want to invest a little extra in a gaming-specific router, especially if you game with multiple people on the same network at once.

, Unfortunately, if nothing else has helped decrease your ping, you'll have to select an Internet package with higher upload and download speeds from your ISP.

ISPs often have year-long deals on specific plans. If your current ISP isn't working for you, you might consider switching ISPs entirely.
Many Internet providers have a ""Gamer"" package with increased upload and download speeds.

Go into a full world.",How to Have a Salon in Animal Jam," You don't need to have the wigs or the rugs, though. If it is a hair salon, you only need the items for your hair. Since they are all gone, you may need to trade for them. Just yell out in Jamaa Township: ""Does anyone have any salon den items? If so, I'd love to trade for them!"" If all else fails, you don't need spa items. Use an inflatable pool (make it white, I use a white pig pool and it's awesome.) for a hot tub. If you are using the beach den skip this step because it already has a pool. You could use a mirror that you can find at Outback Imports as a substitute for a vanity. Get creative!;
, You need it to look good so people don't leave. Try adding some plants music, wallpaper, flooring, and some sort of rug. Everything should match. It should be wide and spacious. If you don't have a big enough den to fit all of your decorations in, you could use multiple small dens, but that would require a LOT of switching dens, so that isn't recommended. Nice music attracts customers and keeps them occupied in the waiting room, more about that on step 4. Wallpapers with different colors, like the pink striped wallpaper, look good. Avoid the rainbow wallpaper. Stick with wooden floors (beta wooden floor, wooden tiles, and wooden planks that come with the small den.) and don't have anything crazy, so avoid the grass floor.

, You can add them in and tell customers to take one after they leave your salon! Like in step 1, it's a spa item, so you may need to trade for it. You could buy a fancy coffee table from Epic Wonders and put some books on it (or put a bookshelf next to it.), but you may need to trade for the books too. You may need to advertise your salon too, so that's why the customers need the magazines.

, Add couches and things to play with so your customers don't get bored and leave your salon. If you are using a separate den for the waiting room, be sure that there is a bunch of stations in the actual salon, because people will get annoyed going back and forth from one den to another. You should have nice music in the waiting room den to keep customers happy.

, You could also hire someone to greet the customers when they come in. If you'd like, add a welcome mat to the front. If you have a door in the front, make sure to open it so people can come in. If you have a greeter, be sure to check on them once in a while. If the greeter has to get off, put some couches next to the entrance so people cat sit while they wait to come in., Just say ""Ok"" and politely tell them to leave. If they don't leave, tell them you are going to lock them out and lock them out. Before you let everyone in, buddy them so you don't have to do it when you lock them out, or else it might just be an awkward moment of silence. It is also important to because they might report you while everyone is buddying you., If they don't, then lock them out or report them.

If they stop, don't do it. If they do, then lock them out or report hem., If they ask for something that you don't provide, kindly tell them you don't provide it. If they yell at you or lose their temper, block 'em and lock 'em. If they ask for something you do provide (for example: the full treatment) then do the full treatment., Make sure to rinse it out and let it dry. Then brush their fur to rid it of any ratty areas. If they want, do their hair. Keep some hairspray by., They will most likely change their fur color. Ask them what color they want. If they reply saying ""This is the wrong color!"" or ""It's ruined!"" ask them specifically what color they want (for example: the purple on the top left) and you should be able to know what color they want. If they like it, then smile and compliment them by saying ""That color looks good on you!"" or ""You look stunning!""., If they are a member, gift it to them. If they are a nonmember, ask if they can put something on trade and trade it to them. What accessories do they want? Ask them. It's always nice to get things, but it's even nicer to give things. If they want a head flower, give them a head flower that looks good with their outfit. Before you give it to them, put it on your animal and ask them ""Do you want this?"" just to make sure. If not, recycle it and get something they'd like. If they do, give it to them and compliment them by saying ""That really matches!"" or ""That looks good with your dress!"", Ask them which color they want and start painting. If they want a pattern, pretend to go get nail stencils ans ask them what color they want their pattern to be. Get that color and do your magic! Do a special marble effect, add cute little nail decals, and cut their nails! They'll adore their new fancy nails., Ask them which color and then apply the makeup on them. Do they want lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow? Do they want green contacts to match their green nails? Do it for them! For the girly girl, pink shades are their best friend. If your customer isn't the ""girly girl"" type, some blues, greens, or browns would look great on them. Be sure to avoid turning your customer into a clown- remember, not too much makeup! Ask them what makeup they can wear to make sure they aren't allergic to what you are using., Welcome them in your salon. Then let the look around top see the things they can do. Offer them some jobs that they might like doing. They will say something from the list down below:

Greeting the customers sounds fun!
I'd love to advertise your salon and give away magazines!
Entertaining people in the waiting room suits me.

, Tell them the things from ""Operating the Salon"" above. Check on them every once in a while to make sure they are doing their job. If they are doing it correctly, everyone should be happy and satisfied! Be sure to share your earnings with the employees so they don't quit., Give them breaks and let them chat for a while when they are not needed (for example: nobody is coming to the salon so the greeter doesn't need to greet people.). Provide food for the employees when they are on their break., Add some pizazz in and say ""Salon my den! It's epic!"". Just adding ""It's epic!"" makes jammers think it really is. Add things like ""It's huge"", ""It's about to get full"", ""Hurry before I leave"", ""Very spacious"", and ""It has good reviews"". Just remember whatever you say, people believe you. Ever wonder why people get scammed? It's because they believe what people say!, That's one of the worst and most annoying problems in Animal Jam. Why? Because most of the time, people who lock their den are trolling other people to click on their name tag for nothing. Make sure to keep your den unlocked so nobody thinks you are trolling them., That's also very annoying. Why? Same as above! You see an awesome salon being advertised, but the person advertising it is moving around like crazy or their name tag is covered by the crowds of Jamaa, so either way, you can't click! So annoying..., Your den will most likely be full. But, it may be super laggy and hard to type and hard for people to click your name tag. Instead of going into a full world, go into a world that has 3 green dots or 2 green dots. A better way to solve this is to go from world to world gathering jammers. Since spas are so rare in AJ, your den should be full in a few minutes (if people don't keep leaving, darn jammers!)."

You can see the map is circular and has many dots inside of it. The biggest white dot is you. The map is sectioned off into four quadrants, try moving your snake to the edge of a quadrant so you can be far away from other snakes.

Pick “Grant Mom's wish.” At the end of the game, after you have gone through an entire adventure through the cursed mansion, you will face an ultimate choice; the ending will change depending on the choice you make.,
Watch the scene.,
Don't help Maria.,
Choose to save Father.,
Run for your life.,
Don't help Maria.,
Help Maria.",How to Get All Endings in Mad Father,"


You must choose between “Grant Mom's wish and let her take Father away” or “Use ogre's magic water to save Father.” Choose the former to have Father be taken away.;
, The bad ending scene will commence revealing Aya all alone in the room. Head north until you find Maria, still in shock. Aya will then tell her that Father is gone, leaving them behind.


In the next frame, Aya and Maria are in the chapel, giving prayers to her parents, but when Aya is about to tell Maria that she can stay with her, the assistant suddenly stands up and run toward the young girl. A scream will be heard in the darkness.
In this ending, it's clear that Maria has lost her sanity after the father disappears. A frame in the game will show Aya lying on an operating table, blood pooled underneath her while Maria stands over her, retorting that she will take on the duty and continue the doctor's work.

, During the game, keep in mind that you don't have to help Maria. The game will continue even after you leave the Hidden Hall. Also, if you get a room key from Maria, don't use it. Carry on with your game until you reach near the end.

, Play the game like normal and solve the puzzle needed. After you have gone through the whole adventure and story, you will have choices to decide near end of the game.


There's no need to worry about incomplete gem collecting for this won't affect the ending of the game.
Choose to save Father to get the second bad ending, which will commence shortly after.
Spoilers: Aya's mother steps away from her daughter, surprised by her decision. A bright light will appear, and Aya's mother fades away.
In a frame after that, they're back in the room with Aya's father close by. In this part, the truth will be revealed, showing that the doctor, Aya's father, actually cheated on her mother.
Aya's mother possesses the young girl to show her the whole story, the truth about her father's experiments and how Aya's mother died.
It is shown that Aya's father is conducting research about turning the human body into dolls, planning to do the research on his precious daughter to preserve her beauty.
The doctor kills Aya's mother when she tries to stop him, stabbing her in the chest until she dies.
After seeing what happened, Maria is in complete shock. She didn't want this to happen to her mistress but fearing being killed, she does what her father tells her. Together, they dispose of the mistress’s body, and he tells Aya that her mother passed due to an illness.

, After the scene, make sure to save your game. This will be the part where the doctor will chase after Aya with a chainsaw, determined to kill her and turn her into a doll, just like her mother.


Aya’s father will slowly come for you. Smash Z as fast as you can to break through the door and run!
Don't stop. Run through the corridor. Run down to the last part of the corridor and wait for Aya’s father to come closer.
As soon as he stays still, pull the lever and run past him to the north.
As soon as you burst into a room, you will find Maria, and a scene will commence.
The doctor will finally reveal his true color. He even uses his chainsaw to attack Maria. Aya will check Maria and find that she's still alive.
The game will then make you choose; the ending changes depending on the decision you make.
It's expected that you die a couple of times because of the difficulty of the game.

, If you decided that Maria deserves to die, Aya will leave the room and go back to the corridor with sandbags.


In this part of the story, you will receive the third bad ending. Father will find Aya and kill her with the help of his dolls.
A black screen will appear with a blood-curdling scream. In the next frame, you will see Aya sitting on the chair, wearing a beautiful dress, unmoving and lifeless. Aya’s father has successfully turned Aya into a doll, a perfect princess with beauty that will last forever.

, This is the best and good ending in the game. Choose “Help Maria” then look for some bandage to take care of her injuries. Together, you and Maria will search for an escape, but the loud wail of a chainsaw will be heard from the distance.


Maria will ask you to leave her, but despite Aya's efforts in convincing Maria, the young girl leaves.
In the chapel, the same thing will happen in the “Don't help Maria” decision. A doll will appear holding Aya to prevent her from running while the doctor holds the chainsaw over his head, ready to cut down his daughter.
Before the chainsaw lands on Aya, however, knives pierce through the doctor's body. The man falls on his knees, and blood pools on the floor underneath him. Maria had made it and helps Aya. She even takes care of the doll with one swing of her knife.
More scenes happen after this, including the appearance of Dio and how Maria and Aya escapes the mansion.
In a later part of the game, it's shown that Aya had become a doctor and Maria remains by her side. There's a catch though; instead of becoming a better doctor than her father, Aya does the very same mistake—turning people into dolls.
Maria quotes before the game ends. “Indeed, the mistress is much like you.”

Don't worry about friends getting a higher rank than you.,
Realize that becoming popular in an MMORPG game is extremely hard.,
Get a lot of friends in the game.,
Have fun!",How to Be Well Known in an MMORPG Without Being a Nerd," Most MMORPG games are pay-to-play, meaning you have to pay a monthly fee, while some are free and cost nothing. Usually the free versions are limited, meaning you can't use all the features. So find a game you want to get into, and read on. However, if you want to try to be the best player in the game, sign up to be a beta tester, because when the game first comes out, you'll be the first to play. This means you'll be able to play longer than anyone else (besides the others that signed up for it of course). When you choose a game, try it out. You never know if you'll like it or not.;
,, As long as you do something in the game you'll still be able to keep up - unless your friend never comes off of course.

, Once people have grabbed the top spots it is usually very difficult to steal them back. If by chance you manage to get highly ranked, don't let it go to your head. Set a good example and help educate the new players out there. Don't go around calling people ""noobs"" - it is that sort of behaviour that gets you a bad reputation.

, If you can't be the top ten players, at least you can get a lot of friends. They can be more satisfying than the highest ranks a game can offer.

, That is the reason people play games and it should stay that way. Don't start playing just to raise your levels or you will not get as much out of the game as you should.

Name your character something cool.,
Make your character look awesome.,
Be interesting and informative in chat.,
Be nice.",How to Be Cool in an Online Game," It has to relate to the game though. Names which are purely consonants (and are therefore unpronounceable) are usually regarded as 'not cool', as are names like ""leet pwndude"". Try to fit your character's name in with the background of the game. Good fantasy name generators are abundant on the internet.;
, This can be very difficult and inefficient if you're trying to level quickly. It's usually a good idea to go for a theme, be it color or art style and Try to keep to it. Characters with green armor, pink shirts and vibrant blue swords are generally regarded as ""n00by"" but remember that it's also a good idea to use the best equipment at your disposal.

, Make sure your chat is relevant to the server, game, or community you are involved with. Constantly yelling ""LF RUN 2 DUNGOEN"" in a roleplaying server is bound to get you flamed or ignored, whereas ""Is anyone else interested in going to X?"" is bound to get you far more positive attention.

, Flaming, mocking, or ""lol""ing at people who ask somewhat silly questions isn't nice and will get you a negative reputation. Being kind to your fellow players is a quick route to coolness!

Get a Mic!,
Don't be a lone wolf.,
Strategize.,
If you're sniping, snipe the objective.,
If you're a leader, lead!,
Get a med kit.",How to Be Better at MAG," This is almost mandatory. A mic is very important. It lets you tell your team what's happening around and you can give orders to your squad, platoon or company.;
, Working with your team is vital to winning the match(even in suppression) because instead of failing 100 times in a row from charging the objective by yourself, group up with your team and take it together. Example: you could get some people lobbing frags and guys with shotguns storming it, while a couple of medics are right behind and one or two snipers are covering them.

, If you're a platoon or company leader, tell the squad or platoon leaders what to do and then they will tell their squad what to do and they'll do it. Strategies work a lot better than just charging whatever and whoever is the closest. Examples: (platoon leader) alpha and bravo squads, you guys go around the left flank and charlie and delta, the right. (company leader) Everyone go to A and make your way down the letters.

, Don't snipe around randomly because the only thing that will happen is that you will get kills and you will probably lose the match. Example: Sometimes you can see the objective from where your sniping and shoot anyone trying to take it.

, Don't be a leader just for the prestige. Actually make some decisions that will help your team to win the match.

, This will help you and your teammates because: you get points by reviving them and they don't have to respawn all the way back at the spawn point.

If you are bigger than the virus, you will split, so make sure to only do this when you are small.
If the player that is chasing you is smaller than the virus, or the same size, then this will not work.

, This is where it's recommended that you begin chasing other players. Be careful, though, as you cannot eat cells that are larger than your own cell.

, Many players split themselves to try and eat other players. This can be done by pushing the space bar.


Splitting can send your cell forward, allowing you to eat another cell as long as your split piece is bigger than their entire cell.

, That is how to catch them.

Recognize the different meanings and variations behind the word ""noob"":


newbie – A new player.,
Use an appropriate, original username/character name.,
Use appropriate English punctuation.,
Spell correctly.,
Do not post garbage.,
Be patient.,
Be a creator, not a destroyer.,
Get some real friends to play with you, and be friendly.,
Don't chat in L337SPEAK.,
Don't beg for help.,
Do not post questions or requests in an annoying manner.,
Do not spam.,
Don't impersonate well-known players.,
Do not flame.,
Do not tell others to break the rules.,
Do not call another player a noob.,
Don't copy another player's team.,
Don't whine.,
Do not show off.,
Do not advertise for a boy/girl friend saying ""press123 for a hot beastly bf"".,
Don't lurk.",How to Avoid Being Called a Noob," This is as non-insulting as it gets.
noob /n00b – an annoying player (i.e. a beggar, whiner). This does not necessarily refer to a new player, but they often go hand-in-hand.newb – Abbreviation of ""newbie"", but often confused with ""Noob"". If you are not trying to be insulting, stick with ""newbie"" to refer to a new player.;
, Don't create a childish l33tspeak username such as ""Ipwnzorzuall"". Similarly, don't choose a name that is a misspelled playoff of other well-known names, such as ""Legalass"", ""Murlin"", or ""Gandolff"". Additionally, one may want to avoid using ""Xx xX"" around your username, or commonly used words such as ""azn"" and ""freak."" Try to create a name unique to you, one that preferably doesn't have numbers ""Bob15546"". If you are a famous person one day, you want to be named as PhoenixDragon, not phenix1588drag4slashrandomblarg.


For example, L4D2: Don't wait in the safe room and wait for other players to come to you, you will get kicked and called an epic noob.






Epic noob: A person who is really annoying and won't try to be a better gamer, just pass on through and not learn. These people hate to lose and will flame because they get killed and it's pathetic.







, Despite what many may believe, it does not take much additional effort to add commas or periods to your sentences as appropriate. People will give you more credit as an individual, and will be more inclined to help you out, should you have a question.


Don't overuse all caps. It drives other people to avoid you.

, Don't abbreviate or deliberately misspell words. Contrary to belief, it does not make you look any cooler to do so—it makes you look very immature. If you really want to ask for someone's help, then be respectful and take the time to type out normal English. The following are some examples of overused abbreviations:


""please"" → ""plz""
""people"" → ""pplz""
You can still use stuff along this: lol, ttyl, lol, afk, and so on. But instead of ""Hi u r so cool u r teh best, try ""Hi, you are so cool you are the best"".

, This would include keyboard gibberish (""dsagterhgr,bds), or general nonsense (""yo yo yo wut up my gangstas""). More likely than not, you will be quickly ignored by most users.

, If you asked for help, it may take someone a while to respond. Keep in mind that other players aren't required to help you if they don't want to.

, Be a team builder, not a lone, selfish bully.

In building games, don't go and destroy all that others made, even if they destroyed yours. Doing so can cause you a loss of reputation and will make you be called a noob.
In survival games, do not ruin other people's chances of survival, but don't let them do that to you, like one big family. Hostility will be treated by the same level of hostility back.

, Others will see that you are being nice and might want to be your friend too. Make as many friends as you can, but make sure you are not out there friending random people that you never met! But yes, you can friend any teammates., Not only is it downright annoying to read, but also is against most gaming policy.


Example: ""|3375|>34|< !5 4|\||\|0'/!|\|&!"" → ""l33tspeak is annoying!""


, In general, it makes you look pathetic. Most experienced players, who probably began with nothing and made their way up without begging for anything, won't give you anything, anyway. This is not to be confused with asking for help, in which case, most players are willing to help you out.

, Keep punctuation to a minimum, and mind your spelling and grammar. Shouting ""Help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!111"" won't get you very far.

, In online gaming, spamming refers to the act of repeating something over and over again, as in copying and pasting ""I need help!!"" several many times.

, It's not original, and chances are, there are countless other players that have done the same before you.

, Flaming is the act of verbally attacking another person. Never flame someone just because you lost a battle, or something similar. Accept your loss and move on, even if the player did something that you disagree with. If you bypass the chat filter(use numbers or symbols in replace of words to offend someone or use offensive language) you will get muted, or even banned!

, This is very important to any other players. Don't trick a newbie to break the rules so you can report him and make yourself look good, because just because you might look better in a moderators eyes, your fellow players will have no respect for you at all.

, This really gets on people's nerves; they've probably encountered this thousands of times while playing online. A new player that has nothing begs for something then once they tell him to work for it he gets mad and starts flaming and calling them a noob. This gets very annoying and only proves the fact that you are a noob. Do not call people who are higher level than you a noob. That just gets on their nerves, and they can obviously beat you in the game.

, This is only for online team player based strategy games, If you fight someone in a battle and they beat you with their team, don't go and change your team to theirs and start battling with it. If you face your original team, they will be annoyed and call you a ""traitor"" and will focus especially on killing you.

, When ever you get beat in a battle or some sort of combat, Don't whine about it for example ""aww man you beat me bad, that wasn't fair my computer lagged, Can i have my stuff back, come on my computer messed up, You were too good"" , or even act all superior ""I can pwn you any day ******"".Just take the loss and move on.

, Never act like a show off after killing an NPC. You will often be called a noob.

, People will call you a noob and an idiot. Anyway, what are the chances you'll meet the girl of your life online? Also, it's against the rules.

, Familiarize yourself with whatever you're ""noob"" at then boom, with information, tell people of what you know in a ""none show off"" way, then you'll be professional.

Moderate yourself.,
Ask a friend to help moderate you.",How to Get Rid of Gaming Addiction," Trying to cure a non-existent gaming addiction is impossible, so ask yourself a couple questions to verify. Do you neglect using the bathroom, eating, sleeping, or some other necessary bodily function for video games? Do you spend a lot of money on video games? If you answer yes to these questions, chances are you're addicted;
, Finding something else to consume your time is the absolute cure to a video game addiction. Try reading books, collecting stuff, or fixing things. It simply takes imagination.

, Some video game consoles and PCs have a timer which you can configure to cut off the power or otherwise prevent yourself from playing. If there is no such timer on your gaming system, try setting your watch or an alarm to go off after so many hours / at a certain time.

, Whether they be family members or friends you know from school or brothers and sisters, friends can definitely help you moderate yourself. It is much easier to quit playing if someone else is asking you to, rather than trying to make yourself quit.

",How to Avoid Video Game Addiction," The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. The problem is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them.

, How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book? Identifying the negative impacts of the addiction will help you focus on positive improvements and getting back the things that you really are missing.

, Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step.

, While it is important to identify the negative aspects of the problem, it is also important to focus on the goal and progress that you have made.

, If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that. Choose your games correctly! If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games.

, You are the parent, and thus you are in control. If your children do not listen to you, removal of the game console or setting of administrative control on the computer may allow you to better handle the problem.

, Are there more than 5 games that you have played in the last two months? Are these games open-ended (like Civilization, World of Warcraft, or Evil Genius)? This could be a warning sign.

, This includes time spent reading walkthroughs and watching videos and discussing games in real life. Always round up! If this number is over 25, then there may be a problem.

, There are freeware programs available for download that can help with this. Playing hide-and-go-seek with your parents (hiding your games) is an effective way to minimize gaming overall.

, You know the statement ""my anti-drug..."" This statement is better phrased ""my anti-addiction..."" or ""my anti-bad habit..."" The best way to do this is to develop a variety of other things to do, with others.

,;
,, If you can't, ask a teacher or a parent. If there isn't one available, do it on your own.

, Play with your friends.

, Read together.

, Have contests with your friends.

;
, Namely, this is to put your addiction into focus. Don't make a list of what your priorities should be, but what they actually are. If you have problems deciding how high of a priority something is, look at what you've done in the past.


When you had a chore to do, did you get up and do it or did you wait until you got one last level?
When your friends wanted to hang out, did you want to go with them or did you want to stay home and play?
When you brought your homework home, did you do it right away or did you get on the computer and play until the last minute?

, Remember that computer games should be played on your free time, so consider where free time be on your list.

, You may find yourself doing it for a few minutes, then returning to your game.

, Realizing that you have a problem, along with seeing the effects of the problem, gives you an advantage. It gives you a reason to change and motivates you to stick with it.

, Some people can't get over an addiction unless they stop completely, while cold turkey actually makes it worse for someone else.

, If you set it at a point in the future, such as ""next Monday"", you can prepare yourself and motivate yourself.

, You can cut down in increments like hours or half hours, and by day or week.

, It's easy to feel the urge to get up and play if your computer is in the living room or your bedroom, so if you have another room to put it in, move it there.

, If you prefer a game where the objectives end totally or result in an extremely lacking 'free' mode, think about how dull the game will be then. Make an estimate as to how much time it'll take you to reach this stage.

, When you come home from school, do your homework. Do your chores and take care of the top priorities before settling down for the day.

, Often, someone addicted to computer games will stay up late. Try going to bed earlier each day, but not so early that you'll just lay in bed staring at the ceiling. If you go to bed at 10, try 9:45 the next night, then 9:30 the next, and 9:00 the night after that.

Do not make excuses.,
Begin by setting up a plan which stops you from buying video games.,
Change your mentality.,
Don't be a perfectionist.,
Limit weekly video game time and start phasing out.,
Reward yourself if you reduce your playing time.,
Vow that you will meet all of your obligations (school, work, family, etc.),
Consider asking a family member or close friend to hold all of your video games for a week or two.

,
Most importantly, solve the root problem which is causing you to turn to video games as a vice.",How to End a Video Game Addiction," If you have a video game addiction, admit it. Do not try to rationalize it, deny it, ignore it, justify it, or compare yourself to others. Just try to work toward a solution.;
, Create a yearly budget with a reasonable limit. Also, try to refrain from impulse buying. Not only will this help cure the addiction, but it will save you money.

, Realize that the video games you are playing now aren't going to matter to you at all in five years, or possibly even one. Realize that nothing productive is achieved from playing video games and after five years, your video game collection will be meaningless. Your high scores will hold no prestige in five years.

, Don't try to complete video games 100%, since in most cases, that requires dozens of hours. Realize that while it may feel accomplishing inside to unlock everything, it produces no real tangible benefits and can be done without.

, For example, go from 20 hours, to 18 hours, to 16, and lower.

, Do not play video games to reward yourself; instead, treat yourself to some ice cream or something fun. You can even enlist a friend or family member.

, before you play games. Video games should also be used only to reward good behavior - not bad behavior.

,, Most addictions work like a vicious cycle. Indulgence in vices, results in problems which can be temporary alleviated by indulging in vices.

Limit yourself.,
If you still can't do it, put your computer on strike.,
Uninstall the game.,
If all else fails, see a psychiatrist.",How to Break a Sims 2 Addiction," Write a strict schedule saying when you can play, (e.g Saturday, 1:00-2:00, with breaks.);
, Turn it off, at the wall if you have to, and walk away. Find something else interesting and try to forget all about it!

, It may be hard, but you should be able to get over it. Ask a friend to hold on to the game for a while, hopefully they won't 'join the club'. Then begin finding new things to do.

, They may be able to recommend further course of action you can take.

,
When publishing your map, adhere to the site's rules.",How to Create a Minecraft Adventure Map," Planning is one of the most important steps; while you can try to make a map on the fly, it is more likely to turn out badly.;
, There is a wide range of different map types; some of the more popular map types are:


Survival. These maps involve the player trying to survive within the parameters of the map. Players can break blocks, build items and generally do whatever it takes to reach their goals.
Adventure. This particular map type is much more linear. Usually the player isn't allowed to break or place blocks, and generally has to follow whatever path the map maker has set for them, although the adventure can be more open.
Parkour. A subset of the adventure theme that has gained a following all of its own. In this type of map, you have to reach whatever the goal is, usually by going through a series of skill based challenges, such as a series of very precise jumps.
Different types of maps have different people who are willing to play them. Parkour maps seem to be the easiest to build. You can also include in your quest to find information in Horror style, Puzzle Style, Battle and War style (like defending a village from mobs) or a cool city or castle to explore.

, A storyline that would guide the player to his adventures in the map. Exploring a lost city? Running errands for villagers? Apocalypse? Escaping from a jail? Escaping from a castle dungeon? Questing? Stopping a timed bomb? or just survival?, If it's a parkour map, how are you going to make the parkour interesting and special? Will there will be traps? What kind of traps?What buildings are you going to create in a city? How are you going to build the castle?, If there are maps with similar ideas to yours, don't create it. Research on redstone techniques and other relevant skills you can use to create your map., If your map is small, not using these mods is OK, but if you are thinking of creating a larger map with scenery and buildings it is recommended to utilize these tools., By now you should have already thought of generally how is the map going to be like. On a piece of paper draw out how the layout of your map will be like (important!!!). And list the different stages and parts of your map. Will they be close together? Or will they be in different parts of the world requiring the player to teleport?, Write down everything that is necessary to your story, whether it be backstory, notes the player will find, dialogue, or anything else. Create a new creative world with cheats on, and build up your map, block by block, following your original plan. It is a time-consuming process, but don't rush it. Focus on every detail of the map, like the scenery, or the distance between each jump if you are making a parkour map, etc. Take your time to make sure it starts our easy, but increases in difficulty or elaboration as the map progresses. Every jump or every quest should be designed to provide its own challenge to the player, but do not start out making it too difficult, or the player will give up after dying dozens of times in the first stage. Remember to make checkpoints (like redstone-activated doors or command blocks to reset spawn points) so players will not lose too much of their progress.

, Once you have the story fleshed out, and you know what type of map you are going to be building, draw out the floor plans for your map. Include everything you feel is necessary for the map.


Grid paper is recommended for this step.
Figure out how you will implement all the features that the map should have. Observe the latest update and decide how will you have it all figured out. Remember that the game is limited and that it might have changed in your favor or not with the ongoing updates. If there is an upcoming update that might drastically change the game, you might want to wait for it. Decide what are the requirements for the map.

, With your plans set up, you are now ready to build.

, Before you can start building the structures of your map, you need a good landscape. There are several ways to do this.


You can try to shape the world by hand, but unless you are doing a pretty small project, and have lots of free time, you are going to want to use one of these programs, or mods:

World Edit. World edit is part of the Single Player Commands mod, which can be accessed via the aforementioned link. It lets the player change and shape the terrain from within the game, although it does have a bit of a learning curve.
World painter.This is a program that allows you to ""paint"" a Minecraft Landscape. It is a standalone program with a wide variety of options, though it is not as precise as world edit, working on a much larger scale.
MC Edit.MC edit is an open source program which allows you to edit your current world. It is a bit clunky, but has many important features, such as the ability to use certain MC edit filters to do a plethora of things.
Voxel Sniper. Voxel Sniper is a very powerful tool for terraforming your world. It is very versatile and a great compliment to world edit.

, Build for what is needed for your adventure/parkour map.

, When you have finally built everything, you can add the story. There are several ways of implementing the story:


Sign dialogue. With this you use a sign to convey dialogue being spoken to or by the player. If the former, you usually need to trap a villager, NPC, or similar in the area.

If you are using the most recent snapshots, you can use Sethbling's MC-edit filter to customize what the villager is going to trade. It can be found in the description in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13LyPP43twE.


Found notes. There are several ways to implement this:

Books. In the 1.3 update you can write books, and leave them in a chest for the player.
Image to map.This converts an image to an in-game map, though this requires some sort of image editor to use.
Note signs. These are signs that say ""read note 1"" or something similar, and require the player to pause the game, go find the corresponding text edit document that you include with the map download, and then read it. It is perhaps the most cumbersome, but also the most versatile.
Command Blocks. Command blocks are the most ""powerful"" block in the game, but you must be in creative mode with cheats enabled to use them. Some amateur redstoners use pressure plates connected to command blocks with the ""say <message>"" command. Professional redstoners can use the /tellraw command. In this example, the command makes ""Example Text"" appear in chat, in a red color: tellraw @a {""text"":""Example Text"",color:""red""} And instead of pressure plates they use the test for command which tests for players within a given radius. Check out the Minecraft wiki for use of these commands. Or just search it up on YouTube


Another option (though not encouraged) is to not include a story, which may be used in some maps, though rarely.

, All that's left to do is add loot for the players (if you have any to add) and anything else you might want to add, such as red stone contraptions.


It is recommended that you are at least somewhat handy with redstone, as it can greatly affect your maps impressiveness.

,

Make sure mobs spawn in a controlled manner and will not interfere with the map.
Make sure that the player will not fall into unexpected places (like caves) and not being able to return to the map.
The scenery should be contained (in a gigantic glass dome or something).
Check that all spawn points are set, game rules are changed.

, This is one of the most important steps. If the map doesn't work, then it is a frustration for the players, and more work later.

, It can be found in the .minecraft folder in your apps directory.

, You need to compress the map's folder into either a .zip file, or a .rar file.

,, Be sure to also make your post interesting, adding information about the map, reviews, and most definitely pictures, as most people won't download your map if it doesn't have pictures in the post. Once this is all done, the map is posted and finished!

, Place the block of wood in one of the four slots under the word ""Crafting"". To the right side of what is called the crafting grid you will see a different type of item with the number four on it. Pick this up and place it in one of the slots in your hotbar. Your hotbar is the row of 9 slots at the bottom of your inventory. This will show up when you are not on the inventory screen.

, These are wooden planks. Place your mouse over one of the slots in the crafting grid. Click and drag the block over each slot.

, The bottom left is 2A. The top right corner is 1B and the bottom right is 2B.


In slot 1A and 2A, place wooden planks by clicking and dragging the blocks. You might notice that it leaves more than one block in each slot. This is because it divides the blocks you are holding evenly among the slots in which you drop them. You should have four wooden planks in both 1A and 2A. In the crafting output, you should see 4 sticks. Click this once. You will now be holding four sticks, and there will now be three wooden planks in each filled slot of your crafting grid.

, Close your inventory, and the blocks in your crafting grid will fall on the ground. Just pick them up, it's no big deal.

, You should see a bigger version of your crafting grid. This one has 3 slots across and 3 slots down. You'll use the same type of format for this crafting grid, but now there are 5 more slots. Just remember that the furthest column on the right is C and the bottom row is 3.

, Place wooden planks in 1B, 1C and 2C. You should get a wooden axe. Place it in your hotbar and select it.

, 24 blocks is a good start. The axe might break when you use it, that's okay. Just follow the previous steps to make another one.

, A fast way to do this is to place all of the wood blocks in the crafting grid and then hold shift when you click the output block. This will grab as many blocks of the type you're making as possible. This is a quick way to get lots of stuff.

, Place it in a spot someplace close to where you were born, a.k.a. your spawnpoint.

, Build a small building around your crafting table with the wooden planks. Place the table in the corner of your house, with a wall 3 blocks long and three blocks tall in both directions, closing it in. You may want to cut corners on the outside for the first few days of your Minecraft world.

, Add 2 more 3X3 walls so that you have a box with nine blocks of space to move around on the inside. Top it off with a ceiling, and cut corners. It will be dark.

, Break (or mine, as it is often called) the two blocks in the middle of that wall. This will be your doorway. Open your crafting table and make a door by placing wooden planks in each of the slots in the A and C columns. Place this in the hole you made.

, Find the sun and watch it for a moment. Determine whether it is falling, and how close it is to setting. Once night falls, you will most likely be overwhelmed by monsters. If you think you still have some time, look for animals in the world around you. If you can find a sheep, kill it. It should drop a block of wool and possibly some raw mutton. You need three blocks of wool to make a bed. Once you have 3 blocks of wool, go back home and craft a bed. Use your crafting table, and fill row 1 with wool and row 2 with wooden planks. Place the bed in the corner of your house.

, If it is dark out, look for the sun. If you can't see it, go back inside your house and right click your bed. You will go to sleep, and the game will skip to dawn. Congratulations. You have survived the first night.

Finish all the starter quests.,
Get a subscription or buy some Crowns.,
Complete every quest in each world.,
Do the Prospector Zeke quests.,
Use attacks that cost more Pips.,
Get the upper hand in dungeons.,
Find a high-level friend.,
Repeat old dungeons.",How to Level Up Fast in Wizard101," Before proceeding with trying to increase your level, finish every available starting quest in Wizard City. When you finish all of these quests, you should already be at Level 9. Finishing these quests will also provide you a lot of good starting equipment and a fair amount of money.


Make sure that you complete everything in Cyclops Lane, Firecat Alley, Colossus Boulevard, and the Sunken City. These areas in Wizard City are only available by purchasing a membership or paying with Crowns.;
, You won't have access to the majority of the quests in the game without purchasing Crowns or a membership. You can use Crowns to access previously-locked areas, while a membership opens everything up to you. Quests are the quickest way to gain XP, so having access to these is essential for leveling up.


If you don't play often, you can purchase Crowns to open the next area you want to go to instead of buying a membership to access everything at once.

, Quests are by far the fastest and most consistent way to earn XP and increase your level. In each world, complete all of the available quests. Most players will progress through worlds in the following order:Wizard City
Krokotopia
Marleybone
MooShu
Dragonspyre
Celestia
Zafaria
Avalon
Azteca
Khrysalis
Polaris
Some suggest skipping all of the sidequests in Wizard City and Krokotopia, as they don't give out enough XP to make them worth your time. Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you start doing all available quests once you reach Marleybone.

, Prospector Zeke can be found in the central hub of each world, and his quests are some of the most lucrative in the game. He rewards you with training points, which is essential for building a good deck. If you're speeding through the quests, make sure you take the time to talk to Zeke. Most of Zeke's quests involve finding items and bringing them to him.


Make sure you speak to Zeke when you first arrive at each world, as you will be coming across the items he needs at each location you visit.

, Each of your attacks cost Pips, and the higher the rank, the more Pips an attack costs. The amount of XP you earn is based on the number of Pips you use to cast a spell, following this pattern:


0 Pips - 3 XP
1 Pip - 3 XP
2 Pips - 6 XP
3 Pips - 9 XP
4 Pips - 12 XP
You still gain XP if your spell fizzles.

, When you enter a tower or dungeon, check that you get to attack first. If you get the first attack, you will have the first attack on every floor, giving you a big advantage. If you don't get the first attack, press Esc and leave the dungeon. You won't be penalized for leaving, and you can try again for the first attack.

, If you can join up with a few high-level wizards, they can teleport you to one of the later dungeons. You won't need to participate in the fights, but you will still gain all of their experience. By using this method, you can go from level 1 to level 18 in just a few minutes.


Some of the best dungeons are Labyrinth, Crimson Fields, and the Tree of Life.
You can only run each dungeon twice. You will get full experience the first time and 50% experience the second time. After that, you will no longer gain experience from that dungeon.
Try asking nearby players for help running a dungeon, but avoid pestering anybody. It requires a time investment on their part, and can be a lot to ask of someone.

, When you've started gaining some levels, go back through dungeons you've already completed. The XP gain won't be huge, but you should be able to breeze through them with your stronger wizard.

This will give your first horse/pony (the one you choose at the signup page) many different Black Market items (Croesus' Fortune, Philosopher's Stone, Chronos' Timer, and Philotes' Stroke). It will also give you enough Aging Points to age your horse/pony to 3 years. It may also give you extra Aging Points.;
, UFOs are items that sometimes appear and float around on a page on Howrse. These can be carrots, apples, mash, so on, including Aging Points.


Clicking on the item will catch it, giving you the item (or multiples of it). While UFOs appearing seems to be random, as does the item that appears, this can be a decent way to get Aging Points if you don't need them immediately and plan to use them for casual use.

, While not directly related to Aging Points, some Black Market Items affect age:


Morpheus' Arms lets you age your horse without using Aging Points.
One Piece of Cloud makes your horse 4 months younger. A Piece of Cloud does give you 2 Aging Points, most likely for turning back time the same amount of months as 2 Aging Points would age them.
Chronos' Timer lets your horse finish its skills twice as fast.
Artemis' Arrow lets your mare age twice as fast during her gestation period, progressing 4 months instead of 2.
Water of Youth ages your horse 1 month instead of 2 each time she ages.

, Place another summer tree next to it, and another next to that.

,,,, Any of the three listed above will work no matter what combination of them you use as long as there are only three.


This will be used as the ""grove of trees"" hence the name of this method.
Make sure you are able to place a medium sized object without making to much room inside the triangle of trees or too little.;
, Reinforced crates cannot be placed right next to each other or any other kind of crate.

,


You may have to turn the rug so it is able to be placed on top of the crates.

, Move the one on the left.


If done properly, the rug should be on the crate.

,


If this is done properly, you should rise up onto the rug when you walk into it but you should not fall.

Understand that Second Life may feel like a game - and it is - but there are real people behind those avatars.,
Make sure you have a Broadband internet connection.,
Get an audio interface.,
Secure streaming software.,
Run Second Life on your computer.,
Get ready for your performance.,
Be ready to have fun and share your show.",How to Play a Live Gig in Second Life," You can direct these real people to your website if they are interested in listening to new music.;
, Don’t even think about trying this on dial-up.

, You need a way to get your live music into your computer. You can also stream pre-recorded content, but the live performance is what people come to hear. You can use the same gear you use to record -- a small mixer, a nice preamp/compressor chain for a large diaphragm condenser mic. Play your guitar through your regular guitar processor into the mixer along with the microphones: one for your voice and another to pick up live acoustic sounds from your guitar. The mixer output plugs into your computer’s audio interface.

, Once the audio is in your computer, you need to send it out to a server that is connected to Second Life. This server is the responsibility of the venue in world. But to send your audio to their server you'll need software. A program called Simplecast from Spacial Audio will stream whatever you have going through your sound card’s output directly to any servers you are connected to. It is kind of expensive ($60 US), but you can get a discount by asking for a coupon through their site’s contact link. This software has level meters on it which is the only way to tell if you're streaming audio is clipping. There is a 20 to 30 second lag from the time you transmit and the time you are heard in world. This lag makes it hard to monitor your output to the web, leaving you with just those meters - so stay out of the red.

, You will need an account to do that. You will need an account to talk to venue owners to set up your gig. It is just like real life, You need to get face time with owners and managers. Give them a demo, usually your Myspace account. If they like your music, they might set you up for an audition where they give you stream information and stage time to test your stuff.

, Would you step on a stage to play a gig without your guitar or keyboard? Of course not. If you are playing for tips, don’t forget your tip jar. These things you can buy in world. The people listening to you aren’t just passively listening. They are chattering in the chat window watching your avatar, talking about what they like/dislike about your performance. They expect to see someone on stage playing an instrument. If they like what they hear, they might want to give tips and check out a link to your website. They expect that, so be ready for it.

, Your stream will be available on the internet for non-Second Life users. Once you have your server log-in info you can build a link to that stream that anyone can plug into their media player of of choice and listen. Be sure to send links to your friends.

Get the hair.,
Get the clothes.,
Now go for the make-up.,
Next get the personality.,
Your profile isn't very important,but still is.",How to Be Scene on Meez," The hair is the most important thing about a scene meez. It's very expensive,so be sure you have the coins for it. Remember that if you don't have the hair, there's no way you will accomplish this style. Good fringes would be the over-eyes bangs (1200c) or the side swept bangs (1000c). Back hair would be the scene side ponytail (1400c),the hawk and scene hair (1100c),or the teased hair (VIP. 1300c). Or any hairstyle under scene hair. Be unique and different with your hair. Glitch it if you know how.;
, Clothes are usually somewhere between 300c and 900c. Wear graphic tees with shorts such as the skull shorts (1500c) and the zebra print shorts (800c). ALWAYS wear some sort of hat/bow. The big velvet bow is perfect with the hawk and scene hair. The beanie with ears is perfect with the side ponytail. Make sure your hat/bow goes with your hair. For jewelry,wear big necklaces. Fishnet leggings (900c) and fishnet arm things work good to. The big fuzzy boots,or high tops or crazy slippers (flamingo,bunny,or turkey slippers) for shoes. Make your clothes colorful,based on one color,or black and white. (Though black and white you might be labeled emo). Piercings; Monroe,3 lip spikes,etc) If wearing a belly shirt or bra,wear a belly ring.

, If you have the over-eye bangs,just wear smokey eyes for eyeliner and pink blush. The panda nose works very well with any fringe. Never wear colorful make-up,always make it simply black. Ganguro eyeliner for fringes that show eyes. Lip gloss not needed. Be unique.

, Don't be noobish and just randomly go up to someone and be like ""hey what's up"". In fact,never say hey what's up. If you plan on walking up to someone,don't. Go one step away from them,wait for them to say something,and then in whatever direction they are,say ""<_<"" or "">_>"" Then say ""wow"". Always be fun and outgoing. But be yourself at the same time.

, Have a funny,and about yourself bio. And media box. Put pictures of you in your media box and funny quotes. Include a playlist with all your favorite rocks songs/bands. (Brokencyde, BOTDF, Metro Station, Slipknot,etc) Always have your top friends full. But don't just put random people in it. Put people you talk to a lot in it.

If the horse doesn't have any Black Market items and is under 20 years old, sell it for 500 at auction. People will bid on it a lot and probably exceed the price it's worth from the competition of bidding.
If the horse is either over 20 or has lots of rare items, sell it for 100000. If it is pregnant you can add up to a 50000 equus to the starting price, but only if the stallion has a high (2000+) Genetic Potential
If it has a diamond apple/retired/5th element coat, and is immortal and/or has more than 10 black market items (a super rare item counts for 2 items,) sell it for passes. If it has a diamond apple, a good selling price is 100000 equus (e for short) and 12 passes. A retired coat (the apple icon is silver) is worth 2 passes and 25,000e -80,000e on average. Golden Apple coats are 500e-25,000e and 1 pass or 65,000-95,000e but no passes. If your fifth element coat is metal then it is worth 2 passes other fifth element coats are worth 1

, When you get to that point, then go on doing that and improve with time., Some people say that they are increasing in difficulty, and others are saying that they are getting easier, but really the difficulty is random. These promotions can give you useful items that you can use throughout your game. The Lottery is the most popular promotion, which happens twice every year. The promotions usually end after 29-31 days, and you will have to wait for a few days before another promotion starts. Some people support all the promotions, like me, but some others complain that Howrse is just targeting people to buy passes, however even non-pass buyers can win anything in a promotion. Just be patient and one day you'll succeed.

, Buy a lot of horses before you get the pass, then after you have the pass, sell the horses you don't want. It is good to save up your passes to buy something good. If you are inpatient, and do not save up, you will be limited.Waiting for another 30 days to happen may take very long, but it's worth it, once you have enough to buy your own special prize.

,


Private Sales and Direct Sales. In the Private sales you can reserve a horse for anyone at a certain price. Direct Sales are public and don't involve bidding. The very first bidder just gets the horse immediately. If you don't have much money but are good at clicking around really fast, try the Direct Sales! They might help you get some good horses and may even save your money.
Breeding Farm. At 60 days You can make your own breeding farm by naming it, and giving it a description. Breeding Farms are sometimes used to sort horses. You can make a certain breeding farm for a certain kind of horse only, let's say you're making a breeding farm for Arabians. You can restrict this breeding farm to the Arabian breed only. If you want to breed only Purebred Arabians in this farm, you can restrict the breeding farm to purebreds only. If you are in a breeding group, let's say it's called Musical Thoroughbreds. You can name the breeding farm that, and restrict the horses to whatever your breeding group breeds. There may even be other ideas to use breeding farms for. Some people prefer to leave their game without any breeding farms for a certain purpose. You can delete breeding farms and make a new one in its place.

If not, wait till later., There are many ways to do this, even in the game itself. Try opening tryouts for something cool, like lacrosse.

What you don't already have (and want to buy; you can still have a party without furniture), you'll need to buy at Ottoman's.(If you don't have Stars to spare, go play some games until you have enough.) Here are some good things to buy:


Colorful lights, such as the twinkling stars and the Rubix cube lights.
A nice rug-size doesn't matter, as long as it's where people can see!
A nice couch is always a fun addition.
Music-themed furniture, like the Cloud DJ booth or the flashing piano keyboard, gives the impression that music is being played, which looks cool.

A Katsuma is a mixture of a cat and rabbit. They are the most active pets, but they tend to get sick often. As long as you feed them and play with them, they will be happy.
A Diavlo is the most mischievous pet, however, they do tend to get a bit fiery. It's OK to leave them for a day or two, because these are the strongest pets in terms of health.
A Furi is the most grumpy pet, but they can be very happy if treated right. If you leave them alone, though, they will get angry. Their health will go down after a while, so take care of them.
A Zommer is a zombie. They are the easiest pet to take care of, but their happiness will go down in a while. Feed them a lot, though, because they tend to get very hungry.
A Poppet is the most playful and loyal pet. They also might be the cutest pet, as some people say. They are nearly always happy and love it when you tickle them.
A Luvli is the last and most fashionable pet. They tend to be spoiled and want their own way sometimes, but overall, they're cute pets to have, as long as you let them take control every once in a while.

Put your hands in position on the WASD keys and the mouse.,
Look where you want to go and hit the gas (W).,
Get familiar with other movements and actions.,
Use other keyboard keys to access particular features of the game like a map or your inventory.",How to Move Around in a First Person Computer Game,"



Your left hand works the WASD keys to control your characters movement. WASD refers to the letters W, A, S and D found on every standard keyboard.
Most people will rest their ring finger on the A key and their pointer finger on the D key. Your middle finger rests on the W key, but also controls the S key when needed.
We use the WASD keys because the arrow keys are not ergonomic to use in conjunction with a right-handed mouse.

Your right hand uses the mouse to look around or aim. Typically the mouse buttons will interact with the game environment, shoot or do other actions.;
,


Characters in first-person games don’t move around like people in the real world. They actually move more like a car with a really tight turn radius.
When you move around, you can imagine that the mouse is like your steering wheel and the W key is your accelerator pedal.
To move from one end of a room to the other, you:

Look with the mouse where you want to go, and then
Press the W key to move in that direction.


No matter what, the W key will always move you in the direction you’re looking.  If you hold down the W key and move the mouse back and forth, your character will also zig and zag back and forth.

,


The W key is the workhorse of the WASD quartet, but the other keys are useful, too. This is particularly true for games where you need to move around quickly to avoid enemy attacks.
The S Key—This key does the opposite of W. This is your character’s reverse gear. S will always move you in the opposite direction of where you are looking.
The A and D Keys—These two keys are used for what is known as “strafing.” A will always move you to left of where you’re looking and D will move you to the right. These keys are useful if you want to continue to look in a particular direction while moving either left or right. Along with the S key, A and D allow you to move in a direction other than the one you are looking.
CTRL, Shift, Tab—These keys are frequently used in games to do special actions. Some examples might be crouching, throwing a grenade or switching a weapon. The easiest way to hit these buttons is with your left pinkie finger.
Space Bar—The space bar is most commonly used to jump, but it might be used for something else or it might not be used at all. The easiest way to hit the space bar is with your left thumb.

,


Many other keys on your keyboard may be used in the game. Some examples: I is often used to access your inventory, M often opens up a map, J is sometimes used for a journal. The number keys are often used to switch between items or weapons. There’s no particular finger for hitting any of these buttons.

Understand that to have a successful EC (equestrian center), you will need to start small.,
If you don't want to start small, plant turnips and resell them for about 6 months.

,
Buy the basic items to start boarding horses.,
Buy droppings until either you hit the limit, or run out of equus.,
Go to your meadows and click 'Make Manure from Droppings'.,
Go back to the store and click 'Resell Items'.,
Continue doing this every time you can.,
Hire a groom.,
Once you have enough equus, consider buying the following:


a racetrack (you need these for competitions)
a shower (this lets your horses in boarding use 10% less energy in competitions)
a scarecrow (these are great for adding to a large fertile meadow for cultivating crops)

,
If you have a pass, buy a large fertile meadow from the Secret Market and start growing crops on it.,
Set the price of board at something reasonable, so people will board there.,
Board your highest skilled horses in your EC if possible.",How to Start an Equestrian Center on Howrse," Manage it proportionately, so when you incorporate more stalls, hire more employees, and buy more acreage.;
,, Below is a list of what you should start with.


Four 1* box stalls
12 wood chip bedding
6 acre meadow
Two 3 acre meadows.

, You'll need this for earning more equus.

, Make as much manure as possible.

, Resell as much manure as possible. You should earn 40 equus per each manure.

, Once you have a very large EC you should be making equus easily, but before that it always helps to have a boost.

, A groom is always necessary, and you need one groom per 20 box stalls. Always pay the highest wage possible. If you don't get on Howrse often, it is also good to have the contracts be long periods of time.


When you have a fair amount of equus, hire the other employees.
To increase your lesson quality, you need a horse riding instructor (one or more). Start with one.

,, Generally the most equus-providing crops are turnips, albeit more pricey to buy the seeds.

, Start with about 15e a day, and if you are gaining a lot of horses, see if it remains the same when you up the boarding price.


If you have to, set the rate at 10e a day. As soon as your boxes are filled (or mostly filled) with boarded horses, up the rate a bit higher.

, This will improve the overall ranking, therefore increasing the chance of other people boarding their horses in your EC. Make sure you don't occupy all your stalls!

Log into Moshi Monsters.,

The age matters a lot. Older horses are sure to move you up in the rankings.;
, The more seniority you have, the more you will move up in the rankings.

, The number of passes you buy on your account has a big impact. If you buy 1 you'll move up at least three rankings. (Ranking movements are not guaranteed every time a pass is bought though.)

Look at the items your horse has.,
Train it and work on its skills.,
Look at its GP (Genetic Potential).,
Find other special things about the horse.,
Pick a sensible price to sell your horse for.,
Blup it.,
Use direct sales.",How to Sell Your Horse Quickly on Howrse," For example, BM (Black Market) items on your horse can increase the price, depending on what items it has. Usually the more passes the BM items cost, the higher you can raise the price of your horse.


People collect retired and non-retired coats (Golden Apple) so horses with coats can bring a very high price.
There is more demand for Instant Pass Horses and Morpheus Arm horses than ever so they are a good choice to sell.
5th Elements are very rare now so they would also be a good choice to sell.
Shutterfly Splint boot horses bring about 70,000 equus at the auctions and lots of passes in the private sales which makes them very easy to sell.;
, If you've trained your horse and worked on its skills, it'll be worth more than if it has little or no training, and more people will want to buy it.

, Horses with GPs of 350 are worth a lot less than horses with higher GPs. The higher your horse's GP is, the easier it'll be to sell.

, Decide what is good or special about your horse that could affect the price. For example, if it's a unicorn, it's almost guaranteed to be sold, as unicorns are fairly rare. Also, if your horse has Greenstars, it'll be easier to sell.

, Taking everything you've just read into account, decide on a fair starting price for your horse. For example, if your horse has little to no skills and no BM items, start it at 500 equus; that way it's almost guaranteed you'll sell it on the first try. If your horse has skills, BLUP, and a BM item, raise the price, but don't go overboard. Having a 30,000 equus price will turn most people off unless your horse is truly spectacular.

, If you blup a horse to 100, it is sold very fast for about a pass.


Train the horse in every bar (may take a lot of time).
Enter the horse in a lot of competitions.
When you see that the horse has 100 blup, breed it with another 100 blup pure breed of its own breed.
Then sell it for 500 equus and 1 pass. It works all the time.

, Check to see how good your horse is, as in the first part.


If it is just a regular horse you can sell it in direct sales for 1500-3000e depending on how popular the breed is.
If your horse has BMI such as Helios ray or Medusa's blood you can sell them for 4000-7000e depending on the value and amount of the items.
If your horse is a Golden Apple horse you can sell it for 60000-75000e or more if there are more BMI.
If you horse is a retired golden apple horse you can sell it for 100,000-250,000e, again depending on how many items are on your horse.

Then after you have logged on and fed your horses every day for about 5 weeks, go and sell all your droppings, thus receiving money for useless things your horses produce.;
, When you have spent 6 weeks collecting them, you will be able to sell your whole stash of apples at the shop and you will receive money.

, Then put it up for its correct price. You will be gaining money! Then go and buy more underpriced horses, and price them correctly. If you can't find any when you do it for three days, then maybe you're better off making money the fast way.

, Lots of donkeys. Then sell them for 500e and one pass. It sounds cheap, but a pass is always better than money.


Buy 2 donkeys, one of each gender and babies.
Age them until 2 years and 6 months.
Breed them together and sell the first baby.

,


Keep the last 2 babies (if opposite gender) and breed them together once old enough.

, On the right is a box where you can choose your horse. Choose a horse or pony and then give it a name. Then choose the gender. Then click Next.


Try to choose a rare color, so that if you sell your horse later, it will be worth more. If you want to create something that represents your dream horse, you may never want to sell so choosing a rare colour is less important. You can choose from lots of breeds, choose a Shetland pony if you wish, then choose a coat color such as strawberry roan or Palomino.
The color depends on the breed of your horse (for example: Friesians can only be black).

, Stallions can be gelded for a skills bonus but will be unable to reproduce. Alternatively, they can be left as stallions and you can offer coverings when they are sexually mature. Mares can be bred and you get to keep the foal.

, Then enter your date of birth (birthday). It will instantly take you to the login page, where your user is already typed in, you just need to type in your password.


If there is no sponsor, leave it blank.

, When you log in to Howrse, you will be instantly taken to your first horse's page. Follow the tutorial or quests, it will give you good hints. Take the first riding level test on the first day. There isn't much else to do on day one. The test is very easy. This is a highly sought after position, so asking around in the EC forum may help.


The quests will start as soon as you log in. Follow the quests for now, until each one is done.
When you finish with the quests, you get a wonderful surprise. You'll get prizes, and a new horse at the end.

, This is an important guide, which will tell you about caring for your horse in the game, making money, breeding and trade.


If you want extra bonuses and a walkthrough, do the quests at the top of your first foal's page. The person leading is named Ow. Do the walkthrough. It will give you all the basics of the game, and at the end, it will fully train your first horse and give you a second to breed with.

, Feed, groom, stroke, water, and give him a turnip if you have one. Do this stuff to both of your horses.


Do not age your horse at this time.

, You will not need to buy many goodies, as the walkthrough will give you tons of stuff to care for your growing stable.

, The trophies are things that you earn for having all of the coats for one breed of horse or all of the fifth element horses or even pets!

, Only 30 minutes is needed for this.

, It gives them energy and morale.

, Do one ride with your horses.

, Train at least three times on two disciplines.

, If your horse's time is about 20:00 or 21:00, put him to bed, then age him.

, This time, do two times on two disciplines.

, Put him into the meadow. Then play with it for 30 minutes, then participate in a competition for both horses.

, Under the My Profile tab, there will be a button called My Objectives. Follow these to win.


You will get a lot of prizes, including horses, even a Pegasus horse. No unicorns though––you have to breed one, which is rare. You get 1/5 chances of having a unicorn foal.

, As you play, your horse will age. There will be different mile stones that s/he reaches. When your horse is old enough to play games (8 months) there are some methods you can follow (follow this link for a schedule : http://www.howrse.com/centre/forum/sujet?id=144116&sujet=1117812). It is very important to follow the schedule, it will allow for the maximum gain of genetic potential (which you can read about in the breeders manual).


One of the milestones your horse will reach is sexual maturity. This happens at 2 years and 6 months. If you have a mare at this point you may be tempted to breed her so that you can have another horse. If you want, you may, but it will take a while to earn your money back as you have a low paying job, and you can't sell horse until 10 days of seniority. Your mare, however, will be fully trained, and just needs BLUPing. Give her lessons everyday to continue adding skills until she is thirty years old, and enter her in lots of competitions to get her BLUP up. She needs to win 20!

, When you have 10 days of seniority, you can gain access to the sales. The sales is a place where you can buy more horses. After buying a horse from the auctions, you can visit the Safe Haven, once you have passed level 2.


At first, you can only access the auctions.
You need to be at least 30 days and 2 horses to access the direct sales. Same for the reserved sales.
The Safe Haven is a nice place that horses can live when their owners do not want them or decide to retire them. You can stroke these horses daily, and win a small prize. The Safe Haven is a very nice place for horses, but once you send a horse there, you cannot get it back.

, If you decide to get a second horse, here are some things to remember.


Look for purebred horses unless you specifically want a cross
Make sure you will have enough money to cover the auction price or you could lose a karma point.
Ensure you have enough funds to care for your horse/s
Don't give reserve auction sales for a specific player, and don't give in to comments with threats like ""Safe haven if not sold."" because, after all, it's a ""Safe Haven"", not like the horse will be put to sleep.

, After 30 days you can set up an Equestrian Center (EC). Read the EC manual. Here are some things to help give your EC a bit of a jump start:


When you get your EC you are given 25,000 e. you will be tempted to buy stalls and start boarding horses right away. Don't, you will have nothing to offer prospective boarders. Instead, buy a green house if they are less than 19000e then buy a fertile six acre meadow. Grow tons of crops and sell turnips and oats and whatever you grow at the market. Build up your money until you have roughly 100,000 equus.
Every day, buy 1000 droppings and make it into manure (on your meadow page at the top). Sell what you don't need to fertilize your crops.
Keep growing crops constantly. Always have apple in Autumn, flax in Spring and wheat in Summer sell them for profit.
When you have earned 25,000e buy 2 six acre fertile meadows and grow crops in them as well as the ones you already have. Start to grow ingredients for health mashes and make 100 of them.
Lots of people start hiring right away. Don't! Your workers can't work until you have about 20-30 boxes that are occupied!
Once you have enough money, buy 6 smallest boxes, 2 fertile 6 acre meadows and 6 rabbits. This is cost 37,980e. EDIT: rabbits are no longer on Howrse.
Put your minimum skills to 4000% (so that people don't board), put flax as bedding in boxes and put 1 meadow as pasture. Every few days, swap this meadow with another one so the fertility and cleanliness don't go down. Make sure you have at least 10,000e, 200 carrots and 100 health mashes always.
Once you have all employees, put your min skills to 0%.
Keep making mashes, carrots and making money by selling crops. When you have enough, upgrade the boxes (do it all at the same time).
When you have more than enough, buy five 15 acre fertile meadows. Buy 5 scarecrows and put them in the 15 acre meadows.
Upgrade boxes again.
Once a week increase the minimum skills by 20%.
Start to buy 18m2 boxes (top quality) one at a time and get 2 more 15 acre meadows as pasture.
Don't think this is going to be easy. It takes a long time but it's worth it!

,, If you don't have any turnips, buy a lot more. A whole bundle is good, like 50 turnips. They are important for training foals.

, These people can help you out later during the game when you are in need of something, or are in need of advice.


Accept all friend requests, and congratulate random people.
Reply to all messages, and be polite by saying please and thank you often.

, This will help your horse give better foals––the higher the BLUP of your mare, the higher the IBS of the foal! And of course, that will help you sell the foals for more.


The requirements to BLUP your horse are to finish training and rides to bold your horse's top 3 skills. The game will already have done this for your first horse, you just need to BLUP it. You must win 20 1st place ribbons in the competitions, and then age your horse to 10 years old. Many players have day to day schedules for BLUPPING in their forums. Learning to BLUP quickly increases your chances of joining a breeding groups, which offer friendship, and a higher chance to become successful on the game equus wise, passes wise, and much more.

, Make sure the green star stud has full BLUP (100 BLUP) as he affects your foal as well.

Any filler horses (horses with a very low skill/GP that practically are worth their feed) should be sold for about 850e. If filler horses don't sell, try canceling the sale after a few days and reposting it again. An alternative is to lower the price at 50e intervals until sold.

, Buy a reasonable horse. one 500-1000e. Train it up; a horse will sell more if it trained. Sell it in the Auctions for about 2500.

, Set a limit to the price you'll pay for a filler horse (say, 800e) and also a constant price for reselling a filler horse (say 850e). Even though it takes time and speed to nab a good deal, it's worth the effort when you resell.

Repeat with your horses as much as you would like to achieve good genetic potential.",How to Breed Horses on Howrse," A horse can have a green star by excelling in one or more skill. They can inherit the skills by their parents. Having a green star can make them easier to train and win competitions. To check if your horse has one, click on genetics on the bottom of the page and it will say if it has a single star or more.

, These are items that allow you to draw a horse and then scan them onto your computer—they are 4 passes.

, Choosing a mainstream breed if you are only just starting to get serious about breeding is recommended, mainly because the coverings are cheaper, and there has been more progress, therefore allowing you to get a better GP.


The drawback with that is that it is harder to become the best breeder of them because everyone will be one step ahead.
If you choose to breed a less common one, there will be less progress, therefore making it harder to get a good GP, but it will also make hitting the top breeder of that breed a lot easier.
Breeds include donkeys, shires (can only breed 3 times), and Quarter Ponies.

, Make sure that you have sufficient funds to buy good quality horses. If you don't, make sure you wait. There is no point in starting with inadequate breeding stock. Also, make sure that they are purebred and are of breeding age.

Make your best stud immortal. He can cover even more mares than before.

, Make sure that your affix is something that will grab some one's attention., Go to 'My Horses', then go into your 'My horses without a breeding farm' tab. You will see a small icon down the bottom left of the screen, click it and follow the steps. Then move the horses that you just bought into that breeding farm. Annoyingly, you can't put your affix on the horses you just bought, so just name them.






If you want, you can BLUP your mares and stallions. Some people like to BLUP their mares and stallion before breeding. To do this, train your stud a lot. When he is a foal (eight months), play with it to gain him an extra 60 skill points. Reach 20 competition wins, age 10 years and earn all possible skill points in his top 3 disciplines to achieve 100 ""BLUP"" (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction). It might cost you a bit of money, and you might lose the horse for 1-3 days.

, Do any training with them until they are both 2-3 years.;
, People with pages attract more viewers. Show your best stud and say his BLUP, green stars, his breed, his stud price, and name. Also say how many coverings he is offering. That will make it easier for people to find him.

, Go to your sales page and scroll down to the bottom right corner and click on the 'Cover a mare' icon. Then reserve a covering for each one of your females. Your male will be quite tired now, so look after him and bed him down for the night, you won't need to use him for a while.

, Name it whatever you like, but make sure it's not offensive.

, Note what its genetic potential is.

, If it's female, age it to 2 years and 6 months.

, Pick any horse you like, but you have to pay fees. When the foal is born you will not have to pay the vet fee; you pay it when you cover your mare.

, You can even sell the foals to gain more money when you reach 10 days!


Keep at least 1 horse out of the 4 that you will produce, but if this is how you can sell the other three.
First, click on the + icon beside its name and then select the 'sell' option. depending on the breed, GP, and gender, the price will be between 500 - 30,000 e. foals don't tend to exceed 30,000 e for normal breeders. To get a rough estimate of how much to sell her for, compare the prices of horses of similar breed and Genetics, and look at the video bellow if you are selling an older horse.
Now that you have sold your horse you will have made a profit. In order to keep your breeding going, you need to use it wisely. The best type of things to buy is food, good tack, spurs, whips, bell boots and the like. You should also keep some so that you can produce better horses and therefore get more money. Also, if your horses get better, you can even sell them for passes!!

The horse must be 10 years or older to reach 100 blup.,
Complete training in the horse's top three skills.,
After you have finished training do rides and competitions until those three skills are bolded.

,
Make sure you do competitions your horse is good at because to get 100 blups you need to win at least 20 competitions in all.

,
After you have bolded the top three skills, have won 20 competitions, and have your horse older than ten years, the BLUP should be at 100.

",How to Get a 100 Blupped Horse on Howrse,";
, It will be a little bit more easy if you have a Chronos' Timer. The top three skills are the ones with the highest GP distribution (i.e. Purebred Spanish: Gallop, Speed, Dressage)

Keep tabs on your horse's age.,
Keep your horse a healthy weight.,
Take good care of the horse.",How to Know when Your Howrse.com Horse Is Going to Die," One inevitable reason that your horse will die is from old age. When horses reach the age of 25 years, their health meter will start depleting. After this point, your horse is on borrowed time.;
, Your horse can die either from being too fat or too thin:

Avoid allowing the horse to become too fat. If you're feeding your horse too much, than you're meant to, the horse can die from becoming too fat.






Avoid starving the horse to the point of becoming too thin. If you don't feed or forget to feed your horse enough, it can get too thin and die.







, Not being looked after properly (neglect) is a reason for the death of some horses on the game. Make sure to look after your horse perfectly. If your horse's energy/health drops to zero, when your horse ages, the horse will die.

Think of a simple name.,
Add a bit extra.,
Add an extra letter.,
Extra Word.,
Consider naming from the parents.,
Count up the letters.,
Alt Codes.",How to Name Your Horse on Howrse," Get a simple name first of all like 'Harley'. Anything normal and simple would do like 'Alfie'. This is not what your horse will be called though. Another thing you can do is search horse names.;
, For example on the name 'Harley' you could lengthen the name a bit to 'Harlequin' or in the case of the other example, 'Alfie', You could lengthen it to 'Alfred'. Your horse's name is still not complete.

, Somewhere in the name where it would fit in well, add an extra letter. For example, In the example of 'Harlequin' you could add a letter C to make 'Harlequince'. For some names, like Alfred, no letters would add appropriately.

, It could be a nice idea to add something like 'Prince' or 'King' to the end of a stallion's name or something like 'Princess' to the end of a mare's name. In the case of Harlequince, You could add Prince onto the end of his name and call him 'Harlequince Prince'.

, Look at the parents of a recently bought or bred horse. Take one word from each parent, for example, from ""Powerhouse"" and ""Buzz Kill"", you could take ""Power"" and ""Buzz"" Put the words together in a way that works, for example, ""Power Buzz"".

, If you have less the 20 characters and spaces then you are Ok. If you have more than 20 characters and spaces then take off the 'Prince', 'King' or 'Princess' from the end of their name.

, Now that you've got your horse's name down to under 20 characters you should make a space with the space bar, press down number lock, press 'Alt' and then on the right side of the keyboard type in a number from 10 to 25. In the case of 'Harlequince Prince' you could change the name to 'Harlequince Prince ♫'.

Decide if you will want to sell or keep your very first horse.",How to Gain Equus on in Your Breeder's Center on Howrse2," If you want to keep him/her, that's fine, and you needn't follow the pointers below. If you want to sell your horse for equus, then follow the pointers below.


Choose a rare coat and breed for your first horse. It doesn't necessarily have to be a horse or pony breed that you like, because to make money you'll be selling him.
Do as much games as you can with your foal to make him gain more genetic potential.
When you get a pass that you aren't using on something else, give your first horse a GA (Golden Apple) coat, preferably one that's not very popular, but still very pretty (so that when the coat gets retired, it will sell for more).
Add any BM (Black Market) items that you can to your horse, especially Morpheus Arms, Philotes Stroke, Pluto's Parchment, and any other BM items that would be a plus to the owner.
Fully finish training (and blupping your horse if possible), and then put him in the sales (either auction or private) for a good price. Remember, people on Howrse will pay tons for a horse with a Philosophers Stone (which your first horse gets anyway if you let Ow guide you) and a retired GA coat. Also, note that if no one bids on your horse, you can always put him back in the sales for a cheaper price.;
"
"
Buy a good inborn skilled and genetic colt (uncastrated male foal) in either the auction or the private sales.,
Use the aging points that you get when you first started the game to age the foal you just bought.,
Once your horse is 2 years 6 months old he will reach his sexual maturity.,
Once your horse is at three years spend three passes to get your horse Morpheus arms and another three passes to get the philosophers stone.,
Spend three passes on an Atlantis pack and another two on a chronos timer.,
Train your horse in it's two least dominant skills then enter competitions.,
Finish training and blupping your horse.,
Offer coverings for a good price in the public coverings and continue to do competitions.,
Buy a filly (female foal) and follow the same rules and guidelines.,
Breed your mare and stallion together.,
Continue having your stallion cover your mare until you make tons of equus.",How to Gain Equus on in Your Breeder's Center on Howrse3," See the guidelines below for what the foal should have and be. Don't be afraid to spend passes to get a good horse; with most, it's worth it. Also make sure this horse is a pure breed, preferably of a breed which people are interested in.


40+ excellence stars.
900+ genetic potential
250+ or more inborn skills

, When your foal is old enough you need to play games with him. There are numerous guides on this so you can find them by looking around. Train for the maximum amount that his energy will allow until he has about 15% of energy left, then stroke, water, feed, and groom, and if there's enough excess energy to train awhile more, then do so.

, Don't offer any coverings until he's fully trained unless someone specifically asks for one.

, This will make your horse immortal and also allow you to age him without aging points.

, Save the rest of your passes.

, You want to enter and win 20 competitions. This will get you money as well as raise your horse's BLUP.

, Continue to do competitions for extra money.

, Your horse will gain skills and also make you money at the same time.

, Make sure she is the same breed as your stallion.

, If you like, use aging points to make the gestation period pass faster.

, If you don't use the hera pack sell the foal for 3,000e or you can lower it with passes. Have fun!

Realize what BLUP (also spelled as ""blup"") is, and what it does.,
Choose your horse to apply BLUP.,
Register your foal in an equestrian center (EC), and make sure to choose the best one you can afford that has carrots, fertile, clean meadows, and large, clean boxes.,
Start going on rides at 1 year, 6 months.,
Try to find items on rides.,
Decide which competitions your horse will excel in.,
Train your horse in its secondary skills.,
Equip your horse with the best removable (not the Poseidon's Pack) tack you have, and enter him in competitions.,
Continue with whatever your horse hasn't finished in the steps above until they are completed.",How to Blup a Horse on Howrse," The abbreviation ""BLUP"" stands for ""Best Linear Unbiased Prediction"". What it does is help the horse pass on GP (genetic potential) to its offspring, and the more GP the horse has, the higher skills it will have when it's fully trained. Please note that fully trained is not fully blupped. To get your horse fully blupped, you'll need your horse to gain 200 points of BLUP (from -100 to 100). In short, your horse will need to do or have the below:


Skill gains complete in top 3 skills (train, ride, and compete until there is no more gain in any of the top three skills).

To check your horses top 3 skills, look at the Training tab on your horse's page. The skills with an arrow by them are the top 3.


20 first-place wins in competitions
Age 10 years or older.

Up until age 10 years, your horse will gain a little BLUP each day. Water of Youth does not increase your horse's BLUP. It decreases the rate at which your horse gains BLUP, but allows you to enter more competitions and lessons in before your horse reaches 10.

;
, It's best to start with a foal, playing with it daily (to increase your foal's skills the full 60 points), and then starting the rides when the horse reaches 1 year 6 months. However, you can start the horse at any age, although the horse will be fully BLUP at an older age accordingly. It also helps to pick a high GP horse to make BLUPing it worth your time.

, Without carrots, you'll have to find specific directions for foal games without carrots.


Note: Foal games no longer require carrots, and the EC's prestige no longer matters for them.
Your foal will do its last foal games at 1 year, 4 months.

, Do the rides that will raise your horse's top three skills (if the top 3 skills are Gallop, Dressage, Jumping, do short Forest rides).


Forest rides increase the Dressage, Jumping, and Gallop skills. Mountain rides increase the Speed, Stamina, and Trot skills. You don't need to concern yourself with beach rides yet, as they appear at age 5 years.
After you're done with this, you can go on to the next step.

, The items are Hoof Picks, Combs, and Tubs of Grease.


If your horse finds a Tub of Grease, drop everything and enter competitions until you lose the Tub of Grease.
There doesn't seem to be a way to control when you get these items. Just hope for the best.

,


Horses' top three skills may not coincide with the skills used in competitions. You'll want to check out which competitions work your horse's top three skills (for a pure Thoroughbred, they will excel in Gallop, Speed, and Dressage, thus being ideally suited for Gallop competitions in the Classical specialty. A Fjord pony, however, excels in Speed, Stamina, and Dressage, making them perfect for Cutting competitions in the Western specialty). Find the specialty that will allow your horse to use its skills to the best advantage, and train the two secondary skills your horse requires.
Using an Arabian as an example (Stamina, Dressage, Jumping), they are ideally suited for Classical Cross-Country competitions (which use those skills). Thus, you would train in dressage and jumping, but not stamina.
Using a Paint Horse as an example (Speed, Dressage, Gallop), they are suited to Classical Gallop races (which use those skills). You'd train in speed and dressage, but not Gallop.
You can tell which skills a competition uses by going to the competition's page.

, These are the horse's top three skills, but you're training the secondary skills of the competition it will specialize in.

, You'll need your horse to be doing its most helpful competitions. These competitions will not only give you wins, but will also give your horse a skill gain up to a point. You need these skill gains to BLUP your horse.

, Then you just have to wait until your horse is 10 (which it most likely is by now). Your horse should now be fully blupped!

Know the rarity and popularity of the horses and items.,
Know that if you are doing your best and staying calm about your buys and sells, you are doing well.",How to Know if a Horse Is Not Priced Correctly on Howrse.Com," Alternatively, memorize the right price for each horse type. That way, you will have a guide in your hands, or your head, at all times.;
, Go to the sales, and look at horses, try to tell if they are priced correctly or not. If you get most or all of them right, you have memorized the correct prices for a horse.

, Really look at the horse's potential, and notice its positive and negative sides. Then try to determine what price it should be.


Look at the training and its stars.
Don't pay any attention to names of horses. If a horse's name says ""Fully Trained"", the seller may be lying.
Examine the horse all over, and notice every detail. Even take a sneak peek at the bonuses.
Mental chants are great for slowing down your choice. ""How slow can you go?"" is a great chant to try.

, Remember that there are some things that may look rare but aren't.

, Even look at the bonuses. Scouring every little nook and cranny on a single horse may take hours, but it is worth it, so always remember to look everywhere for small hints.


The training and items tell you the most, although bonuses are a good place to start. For example: A golden apple may be rare, but a diamond apple is even rarer.
If a horse is a newborn, it might not have as much training. If you are selling a newborn, price it at 1,500 or lower. If it's a uni baby or has special things, sell it for equus not passes.
If you sell a full grown uni or pegasus, sell it for around 50,000. If fully trained plus unicorn or pegasus. If it's just uni or pegasus, sell if for a few passes.
If you are selling a normal horse, sell for around 2,000 equus. Never put it too high for the kind of horse it is.
Never sell your first horse. If you did quest, it's probably rare now. It is probably immortal and almost fully trained depending on how old you are on Howrse. That one's a keeper.

, You will eventually learn. Everyone becomes better if they practice.

Make a new model with a totally different name, but not necessarily a new personality.,
Get known.,

Attack people on the boards and pick fights.,
Make a hate or love board.,
Pretend to leave.,
Bask in your hypocrisy.

",How to Be Popular on goSupermodel,"


Your name should reflect you and your personality. An inside joke with a friend or a silly word. Make sure it is unique.

Make tons of friends. Make friends with the popular models and the MODs.;
,


Leave at least one comment on every board you see, while trying to avoid spam. This will get your name out there and people will recognize you.
Identify the ""popular group"" on GSM and mail every single one of them with mails like ""What's up? Love your pics, you're so pretty!"" and other such compliments. Be sure to use proper capitalization and punctuation, because no one will take you seriously if you don't, and you'll look like a noob or a wannabe if you use chat speak. If the popular models do not reply, mail them again a couple of days later and use a different method. such as ""your diary is so interesting!"" If the inevitable happens and they block you, contact one of their friends and politely tell them that the popular model blocked you and you don't know why.

, Be sure not to say anything rude or something that would smear your name.

, Change your personality. It's best to use a cool personality. People who are unnecessarily mean get more attention than people who seem good and wholesome, since you will look more interesting, badass and rebellious than those goody goodies. Chances are you will not get chewed out for this because all your ""friends"" will take your side. If you do, complain and moan and whine and act completely stupid, don't worry about what they think of you, most models do it anyway, and it's best to just follow them.

, Make a lot of love/hate boards for your friends and enemies. As an alternative, you can make another account and make a board about yourself, then you may attempt the drama. Drama is what keeps GSM going strong and without it, the site would flicker into nothingness.

, Do not attempt this if you have not have any boards made about you! Make a board saying you are going to leave. Do not supply a reason for your deleting. Keep your model long enough for people to beg for you not to leave, then say ""Goodbye, all my good friends. I'll miss you forever,"" or something to that effect and delete your model. This will make your popularity skyrocket, as people will put you in their diaries and make boards about you, grieving their loss. 10 minutes later, make a new model with a name like ""YOURMODELNAMEHERE back from the grave."" Make a diary entry saying ""I COULDN'T STAY AWAY LONG ENOUGH I LOVE ALL YOU GUYS! ;___;"" and be sure to mail all your friends and make lots of boards about your triumphant return.

Okay, Ms. Hotshot, now you've got an appropriate amount of popularity.,
Now you are at least a commercial model.,
You are a hit now.,
Note that this is from the USA version.

",How to Be Known on Gosupermodel," You may already have one, but making a new one with a fresh start is so much easier. Give your model a username like ""Isolah Lynne"", ""Bibelot"", ""Lovelytoes"", ""..Diamond."", ""Catinka"", ""edimir"", or ""ExPo"". Just don't include numbers. Make her look sophisticated, yet add some of your own taste into it. Remember, you need to make a good first impression on the fellow models. Also, being different is the new fad here, which a lot of people are not. When choosing the hair, anything is fine, it's just to get you started.;
, At some point, you will get one if you click ""Yes"". Mentors are a must, because they are usually very friendly, and are willing to be friends (add) with their Mentee. There is a friend for you, right there!

, After a while, you will be a catalogue model.

, This will make the girls think you are dedicated and focused. But don't spend all your time on here, that just looks silly, and it makes other models think that you spend your whole life on here. After some time, mail some of the popular models and leave them nice comments. After a while of simple chit-chat, start talking about more serious conversations. This gets them hooked.

, What about fame? Play 5 photo shoots a day. Get a fashion magazine, for those don't cost very much and can keep you updated on what to wear. Play Dancer as many times as you can, and try Wardrobe Challenge. You must be patient, you won't become a Supermodel in a week. Try a month or 2.

, Save up your goMoney, and don't waste it on useless crap. Try to change your hairstyle every 2 months if possible, and change clothes if you can every week. This keeps your model looking new and fresh. Look at what others are wearing, and what's popular.

, You have tons of friends, are popular, famous, and rich. Use your status for good, not bad.

Finally, pick good pets and guests, even if you are not a beastmaster.",How to Do Well in Adventurequest RPG," It costs a one-time payment of USD $19.95, and it's worth it. You get more features, including access to ArchKnight and Zardwars, two potions instead of one, Guardian blade, Guardian armor, play Guardian-only quests, and the Blade of Awe (it will replace the guardian blade)!.;
, Your weapons will not matter much compared to stats, especially if you decide to become a spellcasting class.

, Try out a bunch of quests and see what fits you best. Random Adventure is not very effective due to the new exp and gold reward updates.

, For example, warrior (STR,DEX,LUK and melee weapons), mage (INT,DEX,LUK and spells/magic weapons), ranger (DEX,STR,LUK and ranged weapons), or hybrid (mixture of stats, good at all forms of combat).

, You should level all tier 1 classes (fighter, mage, rogue, and scholar) to level 10 because many tier 2 classes require you to level in them and some of them are good for levelling at higher levels. After this you should pick classes suited to your role. Warriors can learn Beserker and Knight, Mages can learn Wizard and Rogues should learn ninja. Other classes can be learned such as martial artist and Beastmaster. Tier 3 classes (Paladin, Necromancer and Assassin) are very effective and you should try to learn all 3 of them and pick your the one that benefits you most.

, Important for Warriors and Hybrids.)
Dexterity (Raises damage for ranged attacks and accuracy for all attack types besides pets and guests. Also increases chance for blocking. Important for every role.)
Intellect (Raises MP and damage/accuracy for spells and magic attacks and improves mana potion healing. Important for Mages and Hybrids)
Endurance (Raises HP. Important for all roles, especially Warriors and Hybrids.)
Charisma (Raises damage and accuracy of pets and the rate at which they attack. Important for beastmaster sub-builds).
Luck (Grants a 10% chance at lucky strikes which can be a number of times more powerful than a normal attack with sufficient Luck, significantly improves accuracy for all attacks besides pets and guests, significantly raises the chance to block or dodge though relatively useless at the highest levels, greatly improves your chance to go first in battle, causes you to find larger treasure chests, makes health and mana potions heal more, and even helps to resist negative status ailments.)

, Try to obtain the Blade of Awe (Guardian. Choose one weapon for each element and make sure they are all correct for your role (melee, ranged or magic). Weapons are less important for Mage classes because they should be casting spells the majority of the time.

, While not necessary in the beginning, you will eventually require an armor and shield of every element. Get a good no-drop armour if you are guardian, which is a choice between Armor of Awe (Semi-defensive, so effective for spellcasters because they will not use it to attack.), or Ultra-guardian Armor (Semi-offensive, so effective for warriors because spamming your normal attack is your main form of damage.) Also get decent armours such as effective class armours (Wizard robes provides very powerful spellcasting, Paladin armour provides good abilities for Hybrids.)

, Like weapons, pick one for each element.

, Non beastmasters should usually just stick to healing pets and guests, as the accuracy of attacking pets and guests usually doesn't cut it. Pick one for each element and make sure you have a high enough Charisma for them.

Start the breeding process over again if you didn't get a Rainbow Dragon.",How to Breed the Rainbow Dragon on DragonVale," Whenever you breed two dragons that meet the criteria, there is a 1% chance that the outcome will be a Rainbow Dragon, 2% with the Epic Breeding Island. The chances of getting a Double Rainbow Dragon are 0.5% (1% with the Island). There is nothing you can do to increase these odds. If you don't get a Rainbow Dragon from your breeding efforts, you'll just need to keep trying until it eventually happens.;
, You'll need to earn experience and level up your park to Level 11 before you can start trying to breed Rainbow Dragons. There are several ways to gain experience and increase your level:


Accomplish your daily goals.
Hatch dragons.
Build new buildings and habitats.
Complete Colosseum events.

, Normally you'll have a 1% chance of getting a Rainbow Dragon, but you can increase this to a 2% chance if you use an Epic Breeding Island instead of a Breeding Cave. The Epic Breeding Island costs 125 Gems, and you'll need to be Level 13 to build it.


You can upgrade the Epic Breeding Island to an Epic Breeding Sanctuary for 225 Gems. This won't increase your chances, but it will reduce breeding time by 20%. This will make the process quicker.

, In order for a dragon to be able to breed, it must be level 4 or higher. You can increase a dragon's level by feeding it or spending Gems.


There are some reports that having both dragons at level 11-20 will increase the chances of getting a Rainbow, but this is unconfirmed.

, This will begin the breeding process.

, This is the only requirement for potentially getting a Rainbow Dragon. It doesn't matter which dragon has which elements, as long as there are at least four unique elements in the mix. This means that there are about 30,000 possible combinations that can result in a Rainbow Dragon. The elements involved will not affect the chances of producing a Rainbow Dragon. Some possible combinations include, but are definitely not limited to:Panlong + Seaweed
Crystal + Blue Fire
Current + Flower
Blazing + Swamp
Love + Swamp
Flower + Plasma
Scorch + Seaweed
Firefly + Seaweed
Crystal + Lichen

, When you select your two dragons and start the breeding process, you'll be shown how much time until it is complete. If the time displayed is 48 hours or 38 hours and 24 minutes, it may be a Rainbow Dragon., The breeding process will take some time to complete, and you won't know the results until it's finished. You can pay Gems if you want to speed up the process.

, Rainbow Dragons will have an incubation time of 48 hours. You can pay Gems to skip this as well. If the egg is Rainbow-striped, you've got a Rainbow Dragon.

, If you're lucky, you'll have received a Rainbow Dragon. If you're extra lucky, you'll get the Double Rainbow Dragon! If you didn't get a Rainbow Dragon, don't fret. The chances are very low, and you'll likely have to breed many times in order to get one.

, If you didn't get a Rainbow Dragon, you can just start the breeding process over again. Since the type of elements don't affect the chances, you can just have the same two dragons breed again until you get one.

This is where you can send two dragons to breed and produce an egg. The egg will need to incubate for a certain amount of time before it hatches, depending on the breed the egg contains.;
, When you select two dragons to breed, the game will calculate what dragon you receive based on certain odds. Generally, there are three types of results you can expect from a breeding: Common, Rare, and Epic. The one you get is purely chance-based, and Rares and Epics have very low percentages.

, The rarest dragons are bred from combinations of previous, lesser dragons. You will need to go through several breeding processes before you have the right dragons to breed the super rare ones.

, The rarest dragons can take a very long time to hatch, but once you see that long incubation time you'll know that you have something good on your hands.

Many new Weemees come on the site and are sometimes lost. It's always nice to help them around. Just show them everything they need to know.

Most people just become an ambassador for the fame. You need to make sure you are comfortable with being one. It takes lots of hard work to be one. Just be yourself and find your own style when you help. You can have a laugh once in a while, though; no need to be a robot.


,


Weeworld has its own term of conditions and you need to follow them. Make sure you don't break them and if you do it might lower your chances of being an ambassador.


,


You need to know many things about the sites to help Weemees. Usually you need to be higher than level 10 to be an ambassador but the level doesn't really count. Just make sure you can answer questions. You really don`t need to know all the answers. Make blogs or helpful guides.

, Eyes are the first thing people notice about you. Eyes with a surprised or pouty expression look really cute. You don’t have to choose what your eyes look like in real life. Take risks!


Eyes come in many different shapes. Choose what you think is the cutest.
Pick an eye color. Your eye color is your choice, but choosing light green, blue, brown or hazel will make you stand out.
There are also fake lashes you can buy as an accessory if you want your eyes to look big and innocent.

, Usually, cute noses are small, and big lips can be very pretty. Skin color doesn’t matter, so choose any shade you want.


A small nose will compliment big lips, and a larger nose will look good with smaller lips. This will achieve balance.
If you want big lips and a big nose, your look will be very dramatic.

, Once you’ve put your face together, make sure the different parts look good together. If something doesn’t match, now is the time to change it.

, If you’re going for a natural look, the best choice for your hair is smoky black, gorgeous blonde, or a light brown. If you want to look sassy, colors like pink, green, or even orange will work.


Big hair with lots of volume gives you a dramatic look.
Short and straight hair looks more sophisticated.
Bangs are a good choice because they frame your face.
Get an updo hairstyle if you want to look fancy.

, It’s up to you whether you wear a lot or a little eye makeup. The more eyeliner and eyeshadow you wear, the more dramatic your face will look. For example, dark eyeliner and eyeshadow will make your eyes pop.


There are fun colors of eyeshadow like blue or purple. Try going with a natural look though.
Light colors like gold or green look good with light blue or green eyes.Darker colors like black or purple look good with darker eyes like brown or black., Reds and pinks look good on lips. If you want a wild look, choose a bright color like green or even a dark color like purple. Gothic looks use black lipstick.


Wearing lipstick and eye makeup at the same time will give your face a fuller look.
Sometimes, people like to balance their look by either having dark eye makeup or dark lip makeup—not both.
A lot of blush is not recommended. Too much can make your face look unnatural.

, In the “Shopping” area, you can buy new clothes and accessories.Your clothes should look subtle, but at the same time sophisticated and fancy. There are some general guidelines to remember when buying clothes:


Bright colors will attract more attention.
Sassy clothes are shorter and cover your body less.
Dark colors look more emo and goth.

, If you’re wearing a big t-shirt, choose jeans as a bottom. If you’re wearing a tank top, a skirt will look nice. Fancy tops look best with fancy bottoms, and casual tops go nicely with casual bottoms. But whatever you do, DON'T mix patterns.


Bohemian looks include lots of patterns, scarves, and lots of necklaces.If you want to look bohemian, put on chunky necklaces and wear colorful patterns.
Sporty looks include t-shirts, tennis shoes, and jeans. This look is more simple but still cute. Pair a bright v-neck t-shirt with a pair of blue jeans.

Tap the top, middle, or bottom of the game screen to swipe.,
Repeat as often as you like.",How to Level Up on MovieStarPlanet Fast1," MovieStarPlanet has a free app for both Android and Apple mobile platforms, although it's commonly accepted that the computer version contains fewer glitches and better overall gameplay. For this trick, however, you'll need the mobile app., If you don't already have an account with MovieStarPlanet, you'll need to make one by tapping ""New User"" and following the instructions.

, This is on the right side of your screen, directly above the ""New User"" button.

, These should correlate with the ones you use on the computer version if you do so.

, This is at the top of the ""Games"" screen., ""On Location"" works by giving you Fame whenever you complete a swipe. You can do so by tapping the top, middle, or bottom third of the game's screen.


You receive two Fame for each successful swipe (roughly a second of game time). If you chain together multiple swipes by tapping the top, middle, and bottom in succession, you can make six Fame per two seconds or so.

, This will generate Fame. As long as you don't mind grinding for a few minutes, your character will rapidly level up.

, Please be aware that the game can crash due to too much happening on-screen if your phone or tablet uses too much RAM; if this happens, simply restart and pick up where you left off.

Log into your MovieStarPlanet account.,
Click the ""Games"" option in the MSP interface.,
Review your game options.,
Click on the game category that suits you best.,
Play your preferred game repeatedly.",How to Level Up on MovieStarPlanet Fast2," As you play games within the MSP world, you will be rewarded with Fame; the more games you play, the quicker you'll level up., This is located in the top left corner of your MSP screen.

, MovieStarPlanet has several categories of games, all of which will award you large amounts of Fame upon completion:


""Dress Up"", which asks you to dress your character a certain way in a limited amount of time. Dress Up is largely contingent on other players' approval and takes quite awhile to yield results, so it isn't a very good option for building Fame.
""Crazy Cards"", which lets you judge the appearance of other players. Since this relies on other players' judgement, it isn't ideal for building your Fame quickly.
""Quiz"", which asks you multiple-choice questions. This is your best option for leveling up quickly; you gain fame for every correct answer you get, and the longer you play, the more answers you'll consistently know.
""Arcade"", which contains classic arcade games as well as original ones. While generally the most accessible, these games net you very little fame.
""Catwalk"", which is reserved for level 6 and up. Catwalk isn't ideal for leveling up, since it relies on player judgement like Dress Up.
""Casting"", which lets you create movie scenarios. Similar to Catwalk, Dress Up, and Crazy Cards, this game takes longer than the others, is contingent on player approval, and doesn't afford you much Fame upon completion.

, Playing any of MSP's games will earn you Fame.

, This is a strategy known in video games as ""grinding""--repeating an action that nets you money, experience, or, in this case, Fame. Once you become accustomed to a particular game, you'll be leveling up in no time!


The ""Quiz"" category is the best way to earn fame quickly. It's the only game category with a large amount of Fame as your reward that relies on your ability rather than another player's judgement.

Please note that VIP membership costs money.

, This will open the VIP menu, from which you can choose your VIP package.


If you have a MSP code or gift card you'd like to use for VIP payment, click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen to open the Settings menu, then click ""Redeem Code"" or ""Redeem Gift Certificate"". You can enter the code from there.

, Paying for a VIP membership gives you increased Fame, which will help you level up quicker than on a standard account.You have three VIP tiers, each with one-week, one-month, three-month, and one-year duration options. As a general rule, the one-year option is most likely more than you'll need to reach the maximum level. Your VIP options are as follows: VIP, which is the standard VIP membership. One week costs $4, a month costs $10, three months costs $25, and a year is $55. You'll have a larger amount of options and interactions than a standard account, but the StarCoin and Diamond rewards aren't very high. With this option, you'll be able to add up to four friends, spin the reward wheel twice a day, and give out four autographs per hour.
ELITE VIP, which is the next tier up. ELITE costs $5 for a week, $11.99 for a month, $29 for three months, and $65 for a year. ELITE allows you to add up to seven friends, spin the reward wheel three times per day, and give out 15 autographs per hour.
STAR VIP, which is the final tier. A week costs $6, a month costs $12.99, three months is $32, and a year is $70. For your money, the STAR tier is the best option, since you receive exponentially more rewards upon purchasing the membership. STAR allows you to add up to nine friends, spin the reward wheel four times per day, and give out 30 autographs per hour.
If you avoid the year membership and stick with the three-month duration, the STAR is only $7 more than the regular VIP. This makes it the best balance of cost-effective and reward-heavy, since you'll receive a huge amount of diamonds and StarCoins in addition to the increased chance to earn Fame.

, This will take you to the payment selection screen.

, MSP supports credit and debit cards from Visa, American Express, Master Card, Visa Electron, and JCB, as well as PayPal and pre-paid gift cards.

You can use the ""Check availability"" button next to the box for your name to see whether or not someone already has your name. Two Minecraft players cannot have the same name.

, Once you confirm your name change, it should take effect immediately. However, note that you may not be identified by your new name in Minecraft servers right away. It can take anything from a few minutes to a few hours for your request to be processed.


According to Mojang, you may need to completely log out of the game, then log back in again to see your new name.In the rare event that your new username hasn't been applied within a day or two, feel free to contact Mojang Support via the official Twitter account., In an effort to keep users from changing their names constantly, Mojang enforces a mandatory 30 day waiting period between name changes. This means that once you change your name, you'll have to wait at least 30 days before you can do it again.This waiting period also comes into effect when you create a new account. In other words, you also can't change your name if you just made a new account., When you change your Minecraft username, other users can't take your old name right away — it is stored in the Minecraft servers for 37 days before being released. After 37 days, anyone can use your old name.Thus, if you want your old name back after a name change, you have a seven day window for getting it back: any time between the end of the 30 day waiting period for name changes and before the 37 day storage period for old names.


To be clear, you still have to wait 30 days to change back to your old name. There is no instant way to do it.
Your username will not necessarily be taken by another user immediately after the 37 day storage period ends. However, the seven day window of opportunity is the only time that you'll be guaranteed to get your old name back.

, In the Minecraft launcher window, there is an option in the bottom left corner to edit your existing profile or create a new one. Neither option will affect your in-game username, which is displayed in the bottom right corner of the launcher as ""Welcome, (Username).""


As opposed to usernames, profiles exist to save different selections of preferences (which you can set in the ""Edit Profile"" menu), not to change your in-game title.

, Before Minecraft switched to using a shared account with all other Mojang games, it used its own account system that required users to log in with their username, rather than their email. If you still have one of these old accounts (in other words, if you log in with your username), you have to migrate to a Mojang account to be able to change your Minecraft username. This is easy — just use the steps below:Visit .
Enter your Minecraft username and password.
On the following page, supply the basic information requested in the appropriate boxes. Follow the prompts to complete the process.
Start logging in to Minecraft with your email address (not your username.)

, Have a question or problem that isn't addressed here? The official Mojang support site at help.mojang.com is a great place to get the answers you're looking for. You can also try following the official Mojang Twitter for updates on the most frequent changes to Minecraft and other Mojang games.


Note that if you're using mods, these official support resources might not have answers to every mod-related question. In this case, your best bet is to visit the official site of the mod(s) you are using.

,
Play your game.",How to Change Your Minecraft Skin3," The Novaskin Skin Editor is a website that will allow you to build and download a skin which you make yourself on the website. Though you could use software like Photoshop or MS Paint, Novaskin is likely the simplest way to make your own skin.

, There will be an invisible outline of the character which you will need to locate to begin coloring it. The easiest way to do this is to select one of the colors at the bottom and to randomly color the center of the screen until you see it.

, Once you've found the frame for the character, you can begin creating your skin. There are a variety of tools which you can use, varying from a dropper (which lets you copy an existing color from a pixel) to layers (which let you do your shading separate from your base color). Experiment to get the hang of how the tools work.


Color the base skin color. Choose a base color for the skin by clicking one of the colors at the bottom and using the color slider to select the color. Color all the skin by clicking and dragging across all of the pixels on the character.
Color the clothes. Make whatever clothing you would like on the character. The simplest would be jeans and a tee shirt.
Color the face and hair. Coloring the face and hair can be difficult. Remember to use multiple shades of the same color on the hair to make it look real. Minecraft characters do not usually have a nose drawn.
Use the pre-made shading to make your character look better. From the sidebar on the left, click “Wear”. Select one of the first two shading options to make your character look better.
Use one of the pre-made skins as a base if you would rather not make one from scratch. You can also choose one of the pre-made skins on the left (under the Gallery tab). Find a skin you like and click on it or hover over it and click “+ layer”.
Make sure that all sides of the character are colored. You can select different sections of the character frame in the bottom left corner. Make the disappear to reach the hidden areas that need coloring.

, This will save the file as a .png, which you can add to your game.

, Log in to the Minecraft website and click the “Profile” tab.

, Find the png file you saved and click “Open”.

Video: set your hotkeys for record, pause and stop; click the Settings tab here and navigate to Sound in order to turn on audio for your recordings; set your FPS here, as well, to a reasonable number (30 is plenty).
Image: lets you take screenshots with a hotkey.

, If your free video capturing software comes with editing capabilities, you may use that to cut, splice, transition, and tweak your capture. If your video capturing software doesn't come with editing software, you will need to download editing software and use that to edit your video to perfection.

Alternatively, log in with a friend's info.",How to Download Minecraft for Free," To be able play Minecraft at all, first, you need to download the game itself. The way Minecraft works is a little different than the way other games do in this regard: you can download Minecraft at any time for free, but you need to pay for an account to play the full version.


To get the Minecraft ""launcher"" (the application you use to play the game), first go to Minecraft.net. On the right, you'll see three options: ""Get Minecraft,"" ""Play the demo,"" and ""Already bought the game? Download it here."" Even though you haven't paid for it yet, pick the last option.On the next page, if you're working on a Windows PC, click the link for either Minecraft.msi or Minecraft.exe. Your download will start. If you're on Mac or Linux, click ""Show all platforms"" and choose the appropriate option.;
, Once your download is complete, run the file. The install process should start immediately. Simply follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.


The installation should go smoothly for the vast majority of users. However, if you have problems downloading or installing Minecraft, try consulting the official help resources at help.mojang.com., Once the installation finishes, the Minecraft launcher should start up immediately. If it doesn't, you can always start it by opening it from the directory you installed it to.

, When the launcher opens, it will ask you for your login information so that it verify whether or not you have paid for the game. Since you don't have an account yet, click ""Register."" Without an account, you can't play the game at all — not even the demo.


Clicking the ""Register"" button will open a window in your default web browser that takes you to the Mojang website to create an account. Follow the prompts to register a username and password. You will need to provide a valid email address so that you can receive a validation email as part of the registration process.

, Once your account is registered with Mojang, you should be able to log in to the Minecraft launcher. When you log in, you may notice the launcher downloading additional files via a progress bar at the bottom of the window — this is normal.


Note that you will need an internet connection to log in so that your information can be verified with the Mojang servers.

, At the bottom of the launcher window, you should see a large ""Play Demo"" button. Click this button to launch the game. The launcher will close and a new game window will open. Click ""Play Demo World"" on the title screen.

, Congratulations — you should now be playing Minecraft for free. If this is your first time playing, consider reading our Minecraft article to orient yourself. It's important to note that the demo version isn't the full version of the game — it's meant to be just a taste of what the full version contains. The biggest differences you may notice between the two versions are:


The demo version of the game is limited to a 100-minute play session.
The demo version of the game doesn't allow online multiplayer. However, you can still play LAN multiplayer games.

, If you have a friend who owns a copy of Minecraft, one easy way to play the full game on your computer is simply to use his or her login details. Do this only with your friend's permission — preferably, in his or her presence. Never use another person's account for illegal distribution of the game, as this can get your friend's account permanently revoked.


Note that the Minecraft End User License Agreement specifies that ""you permission to install the Game on your own personal computer and use and play it on that computer."" Though it is unlikely that sharing account login info might lead to serious ramifications unless you deliberately pirate or distribute the game, violating the EULA is grounds for revoking your privilege to play."

Find and share the seed for your current world.",How to Use Seeds in Minecraft PE," In Minecraft, the ""seed"" is a set of letters and numbers that identifies a world created by the game's world creation program. It allows everyone with that seed to experience the same world, since the world generator will recreate the exact same results when the seed is entered.;
, Whenever the world generator function is updated in Minecraft PE, it will make seeds act differently than they did before. This is especially important with later versions of Minecraft PE that introduced ""Infinite"" worlds. Most sites that list seeds should also list the versions that they work for.


""Infinite"" worlds are levels that can stretch on forever, and they use a different creation method than ""Old"" worlds. This means that seeds for Old worlds will provide different results when used to create an Infinite world, and vice versa.
Infinite worlds were added in Minecraft PE version 0.9.0, and are not available on some older devices.

, There are tons of seeds out there. Most Minecraft fan sites have a Seeds section that contains lists of seeds along with a description of the world that will be created. Note that if the seed is a word, it doesn't necessarily mean that the word will relate to the world that is created. For example a seed named forest probably won't create a bunch of forests, and a seed named winter won't make a winter wonderland.

, You will be able to enter your seed when you start a new game.


On the ""Create a World"" screen, tap the ""Advanced"" button.
Select your ""World Type"". For newer seeds, select ""Infinite"" unless the site specifically says otherwise. If you don't have the option to select ""Infinite"", you'll need to use an ""Old"" world seed because your device does not support Infinite worlds.
Enter your seed into the ""Seed"" box. Seeds are case-sensitive, so make sure that you enter each letter correctly. An upper-case letter in a seed will create a completely different world than a lower-case one.
Select your game mode. Seeds work for both Creative and Survival mode, so just pick the one you want to play and tap ""Create World""!

, Here are a few seeds gathered from around the internet. These seeds are all for the ""Infinite"" world type. There are literally countless more, so give these a shot and then try to find your own!

See how far they can shoot.,
Get the average of both items.,
Remember that dropper rhymes with hopper.,
Shoot a bottle o' enchanting out of each.,
Understand that the previous theory is also true with splash potions.",How to Tell a Dropper from a Dispenser on MCPE Master,"


A dispenser can usually shoot farthest. However, there are some items a dispenser can't shoot. Because if different weight, dispensers and droppers have their own range of things.;
,


The item with a higher average is more likely to be a dispenser. A dropper cannot shoot as far. To find this average, compare how far several different items were shot.

,


These rhyming sounds are not the only thing in correlation to each other. If you look closely at the two items mouths, a dropper has a mouth shaped like a hopper. That can help you remember, dropper hopper.

,


The bottle will explode in xp points when shot out of a dispenser. However, a dropper will just drop what ever is in it. This results in the bottle being unharmed.

, A dispenser likes to explode things, but the dropper is more careful.

Zombies - Zombies are slow and can only kill by punching. The easiest way to kill them is to fight back with a sword. They can turn villagers into zombie villagers.
Spiders - A spider can jump to blocks and stay hidden in their webs and can catch you by surprise. Spiders only attack at night. During the daytime, they will not burn but they will just ignore you and not hurt you just like animal mobs.

Cave spiders- They're smaller and more aggressive than normal spiders, and have venom.
Wither Skeletons- They're found only in nether fortress. They have a wither effect when hit by their stone swords.

Creative means you have unlimited resources, can break blocks instantly, and you can do anything without dying.
Survival mode is when you have limited resources and can die, being attacked by monsters, falling from height, and more. The resources you do have are the ones you collect on your own with tools, and can be easily destroyed by a nearby creeper.

,, The D-pad on the screen has five buttons: an up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, right arrow, and a circle in the center.


To move forward, press the up arrow.
To move to the left, press the left arrow.






To move to the right, press the right arrow.






To move backwards, press the down arrow.






To crouch, press the center circle twice. To stand from crouching, tap the center circle once.






To jump, press the circle on the right once.

, Raising yourself and lowering yourself uses the up and down arrows, respectively. If you want to stop flying, either lower yourself to the ground or tap the center circle twice.,


In Creative Mode, this happens instantly. In Survival Mode, it does not, and certain tools are necessary in order to harvest certain types of blocks.

,,, The place you tapped will be highlighted.

, Creative mode is much different than Survival mode, so it's possible to do things that aren't possible in Survival.

You can fly in Creative. Tap the center circle twice to do so.
You have unlimited access to anything you need, meaning you can build whatever you want. Want to make a house entirely out of rare diamond blocks? Go ahead.
In Creative mode, pressing and holding a block will break it instantly. You can even break bedrock, and fall into the void without dying.

, It's called Creative mode for a reason - do whatever you want in the world.

You don't need to worry about mobs destroying your creations. In Creative Mode, mobs that are spawned don't try to attack you, regardless of the time of day.

, You can find this around you almost immediately after you begin the game, in the form of trees. Break the blocks and make sure they get put into your inventory.

, In the upper left, there will be a button labeled ""Craft"". Tap it.

, Tap it and create the planks. These are necessary to create most things in Minecraft.

, In Minecraft PE, crafting tables require four Wooden Planks. Crafting tables are used to create the majority of materials in Minecraft. Create it and set it down somewhere.

, Food is essential to restoring your health. You can either make bread with wheat, make Mushroom Stew with mushrooms, or kill animals and cook the meat in a furnace.


Certain mobs drop certain things when they are killed. For example, sheep drop wool blocks, but they do not drop any meat. Killing a cow will give you beef and leather, which can be used later.
Make sure not to kill off all of the animals. You can breed them.

, If you plan on lasting the night, you're going to need a shelter. It doesn't have to be huge - just something that keeps the mobs out.


You can only create tools with the crafting table (with some exceptions, such as torches). Tools such as pickaxes, swords, and shovels cannot be made through your inventory. For this reason, it's a good idea to carry around a spare crafting table in case your pickaxe breaks while mining.
Wood and gold are the weakest materials for any tools. A wooden sword deals the least damage, and a wooden pickaxe can only harvest stone and coal ore. The best thing to do is to use a wooden pick to get cobblestone, and then use cobblestone for other things, such as swords, furnaces, and pickaxes to harvest iron.

, Certain mobs will be harder to fight than others, and how you fight can make it easier or harder.


For mobs that can attack from a distance, such as skeletons, it's best to use a bow and arrow. If you don't have bows and arrows, a sword will work, but swords make it necessary to run around to keep from getting killed.
Mobs such as spiders and zombies can be attacked easily with a sword. Zombies will slowly walk straight at you, so it's easy enough to hit them with a sword. Spiders leap at you, so make sure you're ready to fight them.
Keep in mind that spiders can climb walls. If your shelter is unfinished, make sure it has a roof so that spiders can't climb in.

Walk into the portal.,
Consider making a Nether Portal in a Creative world.",How to Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft PE," Before you go on an adventure in the Nether, you’ll need to ensure that you have the latest version of the game. The Nether was added in version 0.12.1 of Minecraft PE. If you didn’t enable the auto-update feature on your Android or iOS device, then you'll need to update the game through Google Play or the Apple App Store.;
, This material can be gathered with a diamond pickaxe from areas where water flows vertically into still lava. You can make obsidian by placing some water over a pool of lava, then gathering the Obsidian that forms. You will need at least 10 blocks of Obsidian.


Lava can be gathered underground, but only if it’s still (not flowing). Water can be gathered from pools of water found in the overworld.
You can craft a bucket through your crafting table for 3 iron ingots, or find them in dungeons inside chests. When you gather any liquid with a bucket (tap the lava or water lightly while the bucket is selected), the buckets containing the liquids will not stack and take up individual slots in the inventory.

, You'll need this tool to light the Nether portal. You can find Flint and Steel in dungeon chests, or you can create it from 1 Iron Ingot and 1 Flint.


Flint can be gathered from breaking gravel, though the chance to gather it is a bit low.

, If you have a diamond pickaxe and were able to mine Obsidian, place two blocks on the ground, with two random blocks at each end. Place three Obsidian blocks on top of each end, then finish the top with two more Obsidian and two random corners. You can remove the random blocks after placing the Obsidian. If you don't have a diamond pickaxe, continue through this section for instructions on creating one with just some buckets, water, and lava.The portal frame can be as large as 23x23.

, You can make a “stairway” using stacks of blocks leading to the top if you want or join them together to create an arching frame.

, The water should be flowing downwards into the ground.

, The lava is immediately converted to obsidian blocks.

, If you didn’t make the arc, place water on the top of the obsidian stacks so more water flows, then join the two stacks, adding another block of water whenever you reach a dry side.

, Wait for the area to dry off before lighting the portal

, Since this is a portal to Minecraft’s “hell” level, the portal works by setting the inside of the frame on fire. You can do this by crafting some flint and steel, which costs 1 flint and 1 iron ingot and is made on your crafting table. Select it, and tap the frame you just made. You’ll know if you did it right if the frame suddenly glows purple in the middle!


Be very, VERY careful when handling your flint and steel, since you might accidentally light everything on fire!

, Now, simply walk into the shimmering purple surface and wait for the Nether to load. Walk off the frame once you see a fiery red hell scape, and try not to land on fire or lava! There’s quite a bit to explore here, and while it’s quite hazardous, it’s also pretty rewarding!


You must be even more careful with your flint and steel in the Nether, since you can set Netherrack on fire, and this fire never goes out! While this is good if you want to make a fireplace, it’s not so good if you accidentally set the surrounding area of your Portal on fire.
Don’t immediately go hunting for the native Pigmen, since they tend to swarm around you when they “see” one of them get attacked and pack quite a wallop! The same goes for most of the other mobs here, so at the very least, make sure you’re fully equipped with a complete set of iron armor!
Mushrooms tend to thrive here, making it an excellent farm to grow them in, but you can’t place any water in here, making regular farming useless. You can also plant trees and flowers here if you want to, as long as you place it on dirt blocks.

, Making the Portal in Creative world allows you to quickly make and test it without having to mine the materials or worry about danger.


When you create a Nether Portal in Creative mode, you can switch the world to Survival after it’s made. This will allow you to use the Portal in Survival mode without having to worry about building it.
With this game mode switch feature, it’s also possible to create Nether portals in any of the Creative or Survival Worlds that you created prior to the update.

, There are lots of websites online that act as listings for various Minecraft PE servers that you can connect to. Different servers will have different game modes, and varying player counts. Some of the most popular listing sites include:


Listforge - minecraftpocket-servers.com
MCPE Hub - mcpehub.com/servers
MCPE Universe - mcpeuniverse.com/pocketmine/

, If you're already in a game, return to the title screen.

, By default, your player name will be ""Steve."" Most servers will kick people with the same name, so if you don't change your name you're likely to get kicked when someone else joins.

, This will open the world selection screen.

, You'll find this button in the upper-right corner.

, This is at the top of the screen, next to the ""Advanced"" button.


If you don't see this button, your Minecraft PE app needs to be updated. Open your App Store or Google Play Store and update the app from its store page.

, This can be anything you'd like, as the server will also display its official name in the world list.

, You'll find this on the server listing page. It may be a set of numbers, or a more traditional web address. Make sure you type the address exactly as displayed on the listing page.


Make sure that the server is running the same version as your game. Servers usually run the latest version available, so update your app if you haven't recently.
If the server address has a colon followed by a number, this is the port (e.g. "":19132""). Don't include this with the server address.

, Most Minecraft PE servers will run on port 19132. You'll only need to change this if the server listing specifies something different. If the listing doesn't specify a port, you can leave it as is.

, This will add the server to your world list, but it will not be displayed immediately.

, After adding the server, you'll be taken back to the New World screen. Press Back to return to the world list.

, If you have a lot of worlds, you may have to scroll to find it. If the server is online and entered correctly, it will have a green indicator and show how many players are connected.


It may take a moment for the server to load its information.
If the server doesn't load properly, check that you entered the server address correctly.

, If the server isn't full and you entered the information correctly, you'll be connected to the server. Most servers will have a starting area where you can get acquainted with the server rules.


Note: If you and another player on your same local network try to join a server, one of the players will not be able to connect. This is because the server sees both you and the other player as the same IP address. There is no easy way around this, short of setting up a VPN for the second player. See Connect to a VPN for information on finding and connecting to a VPN from an Android or iOS device.

Watch YouTube videos.",How to Make a Cool House in Minecraft Pocket Edition," Wood is harvested from trees, and planks can be made from the wood using the crafting table. Wood is a great basic material because it is cheap and easy to find in many biomes.;
, Stone is a common block, largely found underground and making up mountains. If mined using pickaxe, you can get cobblestone instead, which looks slightly different.


You can even make a basic stone generator (using glass, lava, and water), if you don't feel like mining for stone or cobblestone.

, Quartz comes from building a Nether Reactor in Minecraft PE. This makes the blocks expensive in Survival Mode, but if you want to bring some white color into your buildings, it's the best way.

, Sand is a common natural block, usually found near water or in desert biomes. This is an easy way to add beige into your color scheme and it's cheap if you're not wanting to invest too much time.

, Coal is a material that you'll have to mine, but it's pretty common. This is the easiest way to bring black into your color scheme. Remember that you'll have to smelt the coal from ore, and the original blocks look very much like spotted cobblestone. Don't miss them!

, You can build a basic house that resembles your real life home or any cliché looking house. Using stairs to make a roof and avoiding pure box shapes can help a lot in making even a basic house look really nice.

, Using cobblestone or regular stone, make yourself a castle complete with dungeon. You can even use Green wool to make yourself a giant dragon to slay! Look at pictures of real medieval castles to get ideas on the layout you want.


Fences are useful for making turrets at the tops of towers.

, Using a few tricks, you can make an underwater house in Minecraft PE. Simply build the walls up to the water's surface, fill the inside with dirt, seal the house, and then remove the dirt.

, Flex your creativity and create a super modern house. You can use the clean box lines and walls of glass panes to create a very cool looking house. These look great perched on a cliff.

, Bring out the ""mine"" in Minecraft and build yourself a Bat Cave. You can even include a waterfall entrance. Batmobile not included...unless you build that too.


Building a mansion over the cave can add even more fun. Use redstone or other clever tricks (command blocks, if you hack your game) to make things like an elevator that takes you down to the cave.

, Build a giant tree and then make yourself a house that either hugs around the trunk and branches or actually fits inside the trunk itself. You can even make a whole village this way and use it to hang out with your friends.

, Use quartz and column blocks to make a cool Roman palace. You can even build a temple to yourself inside! Don't forget a pool out front and a road lined with Cypress trees to seal the deal!

, It's not a small building project by any means, but who wouldn't want to have their own Hogwarts to have adventures in. Make classrooms, the Great Hall, your house's dorm, the greenhouse, the library, and any other parts of the castle you can't live without. Don't forget the lake out front and the Quidditch pitch!

, Build a skyscraper and fill it with apartments. You can use mods to add command blocks and use the command block to build an elevator that takes you to your apartment. You don't have to fill out every apartment of course. Maybe a few for your friends...but save the penthouse for yourself!

, Build yourself a pirate ship and live aboard! Remember that the bigger you make the boat, the more detail you can create. Just be careful not to get scurvy!


Glass panes make good sails for a pirate ship.

, Use different colored blocks to mark the different parts of your foundation. For example, use blue wool to mark the corners of your walls and red wool to mark the locations for redstone circuits. Place these blocks in the first ground layer so that you can build right on top of them. This lets you make sure that everything is lined up and can also help you figure out how much material you need.

, Build houses using materials that you can easily gather. Otherwise, be ready to invest in a long project. This can be fun though! Just play in a way that's fun for you.

, Always, always, always build the exterior walls first. This is often the hardest part of building, so getting it done first will help keep you motivated to finish. It's also important for keeping everything lined up and looking good. This is how real life building works too!


Building the exterior first also has the added benefit of letting you get the ceilings up, which means you get to stay out of the rain and snow.

, You can really build a cool house in just about any shape you want. All you have to do to make it cool is make it not boring! You can do this by avoiding blocky overall shapes to your house (having one giant square or rectangle) and also by avoiding too-flat walls. Use outcroppings, towers, and wings to make your house more interesting. You should also break up the colors of the outside walls and ceiling. Having everything in just one color makes it look like a blob!

, Another key part of making a house interesting is to make sure that you don't neglect the landscaping. A cool house in the middle of a completely empty plain is pretty boring. Make any house more interesting by adding a garden, lake, street, or other decorations to keep the environment looking cool.

, You can find a number of pre-made building plans online, showing you exactly how to make all sorts of different buildings yourself. This is great for beginners, who haven't gotten used to the materials available to them yet.



Minecraft Building Inc is one great example.

, There are a couple of sites on the net that will let you create your own building plans, drawing out exactly what materials should go where. The most common site for this is MineDraft.

, There are loads of videos on YouTube that show you how to build cool houses and other fun structures. Spend some time exploring and getting ideas for what other people have made.

, Hold down on your screen where the creeper is and release your finger after about 5 seconds. Don't worry if you miss, you can collect this afterwards.

Kick back!",How to Live Your Life Out in Minecraft," Punch that tree to the ground. If you spawn in a desert, get out immediately. Once you have as much wood as needed, proceed onward.;
, Use it to make a stone pickaxe and other tools you may need. During your day, time is essential. Mine twenty cobble. Keep your wooden pick. you're going to make good use of it soon.

, Kill any animals you see. Don't forget to eat.

, Find a mountain or something, and start digging into it. If you can't find a mountain, then dig into the ground. Never dig straight down.

, Start smelting your food and iron. Use your coal as fuel.

, While your food and iron are cooking, grab your pick and start mining. If you mine into a cave, immediately block off the tunnel. Who knows what might be waiting for you in the cave.

, Take your iron and craft tools with it. The tools will come in handy, as you will not want your tools to break. Any extra iron may go towards a set of Iron Armor, Wait 10-15 seconds after the sun has rose before running out of your temporary base. This ensures that all zombies and skeletons are dead. Exit sprinting. Sometimes a creeper might be waiting for you outside that door. Creeper explosion to the face will probably take you out.

, Make sure you know your coordinates. A bed now would be nice.

, Make sure you have some torches with you. An iron pick will be very helpful. Bring a stack of torches to light your path ahead. Make sure you bring a lot of torches, as you don't want to run out of torches quickly. Aim for a minimum of 3 diamonds.


Done mining? Time to get out. If you're a risk taker, you can dig straight up. Every time you stop, make sure to place a torch. Falling gravel can suffocate and kill you. Also, be aware of hazards such as lava or water.

, Make a diamond pick and a bucket. A bow might be nice. Keep all the arrows you can find. Fill the bucket with water. Now go find a lava pool and pour water on it to make obsidian. Mine ten or fourteen obsidian (depending on if you want the corner pieces or not).

, Try to enchant your diamond pickaxe with Efficiency or other enchantments you want. Enchant your iron tools and armor with level 1 or 2 enchants.

, Use that 10 obsidian you have to do so. Find a blaze spawner and kill a few blaze. Make sure you have ten or so blaze rods. Go back to the overworld.

,, When you have 15 ender pearls, go back to your house and craft some ender eyes.

, Before you jump in, always make sure you have a lot of arrows. At least 4-5 stacks.

, First, take out all the Ender Crystals on the obsidian pillars. Those heal the dragon. You can shoot arrows at them or punch them, but they blow up when destroyed and will most likely kill you. This is the hard part.


Now all you have to do is lob arrows at the dragon. Fairly simple.
Collect the egg and go back to the overworld. Pushing the egg with a piston will break it. Making it fall on a torch will also work.

, It will be very hard! Make sure you have some nice diamond gear with some good enchants. Potions are good but not necessary.


Go to the nether and murder a few wither skeletons. Get at least 3 wither skulls. This will take a while. The wither skeletons hurt, and the if you aren't careful, the wither effect will kill you.
Get 4 soul sand. Then get to the overworld.
Make sure you spawn the wither away from your house. It will blow up a lot of things.
Spawn the wither in by placing the soul sand in a T-formation and the three wither heads on top.
Run for your life, the moment you place the last head. Once the wither's health bar is full, the terrain around it will blow up. Shoot it with a bow. Once it gets down to around half health, it becomes immune to bows. Smack it with your sword a few times to finish it off.

, After this, you've pretty much finished. There's not much you can do after this.

, If you are playing in a Minecraft server, you may want to block off the surface entrance and set your home underground in the base. This will lessen your chances of being griefed.

, You can craft them by combining coal and wood. If you prefer charcoal, see Get Charcoal Instead of Coal in Minecraft. For mining coal and other things such as diamonds, see How To Mine in Minecraft. If you don't have a crafting table, this is how to make one.


Punch a tree. Then collect the wood.
Open your inventory and make wooden planks from the wood.
Make as many wooden planks as you need for the craft table(s).

, You should craft a bed (optional). If this is your basement or escape route, it is still helpful to have your bed here because the Mobs are less likely to find you. See Craft a Bed in Minecraft for more info.

, Add a furnace, which is made of cobblestone, and an extra crafting table.

Prepare yourself.,
Spawn the wither.,
Do not fight the Wither initially.,
Attack!",How to Kill the Wither in Minecraft," The Wither is a high hitting boss, so arm yourself with as high as armor as you can get. Full diamond armor (that is leveled up as much as you can) is recommended, but it can take an extremely long time to find 24 diamonds, so partial iron may be substituted. However, the Wither can take massive amounts of damage, so a diamond sword or a bow with as high of an enchantment possible is recommended. You can also gather some friends to help you.;
, Visit the Nether to collect 4 blocks of Soul Sand. Arrange these in the shape of a ""T"". Then you must obtain 3 Wither Skeleton Skulls, which are rarely dropped by Wither Skeletons. They will spawn naturally in nether fortresses. Be careful when fighting it, as it can do a lot of damage as well as inflicting the Wither effect. It will take a while to obtain the three skulls, since the drop chance is only 2.5%, increasing by 1% for each level of Looting.

, When the Wither first spawns, it will be at half its health, so it may be tempting to try to attack it. However, the Wither is invulnerable to damage during this period, and will rapidly start regenerating its health, so any attacks will be useless. Also, it will explode after reaching full health, so make sure you back away a good distance.

, Beware of the flying skulls, as they will explode and cause damage, as well as inflicting the Wither effect. This effect will drain your health much like Poison, but is capable of killing you and will turn your hearts black. Stay away from the Wither, and shoot it with your bow while dodging the projectiles. If you can, jump while fighting the Wither. This will allow you to do critical hits, which do a lot more damage. Also, the wither will attack all mobs except undead ones (zombies and skeletons), so fight near a lot of them or spawn mobs like snow golems to distract it. After its health has been decreased to half, it will activate the Wither Armor effect, making it immune to arrows. In this state, it will stop flying and come directly at you, allowing you to hit it with a sword.

Gather your materials.,
Find a protected place to build your portal.,
Store water in cauldrons.,
Clear out everything that you have at your old house.",How to Live in the Nether in Minecraft1," Be sure to build with materials that are not flammable, because there is a lot of fire in the nether. Some good materials to use are cobblestone, anything made of stone, or blocks made of iron or gold.;
, To get to the nether and back, you'll need a portal. Make sure to build this in your house, to always be protected from the mobs. Also, this will help make sure that no mobs from the nether enter your portal and appear in the overworld.

, You cannot place water in the nether unless you use ice blocks, so you can store it in a cauldron. To keep safe when burning, hop into a cauldron and you'll be cool. You can also use these to store water to craft things with or brew.

, You will need all of your materials that you have, because you can't find any of them in the nether. Because of this, you'll want to bring lots of dirt, water, sand, plants, and lots of saplings to grow trees.

"
"
Locate a village.,
Build your house in or near the village.,
Create a large wall around the village.,
Light the village and and the surrounding area.,
Create more iron golems to protect the village.

,
Consider adding traps.,
Add on to the village.",How to Live in a Village in Minecraft," The following method can increase your chances of finding one:


Write down the seed you are using by using the /seed command.
Create a new world on superflat with the same seed . Preferably on creative.
Find a village and write down the coordinates.
Go to those coordinates on your other world.;
, You will want a clear shot of it so you can shoot any zombies attacking. Make it however you want, but you might want to use an iron door so villagers don't invade your home.


You can also occupy an already existing house in the village.

, Zombies won't be able to enter, but don't forget about the other mobs that can harm you. Make it cobblestone or better, at least three blocks high with at least one block overhang.

, This will prevent some monster spawning.

,, Traps like cannons and deep pits into cactus or lava are a great way to get mob drops. Don't forget to keep it villager friendly as they can fall in the trap.

, Trade with the villagers and protect them.

"
"
Make a wall of glass.,
Place your dirt and water near the window.,
Lead cows, pigs, and sheep through the nether portal.,
Plant your crops.",How to Live in the Nether in Minecraft2," This is what will bring in the light of the lava, which works as sunlight.

, You will not need grass for this.

, You cannot lead dogs through, but these animals can be lead to your new nether farm.

, It might take longer for them to grow in the nether, but they eventually will.

"
"
Avoid sleeping in a bed in the nether.,
Create a strong doorway.,
Dig into a mountain.,
Add windows into your home.,
Add grass for the animals.,
Bring lots of bows, arrows, and blocks with you.,
Bring a horse with you through the nether portal.",How to Live in the Nether in Minecraft3," It might seem fine at first, but when you click the bed, it will instantly explode. You wouldn't even be able to sleep when you are in the nether, as it is never nighttime.

, If you are going to be creating a doorway to the outside of the nether, then a good door to create is a pressure plate piston door. This way, you won't have to deal with clicking on anything.

, This is the easiest way to create a home. Simply replace the walls with something a little bit more sturdy, and you are good to go.

, Some might think that nether windows are not the best idea, but they do help you spot mobs, and they are not easily broken by ghasts. When they are broken, simply move the window to another place.

, If you bring animals down, you might want to invest in getting a silk touch tool and mining some grass. This will help the animals grow and eat healthy when they are in the nether.

, You'll most likely be fighting ghasts alot, and you will build bridges more than you may think.

, There are lots of horse armor pieces to be found in the chests of the nether fortress. Might as well take advantage of it. Horses will also help you travel faster on long trips on bridges. However, be sure not to forget to bring apples with you for food for the horse.

Send the Villager in a place far from the village.,
Trap a villager in cacti.,
Spawn zombies.",How to Kill Villagers Easily in Minecraft," Villagers are attracted to pumpkins, so put one down, then build a deep hole around it (as deep as you can). Then sit back and watch as the villagers fall to their doom!;
, Put a bunch of TNT around him and make it explode! The Iron Golem will die or at least take a lot of damage (so you can easily kill it with a sword), leaving you to kill the villagers in any way you can think of.

, Iron Golems like giving children flowers, so spawn an Iron Golem and a Villager Child, but before you do, make a deep 1x3 hole with lava in the bottom and put a pumpkin behind it. The child will be attracted to the pumpkin and run for it, making it fall in the hole. The Iron Golem will Chase it,and it too will fall.

, When it does, the Iron Golem will be too busy killing monsters to care about you. So sneak into the villagers' houses at night and kill them!

, If villagers are far from Iron Golems, those mobs don't attack you and you can kill a Villager without getting attacked.

, Remember cacti can't be placed next to other blocks(including itself) and cacti can only be placed on sand

, Remember, you can't spawn zombies in the daytime, so wait until night.

Collect your ultimate prize.,
Keep the dragon egg as a trophy.",How to Kill the Ender Dragon in Minecraft1," You can't craft the end portal frame, as you must find a stronghold first.


You find this by throwing Eyes of Ender (1 ender pearl + 1 blaze powder ). You will need quite a few. Approximately 9-10 to throw, and 1-10 to actually find the portal. When you throw it, they will fly in the direction of the stronghold. If it keeps landing in one spot, you've found the stronghold. You'll should consider bringing more than 10, because the ender eyes have a 1 in 5 chance of breaking.
If you need help getting eyes of ender, first learn how to make one, and kill endermen with a tool enchanted with loot as this is a rarer mob.;
, Do look around because there are chests that may contain useful things like food, armor, or ingots (to craft swords or armor).

, You'll definitely need it.

, If your bow has the infinity enchantment, then you'll only need one arrow.

, Usually, there are a few Eyes of Ender inside some of the frames, so you won't need all 12.

, Stand there and shoot her with a bow and arrow then attack with your sword when she's there.Before you shoot her, there are special blocks called crystals on obsidian pillars that heal the mob. Destroy them if possible. If you don't know how, try this: ]


,, It drops a lot of XP so you can have a lot of enchanting power approximately 60-100 levels, and in the upcoming 1.9 update, you can ""mend"" your tools automatically using XP.

, What is that thing on the top? That is the dragon egg. It is kind of hard to obtain if you don't know how. One way takes a while. You can click on it as if you are obtaining it, but it teleports away. You can keep finding it to obtain it. Once you have done it enough, it will eventually drop as a resource. Or a shorter way is to just place a torch under the block the egg is on the break the block. The egg then drops.

, By clicking the egg in the OverWorld, will create particles and endermen, ender chests, and more. You can keep it as a decoration or like a trophy. Many think of it as a ultimate prize, sometimes below the Wither.

Select a location.,
Mitigate any risk and to enclose the Wither into a safe area.,
Summon the troops.,
Seal them up.,
Time for battle.",How to Kill the Wither in Minecraft Without Taking a Hit," There are multiple options but typically there are a few things you want to watch out for. Firstly, Lava is not your friend. this can result in the worst case a loss of the nether star and a waste of your three wither skulls. While you can build underground, the safest bet is to take it on at the surface. In particular look for a large patch of gravel, these are often found on the tops of some areas of extreme hills biomes. The gravel is useful since there is then very little risk of the Wither blowing a hole under your feet and making you fall down a chasm to your death.;
, You could make a box out of something which is extremely blast resistant, furnaces or obsidian work well enough. The box will need double thick walls, so make a box of obsidian with external dimensions of 7 x 7 x 7 and internal dimensions of 3 x 3 x 3. Leave the roof off for now. Make sure that it includes a double thick floor to ensure everything works as planned.

, This will require 108 iron blocks.But first build the soul sand part of the wither and add the 2 side heads, leave the middle one off.  Now build a platform which is level with the top of your obsidian ""killbox"" and construct the first iron golem. Then push the golem (without hitting him) into the killbox and make sure he falls into the bottom. Repeat this method until you have 3 very cramped iron golems stuck in the box right next to the wither.

, Cover the roof in the first layer of obsidian leaving a single empty block in the middle. Now build up the last layer and leave the middle block empty and a single block on the opposite side to the wither. This will allow you to crouch and just place on the wither head when you're ready.

, First, throw in a splash potion of regeneration, followed by a splash potion of strength. This will give the Golems a fighting chance. Now put the last wither head in place and stand aside. Get your bow at the ready in case something goes wrong, You don't want a stray wither following you around the world. So what happens now is, the wither will anger the iron golems with its initial explosion which will then start pulverizing the Wither. The wither should be dead within a few short moments, typically around 6 seconds. This will damage the obsidian box, sometimes to the point where the golems will be set free, if you want to reuse the box for future wither kills, then stop the golems from escaping with simple cobble walls so they can be ushered back in later. Another tactic which works if you have fast hands is to keep dumping splash potions of healing into the box from the top, these will hurt the wither while healing your golems. Although this is risky if the Wither pops the block you're standing on you're going to fall in and its your only hope is to not attack (since you will end up enraging the golems).

, By moving frequently in any fight, it makes you more difficult to hit. Try to take on Herobrine in an area that allows you to move easily without too make obstructions.

, Some potions can be really helpful in taking on Herobrine, regardless of which mod you have. A couple of useful potions include:


Strong strength potions, made using Nether wart, blaze powder, and glowstone dust
Negative effect potions in splashable form (to use on Herobrine), such as weakness potions, poisons, or slowness potions.

, Mob traps come in many different varieties. You'll have to choose one that you can afford, is suitable to the area you're in, and which can affect the version of Herobrine you have. Different mods will have different weaknesses for Herobrine, so you'll have to figure out what traps will affect him.

, Killing With Bugbites is a great technique for fighting Herobrine. Get up a tree or in another safe location and then chip away at his health. You can also use the bows and arrows while fighting on foot: just keep moving!

, Beacons will give you a benefit if you take on Herobrine in that area. When built to maximum strength, you can choose status effects that can help you defeat Herobrine with ease. The best choices would be either strength or resistance.

, Never take on Herobrine in an area that you don't know well. You need to be able to run around and attack him without worrying about what's around you. You should also always have a plan. Know how you're going to use your environment. Basically, take the fight seriously and you'll already have an advantage.

Rest easy.,
Stop listening to trolls.,
Look at the code.,
Listen to Notch.",How to Kill Herobrine in Minecraft2," Herobrine is not real, has never been real, and will never be real. Herobrine is a myth or urban legend among Minecraft players, used to scare new or young players. If you believe that Herobrine is real, someone tricked you. If you think you've seen Herobrine, you were mistaken or an admin on your server was playing a trick on you. You cannot get Herobrine in your game without modding the game.


This of course also means that all the urban legends about what Herobrine can do to you in real life aren't true either. He won't come out of the computer and haunt you if you leave it on at night, etc, etc.

, Many of the ""signs"" of Herobrine are easily faked. Don't take someone at their word that their game is unmodded. Don't get spooked if you see them in your own game either. Admins can change their skins, how their name displays, and do things like teleport to players and destroy vast areas in order to spook you. This is a sort of hazing or bullying and if someone tells you Herobrine is real, they aren't being very nice to you.

, The code of a game is like the game's DNA. Kind of like how you can't have wings because it's not in your DNA, a game can't have content that's not in the code. There's always a trail with code. Nothing can hide from people that know what they're doing. Do you think that if the character was really there, that someone wouldn't have proven it in the code by now? Herobrine can only appear through the use of mods, which introduce new code to the game.

, Notch, the creator of the game, has stated on multiple occasions that Herobrine is not real and will not be real.Since he makes a lot of his money from kids playing and loving the game, do you really think he'd add in something that would scare them away?

, This won't hurt it, they always teleport before the arrow hits, but it will provoke the Enderman to attack you in melee.

, Looking down at its feet will prevent it from teleporting away. Eye contact will make it teleport.

Fish for raw fish.,
Tame an ocelot.,
Protect your base with cat guards.",How to Kill a Creeper in Minecraft1," Make a fishing pole from three sticks and two pieces of string.Use it next to a body of water and right-click when you notice a trail heading toward your lure.Keep at it until you get raw fish.


The fish trail will not appear if particles are set to the lowest setting.
An enchantment table can improve your fishing rod.;
, Feed the raw fish to an ocelot to turn it into a tamed cat that will follow you wherever you go unless told otherwise. If you have one or more Cats following you around, creepers will run away from you before they can explode.


Ocelots are most often found above sea level on grass or leaves in jungle biomes., One cool strategy is telling a circle of cats to sit around the edges of your buildings. If the cats are close enough together, no Creepers will be able to even come close. Then you can safely shoot the creeper with a bow, or just ignore it.

"
"
Make a pit trap.,
Suffocate the creeper.,
Blow them up with TNT.,
Burn the terrain in front of it.,
Fish for creepers.,
Lead a creeper to a skeleton.",How to Kill a Creeper in Minecraft2," Make a staircase with a wide entrance, about 4 x 4 blocks, so it's easier to lure the creeper into it. Have this lead to a pit 23 blocks deep, with ladders on the opposite wall. Lead the creeper here, then climb up to the surface while the creeper falls to its death.


A diamond shovel might be fast enough to dig a small pit trap even while you are being chased, but this is a risky tactic.

, If you can get above the creeper, you can drop two blocks of sand or gravel on the creeper, which has a good chance of killing it before it can escape. Some people make suffocation traps and lead the creepers into them, triggering a sticky piston to push a block onto the creeper's head, suffocating it.


The lava variation is a more effective method, but risks setting fire to your surroundings.

, First, use another method to kill creepers, then gather gunpowder from their bodies to use their own weapon against them. Craft TNT from five pieces of gunpowder and four blocks of sand or red sand.This explosive does exactly what you would expect, and can be set off using redstone or from contact with fire or lava.


Make sure the button or lever that sets off the TNT is a safe distance away.
The TNT will destroy the ground where it blew up, so you will either have to fix the whole trap each time or set it up in a new area.

, You can set up a path of flammable terrain, or just find it naturally occurring. Run away from the creeper backwards, while using your flint and steel to set the ground on fire. This will slowly burn the creeper to death as it walks over the flaming ground.


Mine gravel to find flint, then craft it with an iron ingot to make flint and steel., Yes, you really can lift enemies up with a fishing pole. Get on a hill above the creeper and go fishing, then drop it to deal damage. Repeat until the creeper is dead.


Fishing rods are made from sticks and string, which you can find by killing spiders.

, Getting between a skeleton and a creeper sounds like a terrible place to be, and it is. However, if you can get a skeleton's arrow to hit a creeper, it will drop a music disc, which can be played in jukeboxes.


Some other enemies will attack creepers as well, but do not cause it to drop a music disc.

Obtain a bow.,
Keep your distance.,
Shoot it three times.,
Build a dirt tower.,
Create arrow holes or a roof post.,
Enchant your bow.",How to Kill a Creeper in Minecraft3," If you don't have one already, there are several ways to get one:Craft one from 3 sticks and 3 pieces of string. (String can be obtained from spiders.)
Skeletons have a small chance to drop a bow when killed.
Fishing has a small chance to snag a bow.
Fletcher villagers will give you a bow in exchange for emeralds.

, If a nearby creeper surprises you, turn and run. The advantage to using the bow is killing the creeper from well outside its blast radius, so there's no danger of it exploding next to you.


Climbers will sometimes follow you upward if you climb, so make sure you have an escape route before jumping up a tree.

, Three hits should be the most you need to kill a creeper in Normal mode, assuming you draw the bow back far enough.

, If you keep a large stack of dirt in your quick item slots, drop them rapidly underneath you while jumping and you'll soon create a dirt tower. From here you can safely shoot creepers below you, as long as you are at least six blocks above it (eight blocks above the ground).

, Protect your shelter by making a hole beneath your windows, so you can crouch and shoot arrows. Alternatively, make a roof outpost where you can shoot anything that comes near.

, If you have access to an enchantment table, you might try enchanting your bow. Depending on the enchantment, this could increase your bow's damage, knock your targets further back, set your targets on fire, or give you unlimited arrows.

"
"
Sprint forward before hitting it.,
Run back and forth to get hits in.,
Make a barrier.,
Fight underwater.,
Trigger an explosion.,
Improve your sword.",How to Kill a Creeper in Minecraft4," Sprint by double tapping the forward key, to rush toward the creeper. While sprinting, your attacks knock back enemies.


Sprinting is not possible at low health or high hunger.

, An iron sword takes three hits to kill a creeper in Normal mode, but if you try to hit it three times in a row, you'll probably get killed. Instead, retreat after the first hit, then sprint in again two more times, or until the creeper dies.


Never come close while the creeper is blinking and hissing. This signals that it is almost ready to explode.
A wooden, gold, or stone sword takes four hits to kill a creeper. Tools or bare hands can take even more.

, If you set up a fence or other barrier that blocks movement but not sight, this makes retreating during the combat much easier. If you're quick and notice the creeper from a distance, you may be able to set up a short fence before it approaches.

, Water nullifies the explosion, so if you can lure the creeper into a body of water, you are usually safe. Stay under the surface whenever you are next to the creeper, and it will usually be unable to hurt you at all. Block its attacks with a sword if you want to be a little safer.


A creeper can drown in deep water.

, If you time it perfectly, you can trigger an explosion, but run away before it can deal you damage. This is a risky tactic, but if you encounter a group of creepers, a single explosion should kill them all. Consider trying this if you meet several creepers at once and don't have a bow.


If the creepers are spread out, first move in a large circle around them to herd them into one small group.
The creeper will first hiss and blink when you get close, but won't commit to the explosion until it starts flashing white.

, A diamond sword still takes three hits to kill a creeper, so it's not an improvement over iron in this case. Upgrading from anything else to iron, however, is highly recommended. Enchantment tables also provide a way to improve your weapon, potentially adding more damage, knockback, or the ability to set enemies on fire.

Kill a blaze in the nether.,
Craft a brewing stand.,
Turn potions into splash potions.",How to Kill a Creeper in Minecraft5," This will sometimes drop a blaze rod. If you have not yet been to the nether, this is probably the most complicated way possible to kill a creeper. Try focusing on a different method instead.

, Craft three cobblestone and a blaze rod together to make a brewing stand, which lets you make potions., There are many potions you can make from water bottles and other ingredients. Once you discover one that deals damage or gives negative effects, craft it with gunpowder to make splash potions, which can be thrown at enemies for the same effect.

Visit a Minecraft IP list website.,
Copy the IP address for the server you want to join.,
Open the Minecraft multiplayer menu.,
Paste the IP address into the text box.,
Add servers to your server list for easy connection in the future.",How to Join a Minecraft Server1," In Minecraft, to join an online game server, you need to know its IP address, which is a numerical code that computers use to find and identify each other over the internet. Luckily, there are several sites online that list the IP addresses for popular servers. A few high-quality sites are listed below:


minecraftservers.orgminecraft-server-list.comtopg.org/Minecraft;
, Usually, on Minecraft IP list websites, you will see a list of servers with either short descriptions for the type of game being played on the server or a link to the server's website. When you find a server you want, copy the IP address to your computer's clipboard.


To do this, select the text you want to copy, then press:

Windows: Ctrl + C

Mac: Command + C

, Launch Minecraft on your computer. Click ""Multiplayer"" on first screen. You will see several choices: ""Direct Connect"", ""Add Server,"" ""Join Server,"" and more. For now, click ""Direct Connect.""

, After this, press ""Join Server"" and the game should load. If you get an error message like ""Outdated server"" or ""Connection failed"" and you're sure that your internet connection is working, there may be a technical issue on the server's end. It's not uncommon for servers to go down and for their information not to be reflected on the IP list sites, so don't worry — just select another server and try again.


To past text from the clipboard, press:

Windows: Ctrl + V

Mac: Command + V

, Once you find a few good servers that you want to play in frequently, it can be annoying to have to copy and paste the IP addresses every time you switch servers. To get around this, return to the multiplayer screen and click ""Add Server."" On the next screen, input the IP address for the server you want to save and give it a name. Click ""Done"" when you're finished.


Once you do this, the server you choose will be added to your list of preferred servers and you'll be able to see it in your multiplayer menu. In the future, you can join it by clicking it and hitting ""Join Server.""

You can find these on similar IP address list sites that contain information on a huge number of game servers for Minecraft PE. Below are just a few trustworthy sites you may want to try:


minecraftpocket-servers.com/mcpestats.com/, When you find a server that looks like it will be hosting the type of game you want to play, copy down the IP address. You will need it to connect to the game.


Since you're not on a computer, you may not be able to copy and paste it from your clipboard (though many smartphones have this feature.) If all else fails, just write it down on a slip of paper.

, Launch the game on your mobile device. On the first screen, click ""Play."" This will take you to a screen that displays your current list of servers.

, Click ""Edit"" in the top right of the screen. Then, click the ""External"" button that appears next to it. This will take you to a screen where you can input information for the server you want to join.

, In the box labeled ""address"", type in (or paste) the IP address for the server you want to join. Give the server a name (for instance, you might want to choose one that describes the game mode: ""Survival,"" etc.). When you're finished, click ""Add Server.""

Wait for the game invitation.",How to Join a Minecraft Server3," Connecting to a game with other people works a little differently than in the methods above when you're playing Minecraft on XBox 360, XBox One, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. Console versions of Minecraft don't use an IP address system. Instead, you must get personally invited into a game by another player (or make your own game and invite others.)


If you none of your friends play Minecraft, the best place to find people to invite you to games is on Minecraftforum.net.Here, players who want to host servers make posts with their XBox or PlayStation IDs so that you can add them as a contact.
To find games that are applicable to you, visit the forums and scroll down until you see the name of the system you are using. Under the ""Multiplayer"" subheader, click ""Servers."" On the next page, browse the individual posts to find a game that appeals to you.

, Once you've found a post for a game that you want to join, record the username of the person hosting the game. Start your game console and send a friend request to this person. The way you do this is slightly different for each console — see below:



Our article on how to make friends on XBox Live (for XBox 360 and Xbox One.)

Sony's guide on how to add friends on PS3Sony's guide on how to add friends on PS4, Once you send a friend request to the game host, it's up to him or her to actually invite you to the game. Be patient — this may take a while depending on what the other person is doing at the time.

You must have already run Minecraft once with the target version (loading world is not necessary). If you haven't already, do it now.

,,, Click Play.

,,

,,,,


In Windows XP, Vista or 7, Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > Run and type ""%AppData%"" without quotes. There should be a folder named "".minecraft"" (with full stop at the start). Open it. Find and open the folder called ""mods"". This should be empty. Move your mod file into it.
In Windows 8, Search for ""Run"" and do the same as above
In Windows 8.1 and 10, right-click the Start button, click Run and do the same as above.

,, The loading process will take considerably longer: This is normal.

, Your mod should be listed in the list: If it isn't check that you've done everything correctly. If you have then check the Minecraft Forum thread/website for any special installation instructions or problems. Try using a different version of the mod.

,,, Check if there is any bug or conflict (only when 2 or more mods). If there is a bug then report it. If there is a conflict, move to the next section of this guide..

,, This means one is trying to use data that is also used by the other.

,


If MC crashes, then find the report by accessing your /mods/ folder again. This time, go to the folder called ""crash-reports"" and find the .txt file. If it contains something like ""Mod is trying to use XXX but it is used by Another Mod"" then you have a conflict.
If MC does not crash, but during gameplay, you find a strange out-of place block (like Iron Bars in the middle of the underground with nothing around), then probably you have a conflict.

, To solve, either you can use a tool like ""MCPatcher,"" in which case you can refer to the instructions given or you can fiddle around with configs manually:


Access your /mods/ folder again. This time, go into the folder ""configs"" and find the files for your conflicting mods.
There will normally be a section with block/item names and some numbers; if there isn't ask for help.
Find two numbers which are exactly the same. If there aren't any then you don't have a conflict.
Change one of the numbers so that it does not conflict with anything and save.
It is solved! Yippee!

1 stick;
, If you already have your raw materials, skip straight to the next step. If you don't know how to make wood into wooden planks, and finally, into sticks, read on.


Craft wooden planks out of wood. One block of wood, crafted, will turn into 4 wooden planks. In order to make one sign, you'll therefore need at least 2 blocks of wood to craft.
Craft sticks out of two wooden planks. Place two wooden planks in a vertical line on your crafting table to yield 4 sticks.

,, The wooden planks should occupy both the middle and upper third of the workbench grid.

, Take the sign and make as many signs as you'd like, given your raw materials.

, If you place it on the ground, floor, a stick will appear anchoring the sign to the ground. Place the sign on a wall and no stick will appear. The sign will also be placed in the direction you're facing; for example, if you're facing in a diagonal direction while placing the sign, it will face that way.


You can place a sign on any of the following items: any block, including fences, glass, other signs, minecart tracks, and even chests (while sneaking).
If you place a sign underwater, a water bubble will escape after placement. You can use this air bubble to breathe underwater.

, Once you place your sign, a text box will appear. This text box has four lines, each of which can hold 15 characters for a grand total of 60 characters.


Once you complete the text of the sign, the only way to edit the text is to destroy the sign and place it again.

, Liquids such as water and lava cannot pass through a space occupied by a sign, making signs particularly useful as a water stopper (if, for example, you encounter an air pocket underwater and want to block off the flow of water).


Signs can also be used for the arms of a sofa. Craft two steps and place two signs on either side of the steps for a couch or chair.

Make sure that you have all of the mechanisms listed above (BCD, display, input station, prog.,
Modify your BCD to become suitable for the internet.,
Copy/paste, hopefully with worldedit otherwise, remake a BCD of the same type, but this time hook the wires up to that second bus going over the output lines of the user BCD, and these lines will be hooked up to the CPU of the computer.,
Universally set time can be made by having one clock that is there and then runs off to a time station.,
Learn how to make a router.,
To make the I/O you simply get the line, going down a bus and heading towards the computer, but also now, it has to have a double inverter, and the first of those two inverters for each line should have a lever on it, for toggling that line on/off.",How to Make a Redstone Internet in Minecraft," language and a computer, all made out of redstone). Once you have those, these next few steps will be on modifying them to be able to work with the internet. This project will also discuss creation of a router.;
, Well, it should be a 10 line or more (5 inputs, 2 inputs to each output), with no override. Now, feed another bus over that first bus and those will later be used in the programming language.


Each of those output lines in the BCD should be an input in your internet, and you will have another, small input station for it too.






That separate input station should be a large wall with 3x3, the top and bottom rows of levers and the middle row of buttons.






The display can be either torch or piston. This should be at minimum 3x3 for an extremely small internet.







, In that CPU you need to have your commands pre-made so that they will follow through to the display from the BCD.

, A time station is simply a GIANT splitters, and if you need more, make more splitter. Use piston repeaters instead of normal diodes for extending the signal.

, This router will be the medium between the internet and your I/O/Computer. A router must have an IP address (I suggest 6 digit), an I/O station and a mirror cell. The IP address is simple, have the 6 line IP bus, but only put torches on inverters for setting the IP address, and then for turning it off, make it turn them all either on or off. Either way, its an Infi or Null value, meaning nothing, or the router is off.

, Also, a multiplexer for each line should be coming in from all the sites, and a shift so that the sites don't override. Also, have each line hooked up to and gates, so that when they are all on, it will give an overload message saying that the activity should cool down.


A mirror cell is like a ping. You can check if they are working or not. This should NOT have a toggle on it like the other I/O cells should.






There you have it. Now, just to make the servers and server space.


First, for the small kind of internet, with 4 bytes of server space, have it set up in a fashion so that the signal going in or out goes through 4 inverters. The first of those 4 is the toggle, just like the toggle on the router, and next one is a check, which is fed into an and gate for an overload warning, like in the router. the third one is to be able to tap the signal out to an inverse checker, basically, a site check to ping if it's up or not, and the 4th one is a stabilizer.






To put something onto a server, you have to go and make an application on it, out of redstone for example, like an adder or another clock or something like that.






For an upload, make it like the I/O cells of a router, and those feed off and into the application, and the same for downloading, as in it downloads a bit, or however much information is being downloaded and then store it off to the hard-drive.






Now, you know how to make it, make routers and put things on the internet. This is a prototyping version, and it is still being developed to make better, thank you.

, After the pool has been dug, add a layer across the entire surface one block deep into the pool. Make this new layer out of something easy to break such as dirt.

, Use your bucket and start filling in the top layer with water. Water will flow from the source blocks you place, so you won't need to fill in each block. As you fill, you might notice some currents appearing. These are caused by the lack of water source blocks nearby, and can be fixed by placing a water source on the block the current is originating from.

, Once the top layer has been filled with water and there are no currents, you can dig out the layer of dirt. The water will begin filling the lower part of the pool, and you won't have to worry about it flowing correctly.

, Once your pool is complete, you can add the finishing touches to make it a truly relaxing place. Add a cobblestone border around it to give it a professional look. Place some trees for shade, torches for light, and maybe even build a diving board!

Bring stone pickaxes rather than iron or diamond, since the main block you will be mining is Netherrack, which breaks very fast.",How to Make a Nether Portal Without a Diamond Pickaxe in Minecraft,";
,, Then, quickly place the water before the lava begins to flow. When water comes in contact with lava, Obsidian will form. Repeat the process until you have the Obsidian for a 4x5 frame. Then, light the middle of the frame, and voila! A Nether Portal!

, Also bring an iron sword, bows, and arrows. Consider also bringing snowballs to deal with the Blazes that lie in wait in Nether Fortresses.

, Ghasts' fireballs cannot penetrate cobblestone, which means that you will be safe from them.

, Iron and diamond are too valuable to bring, as they may get lost if you die.

, To climb a hill just place stairs instead of half slabs. The stairs, avoid the player to jump.


, If the path goes up or down a hill, the stairs can be placed next to the other stairs, like this.The result should look like this.

,, If you want to use the path with your horse, it's recommended to build a 6 block high street light. This height avoids you to hit the block if you jump.

,, You can use glowstone, or other light source like a jack o lantern.

, Additional protection from light sources is not necessarily because mobs can't spawn on half slabs and stairs.

, Press E to open your inventory. Look for a 2 x 2 crafting grid next to the image of your character. This grid has an arrow to its right leading to a results box.

, Drag at least three blocks of wood into a single slot of your 2 x 2 grid. Planks should appear in the results. Drag these planks to your inventory.

, Drag four planks into your crafting area, completely filling up the grid. Drag a crafting table to one of your quick slots at the bottom of the screen.

, Click the crafting table in your quick slot bar. Right-click anywhere on the ground to place it in the world.

, This will bring up another crafting interface, with a 3 x 3 grid.

, Place one plank directly above a second plank in the crafting area to turn them into sticks. You can do this in the crafting table area or your inventory.


A common beginner mistake is confusing wood and planks. This recipe will not work with wood logs.

, Now you're ready to craft a pickaxe. Right-click on your crafting table and fill it as follows:


Fill the top row completely with planks.
Place a stick in the center of the middle row.
Place another stick in the center of the bottom row.

, Drag the pickaxe to your quick slot and click it to equip it. Now you'll use the pickaxe whenever your right-click and hold to break an object. Try breaking down stone with the pickaxe. It's much faster than breaking it by hand, and you'll get cobblestone instead of just destroying the block.


You can mine coal with a wooden pickaxe (black-flecked stone). Trying to mine iron ore (beige-flecked stone) or more valuable ores with the wooden pickaxe will destroy the block without dropping items. See below for more advanced pickaxe recipes.

Using your Diamond pickaxe, mine the Obsidian.,
Build the frame for your Nether Portal.,
Light the portal with Flint and Steel.,
Stand in the portal for four seconds.",How to Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft1," In order to mine obsidian, you'll need a Diamond Pickaxe. You'll need three diamonds and two sticks to craft the Diamond Pickaxe.


If you want to build a Nether Portal without a Diamond Pickaxe, you can build a ""mold"" using other materials and create obsidian in the correct shape for the portal. Click here for instructions.
See Find and Mine Diamonds Fast on Minecraft for tips on finding diamonds.;
, Obsidian is created by pouring water onto lava. One bucket of water will create one block of obsidian. You'll need at least ten blocks of obsidian, and you'll want to have extra water on hand in case something goes wrong, so pack accordingly.

, You'll need to find some lava to turn into obsidian. Lava typically occurs deep underground, though you can stumble across a lava lake anywhere in the world. You'll have a very good chance of finding lava on level 1-10 above the bedrock, as all air pockets are replaced with lava at this elevation.

, The principle here is to spread the water over the lava blocks. Any water the lava comes into contact with will become Obsidian. The tip here is maximum coverage.

, By doing so, the Obsidian underneath will be revealed.

, You need 10 to make a portal. Rinse and repeat the water bucket trick as necessary.


Note that mining obsidian takes a very long time (9.4 seconds). You can speed this up with the ""Efficiency"" enchantment.
If you're standing the water, be careful that the flow doesn't push you into the exposed lava.

, You'll likely want to build the frame near your home so that you can easily resupply when you return from the Nether. The frame needs to be at least 4x5 blocks, but you don't need the corners, meaning you'll need ten blocks at minimum.Place two obsidian blocks next to each other on the ground, and then place a placeholder block on each end. Place three obsidian blocks in columns on each of the placeholder blocks. Put a placeholder block on the top of each column. Place two more obsidian blocks between the top placeholders. You can now remove the placeholder blocks to create the corner-less frame. The inside area should be 2x3 blocks of empty space.

, You can light the portal with anything that creates fire, but Flint and Steel is the most reliable. The middle of the portal will glow purple when activated.

, After four seconds, you'll be transported to the Nether. You can abort the teleport at any time by stepping out of the portal. A return portal will be created in the Nether where you enter.


Make sure to bring your Flint and Steel with you into the Nether. A Ghast can put out your return portal, requiring you to re-light it.

Climb back down the hole to the ground.,
Create a two-block tall wall around the tower's base.,
Wait for enemies to drop down the hole.",How to Make a Mob Spawner in Minecraft," To build a mob trap, you will need the following items:


Twelve stacks of cobblestone (768 total cobblestone)
Eight buckets of water
;
, Your tower will have four connected walls of two blocks each; in order to kill mobs, it must be at least 28 blocks high.

, The end result should be four branches that are two blocks wide and eight blocks long extending in each direction from the hole in the middle of the tower.

, The purpose of this wall is to contain the water you'll add.

, To do so, select the water buckets in your quick-access bar and right-click the two squares inside of a branch that are the furthest from the center (e.g., the eighth blocks). This action will consume two water buckets per branch (eight total).


If you're using a console controller, press the left trigger instead of right-clicking.
Placing the water any closer to the center hole will cause the water to spill over.

, Doing so will create a seventeen-by-seventeen platform with a hole in the middle.

, Doing this will prevent enemies from jumping off of your platform, which means they'll be forced to fall down the hole in the middle of the platform instead., You can place blocks on the inside walls of the tunnel to serve as scaffolding as you jump down, but you'll need to remove them as you go by mining them with a pickaxe., Doing so will prevent enemies from attacking you while you're waiting for mobs to spawn at the top of your tower.

Try keeping this wall a minimum of five blocks away from the base of the tower so that you have room to maneuver.

, As long as you stay within sixteen blocks of the tower's chute, enemies should begin dropping as soon as you set the game difficulty to ""Normal"" or ""Hard.""

You may have to wait a night and day cycle before enemies begin dropping.

, Now select the Wooden Pickaxe recipe from the Tools tab. As long as you have three planks and two sticks, the pickaxe will appear in your inventory.

, When you select the quick slot bar with the pickaxe in it, it should appear in your character's hands. With this equipped, you can break down stone into cobblestone and coal ore into coal. Don't try to break down more valuable ores without making a better pickaxe first, as described below.

Mine three stone blocks with your wooden pickaxe to get cobblestone, then select the stone pickaxe recipe. On the computer edition, just follow the same recipe for a wooden pickaxe but replace the planks with cobblestone. These are the advantages to a stone pickaxe:Breaks blocks faster than the wooden pickaxe

Can mine iron ore (beige-flecked stone) and lapis lazuli ore (dark blue-flecked stone)

, Iron ore is usually not hard to find with a short mining expedition or visit to a shallow cave. Mine at least thee of these beige-flecked blocks of stone, then turn them into a pickaxe as follows:



Craft a furnace our of eight cobblestone.
Place the iron ore in the top slot of the furnace, and coal or other fuel in the bottom slot.
Wait for the furnace to smelt the ore into iron ingots.
Craft an iron pickaxe from three iron ingots and two sticks.
An iron pickaxe can mine all types of ore, including gold, redstone, diamond, and emerald ores., This is probably the least useful of the pickaxes, since it's weaker than iron. If you just like the shine, you can mine gold ore, smelt it into ingots, and craft it into a pickaxe. The process is identical to the iron pickaxe instructions above.


Gold ore is usually found about 32 blocks below sea level or lower.

, Diamond is an extremely rare ore only found far below the surface. If you manage to locate this light blue-flecked stone, you can craft an extra-strong, extra-durable diamond pickaxe out of three diamonds and two sticks.


There is no need to smelt diamond ore. The diamond will drop as soon as you break the block.

Dig a 6x1 trench.,
Behind this trench, make a 6x3 high wall, with the 2 center blocks being 4 blocks high.

,
Place dirt blocks at the sides.,
Using your water bucket, place 2 water blocks on the opposite ends of your cobblestone mold.,
Remember this principle from now on: Any empty block right NEXT to or directly ON TOP OF a water block, will become an Obsidian block if you strike it with a Lava Bucket.,
Using your lava buckets, make a pillar of Obsidian 3 blocks high.,
See the trench below with water?,
Using your empty buckets, collect the 2 water source blocks on top of your cobblestone mold.,
Climb the mold and use your water bucket on the side of the overhang.

,
Use your lava bucket directly on the water source.,
There you have it!",How to Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft2," You can build a Nether Portal without the use of a Diamond Pickaxe by constructing a manmade waterfall and using lava buckets to build the obsidian frame.

Lay down your rails.",How to Make a Minecraft Subway System," Keep your subway route away from oceans and surface lava. Try to avoid deserts and beaches. Since the sand will collapse into your tunnel, these biomes require major excavation.


On a multiplayer server, make sure the route doesn't pass through anyone's basement without their permission.;
, In a multiplayer world, dig at least eight blocks down to reduce the chance of damage from surface explosions. In a single player world, four or five blocks down is usually fine.


A deeper subway is impractical unless people need to move between underground locations. Always stay above block 10, since lava is very common below that level., Dig the tunnels as straight as you can between your planned station locations. Zig-zagging will not make the route shorter, and makes it hard to run down the tunnel.


Start with one block wide tunnels. You can worry about the view after everything is in place.

, Stations are just wider rooms that your mine carts will pass through. All you need is a rectangular space. If you're in a multiplayer world, don't connect them to the surface yet.

, The tunnels and stations should be well lit to avoid mobs spawning inside them. At each station, stock a chest or dispenser full of minecarts.


To craft a minecart, form a U shape with five iron ingots.
You can decorate these areas however you like, but wait until all the rails are laid. You may need to make adjustments along the way. Avoid wool and other flammable materials if lighting with torches.

, If you're in Survival mode and don't have many resources, make a powered minecart by placing a furnace over a minecart in the crafting area. As long as you keep the furnace loaded with fuel, it will push the minecart ahead of it down ordinary rails. If you do have plenty of gold and redstone, move on to the next step for a smoother, faster ride.


This type of subway cannot make sharp U-turns, and will have trouble climbing slopes., For top speed, you'll need one powered rail for every 37 normal rails, or one for every 7 if you want to move unoccupied storage carts.You can power a flat passenger subway with as little as one powered rail for every 79 normal rails, but this will be much slower.You'll also need one redstone torch for each powered rail.


To make a normal rail, place one stick in the center of the crafting area and fill the left and right columns with six iron ingots.
To make a powered rail, replace the iron in the above recipe with gold ingots, and place redstone dust below the stick.
For a redstone torch, place redstone dust directly above a stick.

, Lay out normal rails along your tunnel, but occasionally place a powered rail instead. See the instructions above to decide how frequently to place the powered rails.


Powered rails cannot be used in turns. Use regular rails instead.
If your subway changes altitude, you'll need to use powered rails more frequently on the incline.

, The powered rails are off by default. To get them active (bright red), connect them to redstone power. You can use a circuit, but the simplest way is to place a redstone torch adjacent to each powered rail. The torch may be below the rail, or next to it on the same level.

, To make the cart stop automatically, place any solid block in the path of the rail. Place a powered rail leading up each side of this block and over the top, but do not power them. This will stop the cart when it arrives. To turn on the power and give the cart a good boost on its way to the next stop, place a button or lever on the wall next to the stop.If you use the subway for two-way travel in a multiplayer world, consider building two sets of tracks and placing signs to prevent collisions.

, This is all about timing and clever use of pistons. When you push a track with a piston, the track doesn't break — it's actually pushed aside! If that piston is a sticky piston, then you can retract the piston and the track will come back with it. That means that with good timing, you stop a minecart by using a redstone signal to expand a piston, which pushes out a rail right before the minecart hits this gap in the tracks. Unlike in the real world, the minecart won't just fly over this gap from its momentum. Instead, the cart will come to a complete stop when it runs out of track.

, Use a redstone-powered piston system to stop the minecart:


Choose a powered rail for the minecart to stop on.
Place a redstone-powered piston to push the rail in front of the powered rail out of the way, blocking the cart.
Place sticky piston behind the powered rail, which can retract to pull that rail out of the way.
Place a second sticky piston opposite the first one, with a solid block in front of it so it can push it behind the stopping minecart.

, Sending a redstone signal to the front piston will stop the cart, but how do you send the signal automatically? One way is to have the cart move over a detector rail. Don't place this rail in front of the pistons, and make sure the redstone dust ""wire"" is long enough that the pistons move after the cart has passed through. It may take some experimenting to get the timing right.


Since the cart won't stay on the detector rail, connect the signal to a redstone comparator to maintain the signal after the detector rail is turned off.

, To start the car again, send a redstone signal to the two sticky pistons, and to the powered rail. Suddenly, from the minecart's point of view, it has its back against a block and an open track laid out before it. Since the minecart is on a powered rail, it will move the only way it can: forward.


You can use the same detector rail and split the signal into two branches, one longer than the other. You'll need many redstone repeaters on the ""start"" branch signal so it shows up about thirty seconds later than the ""stop"" signal.

, Bring the track back to normal by cutting the redstone signal, pushing the block and rail back into place.

, You now have a system that can transport carts back and forth between two stations. If you need more destinations, build a system of track switches: a lever with redstone leading to the curved part of the track. Have a sign with redstone lamps on each side so when you flip the switch for where to go, it changes the track and lights up the sign to indicate where the track leads.

, Nether portals are made from burning obsidian, as described in the linked article. As you might expect, the flaming obsidian portal doesn't lead to a safe and happy place. If you have diamond equipment and are willing to face the challenges, though, the Nether can give you the fastest subway possible.

, Each block you travel in the subway moves you eight blocks in the normal map.It's best to build both portals before you start digging, since the portal placement on the other side won't always line up exactly.

, Fortunately, mining goes pretty fast in the Nether. Dig out a space between your two portals, then place a floor of stone slabs, stairs, and/or glass in this space. These are the only blocks that mobs will not spawn on in the Nether.This is important, since torches will not stop your subway getting overrun by zombie pigmen.


If you're building a narrow tunnel with no walkway (just a minetrack), you can use any solid materials. See below for ways to avoid mobs spawning on the track.
The walls and ceiling can be made from any materials.

, Even on these special flooring materials, ghasts can spawn in an area 5 x 4 x 5 blocks. Keep the tunnels and stations smaller than this in at least one dimension to avoid this happening.

, Leave a gap of air above the floor, then place glass panes or iron bars above that. Mobs can spawn on rails even if they're placed on slabs. These blocks will prevent this from happening. Unlike solid blocks, the glass or iron will not suffocate the passenger as you ride., Normal and powered rails work just as they do in the normal world. Once they're placed, you should have a safe and scenic journey through the lava-flooded nightmare realm. Enjoy!

Create a network on Hamachi.,
Have the other players join your network.,
Download and install the official Minecraft server files.,
Open the server file.,
Start a Minecraft multiplayer game.",How to Make a Minecraft Server for Free1," After Hamachi is downloaded and installed, open the program. Use the following steps to create a VPN (virtual private network) with Hamachi:Go to Networks > My Networks.
Click Add Network.
Give the network a name, type, and description (optional).
Click continue. Select an option for join requests — if you're playing with friends in a safe location, ""Accept Automatically"" is usually fine.
Set a password.
Follow the remaining prompts to create the network.;
, Once your VPN is up and running, get the other players (who should also have Hamachi installed) to connect. If you are using the free version of Hamachi, you are limited to five connections. Players can join the network via the Hamachi client itself or via the internet with these steps:Log in to your account at secure.logmein.com/.
Click the computer you want to access.

, Now that you have a functioning VPN, you need the right equipment to start an in-game server. Luckily, this is available for free from the official Minecraft site () from the ""Download"" page.


Installing the server files requires you to run the .exe several times. The first time, it will generate a ""EULA"" file in its directory — you will need to open this and change the ""false"" field to ""true"" to continue.
In addition, you may be directed to download the latest version of Java.

, Once the server files are completely installed, open the ""server"" file in the installation directory. You will see a variety of options. Use these steps to set up the server:


Look for the ""server-ip"" field.
Copy and paste your Hamachi IP address after the equals sign (you can find this by clicking the ""Info"" option under your computer in the Hamachi client.)
Save your file.

, Now, you are ready to host a game and have your friends connect to it. Open the game client, log in, and click ""Add Server."" Name the server and enter the Hamachi IP address you used earlier. Have the other players connect to this IP address.


You can also start the game, open the pause menu, go to the options/settings menu, and open the game to LAN connections. If the other players are on your Hamachi network, they should be able to see your server on the ""Join Server"" page.
Leave your Hamachi network running throughout the setup process and during the game itself.

Check your server's public and local IP address on a regular basis.",How to Make a Minecraft Server on a Mac," To set up a server, you'll need some files from the Minecraft website:


Visit https://minecraft.net/en/download/server in Safari.
Download the JAR file for the server program.;
, This will be the folder for your server program. You can place it somewhere easy to access, such as on your desktop. The server can be labeled anything, such as ""Minecraft Server.""

, When you run the file, the folder will fill with the various configuration files for the new server. For now, just drag the downloaded server JAR file to the new folder.

, You'll want to remove the version numbers from the end of the file. This will make it easier to run commands for the server later.

, You can find this in your Applications folder. From the desktop, click the Go menu and select ""Applications.""

, This will switch the new document to a plain text document.

, This set of commands will start the server. You can replace -Xms1G -Xmx1G with -Xms2G -Xmx2G to increase the RAM for the server from 1 GB to 2 GB:#!/bin/bash
cd ""$(dirname ""$0"")""
exec java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar minecraft_server.jar




, Select ""Save"" from the TextEdit menu and save the file in the same folder as the server file you downloaded from the Minecraft website.

, You can find this in the Utilities folder. From the desktop, click the Go menu and select ""Utilities.""

, Make sure to include a single space after a+x.

, This will add the path to that file at the end of the chmod a+x command.

, This will change the permissions of the start.command file, allowing it to start your server.

, This will start your server. You'll see some error messages, but this is only for the first time you run the sever. The server will generate several files in the folder its in.


The server will stop automatically after running the first time.

, You'll need to make a small change to this file to proceed.

, Save the change to the file and close it.

, This will start the server back up and show the server command line. Additional files will be downloaded and the server's world will be generated, which may take a few moments.

, Replace <username> with your Minecraft username. This will give you admin privileges when you connect to the server from your Minecraft account.

, Double-click this file and select TextEdit when prompted for a program to open it. You can change the values of these entries to change how the server works, but be aware that incorrect entries may cause the server to malfunction. You'll need to restart the server after making any changes.The gamemode entry lets you choose from 0 - Survival, 1 - Creative, 2 - Adventure, 3 - Spectator.
You can change the level-seed entry to enter any seed you'd like to use.

, When you're connecting to the server from other computers on the same network, you'll need to know the server's IP address.


On the Mac running the server, click the Apple menu, select ""System Preferences,"" then select ""Network.""
Select your network connection and look for the ""IP Address"" entry. Make note of this address.

, You don't need to forward any ports or change other advanced settings if the other computer is on the same local network as the server computer. If your server computer is powerful enough, you can run Minecraft on it at the same time, but this isn't recommended for most computers.


If you want to have your friends join your server over the internet, see the next section.

, This will begin scanning for available games. There's a good chance that you won't see your server available, even though it is.

, This will open a window allowing you to enter an address.

, After entering the address, you will connect directly to it and the game will load. If you cannot connect, make sure both computers are on the same network.


Multiple computers can connect to the same server using this address, as long as they are all on the same local network.
If you are playing on the same computer as the server, enter localhost instead of the server IP address.

, You'll need this address in order to properly forward ports so that others can connect to your server.


Click the Apple menu on the server Mac and select ""System Preferences.""
Click the ""Network"" option and then select your active connection.
Note the ""IP Address"" line.

, In order for others to connect to your server over the internet, you'll need to configure your router to allow incoming connections. To do this, you'll have to access your router's settings. If you are using a router like Netgear or Belkin, you can access your router's configuration page from your web browser. If you're using an Apple AirPort router, you can use the AirPort Utility from your Utilities folder.


See Access a Router for detailed information on opening your router's configuration page.

, The location of these settings will vary from router to router. Generally, you'll find them in the WAN or the Advanced section. It may be labeled ""Applications and Gaming"" or ""Virtual Servers.""

, Enter your server's IP address into the IP address field, then enter 25565 into the Port field. Make sure to select ""TCP"" as the protocol. Save your changes when complete.

, Your friends will need to enter your public IP address in order to connect to your Minecraft server. The quickest way to determine your public IP address is to open Google on the server computer's web browser and type ""my IP."" Your public IP will be displayed at the top of the search results.

, Now that the server is accessible from the internet, your friends can connect by opening the Multiplayer menu in Minecraft, clicking ""Direct Connect,"" and then entering the server address.

, Whenever your server computer restarts, it will get a new local IP address from your router. When this happens, you'll need to change the port forwarding rules to reflect the new address, or no one will be able to connect from the internet. Also, your internet service provider may occasionally change your public IP address, which will need to be entered whenever your friends connect.

Use Terminal to open the .command files.",How to Make a Minecraft Server for Free2," You have two options for setting up a Minecraft server manually: vanilla and bukkit. Vanilla servers are created with the server tools provided by Mojang, the developers of Minecraft. Bukkit servers, on the other hand, use modified tools created by third-party developers.As a general rule, most players will want to use vanilla servers for small private games with friends and bukkit servers for large public games.


The vanilla server files are available at minecraft.net.The bukkit server files are available at dl.bukkit.org., Once you have the server .exe file pf your choice downloaded, create a new folder named ""Minecraft Server"" or something similar and put the .exe file in this folder. The installation process will cause new files to be generated in the .exe's directory, so it's usually easiest to keep track of them if they're in their own folder.

, Follow any prompts you are given to proceed. The setup client will create the game world and load any additional files it needs. It should notify you when the installation process is complete.You may need to install the latest version of Java for the server .exe to be able to run.

, In Minecraft, ops (""operators"") have administrative powers over the servers they run. To give yourself this designation, open the ops.txt file and enter in your Minecraft username (spelled exactly correct).


You may also add the usernames of any friends you want to be ops.

, To change the rules of the game you'll be hosting, open the server.properties file in the server directory with WordPad or a similar text editor. Each line in the file specifies a different game parameter — editing the lines allows you to change how the game will play. Some of the most important options are listed below; a complete list is available here.gamemode: 0 for survival, 1 for creative.
spawn-monsters/animals: ""true"" will cause these entities to spawn in the map; ""false"" will cause them not to spawn.
allow-nether: if ""true,"" players can access the Nether, a hell-like dimension within the map.
difficulty: 0 for peaceful, 1 for easy, 2 for normal, 3 for hard.

, This is the difficult part of setting up a Minecraft server manually. Unfortunately, if you don't do this, other players won't be able to connect to your game, so it's essential. Port forwarding is a somewhat complex process that can vary depending on the hardware you are using for your router. Luckily, there are numerous guides available online to help you do this. One great place to start is at portforward.com, which has a comprehensive list of port forwarding guides for hundreds of router models (available here.)See also our article on the subject.
Another great guide is available on the official Minecraft forums here.

, Launch the Minecraft server, then log in to Minecraft and start the game. From the multiplayer menu, select ""Add Server."" Enter your router's IP address into the ""Server Address"" field and give your server a name. Connect to the server from the list of options on the ""Join Server"" page. Congratulations! Your game should be up and running.


Other players can join your server with your IP address in the same way.
One easy way to find your IP address is to visit portforward.com and look in the top right corner., Bukkit servers don't have the convenient interface that vanilla servers do, so it's actually necessary to create a program to open them manually. Start by renaming the main bukkit file so that it is in the .jar file format — this will allow us to run it with a separate .bat file.

, Open notepad or a similar text-editing program (not a word processor like Word, etc.) Paste the text below into the window, making sure that the line breaks are the same. Save the file with a name like ""startserver.bat"" (the .bat file extension is the important part.)@ECHO OFF
SET BINDIR=%~dp0
CD /D ""%BINDIR%""
java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar craftbukkit.jar
PAUSE

, When you open your new .bat file, it will run craftbukkit.jar, which will start the server setup process for creating the world and loading the game components. Follow the prompts as directed to launch the server.

, Setting up port forwarding on your computer for bukkit servers is done the same way as with vanilla servers. Once again, port forwarding guides for various router models are available here. You may also want to visit our port forwarding article or the official Minecraft forums guide.


Once you've set up port forwarding, you and the other players can connect to the server with your IP address as directed above.

, On Mac computers, the process for creating both vanilla and bukkit servers is mostly the same. However, there are several differences, which will be highlighted in this section. To start, you'll want to download either the vanilla or bukkit file specifically labeled as being for Mac computers.


The vanilla file for non-Windows computers will come in the .jar format. The bukkit file for Macs will need to be renamed with a .jar extension.

, To run the .jar server files for macs, you'll need to use a separate .command file. To make this file, open Textedit, click Format > Make Plain Text, and paste the strings below into the window, keeping the spacing exactly the same. Save the file as ""startserver.command"" or something similar (the .command extension is the important part.)For vanilla:



#!/bin/bash
cd ""$(dirname ""$0"")""
exec java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar minecraft_server.jar





For bukkit:



#!/bin/bash
cd ""$( dirname ""$0"" )""
java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar craftbukkit.jar





, Now, use the .command files you've created to launch the server files themselves. To do this, open Terminal (you can do this by typing ""terminal"" in the spotlight search) and pasting ""chmod a+x "" into the window. Don't forget the space at the end of the string. Then, just drag your .command file into the window and it should run immediately."

Players connecting on a local network need to enter the local IP; those connecting from the internet need to enter your external IP or host name.

Install the plugin.",How to Make a Minecraft Server for Your Friends and You5," There are thousands of user-made plugins and modifications available to download for free that will change your Minecraft experience. These range from world-building enhancements, to complete economy overhauls and all new game modes. Use plugins to add variety to your server and to keep your friends on their toes.

Bukkit is the most popular way to add plugins to your server. You will need to download the CraftBukkit tool. Running CraftBukkit is a complete replacement for the Minecraft Server program; you will be running the CraftBukkit server instead of Minecraft.







, This server program will allow you to add custom plugins that are not supported by the standard Minecraft server software.

, There are a variety of plugin repositories available online. Find a plugin that sounds interesting to you and download it. Be sure that you are downloading from a trusted source.

, Unzip the file that you downloaded. The .zip file should contain .jar files that contain the plugin data. Copy every .jar file in the .;zip file into the PLUGINS directory in your server folder.


Restart the server to install the plugins. You may have to adjust your server settings files again after installing a new plugin.






Make sure that your whitelist is configured to only allow your friends to connect.

Navigate to the ""Port Forwarding"" menu.,
Enter the port information.,
Enter your server’s local IP address.,
Check the ""Enable"" box.",How to Make a Minecraft Server for Your Friends and You6," Every router has a different method for accessing the settings. Most routers are accessible from a web browser by entering the IP address, typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1.


If you cannot access your router with either of those IPs, visit PortFoward.org and enter your router’s information. The default guides will list the standard addresses used by your router.






Most routers require a username and password to access the configuration menu. This would be the username and password you set up when you installed the router on your computer.






Typically, the default username is “admin” and the default password is “password” or “admin”.

, This is typically listed under Advanced Options. It may go by another name, such as Virtual Servers, depending on the manufacturer.

, The Minecraft server port is 25565 by default. If your router wants a range of ports, enter 25565 into both the ""Start Port"" and ""End Port.""


Set ""Protocol"" to ""TCP.""







, Make sure the IP address matches your server’s IPv4 address. Check this in Windows by opening the command prompt in Windows and running “iponfig”. Your IP address will be listed next to “IPv4 Address.” You may have to scroll up to see it. If using a Mac, click the Apple menu and select System Preferences, and then Network. Your IP address will be listed in the lower-right part of the window.

, Review your settings to make sure everything is entered correctly.

Customize and enjoy!",How to Make a Minecraft Server," There are three different types of Minecraft servers. VANILLA, BUKKIT, and TEKKIT. Each one of these types of servers are very different.


Vanilla is the game type that you play when playing single player, or in a LAN world. In vanilla, little customization is available, yet Vanilla is good for building and hanging out with friends.
Bukkit combines customization with Vanilla giving a more ""fun"" experience. Most servers run on Bukkit, or its faster version, Spigot.
Tekkit allows the Tekkit  game type to be played, where customization is everywhere.;
, Make sure that you have the latest version of Java by checking this link (If not just download it and no harm will come.


Make sure to that you or if you are under 18, your parents are okay with players connecting to your router and then to your computer. Running a Minecraft server might cause vulnerability to hackers if and when your server runs.

,


To download the Vanilla server software on Windows, go to this Minecraft site page and download the minecraft_server.1.8.exe folder. Place this folder on your desktop and rename it to a name you would like it to be such as ""Minecraft Server.""
For a Bukkit server, go to dl.bukkit.org and you will see the bukkit logo (lava bucket) and a large green button on the left-hand corner. Click the green button and the download will be processed and the file downloaded. Place the folder on your desktop labeled with your own Minecraft server title for the folder.
The Tekkit minecraft server files can be downloaded for Windows from this page.
You might notice the file is .exe. Running on a Mac OSX will be shown later in the steps below! Do not panic!

, The files will be downloaded in a non-compressed folder, and placed in, most commonly, your ""Downloads"" folder.

, Now the folder downloaded from minecraft.net/download should have a file in it called minecraft_server_1.8.jar or something similar.


If you are using Windows, feel free to double click that file/open it, thus running it and you will notice the world folder and other files will be created in your Minecraft server folder. To go onto your server, your current IP for the server is 0.0.0.0 or ""localhost"".
If you are on Mac OSX, you have to perform an extra step. Open textedit and copy and paste this text into the file without the quotes:
#!/bin/bash
cd ""$(dirname ""$0"")""
exec java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
If you are on a Windows computer and want to run a Bukkit or Tekkit server, do the same process with for the Mac OSX users but replace the filename with your filename.

, Find out want type of router it is. Linksys? Apple? Etc.? You then need to find out how to access your router's settings. Most routers have an app companion app yet a computer's version is preferable. For Linksys, go to this menu.

, This is the default port for a Minecraft server, changeable in the ""server.properties"" file.


You forward 25565 to your INTERNAL IP address which can be found, on a Windows computer by typing ipconfig in the command prompt and on Mac OSX by going into Settings>Network>Wi-fi. Then look at your IP. It should be something like 10.0.1.12.
Once done, update your router's settings. Done!

, What you want to do is go to ipchicken.com and in blue in the center of the page is your EXTERNAL IP address. This is the IP you can give to your friends. If you changed the port to something other than :25565, then the port must be attached to the IP like so 192.32.23.12:PORT#.

, Every Minecraft server needs customization. Basic customization consists of editing the ""server.properties"" file.


In your server.properties you can change the MOTD, the Message Of The Day displayed to users when they load your server, build-height, port number, whitelist on/off, op-power etc., which can all be found online about how to further configure those.

, Though Minecraft carries multiple different-colored materials, your picture may have different colors. If you want to change the colors of your art, simply find a color that best matches the color of the art. If you do not like Minecraft's colors, you can edit the colors using a texture pack.


Use an image editing program (preferably Gimp) to edit a texture pack. To view texture packs, open your start menu and type %appdata% into the search. Press enter and a folder called ""Roaming"" will appear. Click on a folder called "".minecraft"" and open a sub-folder called ""texturepacks"". You may insert and edit texture packs here.

, Open up Minecraft and create a world for your pixel art. You may prefer your world to be in Creative Mode, as it allows infinite items and flying. Your art will be either horizontal, meaning it is flat on the ground, or vertical, meaning it is ""standing up"". Both offer different ways to make a pixel art.

, Use your default image editor and open up your art. Open up a grid if possible.

, Choose a starting point on your art. Start by tracing out the image, taking one part at a time and remembering to count pixels. Once you have an outline done, you can begin to fill it. There are different methods to do this, and it depends on your art style.

, This way is the arguably the easiest. You can place blocks, fly out for an overview, and doesn't risk death or destruction of your art.

It is impossible to wear a blindfold in Minecraft, so to make the piñata breaking part seem realistic, make the room as dark as possible.;
, Don't make it too big. Just 6 stone blocks will do. Put one for the base. Leave its upper space empty and put the 4 other blocks on the other sides. Drop the items you want to put inside. Then put a stone block above the items, still leaving the center space empty.

If you want it easier to break, you can use wood blocks for the piñata.
To make it look like its hanging, use fence to attach it connect it to the ceiling.

Find out if you have a dynamic IP address.,
Set up a Dynamic DNS.,
Configure your router.",How to Make a Minecraft Server for Your Friends and You7," Most residential internet providers assign dynamic IPs. This makes connecting to your server somewhat more difficult, as you have to let people know your new address every time it changes. Some ISPs will give you a dynamic IP, but it won’t change for long periods of time.

Type “my ip address” into Google and note your IP address over a few weeks. If you’re only giving out the IP to a few friends, then you may not have to worry about setting up a static address if your IP doesn’t change very often.







, A Dynamic DNS will assign a domain name to your dynamic IP. This will give you an unchanging address to connect to. Many services offer free accounts for single addresses.


Dynamic DNS will require a program to run on your computer, that will update your domain whenever your IP address changes.

, You will need to set your router to connect through a Dynamic DNS. The location of this setting varies from router to router, but it is typically under the Advanced settings.


You will need to enter your Host name, username, and password.

You may add the health bar for that boss too!
You may even add the Enderdragon and the Wither!
Make sure that the story must have bosses fought at the correct time. Or, you may put some in the Nether (which may of course include Herobrine).

, This step is for Blender Only; other software users should look at other sources. You should see Output. Have the output be PNG. Create a new folder to put the pictures in. Then, render the animation.

, Then go to ""Add>Image"". Select the images and insert them into the editor. Have the green line go where you want your animation to end.

, I would prefer Quicktime for mac user, but for windows users, you can choose what you want. Then render the animation again. This will go faster and go through each photo.

, You've finished making your animation! Now, edit it and everything, and show the world it on YouTube!

, If you find yourself near the ocean or the desert, you can find that Sandstone is the most appropriate block for this venture. Sandstone’s pale-yellow color and cobbled texture is appropriate, if not perfect, for the villa’s walls. You can also make Sandstone variations—like Chiseled Sandstone, which has carvings all over it, and Smooth Sandstone, which is very much what its name states—to widen your range of materials when building. Sandstone can also be crafted into Slabs and Stairs.


If you dig a few blocks down from any sandy area, you’ll find some natural Sandstone. This is because regular Sand is affected by gravity and tends to fall down without any supporting “solid” blocks.
You can also make Sandstone by filling a 2x2 square on your crafting grid with Sand. Smooth Sandstone can be made by placing Sandstone on a 2x2 square on your crafting menu. Chiseled Sandstone is made by stacking two Sandstone Blocks on top of each other in a crafting grid.

, Quartz and Quartz Blocks is more readily available to later-game players who has access to the Nether. These have a whiter, more even color and texture than Sandstone, giving your villa a sleeker, more modern feel. In fact, Quartz is normally referred to as the marble substitute for aspiring Minecraft sculptors! Quartz itself can be mined in individual chunks, while Quartz Blocks have to be crafted. Much like Sandstone, Quartz Blocks also have the Chiseled variation and a Pillar (has lines running across it like Greek pillars) variation. You can also use this material to craft Stairs and Slabs.


Quartz can naturally be mined from Netherrack with large white discolorations. You can craft Quartz Blocks much like Sandstone.
You can craft Chiseled Quartz the same way as Chiseled Sandstone, and Pillar Quartz by stacking two Quartz Blocks on top of each other on any crafting grid.

, Minecraft has an abundance of Wood types for you to choose, but for the villa, it’s better if you pick the warmest-colored Woods available. Jungle Wood is the preference, but Acacia, Dark Oak, and Spruce will suffice if you can’t find a nearby Jungle. Oak and Birch are too pale for your villa, but can still be used for flooring, furnishing, or as a substitute for Quartz and Sandstone for one of the materials for your walls.

, For the tile roof, the most appropriate material are Brick Blocks and Slabs. Bricks can be made by digging for Clay, usually found underwater in rivers and ponds. You can create Bricks by smelting the individual Clay pieces in a furnace, then craft Brick Blocks the same way as Sandstone and Quartz Blocks. You can also craft Slabs and Stairs with it.


For later-game players, you can also use Nether Brick, which can be smelted from Netherrack and crafted the same way as regular Bricks. This material has a darker, slimmer texture, so it isn’t as recommended as regular Bricks for the tile roofing of your Villa.

, Of course, a nice house needs nice windows. Glass can be acquired by smelting Sand in a furnace, and Glass Panes can be crafted by laying down two rows of Glass Blocks on your crafting table’s crafting menu. Either can be used for your villa.


You can also make Stained Glass by placing a dye in the middle of the 3x3 crafting menu of the crafting table, then surrounding it by Glass. You can make Stained Glass Panes using Stained Glass Blocks, then laying it out the same way you do for regular Glass Panes.

, Italian villas are full of greenery and flora. You can gather flowers, breed grass, plant trees, and place vines all over your villa for that authentic Italian look.


You can find flowers nearly everywhere in Minecraft and they are easily picked by hand. Some of the rarer or larger flowers can be bred by using Bonemeal on the flower, and a duplicate of it is deposited as an item into your inventory or on the ground if your inventory is full. Regular flowers can’t be reliably bred, but can be spawned by simply using Bonemeal on the ground and hoping to get the flower you like.
Some flowers only exist in certain Biomes, so the Bonemeal method’s yields can vary, depending on which biome you’re in. If you want the widest selection of flowers, head on over to the Flower Forest and Flower Plains biomes, which are rich in colorful flora.
Vines, Grass, Ferns, Desert Shrubs, and Leaves from trees can be only be harvested with Shears. Vines can be placed on any vertical surface; Shrubs, Grass, and Ferns can be placed on the ground; and Leaves need to be placed on Wood so it won’t disappear.
Shears can be made by placing two Iron Ingots diagonally on your personal crafting menu or your crafting table. You can then use it to “break” the flora without destroying it, letting you gather the frailest of plant matter in the game.

, Italian villas are most commonly found in the countryside, and the more modern ones resemble mansions more often than not. Even when you’re planning on making a small villa, build it in wider, open areas. Villas are also associated with lush, warmer environments and an abundance of greenery, so it’s best to build it in the lush-type biomes like the Plains and its variations, or the Forest biome, but not the Swamp, Jungle, or Roofed Forest. In a pinch, the Savannah and Taiga biomes can work as well, though this will affect the color of Grass, Vines, Leaves, and Ferns.

, While most modern Italian villas are more mansion-like and built on large, flat expanses, you don’t have to do exactly that. Older villas, especially in the countryside, follow the lay of the land, and often slope up and down with the hills. This, in turn, would lead to some impressive-looking structures, so don’t be afraid to follow the land or build with differing levels!


Searching the Internet for some references wouldn’t hurt, so feel free to look up and copy some of the layout designs you spot!
Sloping builds don’t have to exactly follow the land, or at least the interior doesn’t. If you think that the slope is too erratic or the area it slopes with is too small, feel free to hollow out a part of the hill and take some creative liberties with your floor design.
For those who wish a flatter main house but decided (or can’t help but) to build the house on a slope, you can just create the flat floor, fill in some necessary space in the foundation, and simply install pillars around the areas that go past the foundation ground to emulate balconies, patios, gardens, and such. Not only will it save you some resources, it will also look pretty impressive!

, Italian villas have very large windows incorporated in their housing designs, giving them an open and sunny look. The easiest way to do this is to create a pillar segment, so to speak, at least 5 blocks long. You’ll also need three types of wall material, four blocks of wood of your preference, and some two Glass Blocks for each segment, depending on how wide you want it.


Here’s the general guide to your materials:p = pillar block
w = wall block
c = ceiling block
W = Wood
g = Glass (Panes or Blocks)
X = empty space
(...) = repeat

Place down the block you chose for your pillar material. Count three blocks away from it, then place another pillar block on the fourth. Then build up the pillars up to four blocks high in total.p X X X p
p X X X p
p X X X p
p X X X p

Place your main wall material between the top and bottom rows of the wall.p w w w p
p X X X p
p X X X p
p w w w p

Place two blocks of Wood on each side of the ensuing gap, and fill the middle with Glass Panes or Glass Blocks. Lastly, place the ceiling blocks on top!c c c c c
p w w w p
p W g W p
p W g W p
p w w w p

If you want to extend the wall, simply treat the pillar block as a base, count three blocks, then place another pillar and build up another section!c c c c c c c c c
p w w w p w w w p

You can even expand the wall segment to make the windows wider, if you want!c c c c c c c
p w w w w w p
p W g g g W p
p W g g g W p
p w w w w w p

For corners, take your pillar blocks then create an L-shape where the walls meet, then build the rest of the walls along the pillars! This is so the building stays symmetrical inside and out, and preserves the pattern.Top:

Building the second floor is similar. Within the building, above the ceiling blocks, place another row of the same material. Then on that new layer, slowly place more of the same material blocks until it fills up the room to make a floor. Then simply repeat the steps for creating wall sections, and fill out the ceiling with more ceiling blocks!

, Aside from the open design, Italian villas often have arching pillars incorporated in the design, especially for the patios, roofed balconies, and such. While tricky with such a blocky medium, it’s doable with a pair of stairs and slabs. Take some blocks of your chosen material (you can use the same material as you built the walls with, stone or wood), and place them about 2–3 blocks apart to act as your pillar’s support. Now, take any material you want for the arches, and simply place them on the sides of your arch’s support block, with the steps of the stairs facing downwards. If you chose to place it 3 blocks apart, place a slab in between the two stairs. And there’s your arch! You can use them for your entryway, the patio, or as walls to your garden!a = arch block
s = stair
sl = slab
d = door
a s sl s a
a X X X a
a X X X a
or
a s s a
a X X a
a X X a


To make an arch for a single door, follow the three-block-gap pattern then place the doors behind the arch, on the wall. There aren’t many feasible ways to create a single door arch pattern you can emulate with the arch alone, since it leave strange gaps on the top or sides of the door.
To make on double doors, use the two-block-gap pattern, then you can place the doors either between them or behind them. This works better than the one-gap arc patterns since there’s ample room for the arc and the doors without sacrificing the pattern.

, Normally, the roof of an Italian villa is a low, cheery red tile that slopes upwards, and sometimes flattening itself on the top. In Minecraft, this means that plain clay Bricks are your best bet for this.Take some Brick slabs, then place them along the top half of the outer portion of your walls, on top of the ceiling blocks. Then, on top of the outermost ceiling blocks themselves, place another set of slabs until it circles the entire wall.(b) = brick slabs
b = brick Blocks

Keep repeating this pattern of alternating slabs and bricks until you fill out the rest of the rooftop or reach enough layers according to your preference. Ideally, the layers should be around 5–6 in a smaller house. This will lend your villa a gracefully sloping roof.
If this seems to tedious to you, you can just use Stairs instead, then after the fourth layer of stairs, you simply place slabs or bricks to close off the roof.

, This might be the simplest step of this guide, seeing as all you have to do is add greenery to your villa.


Place vines all over the sides of the walls. You don’t need to place all the vines individually, since it naturally “creeps” down the walls after a while. Just place a couple on the highest part of your wall then wait for it to grow.
Placing flowers and ferns on the ground along the walls can really improve the scenery as well.
You can plant trees nearby, preferably the likes of Spruce and Birch. You can also make trees by placing a stack of Fence Posts about 2–3 blocks high, then placing some leaves around it to form a tree.
Bushes can easily be made by placing a block of wood or wooden planks, then covering it with leaves. You can also place two Fence Posts about 1 block apart then place leaves in between to create a sort of neatly-cut topiary design.
You can also place your plants in Flowerpots, both inside the villa and out! Flowerpots are crafted by placing 3 Bricks in a V-shape in your crafting table’s grid. Once crafted, you can place nearly every type of ""small"" flora (like posies, dandelions, tulips, and mushrooms but not ""big"" ones like tall grass, ferns, rose bushes or sunflowers) in it, no matter what special conditions it has for planting. Do note that anything planted in a Flowerpot can’t be bred or farmed!

, A villa doesn’t have to remain symmetrical! Build differing floor heights, place the second floor only on one side, build an open garden on the rooftop, install three balconies if you want to. This is your villa after all! Build according to your preference, and don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. Soon enough, you’ll have your very own, personalized Italian villa to call your home!"

If you're short on iron, learn how to find more quickly.;
, Pumpkins can grow on any grass block with air above it (but not on tall grass or snow). Plains biomes are the easiest place to find them. You need one pumpkin (or jack o' lantern) for each iron golem.


You only need one pumpkin to start a pumpkin farm and grow as many as you like. First, turn the pumpkin into four pumpkin seeds in the crafting screen. Plant the seeds in farmland next to water, leaving one empty dirt block for each seed. The pumpkins will grow onto the empty blocks., The space must be at least three blocks wide and three blocks tall, but it's a good idea to work in a larger space. If you craft the golem too close to a wall, there's a chance it spawns trapped inside the wall and suffocates.Break any tall grass or flowers in the area before you begin. These sometimes prevent the golem from spawning., Place one iron block on the ground. Put the other three in a row on top of the first one, forming a ""T."" This will become the body of your iron golem.

, This will change immediately into an iron golem.


The pumpkin must be the last block you place, or the iron golem will not spawn.

, If iron golems sense a village nearby, they will wander over there and patrol its buildings.This defense isn't as foolproof as a good wall and torches, but you get to see the golem hand flowers to the villagers.


Unlike naturally spawning iron golems, your own creation will never attack you, even if you harm it or a villager.

, Put up barriers if you want your new iron golem to stay in place instead of wandering off to protect villagers. The iron golem will also stay put if you surround your house with vines., You can use a lead to make the iron golem follow you, or to tie it to a fence (although it won't defend very well when tied up).Craft a lead using four string and one slimeball.

Choose what kind of tree to plant.,
Find what kind of tree you want to plant.,
Acquire saplings.,
Pick the location to plant.,
Plant your sapling.",How to Plant Trees in Minecraft1," Just like in real life, Minecraft has different kinds of trees growing, and it’s important to know what kind of tree you want to plant, especially if you’re hoping to get a particular kind of resource. All trees in Minecraft fall under one of the six basic tree species; acacia, birch, dark oak, jungle, oak, and spruce. Below are pointers about what to expect from each kind of tree:


Acacia trees are the most visually unique kind of tree. They grow in a spiraling pattern, and their wood is more orange than other wood blocks.
Birch trees grow quickly and are easy to harvest.
Dark oak trees grow amazingly fast, and their leaves have the chance to spawn apples. Their trunks also grow in a 2x2 pattern, so if you want to harvest lots of wood blocks, this is an ideal tree to plant.
Jungle trees are the largest kind of tree in Minecraft and are sometimes also referred to as the “jungle giants.” Though planting a jungle tree would be a great way to harvest wood blocks, cutting down jungle trees can be a bit more difficult and potentially dangerous due to how tall they grow.
Oak trees are the easiest to find and the easiest to grow. The wood harvested from oak trees is the same color as the wood found in naturally generated structures. Like dark oak trees, oak leaf blocks have the chance to spawn apples when destroyed.
Spruce trees grow very tall, which like the jungle tree could give you a lot of wood blocks to harvest, but also adds some danger due to the height.;
, Before you can plant a tree, you’ll need a sapling, which can be harvested from already existing trees. Different kinds of trees grow in different places, so you need to know where to look:


Acacia trees naturally spawn only in the Savanna biome.
Birch tress can spawn various places, but are most commonly found in the birch forest biome and are easy to spot because of the white color of their trunks.
Dark oak trees generate only in the Roofed Forest biome.
Jungle trees are found only in the jungle biome.
Oak trees can be found in many biomes, including Extreme Hills, Forest, Swampland, and Jungle Edge.
Spruce trees are easiest to find in the Taiga biome but can also spawn naturally in Cold Taiga, Mega Taiga, and Extreme Hills.

, Unlike many crops in Minecraft, trees don’t grow from seeds, but rather from saplings. You can harvest saplings from already existing trees, such as the one you’ve just located. Saplings harvested from a tree will grow the same sort of tree as the one they were harvested from. To harvest a sapling, the easiest way would be to cut down the tree.


Cutting down a tree can be made easier with the use of an axe, but you can also do it with your bare hands.
Stand next to the tree and left-click on the woods blocks one at a time, holding down the left mouse button until the wood block drops. When all of the wood blocks have been harvested, the leaf-textured blocks will begin to vanish. Each one has a chance to drop a sapling.
Pick the saplings up by walking over them.
If you don’t want to cut down the tree, you can just harvest the leaf blocks by left clicking on them.
Not all leaf blocks will drop saplings, so it might take you a couple minutes to harvest one.

, Now that you have the saplings to plant, you need to know where you want your trees growing. Trees are normally planted by the player’s base, spawn point, or house to make them convenient, but they can be planted almost anywhere.


The block that the sapling is placed on must be dirt, podzul, or grass.
The sapling will need to have access to light, meaning it will need to be outside or have an alternate light source if grown inside. The two most commonly used alternate light sources are torches and glowstones.
Trees will not grow through other blocks, so make sure you don’t have anything blocking the way of the sapling in the blocks directly above it.

, Now that you’ve made sure your growing location is ideal, you can plant your sapling by selecting it from your item bar and then right-clicking on the block where you intend to plant it.

Pick a place to plant.,
Plant your sapling.",How to Plant Trees in Minecraft2," Although planting a tree in Creative mode is a little different, it’s still important to know what kind of tree you want to plant. Since you probably won’t need to take resources into account when playing in creative mode, you’ll want to look at the visual qualities of the different types of tree.


Acacia are the most unique trees in Minecraft visually speaking. While their trunks are brown and their leaves are green, the wood blocks themselves have a diagonal pattern and the trunks will often grow in a spiraling pattern. Acacia trees can also have multiple canopies.
Birch trees have leaves that are a pale green with white trunks.
Dark Oak trees are similar in appearance to the oak trees, but they are a bit darker in the color of both the trunk and leaves.
Jungle trees are the tallest kind of tree, dark in color and often seen growing vines.
Oak trees are the most commonly found tree and look the most like a generic tree. The trunks remain straight, and they don’t grow as tall as spruce or jungle trees.
Spruce trees (also known as pine trees) have the appearance of an evergreen tree. The bark is darker than oak trees or even dark oak trees, and the leaves are more dense with a slightly blue tint in color.

, Getting saplings in creative mode is much easier than getting them in survival mode since you already have access to different kinds of saplings in your inventory and you won’t have to go looking for trees.


Press E to bring up your inventory. You’ll notice right away that in creative mode you’ll have access to all blocks and materials, which includes saplings.
You can search items by hitting the search tab in the top-right corner of the window. Search for whichever kind of sapling you’d like to plant or just type in “sapling” to see all your options.
When you’ve found the sapling of the tree you’d like to plant, just left-click on its icon to put it into your item bar.

, When you’re in creative mode, planting things can be a lot easier, but if you want your tree to grow properly, there are still some things to keep in mind.


In order to plant a tree, the block that you’re placing your sapling on must be dirt, podzul, or grass.
You’ll need to have a light source near your sapling. If you’re planting your tree outside, sunlight will make an ideal light source. If you’re planting a tree inside, torches and glow stones both make excellent alternate light sources.
You’ll need to make sure there are no blocks directly above your sapling, as trees cannot grow through other blocks.

, Your sapling should still be on your item bar, so you just highlight it by clicking the number that corresponds to whatever slot it’s in.


For instance, if your sapling is in your second item slot, you’d simply press “2” on your keyboard, to switch over to the sapling.
You plant the sapling by right-clicking on the block where you’d like to place it.

, If your bed is destroyed, you won't be able to respawn, and if all your team dies, you lose! The area around it should be big (maybe 5x5), with plenty of layers; and NOT hollow. Try using wool, sandstone, wood and if you can afford it, obsidian for about 5 layers to annoy enemies and kill them while they mine towards your bed.

The second one is: run towards the middle. Most people run towards the middle as soon as they spawn, and you will probably find some people there as well.

Install Forge.,
Download the mod.,
Start the game.,
Hatch the egg.,
Tame the dragon.,
Saddle your dragon.,
Ride your dragon.",How to Open the Dragon Egg in Minecraft," Forge is like a ModLoader that is used by many players who uses mods. In order for the Dragon Egg mod to work, you have to download and then install Forge .


As of now, the current version required for Forge is Minecraft 1.7.2. The installer won't work if you're using a higher version of Minecraft.;
, After installing Forge, download the mod . There are two version you can use, 1.7.2 and 1.6.x.


Click on the link to get the download and then save it in your computer.
After downloading, put the zip file in the .minecraft directory's mod folder, which can be found here:
%appdata%\.minecraft for Windows
~/Library/Application Support/minecraft for Mac OS
~/.minecraft for Linux

, After installing and placing the zip file in the mod folder, start your game like normal. You can use either Creative mode or Survival, depending on what you prefer.


If you're using Survival, you need to obtain the egg first by defeating the Ender Dragon.

, In the old version of the mod, you are required to heat up the egg by placing it in the middle of the magma, but they have changed it recently by playing the egg block on the ground and then right-clicking the item. The egg will hatch and the dragon will appear.

, Use raw fish to tame the dragon. The dragon is modified to act like a pet in Minecraft. They will follow you, protect you, and even sit if you use a bone.


Just like any pet, dragons are vulnerable to damage as well, but you can heal them up by feeding them raw fish and other poultry.

, For you to ride the dragon, you need to saddle it up. Saddles are rare in the game and cannot be crafted, but you can find it in the dungeons, chest, mineshafts, and even trade it with a villager.


Remember that you need to tame the dragon first before you can saddle it up.

, Right-click your saddled-up pet to start riding it.


Unfortunately, the only way to go down is to right-click the dragon, which will cause you and your pet to free-fall from the sky. It's still uncertain if the mods are planning to fix this or leave it as it is.

Minecraft comes down to about twenty five U.S dollars and can be downloaded from the official Minecraft site Minecraft.net with no additional payments once bought.

To buy Minecraft, click the yellow 'Get Minecraft' button on the home page and create a Mojang account.;
, One of the most aggravating things to have to figure out about Minecraft are the controls- not to mention the fact that they have the potential to change with each update.  These controls can be changed from the settings menu, but the default controls that you'll want to know on the PC version of Minecraft are as follows:


WASD keys: The WASD keys are used for movement in Minecraft and double tapping W is used for sprinting. W goes forward, S goes backwards, A goes left and D goes right. These controls can take some getting used to if you've only ever used your arrow keys, but are easier to use then arrow keys once you get used to them.

E: E opens your inventory.

Double tap W: See next section.

LM button: The LM button or 'left mouse button' is used to click and drag objects around your inventory, attack creatures and, perhaps the most important thing of all, to break blocks.

RM button: he RM Button or 'right mouse button' is used to place blocks and can be used in some shortcuts when dragging blocks around your inventory. It is also used to activate blocks such as TNT, furnaces, doors, crafting tables and more as well as being used to eat when you are holding a food item. If you use the RM button while holding a sword, you can use it to block.

Numbers/Mouse Scroller: The numbers and mouse scroller are used to select items in your hotbar.

Shift: Shift is used to crouch. If you use it near an edge, you will not fall off.

Space Bar: pace bar is used for jumping. In water, it is also used for swimming to the top.

Esc: Esc brings up the menu.

Q: Q is for dropping any items you don't want.

, To gather wood, you hold down your left mouse button on the trunk of any tree and wait for it to break. You the collect the block. If you have an axe, you can use your number keys or mouse scroller to scroll to that tool and harvest the wood a little faster. (or a lot faster, depending on what axe you have)., To do this, open up your inventory (using E). There should be four boxes at the top. Don't arrange any shapes- just drop the wood into the box. It should appear in a single box next to these four boxes. Click on this single box until you have as many planks as you want, and then arrange four of these planks in a square in the same box of four and collect the crafting table you make., You'll see that you have a slightly bigger table this time- this will help you to make more advanced items like fences and stairs later on., To do this, make sticks (two wooden planks in a vertical arrangement) and place one in each of the bottom two boxes in the middle column. Then drag 3 wooden planks along the top of this and if you've done it correctly, you should have a wooden pickaxe. This is for mining stone.,

Stone is a grey block that you cannot break with your hands alone. If you try, it will just disappear and you won't get the resource.
Coal is like stone only with black dots on it. You can break these two blocks with a wooden pickaxe- any other mineral blocks will require a stone or iron pickaxe to break them, however.

, The same formation as a wooden pickaxe, only with stone instead of wood in the top three boxes., Make sure you leave some- coal is important in cooking and smelting ores such as iron and gold., This will stop any monsters from spawning in the areas where it is lit and you can more safely build your home., Using the left over wood, stone, planks and even dirt you have accumulated, build a simple shelter. You don't need to fancy it up just yet- that will come later. For now, you just want to survive the night. All your home needs are 4 walls, a ceiling and a two high space for the door. The walls should be at least three blocks high., To do this, put your crafting table down and right click it. The table you used to create your pick should appear. Using six wooden planks, make a vertical, 2x3 rectangle in the box, and then collect your wooden door from the box next to it. Right click to place the door in the 2 high space you made in step 2. This will let you exit and enter your home., You don't want monsters to spawn! Monsters will not spawn in light sources above light level 7- and a torch project light level 14! It is because of this that monsters do not spawn in daylight, but be careful- because they can spawn in caves. Most mobs burn in sunlight, but some, such as creepers and spiders don't. We'll cover all that in the next step., Zombies can break doors down, so just stick one in front of it or dig a hole and you should be covered., If you've done all this correctly and if the door is closed, you should be fine!, Any NPC animal in Minecraft, hostile or not, is called a 'mob' and can be killed. Most of them have food or items in them and some can even be used for trading or transport., If you put a saddle on one and right click it, you can ride a pig- however you cannot control it without the use of a carrot on a stick. You can also kill pigs for pork which are a very good source of food., If you have a bucket you can right click a cow for milk, or else you can kill a cow for leather and raw beef., These creatures look very similar to cows- in fact, if sheared, they will turn into cows! They will also drop 5 mushrooms if sheared. If killed, they will drop the same things that a cow does- beef and leather., When killed, chickens will drop feathers and/or eggs., If sheared or killed, they drop blocks of colored or non-colored wool, as well as raw mutton. (only if killed.), With horses, specially crafted armor can be placed on them, as can a saddle. They go quite fast and can also jump very high. Donkeys can carry chests and wear a saddle, but not armor., When killed, squids drop ink sacs which can be used for black dye., When attacked, wolves become hostile and even if you're on peaceful they will attack you. If you have a lot of bones, however, you can use them on a wolf to tame them. Wolves will attack skeletons for you and follow you around, and you can make them sit if you don't want them to. They will also attack rabbits and sheep., There are certain conditions that must be met to tame an ocelot however- for example, the ocelot must be looking at you and walking slowly towards you. When fed a fish, ocelots will turn into a breed of cat that, much like the wolf, will follow you around once tamed. They will attack creepers for you., When killed, rabbits will drop rabbit hide (which can be made into leather) and rabbit meat."

, After a while, you get a knock back wooden sword. Sometimes people stay at spawn point and try to kill the seeker, but don't, you will risk your life.

, Remember that you'll probably spend a long time in the Nether, so create a high ranked one (1 diamond pickaxe should be fine, or even 2-3 iron pickaxes). If you don't know how to create a pickaxe, read this.

, If you find yourself trapped in a small area, dig downwards. You should enter a world full of lava, Netherrack and mobs; this is where you want to start mining.

Since the lists are sorted by popularity, this is the best way to find active servers. Be aware that some servers just pay to be seen higher on the list. These should be labeled ""sponsored"" or have a star next to them.

, The server descriptions or tags should describe what the server is all about. You're probably familiar with most of these if you've played on popular servers before. If not, see the descriptions below.

, Most of these lists display how many players are currently logged in next to the name of each server. If you're looking for a place to play minigames or be part of massive projects, choose a server with at least 100 people logged in. If you're looking for a more intimate community, you might prefer one with 50 or fewer people online.


The maximum server population is also listed. If it's full (for example, ""240/240"") you'll have to wait for someone to leave before you can log in.
Some server lists also list online-time percentage,"" telling you how often the server is accessible.

, Survival servers usually mention this in the description if they have it, but not always.

, You can sometimes find this info in the description of the server, or by looking at the tags that some server lists use to organize their servers. If the info is not there, visit the server's website or log in to the server and ask in chart:


Minecraft version: The most active servers usually update to the latest version promptly. If the version number is lower than yours, you can change the version you use with the ""Edit Profile"" button, visible as soon as you open Minecraft.
Mods: If you have a favorite mod you can't stand to play without, try to find a server that allows its use. Some servers require you to install a mod before joining.
Online-time percentage: This shows how often a server is online (ideally 90%+). Only a few websites list this.
Lag / ping time: How fast or slow the server is. This is usually difficult to find out without logging in. If the server forum has a lot of recent posts complaining about lag, stay away.

, Is the server's forum post or website page nice to look at? Does it include information about the server rules, features, staff, and community? The best servers tend to invest time into their online presence, making it user friendly and informative.

, After all that, you'll need to try out the server to find out more. A good server should almost always have mods or admins online to answer your questions and tell you about the rules and server features. More importantly, join some games and conversations and see whether you enjoy the community., These servers feel the closest to playing in single-player Survival mode. Besides the chance to build and fight monsters with friends, many servers offer extra perks, like teleports between towns or shops where you can buy special items.


Towny and Economy servers are especially focused on trading items and making money.

, Player versus Player servers allow you to fight other players and destroy their bases. Some of the most popular are Faction or Raid servers, where teams of players wage war against each other.


KitPvP is a popular variation that allows players to choose classes or ""kits"" with different weapons and abilities.

, Some servers are dedicated exclusively to minigames, but almost all of the largest servers have at least a few you can play. Most server list websites use a tag system to list the available games. Parkour servers should have a large collection of fast minigames, such as Capture the Flag. If you want a more in-depth experience, try these popular options:


On Skyblock maps, you spawn on a floating island with monsters and limited resources, and must complete building challenges without dying.
Prison maps, usually on PvP servers, place you in a guarded compound with very limited resources. If you can survive in a world with powerful NPCs and other players, you can advance in rank and gradually become more powerful.
On Infected/Zombie maps, ""human"" players try to survive and kill the ""zombie"" players before the infection can spread.

, Infinite items, the ability to fly, and no combat — if you care more about making things than mining or fighting, this mode is for you. Unfortunately, many big servers that advertise Creative mode only allow tiny building areas, or charge real money for it. If this is the main way you enjoy playing, your best chance is to find a small but active server, and talk to the admins in chat. If they get to know you and trust you, they can grant you the ability to enter Creative mode.

, If you enjoy acting in-character and telling a story with other players, find a Roleplay server. Even more than on other servers, it's important that you get along with the other players. Explore the server website thoroughly to see if it's the kind of world you'd like to live in.

Select the name tag.,
Equip your custom name tag.,
Locate an animal or a monster.,
Face a mob and select them.",How to Name a Mob in Minecraft," You'll need an anvil to customize your name tag later. To craft an anvil, you will need the following:


Three iron blocks - Each iron block requires nine iron bars, for a total of twenty-seven iron bars needed.

Four iron bars - These bars bring the iron total to thirty-one.
You can create iron bars by adding iron ore, which is the grey stone with orange-brown spots, into a furnace that has coal in it.;
, It will open to a three-by-three grid.

If you haven't yet crafted a crafting table, you can do so by placing a plank of wood in each of your inventory's four crafting slots.

, To do so, you'll place the three iron blocks in the top row of the crafting table grid, three of the four iron bars along the bottom row of the grid, and the final iron bar in the center of the grid, then select the anvil icon.

On the PE version of Minecraft, tap the black anvil icon on the left side of the screen.
On the console version of Minecraft, select the anvil icon in the ""Structures"" tab.

, You can only gather name tags in one of three ways:Fishing - Blank name tags are random catches when fishing.

Buying from villagers - Villagers will sell blank name tags for between 20 and 22 emeralds.

Looting fortresses - If you come across a chest in a fortress, an abandoned mine shaft, or a mansion, there is anywhere from a 22 percent to a 40 percent chance that you'll find a name tag.

, You'll need three sticks and two pieces of string to do so.

You can also combine two damaged fishing poles to craft a working pole.

, To fish, you'll cast out a line by right-clicking (or tapping, or pressing the left trigger) while facing a body of water with your fishing pole equipped. When your pole's bobber dips below the surface of the water and you hear a splashing noise, you'll press the ""Cast"" button again.

You'll likely catch a lot of fish and other junk before you reel in a name tag, since name tags are fairly rare.

, Villages are randomly generated structures situated around Minecraft's world. If you know of a village's location and you have plenty of emeralds, it may be faster for you to purchase a name tag than it is to fish for one.

To speak to a villager, face them and then right-click, tap, or press the left trigger.

, Chests inside of these areas have a reasonably high chance of producing a name tag. Since these structures are randomly generated, this method of acquiring name tags is incredibly inefficient if you don't already know where to find a fortress/mine shaft/mansion in your world.

Mansions are extremely rare.
As one might expect, looting a fortress entails a significant amount of risk due to loads of enemies.

, Your experience level, which is the green number near the bottom of your screen, must be at least one in order for you to craft a custom name tag., It will make a loud ""clank"" noise when you do so., To do so, open your inventory and move the tag to your character's hotbar, then select it. The tag will appear in your character's hand., This will open the anvil's crafting window with your name tag in place., You'll do this in the ""Name"" field at the top of the anvil's window.

On console editions, you'll first have to select the ""Name"" field and press A or X.

, Doing so will place it in your inventory., Once you see it in your hand, you're ready to assign a name to a mob.

On console editions of Minecraft, you can simply select the tag and press Y or Triangle.

, You'll want to take care whilst naming a hostile mob (e.g., a zombie), but naming animals like sheep or cows is a harmless task., As long as the name tag is in your hand, doing so will place a text box with your name tag's phrase in it above the mob's head.

You can repeat this process for as many mobs as you like, since your current name tag has unlimited uses.

Find an area with tall walls, preferably away from the lava lakes.",How to Mine in the Nether2," Netherrack should be all around you. Start mining! Netherrack is mined quickly, and you can get around 2 to 3 blocks per second with an iron or diamond pickaxe.


Netherrack is useful in the Overworld for many reasons: When lit, the fire on it will never burn out, unless extinguished by the player. It's texture is also very unique and different from other blocks in the Overworld.
An efficient way of mining Netherrack is to create a corridor in the enormous mountains of Netherrack. You can collect the Netherrack easily, and it is very simple to go back from where you started.
Netherrack can be smelted in a furnace to become Nether Brick.;

Find Nether Quartz Ore. Nether Quartz Ore spawns fairly commonly in the Nether, but the blocks aren't very close together.,
Collect a lot of Nether Quartz.",How to Mine in the Nether3," You need to get to a pretty tall spot, and look around for the Nether Quartz Ore. Then go to it and use your pickaxe to mine it; each ore should drop 1 Nether Quartz (more if your pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune).

, 4 Nether Quartz pieces put in a square in the crafting table give you 1 Block of Quartz, a whitish block. Quartz Blocks are only used for decoration; they have no unique characteristics.


A way to search for Nether Quartz Ore is to create a corridor inside the Netherrack. Every set amount of blocks, create smaller channels of 4-5 blocks to the sides of the main corridor. This exposes you to the most amount of blocks, increasing your chances of find Nether Quartz Ore.

"
"
Find a Nether Fortress.",How to Mine in the Nether4," They are huge structures of Nether Brick that spawn randomly in the Nether, created solely of Nether Brick, Nether Brick Stairs, and Nether Brick Slabs. Mine them, and you will get Nether Brick, which is an excellent decorative block in addition to having a high blast resistance.


Nether Fortresses are extremely dangerous. Blazes and Wither Skeletons lie in wait for your arrival so they can kill you. Besides these, there are Zombie Pigmen and Magma Cubes. On the bridges outside, Ghasts may attack you. It is suggested that you wear at least all iron armor, and bring nothing too valuable.

"
"
Inside the Nether Fortress, look around and try to find a nether brick staircase.",How to Mine in the Nether5," Sometimes, there is Nether Wart growing on Soul Sand around the staircases. Mine the Nether Wart and the Soul Sand as well. This way, if you place Soul Sand in the Overworld, you will be able to grow Nether Wart.


Nether Wart is crucial in brewing. They are used to create the Awkward Potion, a basic ingredient for other complex potions. You can grow them in the Overworld by placing them on Soul Sand.

Make silverfish mine for you.",How to Mine in Minecraft," This section gives a basic overview of mining. If you've been playing for a while, skip ahead to the intermediate or advanced instructions.
, If you've never been mining before, you'll need to make your first pickaxe. Here's how to make one that can mine through stone and less valuable ores:


Craft a wooden pickaxe (a column of two sticks below a row of wood planks).
Use the wooden pickaxe to break through a few stone blocks.
Craft a stone pickaxe (two sticks below three blocks of stone).

, Mining ends in two ways: a proud return with bags of loot, or death. To prepare for both scenarios, empty your valuables into a chest, leaving plenty of inventory space. Pack the following for your first short expeditions, besides the pickaxe:


Food
Wood
Sword (unless playing on Peaceful difficulty)


, Almost every player has died from a bad decision while mining, even with no enemies around. Prevent this by following these simple rules:Never dig through the block you're standing on, to avoid falling.
Never dig through the block right above you, to avoid falling gravel or lava.
Do not descend too deep or enter special areas (such as abandoned mineshafts) until you have better armor and weapons.

, Coal is the easiest ore to find, and looks just like stone studded in black flecks. The safest place to mine it is from hillsides, cliff faces, or shallow caves. Collect it with a pickaxe until you've mined at least two or three groups of coal ore.


Ore almost always spawns in groups larger than one block. Look carefully at surrounding blocks whenever you mine something.
Don't wander too far! Many players get lost for the first time when they start mining. Try pressing F3 to view your x-, y-, and z-coordinates, and write down the coordinates you'd like to return to.

, Place the coal above a stick in the crafting area, and make as many torches as you can. You can place these torches on any solid surface to make a permanent light source. Don't leave home without them.

, Because of wandering monsters, caves are more dangerous than digging an artificial mine. That said, they're also much faster and much more fun. Wander around until you see an opening in the ground or the side of a mountain.


Only coal will appear above sea level, so don't wander too high into the hills. You want a cave that extends down, although it doesn't have to be steep,

, You've probably seen monsters burn up in daylight, but the same will not happen underground. Away from the sun, monsters can wander all day and all night. Torches won't stop them, but they will reveal those zombies approaching.


If the cave has many branches, keep the torches along the right wall. If you get lost, you'll know to keep the torches on your right to go deeper, or on your left to get to the surface.

, Just like all ore, iron ore looks like a stone block with colored flecks. In this case, the flecks or beige or yellow-brown. Iron shouldn't be too hard to find, as long as you're looking a few blocks below sea level or lower.


Do not use a wooden pickaxe to mine iron. It will break the block and fail to drop ore.
Press F3 to view coordinates. Iron only shows up at a y-coordinate below 60, and is much more common below layer 50., Back up to the surface, collecting the torches you placed earlier. You've survived your first mining expedition, and the fruits of your labor will help you do even better on the second one. Before you jump down the next cave, make some iron tools:



Craft a furnace and place it on the ground.
Interact with the furnace and place the iron ore in the top slot.
Place wood, coal, or other flammable items in the bottom slot. Over time, the fuel will burn away and the ore will become iron ingots.
Use the iron ingots to make a better pickaxe, better sword, and (eventually) armor.

, Let's say you've done a fair amount of mining, but you'd like to make the process more efficient and profitable. At this point you should stock your inventory with plenty of basic equipment:Food, iron pickaxe, shovel, & your best combat equipment
Torches (several full stacks)
Coal
Crafting table and several chests
Two buckets of water
Ladders
Bed (if you're in a multiplayer game that skips night)


, Place a crafting table, chest, and furnace on the surface, either at a cave entrance or anywhere you plan to mine. Stash your valuables (besides mining and combat equipment) in the chest, so you can retrieve them if you die.

, Press F3 to view your coordinates and use the y-coordinate to guide you to the right area for the ore you seek (coordinates are given for PC edition):Diamond: Only layer 15 and below
Gold: Only layer 31 and below
Lapis lazuli: Mostly between layers 11 and 17
Redstone: Only layer 15 and below
Emerald: Only between layers 4 and 32 under Extreme Hills biomes
Iron: Mostly between layers 2 and 58
No specific purpose: Focus on layers 10–15.

, There are three basic approaches to starting a mine:


A large natural cave gives you a headstart with exposed ore on the walls. Be prepared to fight plenty of mobs and take special care to mark the paths you take with torches or signposts.
Dig your own vertical shaft to go straight to the best mining layers. Dig this in a 1 x 2 space so you never dig underneath your feet. When complete, build a way up with ladders, or pour water from the top to make a waterfall elevator that you can swim up and down.
Dig an angled shaft at a 45º angle, clearing enough room above you to jump back up. Optionally, place stairs along the shaft for faster movement up and down., Once you're at the right layer, clear out an area three to five blocks tall, and extend it horizontally to search for ore. Since all ore besides emeralds come in groups of two or more, you do not have to reveal every single block to find the vast majority of them. Try digging tunnels one block wide, with three solid blocks between them.Remember, never dig straight up or straight down.

, Lava usually spawns below layer 30, but it can show up higher than that. Keep an eye out for embers, popping noises, and red ceiling drips that hint at nearby lava. If you do unleash a lava river, quickly emptying a bucket of water can cool it into cobblestone or obsidian.


There's not much worse than mining diamond ore on the floor and watching it fall into lava. Dig around valuable ores first to check for this possibility.

, Even the most prepared miner can die in a freak accident. Place chests in well-lit, easy to find locations along your route back. Store your valuable ores in these chests to retrieve them on the way back, or to recover after you die.


If you have trouble keeping your sense of Minecraft direction, leave a trail of redstone dust to follow on your way back.
When exploring a cave, consider lighting each chamber first, then mining on your way back. This reduces the chance of an accident destroying your loot.

, There are two structures that appear fairly often underground. Identify them by the change of scenery, and know what to expect:


If you see mossy stone, you're near a dungeon. These are small rooms with a monster spawner and zero to two chests of loot.You can destroy the spawner or leave it there as a way to gain XP.
If you see wooden structures or rails, you've found an abandoned mineshaft. Look for chests inside of minecarts, and clip cobwebs with shears to get string. Be wary of spider spawners lurking beneath the webs., Minecraft cave systems can be quite expansive. If one branch ends in a dead end, especially one ending in dirt or gravel, there's often another cavern on the other side. Taking advantage of this sideways ""drifting"" can add major shortcuts to your mining., So you have a diamond pickaxe, a fortress the size of New York, and enough ore to make Scrooge McDuck envious. Now's the time to get serious. Enchant your pickaxes to improve their mining ability. Here are all enchantments available for tools:Fortune (max level III) increases the amount of ore you get per block. If you are lucky enough to get this one, save it for the extra-valuable ore only. Note that you cannot get Fortune and Silk Touch on the same item.
Silk Touch (max level I) mines entire blocks instead of ore. You'll need to mine the ore with a different pick to get the ore, but this does save on inventory space. It can be more valuable than Fortune if you're on a large multiplayer server and plan to sell the blocks.Efficiency (max V) speeds up mining and Unbreaking (max III) increases durability.

, Once you have diamond armor and a diamond sword, you may be ready to build a Nether portal. The area on the other side has several new blocks to mine, notably Nether quartz. There's nothing unusual about the mining itself, but be prepared to face very difficult enemies.

, If you don't mind laying tracks and tinkering with redstone, you can make your own subway system to transport goods. By digging branches off of the main subway tunnel, you can stay near your tracks and never run out of inventory space. See the linked article for details.

, Strongholds are the rarest and most valuable structures that show up underground. Look for mossy or cracked stone, which could potentially lead to a system of libraries, prisons, and chests. Each stronghold has an End portal which can be activated to reach a special endgame zone.You can find the strongholds using eyes of ender, gathered from the Nether.

, This technique is complex, dangerous, and requires a great deal of preparation. Most players will never even consider attempting this, but if you pull it off, you can mine incredibly quickly. Here's the gist:Enchant armor with at least Protection I. Brew splash potions of poison and regeneration.
Attract silverfish from the spawner found next to End portals. Construct a tunnel of glass so they can follow you without burrowing to you.
Prepare a high glass walkway in the next area you plan to mine. Build two Nether portals here, one for you on the walkway and one for the silverfish below you.
Lure the silverfish through a Nether walkway to the portal you just built, so they reach the area you plan to mine.
Throw splash potions of poison and regeneration on the crowd of insects. They will get hurt constantly but heal before they die, summoning more silverfish from the stone around them. In just a minute or two, the silverfish will mine through a massive area of stone, leaving the ore behind.

Avoid bedrock.,
If you are in a dungeon, find the mob spawner.,
When you see orange or hear water, stop.,
Always bring buckets and food.,
If possible, play with a buddy.,
If all else fails, play on peaceful or structures off.,
Remember to never dig straight down.",How to Mine Safely in Minecraft," Lava is most common down there, and so is water. Even if emeralds are there, you can't really do much with emeralds and they're more useless than gold. Slimes also bounce down there (in certain chunks), and it's a real pain in the neck to kill them all.;
, After you have located it, quickly torches on and around it. Putting only one torch on top of the spawner does don't prevent mobs from spawning, you have to place multiple torches to be safe. When you do this, it not only prevents mobs from spawning out of it, but also it is a great place to put a torch as it lights up nearly the entire room being in the middle.

, The Orange is lava and if it drips from the roof, lava is above you. Walk back to your typical staircase or ladder, and climb to another spot. When iron and coal ore are near to each other then this is a good sign of lava, and gold ore found in ravines or cave systems has a good chance to have water near.

, You can carry milk in buckets and also use then to clean up water and lava spills. When you have a bucket of lava and water, you can mix them to make obsidian (but this sometimes makes cobblestone) which is used to make enchanting tables and the Nether portal. Food is vital; no one wants to starve and die in mines near mobs!

, This enables you to stay safe from mobs and get the tools and mining done quicker, but also gives you and your buddy XP which is satisfying. This also means your buddy can bring extra food, bows, swords, pickaxes etc. Either way, this is really fun.

, This removes all mobs on peaceful so there is no fear of creepers or Slimes, making it easy to mine at bedrock. Playing with structures off means no water or lava, but careful; this means no dungeons, ravines, etc.

, You'll probably fall in lava.

Look for abundant blocks if you want your tower to have a uniform look.


Be mindful of materials effected by gravity, like sand or gravel., If you are trapped in your tower with no way down, use your bucket of water directly beneath you while falling to prevent fatal fall damage., The upper limit of a Minecraft world is 255 blocks tall, but the tallest tower you can make will start at block one. If you truly want to make the tallest tower possible, you will need to mine a deep hole to start your foundation at the lowest elevation possible.


In the PC version of Minecraft, you can check your altitude by pressing F3.

, Break out some grid paper and start sketching a design. Maybe you want to imitate the Gothic architecture. Or do you want a simple, unmistakable square shape to rise up into heaven? Don't forget to plan a means of getting up and down. Stairs will speed your vertical travels considerably.


It all depends on taste, but keep in mind that the wider the base of your tower, the more material it will take for you to complete it. The more material, the longer the time.

, These can be your inspiration! You could even use an existing structure as the foundation for your brand new tower.

, Building such a large structure in Minecraft can be very time consuming, and your tower might benefit from additional builders working on it. Invite your friends to join you in building the biggest and best tower in the world.

, A poorly planned foundation can limit your tower's upper range. If you are modifying an existing structure, begin with the lowest possible spot before building upwards evenly. Starting from scratch? Give yourself the max vertical height by digging down first.


Use dynamite to speed up the process.Blow a low spot in the landscape to make way for your tower building endeavors.

, Don't forget your water bucket, and keep in mind the base you have planned. Lay the foundation, and then build upwards.

, The in-game height limit is set to 255 blocks. Keep in mind that block one begins deep in the earth. Building your tower from block one to block 255 will require some excavation.

, Think about installing landings, which can be used to store materials or as a staging ground for the parts of your tower high up in the sky.

Make any potion throwable.",How to Make Potions in Minecraft," You will need several tools in order to create potions, as well as a source of water. You can create these tools using the Crafting Table.


Brewing Stand - This tool is required to brew potions. You can create it by placing three Cobblestone Blocks on the bottom row of the Crafting Grid, and a single Blaze Rod in the center of the grid.
Cauldron - A Cauldron is not required for crafting potions, but can be useful for keeping your water nearby while you're brewing, each Cauldron can hold a Bucket of water, which can fill three Bottles. You can craft a Cauldron by placing seven Iron Ingots around the edge of the Crafting Grid, leaving the top-center and middle squares empty.
Glass Bottles - Glass Bottles are required to hold your potions. You can sometimes get Glass Bottles from defeating Witches or by fishing, or you can craft them by placing three Glass Blocks in the Crafting Grid; one in the bottom-center square, one in the left-middle square, and one in the right-middle square. Crafting Glass Bottles will create three at a time.;
, Nether Wart is the primary ingredient for nearly all of the potions in Minecraft. The only potion that doesn't use Nether Wart as an ingredient is the Potion of Weakness.


Nether Wart grows in the Nether, and can be found in some Nether Forts, especially around staircases.
Nether Wart can be planted in Soul Sand to grow. This is essential if you intend to create a lot of potions, and can save you a lot of foraging time.

, Base potions don't have any effects, and need to have another ingredient added to make them do something. The ingredients you choose will dictate what kind of potion you create.


Spider Eye - Dropped by Spiders, Cave Spiders, and Witches. Used for poison potions.
Glistering Melon - You can craft a glistening melon by surrounding a Melon with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for instant health potions.
Golden Carrot - Can be crafted by surrounding a single Carrot with eight Gold Nuggets in the Crafting Grid. Used for night-vision potions.
Blaze Powder - Can be crafted by crafting a single Blaze Rod, dropped by Blaze enemies. This will produce two Blaze Powders. Used for strength potions.
Fermented Spider Eye - Can be crafted from a Spider Eye, Mushroom, and Sugar. Used for weakness potions.
Pufferfish - Can be caught by fishing. Used for water-breathing potions.
Magma Cream - Dropped by defeated Magma Cubes, and can be crafted by combining Blaze Powder and a Slimeball. Used for fire resistance potions.
Sugar - This can be crafted from single pieces of Sugar Cane. Used for speed potions.
Ghast Tear - Dropped by Ghasts. Can be difficult to obtain since Ghasts tend to hover over lava. Used for health regeneration potions.
Rabbit’s Foot - Dropped by defeating Rabbits (2.5% drop rate). Used for leaping potions. This is only available in 1.8

, You can further modify a potion by adding another ingredient after it is created. This will usually increase the amount of time the potion is active. You can also make potions throwable so that they splash on impact.


Redstone - You can find Redstone by mining Redstone Ore. This will typically yield 4-5 Redstone. This can make potions last longer.
Glowstone Dust - Can be obtained by breaking a block of Glowstone. You can receive up to four Glowstone Dusts per block of Glowstone. This can make potions stronger, but shorter.
Gunpowder - This can be found by defeating Creepers, Ghasts, and Witches. This makes potions throwable.
Fermented Spider Eye - This secondary ingredient can also be used to further modify potions. It typically reverses or corrupts the effects of the potion.

, All potions start with a Glass Bottle filled with Water. Fill three of your bottles from a water source. You can make three potions from one secondary ingredient, so make sure you are always being efficient and creating three potions at a time.

, This will open the Brewing Grid. There will be one square at the top, connected to three squares underneath. Place your water-filled Glass Bottles in the bottom three square.

, Place a Nether Wart in the top square of the Brewing Grid. The brewing process will begin, which 20 seconds. After the process is complete, your Glass Bottles will be filled with Awkward Potion. The Awkward Potion does not do anything, but is used as the base for actual potions.


If you are trying to make a Potion of Weakness, add any of the secondary ingredients listed in the previous section instead of the Nether Wart to make a Mundane Potion. This is the base for a Potion of Weakness. Adding a Fermented Spider Eye instead of a Nether Wart to immediately create a Potion of Weakness without the need of a base potion.

Find a pool of lava.,
Collect the lava in buckets.,
Dig a hole where you want the obsidian.,
Pour the lava into the hole.,
Send water over the lava.",How to Make Obsidian in Minecraft1," There is no crafting recipe for obsidian. Instead, any time flowing water hits a stationary lava ""source"" block, the lava turns into obsidian. You can find stationary lava in the following places:Lava is easiest to find as ""lava falls"" in caves and ravines. Only the top block is a source block.
Lava is very common in the bottom ten layers of the map. Dig down diagonally to avoid falling in it.
Rarely, you can find lava lakes on the surface, but never more than about twenty blocks above sea level.Some villages have a single smithy with two blocks of lava, visible from the outside.;
, Craft a bucket out of three iron ingots. Use the bucket on the lava to scoop it up. You can only scoop up stationary blocks of lava, not flowing lava.


In the computer crafting system, arrange the iron in a ""V"" shape.

, Make sure the hole is contained, and that nothing flammable is within two blocks in any direction. Wood, tall grass, and many other objects will catch fire near lava., Remember, only stationary (not flowing) lava will turn into obsidian. This means you will need one bucket of lava for every block of obsidian you want to make.


Remember, without a diamond pickaxe you cannot mine the obsidian without destroying it. Make sure you want obsidian in that location before you continue.

, Use your now-empty bucket to scoop up water. Bring it to the lava pool you created and place the water above the lava so it flows down onto it. When the flowing water hits the lava, the lava will turn into obsidian.


It's a good idea to build a temporary, non-flammable structure around the lava pool to prevent an annoying flood.

"
"
Obtain a diamond pickaxe.,
Locate a lava pool.,
Fence off the area.,
Pour water over the lava.,
Test the edge of the obsidian.,
Direct the water to flow where you mine.",How to Make Obsidian in Minecraft2," Obsidian is the only block that must be mined using a diamond pickaxe. Any lesser tool will destroy the obsidian if you try to mine it.

, Dig down almost to the bottom of the map and explore. It shouldn't take long to find a large pool of lava. Since you have a diamond pickax, you can turn the whole pool into obsidian at once, instead of transporting the lava in buckets.

, Create a small wall on one side of the pool, leaving room to put down a water block. This will reduce the chances of water pushing you into the lava.

, Put the water block down inside the fenced area, one level higher than the lava. It should flow down and turn the surface of the lake into obsidian.

, Stand at the edge and dig one block deep into the obsidian. There might be another layer of lava beneath it. If you're not careful, you may fall into this lava, or the obsidian bock item will fall before you can catch it, and burn up.

, If there is lava underneath the obsidian, stand next to the water and mine the obsidian at its edge. The water should rush in as you mine, turning the next layer into obsidian before the lava can cause any damage. Continue to mine as much obsidian as you need, moving the water when necessary.

"

Gather twenty obsidian by other means.,
Create a Nether portal.,
Travel through the Nether.,
Build a second portal.,
Mine the obsidian in the Overworld portal.,
Exit the same Nether portal to spawn a new one.",How to Make Obsidian in Minecraft3," It takes ten obsidian to make a Nether portal. Once you have enough for two portals, however, you can use a trick to get infinite obsidian without needing to find lava.

, If you don't have a portal already, place obsidian blocks in a vertical frame 5 tall x 4 wide. Activate it by using a flint and steel on the lowest obsidian block. This trick may not work if there is another portal close by.The corners of the portal do not have to be obsidian.

, The Nether is a dangerous place, so prepare yourself if you haven't been before. You'll need the remaining ten obsidian blocks, but you might want to leave them safely behind and explore a safe route first. You'll need to travel a certain minimum distance in a straight, horizontal line (these numbers include a 3-block margin of safety just in case):PC, Pocket Edition, and Console Edition ""large"" worlds: travel 19 blocks.
Console Edition ""medium"" worlds: travel 25 blocks.
Console Edition ""classic"" worlds (including all PS3 and Xbox 360 worlds): travel 45 blocks.
If you have multiple Overworld portals, walk away from their coordinates. This trick will not work if you are too close to an existing portal.

, Build this in the Nether and activate it the same way you did the first one. When you walk through it, you should appear in a brand-new portal in the Overworld.


If you appear next to a portal you already built, you did not walk far enough in the Nether. Go back to the Nether and break your portal with a diamond pickaxe, then rebuild it somewhere else.

, The portal that just appeared has fourteen obsidian blocks free for the taking. Mine these with a diamond pickaxe.

, Each time you walk through the Nether portal you just built, a new portal will appear in the Overworld. Mine this for free obsidian. Speed this up if you want a large amount of obsidian:


Use a bed to set your spawn near the permanent Overworld portal.
Place a chest near the temporary Overworld portal. Stash the obsidian and diamond pickaxe in the chest after mining the portal.
Kill yourself to return to spawn.
Walk through the Nether again and exit the same portal to create a new one. Build a tunnel between the Nether portals to increase safety.

"
"
Find the End portal.,
Mine the End platform.,
Mine the obsidian pillars.,
Return through the same end portal.",How to Make Obsidian in Minecraft4," The End portal leads to the final, most challenging area in Minecraft. Locating it and activating is a long quest involving many Eyes of Ender. Try this only when you're ready to face the fearsome Ender Dragon.


If you are on Pocket Edition, the End Portal will only work on infinite (not ""Old"") worlds running on version 1.0 or later (released December 2016).

, When you travel through the End portal, a platform of 25 obsidian blocks will appear for you to stand on. Mine it with the diamond pickaxe (though you may want to kill that dragon bothering you first).

, The island with the Ender Dragon has several tall towers with purple crystals atop them. The towers are made entirely of obsidian.

, You can return to the Overworld either by dying, or by defeating the Ender Dragon and walking through the exit portal that appears. Each time you walk through an End portal, te 25-block obsidian platform will respawn. This makes it one of the fastest ways to get infinitely recurring obsidian.


The obsidian pillars do not respawn unless you respawn the dragon. To bring back the dragon, place four ender crystals on top of the exit portal that appeared when the dragon died."

Fish for Name Tags.,
Trade with a librarian villager.,
Find Name Tags in chests.,
Pull up the anvil’s crafting menu.,
Name the tag.,
Name your villager.",How to Rename Villagers in Minecraft," Fishing is a simple activity where you cast out the line, wait for a bubble trail to appear towards your lure, and immediately reel it in once the lure is tugged on. If you time it right, you’ll either get nice, juicy fish to eat, some random “junk” to use, or rare items like Enchanted Books and Name Tags!


To cast your line, you right-click or press LT/L2 while facing a body of water. Reeling it in uses the same controls.

Click here for instructions on creating a Fishing Rod.
Fishing can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Name Tags are part of the “treasure” category of items found by fishing, and the overall chance to even acquire a treasure is about 5%. It might take a while before you can receive one, depending on how lucky you are.
For more experienced players, having a fishing rod enchanted with Luck of the Sea III would improve your chances of getting rarer items to 8%. This will not immediately assure you’ll get a Name Tag, however, but simply improves your chances to get “treasure” items.;
, If you’re lucky enough to have one, a librarian villager (the ones with white robes) will sometimes be partial to trade you a Name Tag for about 20-22 emeralds (the currency of villagers, acquired by trading) apiece as a late-tier trade. You can unlock these trades by trading with them enough times.

, If you’re extremely lucky, Name Tags have a small chance to be found in the chests found in Dungeons. Dungeons are uncommon, randomly-generated structures normally found underground. They are small rooms containing a chest or two, with a monster spawner in the middle of the room.

, A Name Tag must be renamed before use, since it’s blank and would defeat the purpose of naming something a “blank” name. Of course, before you can rename your tag, you need to figure out how your anvil works. You can pull up the anvil’s dedicated crafting menu by pressing X or square on the console or by right-clicking the anvil on the PC.


If you don’t have an anvil yet, it costs 3 Iron Blocks and 4 Iron Ingots. Click here for detailed instructions on crafting an Anvil.

, Place the tag in the first slot of your anvil’s menu, and select the box that says “Name Tag.” Then simply type in the new name you want to use for a villager, and take the Name Tag from the result slot.


You’ll need at least 5 experience levels to rename the tag. You can gain experience through various activities, such as killing mobs (both hostile and non-hostile), breeding animals, mining all ores (aside from Gold and Iron), and fishing.

, Now all that’s left is to go up to a villager and use the Name Tag on them! This is done by right-clicking (PC) or pressing LT/L2 (console) on your villager. Now, whenever you look at a villager, you’ll see their name hovering above their heads!

Place two blocks of Jungle wood on top of the easily breakable block in a sort of diagonal fashion.,
Break the easily breakable block.,
Stack more blocks to create a more arcing trunk.,
Take your leaves or wool, and go to the top of your tree trunk.,
Start by making a horizontal cross-shape with your leaf material about four blocks long per spoke.,
Add two more blocks on top of the first leaf layer.,
Create the downward arc of the leaves.,
Create diagonally-arching palm leaves.",How to Make Palm Trees in Minecraft," Minecraft, being an open-world survival sandbox game, allows to to go anywhere you like, so start by walking around until you find a place where you want to build your palm tree. Look for a suitable place, like a sandy beach, an oasis in the desert (patch of water surrounded by sand), or a savannah. These areas are great because they most resemble the areas where palm trees are most common in the real world.


Look for dry-looking areas next to bodies of water, with lots of sand or yellowing grass. There’s no guarantee that you’ll find the area immediately, since all the areas are randomly generated, but as long as you keep exploring, you’ll find them eventually!;
, Seeing as most available editions of Minecraft have several varieties of wood, for a more realistic-looking palm tree, Jungle wood would be best. It shares a similar texture to most real-life palm tree trunks. Jungle wood can be difficult to find though, since jungles are somewhat of a rare biome, but you can use Acacia wood or even Birch for the base of your trunk. To harvest wood for the trunk of your palm tree, walk up to the trunk of an Acacia, Birch, or Jungle wood tree. Hold down the left mouse button (PC), press the Right Trigger button (Xbox), or tap the object and hold (PE); this will harvest the wood for the trunk of your palm tree.

, You can use most types of leaf block except (ironically) for Jungle leaves, since the texture has those yellowish bulbs in them and ruins the illusion of the palm leaf. You can use Green Wool, since it's visually close to the color and texture of palm leaves.


To gather leaves, you must first craft Shears to cut them with. Craft Shears using 2 iron ingots laid out diagonally on your inventory’s crafting grid. You can access your inventory by pressing the E button (PC), the Y (Xbox), or by tapping on the crafting table (PE). Next, simply select your tool, and hold down the left mouse button (PC), press the Right Trigger button, or tap (PE) on the leaves.
Green Wool can be made by putting green dye next to your wool on the crafting grid. Green dye can be acquired by smelting a cactus block in your furnace.

, On the PC, you can do this by pressing the number corresponding to your item in your hotbar, which can be located on the bottom of your screen, or using the mouse scroll button to select your item, then right-clicking on the area. On the Xbox, you can select your items by pressing the Right and Left Bumper buttons, then placing them by pressing the Left Trigger button. On the Pocket Edition, simply tap on the desired item.


If your material is missing from the hotbar, access your inventory and place it on your hotbar. If your hotbar is full, select an item you want to put in the inventory, then select an empty slot in your inventory to deposit it in. Alternately, select your desired item from the inventory, then select the item you want to replace and place it where your desired item was.
This is how the trunk should look like when viewed from the front:
w = wood
f = foliage block
e = easily breakable block
w
w
w
This pillar will serve as a base for your tree.

, Dirt is the most common to use. Wood planks, a different kind of wood block, and even clay blocks would suffice if you don’t have dirt.

, It should look like this:
w
w e
w
w

, This will make the illusion of a bent trunk more convincing, and should look like this:
w
w
w
w

, To do this, stack another block on top of the diagonally placed block, and place another block diagonally from that one. Finally, add the last block horizontally from the direction your arc is facing, like so:
w w
w
w
w
w
w


And there you go! A nice, arching trunk!

, You would need to invest in some more easily-breakable material to access the top of your tree trunk easily. Simply go beside your tree, preferably at the side or a space away from the tip of the arc, point your camera downwards, jump using the spacebar (PC), pressing A (Xbox), or the square symbol on the screen (PE), then place out block below you. This is the easy way to “build up,” as it were. Once you’re done with the top of the tree, break the pillar of easily breakable material so that the tree looks more natural.

, Then add two blocks on top of the center and the spoke facing the direction the arc is. It should look like this from the top:
L= leaf
X = empty space
Top layer
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
Bottom layer
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
L L L L L L L
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X
X X X L X X X

, One should be placed on the center and the other must face the same direction as the tree’s arc. This will enforce the illusion of arching leaves that all palm trees have.

, Like with your trunk, place any block below a spoke, put another leaf material block in the same direction your spoke is facing, then break the support block again to create a downward arc. It would look like this from the side:
l = leaf
w = wood
L L
L L L L L L L
L w w L
w
w
w
w
w


Repeat for the other spokes,and there you have it! A simple palm tree! You can stop here if you want, but the next step adds another set of leaves so it looks even more convincing.

, This step is mostly optional but would make the tree look more convincing and natural. You can build diagonal leaves by creating a two-by-two block between the corners of the spoke, then destroying two blocks diagonally. You can then repeat the step with the outermost diagonal block as the corner block, and then repeating until it's a straight diagonal line. Afterwards, just combine the step for creating a downward arc with this method to create a diagonally-arcing palm leaf.
L X X L X X L

You can also trade with a villager for a saddle.
Saddles cannot be crafted.;
, You can give a horse gold apples, bread, wheat, sugar, plain apples, or golden carrots. Feeding horses food before taming them makes taming them quicker.


Golden apples give the best chances of taming a horse.

, You must always be holding a raw fish while taming, even during the approach.

, Do not run at it. Walk toward it only when it’s facing away from you. When it turns to face you, stop immediately to keep it from sprinting away.


There should be at least a 7x7 open space around the ocelot to prevent it from feeling trapped or scared.
Do not aim your crosshairs yet on the ocelot. When you’re close, remain holding the fish. Do not take a single step, jerk the mouse, or aim at the ocelot with your crosshairs to prevent it from getting frightened.
The ocelot will then approach you cautiously while maintaining it’s gaze directly at you. It will stop a few blocks away from you.

, When it stops, slowly and carefully move your crosshairs toward it and right-click while holding the fish.


The ocelot may emit hearts while eating the fish, but taming will only be successful when it turns into a cat.
An ocelot must come close to you voluntarily in order to be tamed.
When tamed successfully, ocelots turn into one of the 3 breeds of cats that follow you around.

Teleport a player somewhere else.",How to Teleport in Minecraft1," Teleporting is a special command, and is only available in specific situations:


If you're playing online, you need Operator access for the server. To become an operator, an existing admin or operator needs to type /op YourName into the chat window.
In local multiplayer, the game needs to be started with Cheats enabled. This needs to be done by the player opening the game to local multiplayer.
For single player, Cheats need to be enabled when creating the world (""More World Options..."").;
, Minecraft uses three coordinates (XYZ) to determine player location in the world. The ""X"" coordinate is the position east or west of the spawn point. The ""Z"" coordinate is the position north or south of the spawn point. The ""Y"" coordinate is the elevation above bedrock. Sea level is Y:63. Your spawn point may not be at exactly 0,0,63, as this is sometimes underwater.


You can view your current coordinates in game by pressing F3, Fn+F3 (laptops and Macs), or Alt+Fn+F3 (newer Macs).
If you're playing with others, you'll be able to teleport to someone by using their player name.

, You can open this by pressing T.

, If you want to teleport yourself to someone else in the same server, enter the following command. Make sure that the player's name does not contain any spaces:/tp PlayerName

, You can teleport to any location in the world by entering the coordinates. If you aren't sure about the Y coordinate (common with village-finding tools online), enter ""83"" to try to avoid teleporting into something and suffocating. You may fall for a bit, but you should be able to survive:



/tp X Y Z (e.g. /tp 517 72 -169)
Note that X and Z must use numbers between -30,000,000 to 30,000,000. The Y coordinate must be positive.
You can replace the coordinates with relative positions by using a ~. For example, /tp 200 ~10 200 will teleport you to X,Z:200,200 and 10 blocks above your current elevation. Relative coordinates can only teleport the player as far as the world allows; anything further results in a game crash. Relative coordinates can be used to go to negative Y values.

, You can use the teleport command to move any player on the server:


/tp TargetPlayer XYZ OR DestinationPlayer
Teleport a player to your current location by typing /tp TargetPlayer @P}}.
You can teleport all players to yourself by typing /tp @a @p.

Mine nether quartz.,
Craft the daylight sensor.,
Deposit the sensor.,
Transform it to detect night instead.,
Connect it to a redstone lamp.,
Adjust the timing.",How to Make Lights That Turn on at Night in Minecraft1," The daylight sensor is the easiest way to make a ""night light,"" but you'll need a Nether portal to find the ingredients. Nether quartz ore isn't hard to find once you're in the Nether, but be prepared for difficult combats. Each sensor requires three nether quartz.


If you're not at this stage of the game yet, try the DIY sensor below.;
, Create a daylight sensor with the following ingredients:


Three glass in the top row
Three nether quartz in the middle row
Three wood slabs (not planks) on the bottom row

, Place the sensor anywhere you like. It is a half-height block, with a beige upper surface. By default, this sensor will provide power when sunlight hits it. The brighter the sunlight, the stronger the signal.

, There are two ways to change this sensor's behavior:Surround it with opaque blocks to make it a night sensor. This will send a power signal only at night, reaching peak strength at midnight (time 17780–18240).

Or right-click it to make it an inverted sensor (blue surface). This sends out a stronger signal in dark conditions. Unlike the night sensor, this can turn on in the daytime during rainy or stormy weather.

, Place a line of redstone from the sensor to a redstone lamp. Depending on which sensor you used, the lamp will either turn on at night, or anytime the sensor is dark.


To make a redstone lamp, surround a glowstone block with four redstone dust.
Night sensors (but not inverted sensors) will blink on and off if the lamp they are connected to is exposed to the outside sky or window. Place the lamp in a windowless room to prevent this, or right-click the sensor to invert it.

, These sensors don't just have two states. They will gradually increase and decrease in power over the course of each day/night cycle. To make your lamp turn on earlier in the dusk, shorten the redstone path or insert some redstone repeaters to boost the signal. To make the lamp stay off until later at night, lengthen the redstone path.


To make a redstone repeater, place redstone dust in the center with a redstone torch on either side, all above three stone blocks.
Redstone repeaters have a front and a back. Make sure to place it so the signal goes in the right direction.

Make paper!",How to Make Paper in Minecraft," The Crafting Table is the most essential tool of Minecraft, since without it, you can’t create any tools, blocks, or items needed for elaborate builds or survival. To make a Crafting Table, you’ll first need some Wood. Go and punch some trees to get some Wood (1 Wood creates 4 Wood Planks in your basic Crafting Grid, which is all you need).


To punch a tree, simply Press and hold the left mouse button (PC), press the Left Bumper button (Xbox) while facing the trunk, or simply tap the trunk with your finger (PE).
If you already have a Crafting Table, you can go ahead to the section on making paper.;
, Now press the E key (PC), the X button (Xbox), or the icon (PE) to view your inventory. You’ll see, aside from several boxes where your items are stored in, a set of four empty boxes arranged into a box formation with an arrow pointing towards a single empty box. That is your initial Crafting Grid, where you can make various things. However, seeing as it only has 4 slots in the grid, you can’t make anything complicated with it, which is why you need a Crafting Table.

, Do this by selecting it (clicking on it for the PC versions, scrolling to it with the RB and LB buttons on the Xbox, and tapping it in PE), and you’ll see that an item appears on the single box. You’ll see that you got 4 Wood Planks for your single Wood.


If you’ve got more wood, feel free to convert it all to planks, but for now, all you’ll be needing are 4 Wood Planks

, You’ll see another item on the rightmost box again. Take that item, and you now have a Crafting Table!

, Do this by right-clicking or pressing the Left Trigger button on your controller. Now you can use the Crafting Table to make paper!

, Now, you need to explore the nearby area to find your Sugarcane. They can be found beside bodies of water and resemble a cluster of tall bamboo or reeds, and each individual unit of it can be placed on a block directly beside water to grow more. It’s pretty easy to spot them as long as you keep an eye out for water. They’re common enough that most players can probably spot a few growing near their starting areas.

, You can gather sugar canes the same way you gathered Wood. Just punch at it.

, Once you’ve enough Sugar canes, access your Crafting Table’s menu by facing the table and right-clicking or pressing the X button.

, Place 3 Sugarcanes in a row. It will result in 3 pieces of Paper from the slot next to the grid.

Right-click to invert the sensor, then place a line of redstone dust extending from any side of it. Place short branches of redstone off of this line, with a redstone lamp at the end of each branch. When you reach the limit of the sensor's range (when the redstone is no longer glowing), place a redstone repeater to keep the power line going.


Keep in mind the power signal will decrease as it brightens. If you have a long line, the lamps farthest away from the sensor will go out first as dawn approaches.

, Place three or four fence poles on top of each other to make one tall one, and top it with a redstone lamp. Place redstone dust on top of this lamp, then a daylight sensor on top of the redstone. Surround the redstone with more redstone lamps for extra light, then right-click the sensor to invert it.

Understand that the /testfor command, although able to be used by a player, is meant to be used in command blocks.,
Type /testfor and hit enter.,
Make the most basic application.,
Use this to power a second command block, this one running many commands.,
Use the data tag command.,
Use another data tag, Inventory.,
Use multiple data tags at once, just separate them with a coma.",How to Use /Tesfor for Map Making Purposes (Minecraft)," If you don't know how to get a command block, all you need to do is type: ""/give (Player) minecraft:command_block"". You cannot find this block in the creative inventory.;
, It gives you the syntax of the command. But as explained, it is meant to be used in a command block. If this is in a Adventure Map, you don't know who you will be testing for. So where you type player, you can use some fillers. These include: @p(Targets the nearest player), @a(Targets all players), @r(Targets random player), or @e(This targets all entities. This was added in the 1.8 update.)


The last part of the syntax is a data tag. This will be covered later.







, This is to see if a player is online. However, it is easier to just press your tab button on your keyboard (in Multiplayer). However, you can have a comparator take an output from a command block, just like it can take from a chest. To do this, place a comparator with the input against the command block. It the command succeeds (finds the player), it will give a redstone signal.

, One of the easiest is /tell, having it tell you something. You can you use /tellraw for a more aesthetic look, but this requires a JSON text, and that is a completely different subject, one that requires it's own tutorial. The first command block tests for a player, and the second one tells you that this player is online.

, We will cover and explain two types, but the rest you will have to do some research to learn. In the command syntax, you would type: ""/testfor (Player) (Data Tag)"". Data tags are written in brackets({}). One Data Tag is the Selected Slot tag. To use this, type: ""/testfor (Player) {SelectedSlot:(Slot #)}"" The slots are listed starting at 0, so your first hotbar slot is actually slot 0. Your second hotbar slot is slot 1, and so on.

, The syntax for this one is tricky. Type ""/testfor (Player) {Inventory:}"" This only works for hotbar slots.

, For example, type: ""/testfor (Player) {SelectedItemSlot:0,Inventory:}""."

Open your furnace.,
Place fuel in the bottom slot on the left.,
Place the item to be processed in the top left slot.,
Wait for it to finish.",How to Use a Furnace in Minecraft," This is done by clicking the ""use"" button while aiming at the furnace. The preset button for this is the right mouse button.


You'll obviously need to craft a furnace first, if you haven't done already.;
, You'll need to carefully determine which kind of fuel you need, as each kind of fuel smelts/cooks a different amount of items. While one bucket of lava can process 100 items, charcoal can only process 8, and saplings only half an item (so you'll need two to process one item). For a complete list of fuels and how much items they can process, check out this table

, You can burn wood to make charcoal, smelt iron ore into iron ingots, or cook food so it replenishes more hunger.

, The furnace will keep working until it's either run out of items to process or fuel.


Note that sleeping in a bed will not speed up or skip the furnace.

Try out even more commands.",How to Use Command Blocks in Minecraft," Only the computer edition of Minecraft has command blocks. They are not yet available for Minecraft Pocket Edition or Minecraft for gaming consoles.;
, Command blocks are in-game items that give access to the Minecraft console. They are powerful tools that let you reshape the whole game — but because of this, they are only available in certain circumstances:


On a multiplayer server, only the server operators can use command blocks. You'll need to ask an operator to promote you, or host your own server.
In a single-player world, you'll need to enable cheats if they weren't enabled at world creation. Open the menu and click Open to LAN, check the ""Allow Cheats"" box, and click Start LAN world. This will only last one play session, but you can repeat it each time you want to add more command blocks.

, Now that you have console access, you can switch to creative mode. This is the only mode that lets you place and program command blocks. Use the following command to accomplish this:


Hit T to open the console (the chat bar), or press / to open it and automatically enter / to the line you are typing.
Type /gamemode c and hit Enter to enter creative mode.
Once you're done setting up command blocks, type /gamemode s for survival mode or /gamemode a for adventure mode.

, Open the console again with T and type this command: /give (yourusername) minecraft:command_block 64 . Instead of (yourusername), type in your full Minecraft username, without parentheses.


Your username is case sensitive.
If nothing happens, you may need to update minecraft to at least version 1.4. Update to the latest version to get access to all commands.
You can replace the ""64"" with any number to receive that many blocks. 64 makes a full stack of command blocks.

, Check your inventory and look for the command blocks you just created. The icon is a brown, patterned box with grey control panels on each side. Move the command blocks to your quick slot and place one on the ground, just as you would any item.

, Walk up to the command block and right-click to open it, as you would a chest. A window should pop up with a text box.


If nothing happens, command blocks might be disabled on your multiplayer server. Someone with access to the server.properties file will need to open that file and set enable-command-block to ""true"" and op-permission-level to ""2"" or higher.

, You can enter just about any command in the command block's text field, then press Done to save it in the block. There's a long list of commands included below, but try summon Sheep for your first experiment.


To learn more commands, open the regular console (not the command block) and type /help.
Unlike the regular console, a command block's text box does not need to start with the / symbol.

, Connect a trail of redstone dust to the command block, and place a pressure plate on top of the redstone. Walk over the pressure plate to activate the redstone, and a sheep should appear next to the block. This will happen whenever any player or mob activates the redstone.


This works just like a regular redstone activation. You can replace the pressure plate with a button, lever, or other activation method of your choice. You can even place the button directly on the command block.
Anyone can use the command block once it's set up, but only players with the right permissions can change the command.

, For the most part, command block text works the same as the regular console. If you aren't familiar with the console yet, check out the example section below to get started. If you already know how to use console commands, these are the only extra terms you need to learn:



@p targets the player nearest to the command block, no matter how far away she is.

@r targets a random player, anywhere on the server.

@a targets every single player on the server, including yourself.

@e targets every ""entity"" on the server. This includes practically anything that isn't a block, including players, objects, enemies, and animals. Be careful messing with this one.
You can use these terms wherever you would use a player name or entity name (although these terms still work fine).

, You can create extra-specific commands by adding modifiers after @p, @r, @a, or @e. These use the at . There are many different arguments and values available. You can look up the full list online, but here are some examples to get you started:


A command that includes @rwill affect a random sheep.

@eaffects everyone in creative mode. The ""m"" argument stands for mode, and ""c"" stands for creative.
Use the ! symbol to make the opposite value. For example, @awill affect every player not on team Commando. (Teams only exist on special player-made maps.)

, If you know a command, but aren't sure what you can use it for, press Tab and the game will fill it out for you. Press Tab a second time to scroll through a list of options.


For example, go back to your sheep-summoning block and delete the word ""Sheep."" Press Tab to cycle through a list of possible entities to summon.

, Save the command tp @p x y z into a command block. Instead of x, y, and z, enter the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the location you'd like to teleport (for example, /tp @p 0 64 0). When anyone activates this box, the player nearest to the box will vanish and reappear at those coordinates.


Press F3 to display coordinates.
Just like any command, you can replace the ""@p"" with another term. If you type your username, you'll always be the one teleported, even if someone else activates the block. If you use @r, a random player on the server will be teleported.

, Assuming you're using Minecraft 1.7 or later, you can make command blocks to summon any entity or block. Here are some examples:


A command block with summon Boat stored will add a new boat next to the block every time the block becomes activated. The people of your server will never need to wait for a ferry again.
To spawn a block instead of an entity, use the setblock command instead of the summon command. setblock minecraft:water 50 70 100 turns the block at the coordinates 50-70-100 into water. If there was already a block there, it disappears.

, The kill command will permanently destroy an entity. This one is dangerous to use, since a typo could end up destroying the wrong thing (or even your entire world if you use @e). kill @rdestroys a random painting within a 50 block radius of the command block.

, time set day or time set 0 will set the level of sunlight to the specified amount. Try different values instead of 0 to make it any time you like. Once you're tired of ruling over perpetual sunshine, make a block with toggle downfall or weather rain to start the rain.

"
Don't try to explore deeply before you have a good home base set up near the soon-to-be-mine.,
Spend a few game days preparing.,
Go select a good cave to start mining once you have enough materials.,
Build a shelter of cobblestone completely covering the entrance to your mine.,
Return home.,
Enter your mine.,
Craft a few yellow (or your choice) carpets.,
As soon as you collect 8 iron ore and some coal, go back to your shelter and smelt it.,
If you come to the end of a tunnel, congratulations.,
When you break your tools, you can drop your crafting table and make some more on the fly (make sure to pick it back up), or you can return to your shelter.,
When you've gone deep enough in your mine that returning to your shelter is inconvenient, just build another one complete with crafting table, bed, water source, and all.,
When you start to run low on wood or wool, you'll be returning home.",How to Turn a Cave Into a Mine in Minecraft," Only go deep enough to find a few stacks of cobblestone, at least half a stack of coal, and 8 iron ore.


Use the iron to make 2 buckets and a pair of shears.
Have at least one 9x9 plot for food. (If you're short on flat building space, you can line the top of your house with dirt.)
Have at least two 9x9 plots for trees. Birch is best, as it is the easiest to harvest quickly. You can easily fit 25 birch trees in a 19x19 (four 9x9 plots without interior fences) plot.
Plant a torch next to each tree so they will grow at night. If you have the time and the cobblestone to spare, consider making the entire plot cobblestone except for where you'll plant the trees. This will make replanting easier.
Make at least one, but preferably three, 9x9 plots for sheep. Dye your sheep 3 different colors. Red, green, and yellow are fairly basic choices, as they're intuitive, easily visible, and the dyes are easy to acquire. Now you're ready to start financing your expedition.;
, Shear your sheep, then cut your trees. Shear your sheep again. Collect your saplings and replant your trees. Shear your sheep. Harvest and replant your food. Rinse. Repeat.

, It's best to carve yourself a 3 meter (9.8 ft) wide road from your home to your mine with slabs or steps so you don't have to jump or fall when travelling--jumping increases hunger. One torch every 10 meters (32.8 ft) is sufficient to keep monsters from spawning on your road.

, Be sure to include a double chest for loot, a bed, a crafting table, a furnace, and a 2x2 pit for an infinite water source. Put a door to the mine and a door to the world. Build a small (3x6 meter is enough) fenced-in area in front of your door. This will allow you to kill any monsters you find hanging out when you come out of your mine. Now put pressure plates on the safe sides of your doors and fence gate. This way the door automatically closes behind you. Make sure to light the outside of your shelter so no monsters spawn in your safe zone.

, Gather resources again.


You need to leave home with:

2 stone pickaxes, 1 stone sword, 2 stone shovels, and 1 stone axe
1 stack of food, 1/4 stack of seed, 2 buckets of water, and 2 stacks of dirt
1 stack of torches, 1/2 stack of cobblestone, 1 stack of each color wool, 1 stack of logs, 1 stack of sticks, 1 stack of planks, and 1 crafting table.


Don't bother with leather armor; it takes more time than it's worth.

, Immediately walk a reasonable distance, throwing torches down blindly while you kill monsters. Return to your door. As you're killing monsters, try to locate all directions they can come from. Block them all off with dirt. Now that you're in a big room by yourself, you have time to think and plan. Light this room enough that no monsters can spawn.

, Throw three of them down in the middle of the room in an arrow pattern, pointing to your door, then put a torch right next to them. Double-check each wall of dirt to make sure no monsters can get into your room. Don't forget to look up, as monsters can survive a fall of a few meters. Put a block of red wool in or near each wall blocking unexplored areas. Block off any sources of running water or lava. Dump water from your bucket near (not on) any standing pools of deadly lava to turn it into less-deadly obsidian. Now mine this room of any valuable ores. Build stairs and paths to any inaccessible areas. Optional: clean up the room so it's not a disgusting mess; you're not a child. Now, pick a direction to continue. Dig out a 1x2 entrance to the next space. Repeat step 1. Place a yellow arrow pointing home every time there's a fork in the road. Collect the dirt walls, and the red wool, that you no longer need.

, One coal smelts 8 ores, so do this every time you get 8 or 16 iron ore.  The first item you'll need to craft is an iron pickaxe, to mine ores that you can't mine with a stone pickaxe. (Later you may choose to use iron tools entirely, but for now only use it when you have to.) The next item is an iron sword. Then start making armor. You'll have a full kit before you know it.

, Mine a few blocks extra just to be sure there's nothing hiding behind it, then turn around. When you come back to a fork, place a block of green wool at the entrance to your cleared tunnel so you know not to bother going that way again. Start off in a new direction.

, It's probably best to only return to your shelter when your inventory starts to fill up. When you do return to your shelter, first replace your broken tools. Next, replenish your stock of torches. Finally, drop your extra loot in your chest. If night has fallen, sleep in your bed at least once so that if you die you'll respawn in your shelter instead of back home.

, Continue doing this until you're two or three safe rooms deep into your mine. Here you'll want to start a mini-farm to replenish your food supplies. You may want to plant a couple of trees, but you'll most likely run out of wool before wood becomes a problem.

, Remember never to go home without taking a full load of loot back with you. Congratulations, your Steve has learned a trade."

As you conquer the first hundred, begin to explore the sealed off portion of the cave.",How to Turn a Cave Into a House on Minecraft,";
, Caves can be found in the sides of mountains and on the seashore. They can also be found underground by digging down low.

, There will be mobs in the cave that you will need to kill. This usually means two stacks of torches, a sword, food and wood blocks.

, This will prevent mobs from spawning inside your house at night.

,,, This can be things such as smoothing some of the walls, adding paintings and furniture, or just flattening the floor and adding stairs.

Get lots of raw fish.,
Wait for the ocelot to approach you.,
Be in an area that allows for plenty of escape for the ocelot.,
Be somewhere that no hostile mobs are attacking in.,
Hold the raw fish at all times during taming.

,
Never look directly at an ocelot when attempting to tame it.,
Get close to the ocelot with great care and stealth.,
Wait for an approach.,
Stay still when the ocelot is within 5 blocks of you.,
Wait for the ocelot to stop a few blocks from your character.,
Wait for the ocelot to transform into a tame cat.,
Repeat the feeding if the cat transformation has not occurred.,
If the ocelot transforms into a cat, you have successfully tamed it.",How to Tame an Ocelot in Minecraft," Raw fish can be obtained by fishing. Use a fishing rod over a water body and amass the fish in your inventory. You'll need at least five fish and maybe up to 20, to lure the ocelot to you.

A fishing rod can be made with 3 sticks and 2 string which you can get from killing spiders. In the crafting table, place the sticks diagonally from top left to bottom right and place the string to the left vertically.



 


Do not cook the fish. Ocelots are only attracted by raw fish.;
, This is an absolute requirement or taming the ocelot will not occur––if you try to approach the ocelot, it'll assume you're chasing it and take off. Moreover, trapping or cornering an ocelot will not result in taming.


The ocelot will possibly come to you when you are holding a raw fish.
Do not be threatening in any way.

, Your character must be situated somewhere that has a 7x7 minimum horizontal block area. This will allow the ocelot to feel safe rather than trapped.

, Taming will not take place if hostile mobs are attacking at the same time. And never have chickens or other animals around.

,, This means keeping the crosshairs off it.

, The ocelot will be easily frightened away.


Walk at normal speed if you need to move nearer to keep apace with the ocelot, but don't get too close while moving. Only use walking to get nearer, then cease moving.
When drawing closer to the ocelot, if it turns to face you, stop moving immediately.

, If an ocelot turns around and faces you, this may be an opportunity for it to approach you.


Stand still if possible. This is the best way to attract the ocelot.
If you want to, try sneaking––this might work without disturbing the ocelot. (Try holding sneak, while the mouse sensitivity is set to yawn.)

, Keep holding the raw fish without moving or looking directly at the ocelot.


Wait for the ocelot to stare at your character and approach timidly. If the conditions are right, the ocelot will slowly walk towards you.

, When this happens, slowly pan the crosshairs over to the ocelot and right click the raw fish on the ocelot. Stay still while the ocelot feeds.

, The taming process is not complete until the ocelot becomes a cat; while there may be a heart or puff effect evident after eating the fish, only the cat transformation is confirmation of a successful taming.

, Use quick repeated right-clicks without jerking the camera or moving. Any movement can scare away the ocelot before it is tamed.

, There are three possible breeds of cat that it may transform into––Siamese, ginger tabby and tuxedo (black and white).


A tamed ocelot (cat) ceases to be afraid of humans. It will meow and purr quite often. It will follow you around and sit on demand (simply right click).
Cats will sit on everything, including chests, which can be a nuisance as the chest won't open until the cat gets off it!
Expect creepers to flee when your cat is by your side.

, They can be dropped by skeletons and wither skeletons, obtained from chests in desert temples and jungle temples, or caught by fishing. Then walk up to the wolf and right click on it with the bones. It may take multiple tries and will consume your bone. After you tame it, you can make the dog either sit or follow you by right clicking on it. When it is tame, it will be sitting by default, so you will have to right click it to get it to follow you.

, Make sure both dogs are at full health, then breed them by feeding any kind of raw or cooked meat (including rotten flesh) but not fish. You can feed them by right clicking.


The two dogs should go into love mode and breed a baby dog.

, Usually, the baby is already tamed. You can also make the baby sit or follow you. When the puppy is born, it will have low health, so you should feed it to bring it back to maximum health.

Saddles cannot be crafted. You can find saddles in naturally appearing treasure chests, get them by trading with villagers.You can find them by fishing as well, but they will show up only about 1 in 120 tries with an ordinary fishing rod.;
, Horses will only spawn in Savanna or Plains biomes.These are mostly flat, grassy areas with a few scattered trees. Horses come in several different colors and have slight pattern differences as well.


Donkeys are found in the same locations. They are smaller than horses and have longer ears. They are tamed in the same way, though there are other differences explained below.

, Select an empty spot on your hotbar, so you are not holding anything. Right-click the horse to move onto its back.


On consoles, use the basic control for interacting with objects.

, The first time you try to ride the horse, it will almost always buck and kick your character off. Just keep getting back on; each time you try the chance of succeeding is higher. Eventually, a swarm of hearts will appear around the horse. This means it is tamed.Keep reading to learn how to control the horse.


You have roughly a 5% chance of taming on your second try, and can usually tame a horse within six attempts.You might get unlucky and have to try several more times, though.

, This is usually unnecessary, but try it if the horse keeps throwing you and you get frustrated. Just hold the food in your hand and right-click the horse. This will use up your food, but make future taming attempts easier.Each unit of sugar, apple, and wheat helps a little, adding another 3% to your chances.
Golden carrots add another 5% chance, and golden apples add a 10% chance. You might want to save these for breeding, however, as described below.

Breed horses.",How to Tame a Horse in Minecraft2," Hold the saddle and right-click the horse to put it on. When you get on a saddled horse (or donkey), you'll be able to move around with the usual controls.


Horses can jump much higher and farther than your character. Hold down the jump button to charge up a bigger jump.To dismount, press the left Shift key on a computer, or the right trigger button on a console.

, Use a lead (leash) on the horse to tie it to your hand. The horse will now follow you around. While holding the horse, use the lead on a fence post to tie the horse to it. To detach the lead without tying the horse to anything, use the lead a second time on the horse.To make a lead, hunt for slimes (hostile green cubes) underground or in dark swamps, and kill them to get slimeballs. Craft a lead by placing a slimeball in the center of the crafting table, then adding string to the top left, top center, middle left, and bottom right squares. (Kill spiders to get string.)

, The main difference between horses and donkeys is what you can equip onto them. While riding the animal, open your inventory to see their equipment slots:


Horses can wear armor, protecting them from damage. You'll need special horse armor, which you can only find in treasure chests or by trading with villagers.Donkeys can hold a chest, which you can store items in as usual., Feed two nearby horses golden apples or golden carrots. They will approach each other, and a small foal will appear. The foal cannot be tamed until it grows up, which takes about twenty minutes. You can speed up the growth by feeding it non-golden food.Craft a golden apple by placing an apple in the center of the crafting area, then surrounding it with eight golden ingots.
Craft a golden carrot with a carrot at the center, surrounded by gold nuggets.
Breed a horse and donkey together to make a mule. Mules carry chests like donkeys, but cannot breed with any other animal.

Learn how using this guide to installing mods, if you've never tried it before. (Note that this can be difficult or impossible on some versions of iOS.) You can search for horse mods on your own, or look up the mods named ""Horses"" created by Argll or Bernard.Download mods at your own risk. They may contain viruses that infect your phone. The above examples have worked for some users, but this is not a guarantee that they are safe.

, If your horses are all-black or look like cows, you'll need to download a texture pack as well. Check the website where you downloaded the mod, and look for a link to a texture pack. Once downloaded, restart Minecraft to see your horses in full color.

, Because each mod is created by users, there is no standard way to tame horses. In some mods, you feed the horse wheat to tame it. In others, you might just interact with it using an empty hand. The creator usually posts these details somewhere on their website.

Search the trees nearby and begin collecting wood from it.,
Place the crafting table somewhere close to you, right-click it and create a wooden axe.,
2 logs should be enough, only use 1 out of the 2 logs you collected for wood planks.,
Your home should be small, you don't want to spend too long on something that isn't a permanent shelter.,
If you still have enough time, go out and collect more wood (more sticks and planks), stone (upgrade all your tools to stone), and coal (more torches).,
Check frequently from time to time to see if the night had ended (alternatively, you may leave one block open so you don't have to do this, however, it's a little risky).,
Look around for tall grass, destroy it to get seeds to grow wheat farms.,
Go out on a journey to find sheep.,
You may want to think about a tree farm as well, just to prepare, destroy leaf blocks for a chance of a sapling dropping from it.,
You have a constant supply of wood, stone, food and the ability to sleep when it's night.",How to Survive Minecraft on Hardcore Mode," As soon as you have 3 logs, bring up your inventory screen and craft them into wooden planks. 4 planks should be used for crafting table, 2 for stick.;
, Mine the crafting table with the axe so you can store it back into your inventory again. From there, continue collecting wood with the newly crafted axe you made.

, You should still have enough sticks laying around for one more tool, so use those to make a wooden pickaxe. Get at least enough cobblestone for a furnace and some stone tools (If you happen to rarely see coal somewhere, mine it with the pickaxe if possible). Decide where you are going to carve your small temporary home into for the night. The three recommended options are underground, mountain, or a tiny island.

, Place your crafting table somewhere inside your home and make a furnace. If you have not got any coal as of yet, you may want to make charcoal. Luckily you still had not used that one other log you collected. Smelt the log with wood planks or sticks, and when it's finished, grab the charcoal from the furnace and make torches. Place it all around your shelter, block up the entrance with dirt, stone, or whatever. Now you're set for the night (No wooden doors for the entrance, since zombies can break them easily).

, You may also slay animals for meat and cook it in the furnace. You could also make a chest to store unnecessary items. Do all of this until nighttime has arrived.

, Next, you're going to want to craft a stone sword and have torches, cooked food, and other stone tools. You may encounter creepers, spiders, and endermen, so get your stone sword ready to slay them (Zombies and Skeletons won't be burned by sunlight if hiding under a tree or in the water).

, This is important especially when all the animals in your area are no longer there. Find an ocean or a lake, use a stone hoe to turn dirt or grass into farm land around water. This way, the soil will become hydrated by the water flowing into it to make wheat plants grow faster. Place seeds into the farm land and a few torches (If you do not have any, then this would be a good time to get plenty of them). It may take a while for the wheat to grow, but keep on planting and planting so it makes much more of an impact when it's fully grown.

, You need their wool to make a bed, so slay three of them. Sleep in the bed when it's nighttime, skipping to daytime without monsters spawning would make hardcore a whole lot easier.

, Plant it anywhere where there's dirt, room, and light. Add one torch or so to make it grow even when the sun isn't out. You probably don't need to do this now, but maybe later when your running out of trees.

, The only thing left to do is to expand on your little home or make a even better one, from there you would start mining for iron and coal underground. Smelt iron in the furnace to make iron ingot to create better tools and armor. Iron pickaxe can be used to mine gold, diamond, and redstone. You're going to need armor to survive caves full of monsters. With all of this completed, you now know how to survive and thrive in hardcore mode.

Mushroom stew is really easy to make in survival games. Pumpkin pie does a huge refill on your hunger. Steak and beef also add food to your hunger bar.

Think before building.,
Consider scale.,
Be original.,
Decide on colours and materials.,
Block it out.,
Change the bottom layer.,
Change the weather.,
Start in the middle.,
Build up a base.,
Save details for later.,
Look from different angles.,
Build, break, adjust.,
Add in details to your build.,
Look at your neighbours.,
Always keep an eye on the time.,
Practice.,
Don't add spammy signs.,
Vote fairly.,
Be kind to others.,
Be a good loser and a good winner.",How to Win a Build Battle in Minecraft," It may be tempting to start building right away, but give yourself ten to fifteen seconds to think out your build. Decide on what you are going to build and how you are going to do that.
, Scale is one of the most important things - too small, and you won't be able to put much detail into it, but if it's too big, you might not be able to finish your build in time., This is very cliché and super cheesy, but it is very important. When the theme has a double meaning, e.g. 'keyboard', choose the less obvious. People will be pleasantly surprised, that is, when the build itself also looks good. When the theme is 'bed', many people will make something that looks like an ordinary Minecraft bed. This is good, but you need to add that one extra detail to get the best score. Add a side-table, put a book half-hidden under the bed, go crazy.

Try to think outside of the box and build something which other players are likely to not build. However, make sure you still stick to the theme!

, If we take the example of the bed again, when you make the duvet red, that's good, but you can also colour it green, blue, or any other colour you like. This is a small change, but it will have a big impact on your scores. Material, on the other hand, adds texture. A good rule is as in real life, as in Minecraft. This means that you would make something wood, like the frame of your bed, out of wood. Of course, you will need to use some blocks in a different manner - cobblestone walls make nice walls, but when stacked on top of each other, they make pretty decent lanterns., This process is different depending on the theme but basically put in the structure without adding in details. Don't build it too big as it can be hard to finish within the time allocated (usually 5 minutes).Many players find animal related themes difficult to build. This step is crucial for convincing animals. Try to simplify the shape to a series of boxes and work from there. In a typical 5 minute game, this step should be complete before 3 minutes into the game., When you're building a bed, you don't want an earth floor. Change it to wooden planks or dyed clay. When you're building a beach, you can save a lot of time by setting the bottom layer to either sand or water.

Refer to the server's instructions on how to do this, as this differs from server to server.

, This also greatly determines the general atmosphere. A beach needs sun, an autumn scene needs rain, and a snowman of course needs snow.

Refer to the server's instructions on how to do this, as this differs from server to server.

, This also depends on the size and theme of your build, but starting in the middle is a safe move - you don't want to end up against the wall with your build., No matter what you're building, it's going to have some sort of base. Start with this and build the build around it., Due to the time limit, you should first have a decent build before moving on to the finer work - you don't want half a pool, even when it's nicely decorated., Your build might look nice from the front, but the back may look hideous. Make sure your build looks nice from each angle., When something doesn't look right, remove it and re-build it. When you don't have enough time, let it be for what is and move on to the next part., For example, on an animal, here is where you would add in the eyes and facial features. You can also use stairs and slabs for further refinement, as well as smaller blocks like fences, buttons, and the like., Some servers have peepholes in the walls, so you can look at your neighbour's build. When you see it's similar to yours, put in some extra effort to make it look unique., When you feel you're running out of time, either build 'rougher' (less details and effort), scale things down a bit, or keep going and hope for the best.

Once you have finished your build, in whatever time you have left try to integrate the build into the surroundings. This can be done using particle effects, changing the time and ground material, or growing grass and flowers, depending on your build. For example, if you build a house, you might integrate it by building a path leading up to it with a small garden or pond.

, Another cliché, but very important thing. You will get better over time, as you practice and look at other builds and techniques., When other people have to vote and see 'Vote this legendary!!', they will tend to do the exact opposite. Leave out signs like 'iiwHloverii was here xx', as people will get distracted, and it looks very unprofessional.

If you really want some kind of signature, use one of the following commands for the skull you have at the moment (the skull from your skin, what your head looks like). Replace Username with your own username.

/give @p skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:""Username""}
/skull Username



, When someone didn't build anything, or when the build looks awful, sure, give it a low score.

Explore!",How to Survive Your First Few Days in Minecraft (Xbox)," As soon as you spawn you MUST gather wood. In Minecraft, wood is by far the most important material out there. It is used to make crafting tables, wood planks, tools, torches, doors and practically all the things you need when you start! Even if you are in the desert, you must find wood. Travel halfway across the map if you need to but it is essential!;
, Try to collect wood all morning but when it's midday move onto making a shelter (you can check the time by looking up at the sun: when it is directly above you, it's midday).


The easiest way to do this is to break into a cliff. It only has to be two blocks high but make a cave like area and add a door. Also, you MUST light it up with torches: if you have already found some coal then make them using that; if not smelt a block of wood (NOT wood planks) in a furnace to make charcoal. Light up your new house with these so no unwanted visitors spawn there in the night. If the sun isn't already setting, go out and collect more wood until then.

, Now you are safe and sound in your shelter, make use of this time by starting a mine inside. Make some ladders out of your wood and dig down into the ground (Note: never dig straight down! You might fall into lava if you do!) place the ladders on the wall as you go down. Make sure you light up your mine too or monsters will spawn down there also. Hopefully by morning you will have plenty of cobblestone to make better tools and you may even have collected some coal if you were lucky.

, Congratulations! You have survived your first night! But by now, hunger will be setting in and you need to find food. Look around the area, making sure you don't stray too far from your shelter, and kill any animals you see. Here is what each animal will give you: cows - 0-3 leather, 0-2 raw beef; sheep - 0-3 wool; pigs - 0-3 raw porkchops; chickens - 0-2 feathers, 0-2 raw chicken. Cows are probably the most useful as beef gives you a lot of food points and you can make armour out of the leather. However, make sure you get AT LEAST 3 WOOL as you can make a bed out of this.

, It is important to cook your food as you can become ill if you have raw meat. You can also make a bed now so place that in your shelter. Eat any food you need now.

, Depending on how many resources you have go out and collect any of those materials you think you need most.

, Tonight continue mining inside and try to go down a little further. If you are really lucky, you might find some iron ore. Iron ore is another very useful material that will make life a lot easier. It is a good idea to use it to make some good iron tools and some shears. The tools will last longer than wood or stone and the shears will allow you to cut the wool off sheep so you won't have to kill them. Keeping it alive is beneficial: more wool will be awarded and it will grow back soon. If you don't find any iron, don't worry, you will probably find some soon if you keep mining every night.

, Farming wheat is a very easy, renewable way to collect food. To make a farm, dig out a 1 block deep row every other block. Use an iron bucket to fill the holes with water. Then, use a hoe to till the blocks next to the water and plant wheat seeds. You can find wheat seeds by destroying long grass and can be found in villages. Then, when the wheat is fully grown harvest it and make bread. Bread is a very good food as it restores a good amount of health points.

, This will allow you to keep a good source of food nearby. Craft some fences (and a fence gate) and make a pen for your animals to go in. Make sure it isn't more than 20 blocks x 20 blocks or the animals will despawn. Then, collect some wheat and hold it in your hand. Approach an animal and it should follow you (but chickens will follow wheat seeds and pigs will follow carrots) so make them follow you into the pen. Breed the animals too by feeding two of the same species the food they follow. The two animals should then briefly kiss and a baby animal will appear, aww!

, It is important to keep mining and going deeper and deeper underground so you can find more and more materials that each have their own advantages and uses. Emeralds, for example, you can trade for other items with villagers.

, It is extremely productive to explore your world and seek the hidden treasures. Travel to new biomes, go caving, stay out one night and fight zombies or maybe even move to another shelter. There are endless opportunities in Minecraft and everyone plays it differently so go and do what you like. Now that you have survived the first few nights and collected the bare essentials, you are free to go do whatever you please!

Crafting table - Four wooden crates, which come from one wood block.

Book - Three pieces of paper, which come from three pieces of sugar cane, and one piece of leather.

Enchanting table - Two diamonds, four blocks of obsidian, and a book.;
, You should see your crafting items here.

In Minecraft PE, you'll tap the ... icon to open your inventory.

, To do this, you'll use the four wood crates, which come from placing one block of wood in the crafting grid.

On the PC version of Minecraft, you'll click and drag each of your four wooden blocks into the two-by-two crafting grid at the top of your inventory.
On Minecraft PE, you'll tap the tab above your inventory tab on the left side of the screen and then tap the crafting table icon, which resembles a box with lines on it.
On console, you'll press the ""Crafting"" button (X or circle), then select a wooden crate.

, You'll need to select it from the hotbar at the bottom of the screen to do so.

If your hotbar is full, you must first open your inventory and replace an item in the hotbar with your crafting table.

, It will open to a three-by-three grid, along with the contents of your inventory (PE and PC versions only)., To do so, you'll place three pieces of sugar cane across the middle row of the crafting grid, select the resulting paper, and then place the three pieces of paper in an L-shape in the top-left corner of the crafting grid. Your leather should go in the top-middle box, thus filling in the ""L"" shape.

In Minecraft PE, just tap the book icon on the left side of the screen, then click the 1 x button on the right side.
On the console version of Minecraft, select the book icon from the paper section of the ""Decorations"" tab.

, The enchanting table requires a book in the top-middle box of the crafting grid, a diamond in both the middle-left and middle-right boxes, and obsidian in the center box as well as the entire bottom row. You should see the enchanting table icon appear on the right side of the crafting grid.

On consoles, select the enchanting table from the crafting table area of the ""Structures"" tab.

, You'll do this in the same way in which you placed the crafting table here., It will open to one space in which you can place your book., To do so, simply click and drag the book into the space (PC).

For Minecraft PE, you'll tap the book on the left side of the screen to place it in the table.
For consoles, select the book in your inventory.

, The level of enchantment you can place on your book depends on your level. Selecting an enchantment will apply it to your book, causing it to turn purple.

For example, if you're level 3, you can select any enchantment with a 1, 2, or 3 next to it.
Enchantments are randomized, so you won't be able to select a specific enchantment.

, Doing so will place it in your inventory. Now that you have an enchanted book, it's time to apply it to an item.

In Minecraft PE, you must double-tap your book to add it to your inventory.

, Having an anvil will allow you to apply your enchantment book to an item. To craft an anvil, you will need the following:


Three iron blocks - Each iron block requires nine iron bars, for a total of twenty-seven iron bars needed.

Four iron bars - These bars bring the iron total to thirty-one.
You can create iron bars by adding iron ore, which is the grey stone with orange-brown spots, into a furnace that has coal in it.

, As it did earlier, the crafting table will open to a three-by-three grid., To do so, you'll place the three iron blocks in the top row of the crafting table grid, three of the four iron bars along the bottom row of the grid, and the final iron bar in the center of the grid, then select the anvil icon.

On the PE version of Minecraft, you'll tap the black anvil icon on the left side of the screen.
On the console version of Minecraft, you'll select the anvil icon in the ""Structures"" tab.

, You're now ready to craft an enchanted item., It will open to three boxes., You can place it in either the far-left box or the middle box here.

For example, you might add a sword.

, It goes in either the far-left box or the middle box., This is the box on the far-right side of the anvil's menu. Doing so will add your enchanted item to your inventory."

, Wood can't do very much for you but wooden planks are extremely useful in Minecraft.

, This will be necessary if you want to make almost anything. Now you will have a wide variety of things that you can craft.

, This will cost three wool and six wooden planks. There is no way to sleep and repair yourself without a bed.

, You will need some wood, but that's all.

Upgrade tools and armor.",How to Survive in Minecraft," Collect a decent number of logs, 20 - 30 is a good number. Convert some of the logs to wooden planks. Planks are used for many different crafting recipes and are one of the most basic items in the game. 16 logs makes one stack of planks;
, You are only able to craft so much in the 2x2 crafting grid in your inventory. You will soon need an upgrade to make other tools and items. Crafting tables are a necessity.

, You will need it to mine stone (which becomes cobblestone when mined without silk touch), to turn into a furnace. You also would want to get a decent amount of coal too. Coal is a basic fuel in the game and is abundant while mining. You can use coal to burn the logs you collected to make charcoal which is a similar item to coal (both smelt 8 items each).

, The more the better. You will most likely build your first house out of cobblestone or some wood and mostly cobblestone. It is an abundant material. The majority of Minecraft is made of it.

, You will most likely find some coal if you do. Make your way up to or into it, and mine any ores you can find. Note that certain picks will mine certain ores. A wooden pick will only mine stone and coal while a stone pick can mine iron too. If you try and mine iron with a wooden pick it will disappear.

, Light up the inside with torches. Otherwise mobs will spawn inside your house. You don't have to have a door as zombies can knock them down, simply cover with dirt or wood. You can have an iron door with two buttons or a lever which stops zombies from breaking the door.

, Many monsters spawn at night. On your first night, this can often be overwhelming as you may only have stone tools. If you are going out to fight mobs though, make sure you have got the tools you need. Leather armor for example will reduce damage taken by mobs.

, Creepers are an annoying mob that won't burn in the sunlight, like zombies and skeletons. They can survive for quite a while come daytime. They are green in color and can be hard to spot in grassy areas and don't make any sounds while walking or idling, so they can easily catch you by surprise. If one manages to get close to you, it will explode, harming or killing you and destroying nearby blocks.

, This is generally how you progress in minecraft after basic survival. Of course you can attempt to face bosses too.

, If you are not constantly getting better armor and tools, you will never be able to progress in the game properly. Make sure you are getting better and better tools constantly.

Before you enter the Nether, put all your valuables in a chest.,
Bring tons of food.,
Protect your Nether portal with cobblestone.",How to Survive in the Nether (Minecraft)1," Don't stay there longer than you need to.;
, You are going to need a bow with several arrows, and the best sword you can get. If you can enchant the sword and/or bow, that would be the best option.

, Store items like diamonds, emeralds, and ender pearls. Also, be sure to bring flint and steel in case you need to relight the portal, and a lot of cobblestone. A map may come in useful; it will not tell which direction you are facing, but it will show you where you are. It will be useful if you get lost. Snowballs are useful for fighting blazes; you can bring them in the form of snow blocks to save space, and use a shovel to convert them back to snowballs.

, Be sure to bring food you can eat quickly, such as cooked meat instead of something like cake. If you can afford it, golden apples would be even more preferable as they give you regeneration and resistance. ""Enchanted"" golden apples with purple sheen will give you fire resistance as well, but are no longer craftable in PC edition, so may be best saved for fighting blazes.

, Ghast fireballs won't destroy cobblestone, so be sure to bring a lot of it to the nether. Fireballs won't destroy obsidian, but they could ""unlight"" the portal, leaving you stranded (unless you have flint and steel).

Dig into a mountain.,
If you can, find a Nether fortress.,
Only eat rotten flesh if you have nothing else.,
Make a brewing stand.",How to Survive in the Nether (Minecraft)2," You'll need a place to stay while you work on your house. When you build your house, be sure to use cobblestone (not wood) so that it will be ghast-proof. Make sure you have an iron door with a lever or button inside and out. Don't bother placing a bed, because if you try to sleep in it, it will explode.

, You may need to clear out the pigmen and blazes - just remember that all of the pigmen will attack you if you injure just one - and make sure to destroy all blaze spawners (with a pickaxe). The Nether Fortress does make a quite decent house; there are hiding places inside mountains and rooms deep inside where you can hide from ghasts and stuff. They are very decent places to live and contain plenty of bricks and staircases, blazes for blaze rods for potion making, treasure chests, and a Nether-wart farm. What else could a Minecrafter ask for?

, You can get rotten flesh from zombie pigmen (climb a tower before fighting them, because they will swarm at you). Rotten flesh may give you the hunger effect, but you can drink milk (if you were able to get a cow through the portal) or bring a milk bucket before entering the nether. You can also drink a potion to stop the effect. If you bring bowls, you can make mushroom stew in your inventory crafting grid from the mushrooms found in the Nether. There are no other food sources in the Nether unless you brought trees or seeds with you. If you bring trees or seeds, you should also bring dirt.

, Yes, it's a no-brainer because the materials needed are mostly in the Nether to make this, and so are the ingredients: blaze rods, ghast tears, etc. You can also make splash potions for pesky pigmen packs that you have started a fight with. Either way, its essential unless you want to easily die after eating rotten flesh.

Run!",How to Summon Herobrine in Minecraft," Herobrine does not and has never existed in the game naturally.In order to have Herobrine appear, you will have to download a mod. If you don't know how to find and install mods for Minecraft, wikiHow can help.


The most common Herobrine mod is the burner Mod, available on MinecraftMods and in the Minecraft Forum. These instructions will be for summoning Herobrine using the Burnner mod, since it is the most common. Most mods will include summoning instructions however, so check the forums for instructions for your particular mod.;
, The Herobrine block is made in a 3x3 grid, with a Soul Sand at the center and Bone all around.


Bone is dropped most commonly by skeletons but also by Wither Skeletons.
Soul sand is found in the Nether, usually near lava.

, You will also need Netherrack and two Gold blocks, as well as something to set a fire. Weapons to protect yourself won't hurt either!


Netherrack is found abundantly in the Nether.
Gold blocks are crafted from Gold ingots which are in turn crafted from gold ore. Gold ore is found most commonly in the lower 32 layers of the map, in veins bordered by stone.

, Place a Gold Block on the ground. Place another Gold Block on top of it. Now add your Herobrine block that you made in Step 2. Top it off with the Netherrack block. You should now have a totem that is four blocks high., You'll need a Flint and Steel to light the Netherrack on fire and complete the totem. Flint and Steel are crafted by placing a flint at the center and an Iron ingot to the left, in the crafting box (sometimes with the ingot at an angle from the flint). Equip the Flint and Steel in your hand and right-click to activate it. Of course, you'll want to activate it in the direction of the Netherrack...otherwise you'll just end up setting everything on fire!


Flint is found when mining gravel. Iron ingots are made from Iron ore, which is found readily when mining.

, After lighting the totem, Herobrine will be summoned and can appear anywhere and at any time. Good luck and don't forget to bring a fresh pair of undies!

Find a Desert Temple.,
Enter the temple.,
Use a pickaxe to break through the pattern in the center of the temple.,
Be careful as you proceed.,
Destroy the pressure plate.,
Collect the loot.,
Climb back up.,
Finished!",How to Survive a Minecraft Desert Temple," Minecraft randomly generates worlds, so there's no foolproof way to find a temple. However, you can start by finding a desert biome; these are characterized by cacti, sand, sandstone, and small, dead bushes.


If you want to skip this part, try looking online for Desert Temple seeds. There are plenty of seeds that will spawn you right next to or very close to one of these structures— some may even include multiple temples!;
, Be careful; there could be various monsters inside, taking refuge from the sunlight. Add some torches, just to be safe, and check around so that nothing will sneak up on you.

, Don't stand on top as you mine! Clear all blocks so you have a clear view of what you're about to do.

, At the bottom of the room under the temple, there is a pressure plate; landing on it will activate 12 TNT, which will almost certainly kill you. There are a couple ways to safely get to the bottom:


Spiral stairs: place blocks along the sides of the room, each lower than the next, until you reach the bottom. Avoid stepping on the pressure plate once you get there.
Mining down: choose a block adjacent to the opening of the chasm and mine down until you reach. the floor.

, Use a pickaxe so it will go quickly and you can collect it afterward— who knows? It could come in handy!

, You can also collect the chests and TNT, if you like, and any block in the temple that strikes your fancy.

, If you used the spiral staircase, it will also serve as your way up. If you dug down, you might want to build a pillar up.

, Enjoy your awesome loot.

Collect supplies.,
Turn the sand into sandstone.,
Dig a 8x8 square from sand on the floor.,
Start making a wall.,
Make a roof.,
Start digging a stairway down a little bit away from your house.,
Make a workbench.,
Construct a door.,
Congratulations!",How to Survive in a Desert in Minecraft Beta," You will need at least 15 full stacks of sand. This will be used for the stone construction of your house. You will also need coal, but we will need a mine if there isn't any on the surface, so we will come back to that.;
, This is a simple but boring task. Place 4 piles of sand in your crafting square. Keep on clicking on the Yellow Stone (Sandstone) on the right of your square. When you're done, repeat the task until you have ran out of sand.

, Once you have done the following, start placing your Sandstone in the gap. Once you're done you should have an almost 100% smooth Sandstone floor for your house.

, You will need a wall for your house. So build a wall high enough for you to jump, then that's about right. maybe about 4 blocks high from the Sandstone floor. This is so if you do find wood and you make a bed, you won't suffocate when you wake up.

, This is a bit easy, at the highest block on your wall, place a Sandstone block. Fill in the giant gap in the Sky until it goes dark. Once you're done, Break a 1x2 gap to place a door so you can get in and out without anything going in your house.

, This will be your coal/iron mine. Sadly, you will need wood for this part so you can make a pickaxe, or you can get TNT and blow up some stone for cobble, but that will take a lot longer. So, dig down until you have about 3+ coal.

, Yes, you do need wood, but you can't survive without it. Travel away far to get some wood, but don't get lost. Return and make some sticks. Get those sticks, and make a few torches. Place them around your house.


Keep saplings from the trees you cut down to make a tree farm. Oak trees are best for growing compactly, because they need the least space to grow. Excavate a few stacks of dirt for making farms.

, You will need wood again, once you have made a door, go outside your house and place it on the block you made the gap/doorway.

, You have made your first desert house! (Well, most likely) you can celebrate if you want. Don't forget to add beds and decorate your pad. And daytime you could add windows as well. Don't forget to go to your mine and see if you can find caves, dungeons, diamonds, iron, redstone and maybe even Lapis Lazuli! Enjoy your new house.

Start or load a game in Creative mode.,
Start off flying or levitating.,
Stop flying by double-tapping the jump key again.,
Don't worry about fall damage.",How to Stop Flying in Minecraft1," Flying is only possible in Minecraft's Creative mode. There is no way to fly in survival mode.


Some third-party mods may allow you to fly outside of Creative mode. The controls used for these mods will vary, so if you're using a mod, consult your mod's website for more information.;
, To stop flying, first you need to be flying to begin with. When you're on the ground, you can start flying at any time by double-tapping the jump key.


On the computer version of Minecraft, this will be the space bar by default. Other versions of the game have different controls. A few examples are as follows:Minecraft PE: On-screen square jump button
Minecraft for Xbox 360/One: A button
Minecraft for Playstation 3/4: X button

, You should immediately start falling downward as if you had walked off a ledge. When you hit the ground, you will be walking normally again. Whenever you wish, you can double-jump to start flying once more.

, Flying is only possible in the game's Creative mode. In this mode, the player is invincible to all damage (including fall damage).While a fall from a great height would normally kill the player unless it was into water, you don't have to worry about this in Creative mode, so feel free to stop flying even when you're nowhere near the ground.

Hold the sneak/crouch button to descend slowly.,
Use the /kill command.,
Try teleporting to the ground with the ""/tp"" command.,
Change your game mode.",How to Stop Flying in Minecraft2," Double-tapping the jump button is almost always the quickest way to stop flying in Creative mode. However, if you don't want to do this for some reason, there are a few other ways to get out of the air. One is to use the sneak button. This will cause you to slowly sink, rather than plummeting to the ground. When you hit the ground, you will start sneaking (walking slowly) as normal.


On the computer version of Minecraft, the sneak button will be left shift by default. Other versions of the game have different controls. A few examples are as follows:Minecraft for Xbox 360/One: Push in the right control stick
Xperia PLAY: Left touch pad

, It is impossible to take damage in Creative mode, but you can still die with the ""/kill"" console command. When you respawn, you should be on the ground.


To use this command, open the console (T key by default on the computer version).Type in ""/kill"" and hit enter. You should die immediately.

, You can also use the console to teleport yourself to a specific in-game location. If you choose a location on the ground (or beneath it), you will stop flying.


To use this command, open the console and type in ""/tp"". Next, enter your X/Y/Z coordinates separated by spaces. X and Z are your horizontal coordinates in the game world, while Y is your height. Y has a minimum value of 0 (Y = 0 is the absolute bottom of the game world). If you put a tilde (~) before any of the coordinates, you will be teleported to the coordinate relative to your current position.You can use negative y values with the tilde notation.
For example, if you enter ""/tp -100 30 500"" into the console, you will be teleported to the location -100/500 at a height of 30.
However, if you enter ""/tp -100 ~30 500"" into the console, you will be teleported to the location -100/500 30 blocks above your current height


, Since flying isn't allowed in Survival mode, switching out of Creative will get you out of the air. Keep in mind that you can be damaged in Survival mode. This include fall damage, so don't switch game modes if you're hovering over a huge drop.


A convenient way to switch game modes is to use the console command ""/gamemode."" Type this into the console followed by the game mode you want (separated with a space) and press enter to switch modes.The game modes can also be abbreviated with their first letters or the numbers zero through three. In other words:



Survival mode can be s or 0

Creative mode can be c or 1

Adventure mode can be a or 2

Spectator mode can be sp or 3





For example, if you want to switch to survival mode, you can use the command ""/gamemode survival"" or ""/gamemode s"" or ""/gamemode 0.""

Find wood.,
Build a home.,
Craft a crafting table.,
Craft the basic weapons and a bed.,
Craft a bed and sleep.",How to Start Your First Minecraft Survival World," Wood is the most used block in Minecraft, alongside dirt and stone. Once you have found a tree, break the wood and craft it into planks. If you cannot see any wood, walk around for a bit. Trees are practically everywhere, so it won't take too long to find one.;
, If you don't have a lot of wood, get some more or build it out of dirt. Don't make it too big to start off with, but you can improve it later. Still, make it big enough to fit all of the basic equipment inside- 5x5 or 6x6 is optimal.

, You will need four planks of wood, which you can get from one piece of normal wood. The crafting table is by far the most used tool in Minecraft. Place it in your home or any other desired place.

, By now, the sun has nearly set. Monsters will spawn soon, so go to your crafting table and make: some sticks; a wooden sword; a wooden axe and a wooden shovel. Next, to make a bed you will need three wood planks and three wool. You get wool by killing sheep. If you don't want to kill sheep, make a stone pickaxe and get two iron. Smelt it in a furnace (you will need eight cobblestone to make one) and make some shears to shear sheep instead.

, Place your crafted bed in your home and sleep in it. Sleeping in a bed allows you to skip the night, and set your spawn so if you die you spawn where you last slept.


Well done: you have survived your first night! Now go forth, build a mansion, mine precious diamonds, and kill the evil enderdragon!

Experiment!",How to Start Building a Base in Minecraft," Depending on your original spawn point and preferences, you can build your base practically anywhere you want, as long as it’s viable. Time and time again, players have proved they can live in any setting they please, whether player-made or natural. From the bottom of the ocean to a complicated lava maze, as long as you are prepared and know your area, you can make your own base to your own preference. The next few steps are a guide of some of the major types of biomes, but not a full list. The biomes listed here are the ones with major defining features and most feasibly habitable, and biome types like river and beach variations and the ocean are excluded due to redundancy and lack of variability.;
, This biome type has little to no grass, and whatever vegetation grows in the area is dry and brittle-looking.


Savannahs are the most lush of the dry biome types, having more water and actual vegetation. It is characterized by the yellowing grass, the vast, open plains made predominantly of dirt blocks, and Acacia trees. This is one of the biome types that can spawn Villages upon world generation and one of the only two biomes that spawn Horses naturally.
Deserts are the most well-known of the dry biomes and is nothing but sand with some pockets of water, cacti, and dried bushes scattered here and there. This is another biome type that can spawn Villages.

Digging under the sand for a few blocks will yield the player some Sandstone. You can also make Sandstone by placing Sand on a 2x2 block formation on your crafting menus.


Mesas are the rarest of the dry biome types. It’s made completely out of Hardened Clay, Stained Hardened Clay, Red Sand, and Red Sandstone blocks, with some dried bushes scattered here and there. Red Sand acts much like regular sand, but with a reddish-brown coloration.

, Cold biomes are generally known for their blueish grass, the presence of Spruce trees, and the appearance of snow if you go up to a certain height.


Extreme Hills are basically as they are named. This biome is full of steep drops, valleys, ridiculous overhangs, caves, ravines, waterfalls, and random lava flows. If you want a spectacular view, this biome delivers.
Taigas are basically areas populated by Spruce trees, ferns, and Wolves. There’s a more diverse variation of this biome called the Mega Taiga, which has generally larger and thicker Spruce trees, Podzol replacing the usual grass, Coarse Dirt, and Mushrooms scattered here and there. Podzol is a type of dirt that lets you plant Mushrooms even in higher levels. You can’t transplant Podzol to other areas without breaking the dirt under it unless you use a tool called Silk Touch. Podzol also won’t spread to other nearby dirt blocks, unlike Mycelium. Coarse Dirt is just dirt without grass covering it. Grass won’t grow on it, but you can still till it to farm crops.

, Obviously, snowy biomes are perpetually covered in snow. There's not a lot of variation to them, unlike the other biome types, but the abundance of snow and ice makes it pretty picturesque and useful. Do note that snow falls and covers the ground regularly, and water freezes in this biome quickly, though you can thaw it all out with a torch or any kind of light source nearby.


The Ice Plains biome is hilly and has nothing but snow, ice, and the occasional lava pit. If you want a nice snowy flatland with a view, this biome is for you! There is a very rare variation of this biome called the Ice Plains Spikes, with gigantic ice stalagmites made from a unique block called Packed Ice. This block, unlike regular Ice blocks, doesn’t melt if you place a torch near it. But much like Ice blocks, you can’t gather this block without the Silk Touch tool. If you’re lucky enough to come across this biome, you can get a very uncommon and striking material to build with!
The other notable Biome of snowy type is the Cold Taiga. Much like the Taiga biome, it’s full of Spruce, fern, and Wolves, but this time it’s covered in snow.

, Lush biomes are probably the most diverse and universally preferred of the biome types. They’re normally characterized by the abundance of greenery and the presence of plenty of wildlife.


The Plains biome is basically large, flat expanses of grass and flowers, and is the other biome where horses naturally spawn in. A variation of it contains an abundance of Sunflowers. NPC Villages and ponds are also spawned here as well.
The Forest biome, obviously, is full of trees. Oak and Birch trees spawn naturally there, with the possibility of finding Wolves. Mushrooms also spawn here occasionally. The Forest is thus regarded to be one of the best biomes to start out with, aside from the Plains. There are variations where it’s predominantly Oak, predominantly Birch, and full of rare flowers. This is also usually the smallest Biome in the game, though also one of the most common.
Be careful when exploring the Forest at night, since you don’t have much visibility from all the trees and whatnot. Monsters also tend to remain spawned in the area in daytime due to the shade. Monsters may also spawn in this biome if it gets dark enough in some areas.
The Roofed Forest is it’s own biome type due to the abundance of the huge Dark Oak trees and the abundance of Giant Mushrooms that are spawned naturally in this biome. Because of this, it can be hazardous to explore this biome due to the thick foliage and the sheer number of the trees and Giant Mushrooms blocking out the sunlight. Regular mushrooms also spawn here occasionally, as well as Rose Bushes.
Another forest-like biome considered as unique is the Jungle. This somewhat rare biome has unique trees and plant life, and the flora of the Jungle is even more dense than the Roofed Forest, making it difficult to navigate for players. It’s often hilly and full of drops, caves, and vines. This is also the only biome that spawn Ocelots and Melons naturally, as well as contain the unique Jungle Trees.
Another uncommon biome, and by far one of the most unusual, is the Mushroom biome. This biome is characterized by the purplish Mycelium covering the ground, the absurd amount of Mushrooms, the presence of Giant Mushrooms serving as trees, and the strange, fungal-looking Cows called Mooshrooms. This biome can be a bit weird, but it offers quite a lot of food since Mushrooms can be grown on the Mycelium here even when exposed to the highest light levels of the game. Mooshrooms act much like regular Cows, but with the added bonus of supplying you with Mushrooms when shaved by shears and Mushroom Stew when milked with a wooden bowl. This makes them one of the most useful food source in the game.
Last of the lush biome types is the Swamp. This biome is the wettest of these types, full of scattered water pockets, sugar canes, water lilies, and mushrooms. The trees of these biomes are Oak, but spawn with vines attached. This biome is full of clay, sand, and dirt under the pools, and is often about sea level. Two uncommon enemies spawn at night and most abundantly during the full moon in this biome: Slimes and Witches. They can be a bit difficult to handle if you aren't prepared enough.

, Not all bases are built the same, and will depend on the preference of the player. As long as it’s reasonably secure, you can make any kind of base you want, ranging from simple to completely wacky. These are some common types of base, aside from the usual houses and huts. Of course, you can make your own variation with your own preferences, but these are just to give you an idea where to start.

, This base type is the simplest type to make, preferred by beginners and expert players alike. This is simply because all the player needs to do is dig a hole on the ground or on the side of a hill and create their base almost completely underground. You only need to punch the dirt using the left mouse button (PC), RT/R2 (PS3/4/Vita), or by tapping and holding the block you want gone (PE). The ideal minimum is 4-5 blocks big, though you can make it smaller or bigger to your preferences.


If you encounter some harder rock blocks, you’ll need to get a pickaxe. Pickaxes can be made on a crafting table with two Sticks and 3 blocks of Wood Planks, Cobblestone, Iron Ingots, Gold Ingots or Diamond.

, Much like the “hole” house, this base type is mainly underground but relies on the naturally-spawning caves in the game to provide you with the housing area. Simply block off the area you wish to live in by placing blocks to form “walls” and decorate! This is also a great way to access a lot of mineral resources, like iron, coal, and gold, while providing you a close “safe area” to retreat to.


You can place blocks by right-clicking, pressing the LT/L2, or by briefly tapping the area you want your block placed in.

, This type is most popular for densely-forested biomes or those with unusual trees like Jungles, Roofed Forests, and Savannahs. As the title suggests, this base type is hidden atop and among some trees, securing it against some mob types like Creepers, Skeletons, and Endermen. Spiders are still a threat, since they can climb trees, but there’s some methods of deterring them, like putting slab “ledges” under the trunk or any surface spiders can climb on. Treehouses are just simply your base on top of a tree, or sometimes inside the tree if you’re using a Dark Oak tree or one of those huge Jungle Trees. It’s a bit difficult getting up and down your house if you need it to be protected from enemies, but it’s one of the less time- and resource-consuming base types.


When making a treehouse, don’t take away all the Wood in the tree! Make sure to leave some Wood sticking to your Leaf blocks. If you take out all the wood, it will cause the leaves to disappear, leaving you either standing on a bare tree, or falling off!

, Simply put, this is the base type where you build a tower by pillar-jumping (looking down, jumping, and placing a block under you, then repeating) until you are satisfied with the height, and then you expand the area until it can fit your stuff. This can consume more materials like dirt and stone, since you can simply build your entire abode on an ever-expanding mass above ground. Do take care to light up all the areas to keep monsters from spawning, though.


Do note that this means you have to bring with you all the renewable resources you can manage to bring and give up on mining. Spiders can still climb up to it, but placing “lips” under the pillar or destroying the block under the main body of the pillar prevents that.
Being 20–30 blocks away from the ground is preferable, since Skeletons can shoot you from that far away, and also to make sure that if you ever decide to descend, there won’t be monsters spawning.
Don’t use Sand or Gravel for this method unless you place it on layers of dirt or stone, since sand and gravel are affected by gravity. If a passing Enderman decides the tower looks nice and takes a piece, your tower would literally come crashing down.

, This is the more “surreal” cousin of the pillar tower base, simply because it’s just floating at least 10 blocks from the ground. It looks impressive, plus spiders are less likely to climb up on it since they can’t climb on anything! You can do this by “extending” the side of a cliff one row at a time while breaking the row of blocks behind you until you’re far away enough from the cliff that Skeletons can’t reach you anymore. Expand until you have enough space to place all your belongings and such. Much like the pillar tower, you’ll need a lot of materials to pull it off, and keeping it well lit is a must to make the effort worth it.

, While this is an option only for more experienced or prepared players, or for those who chose the ocean as their living area, building an island for their own habitation is the only way to truly live in the ocean. Much like the tower and the floating island, it consumes a lot of resources but enables you to live and thrive in your self-made home.

, Beds are necessary since they establish a spawn point for you to come back to whenever you die. They are crafted on your crafting table with 3 Wool, which you can get from killing or shearing Sheep, and 3 Wood Planks.


When night falls, just head to your bed and sleep on it with a right-click, LT/L2, or by tapping it; you’ll immediately be taken to the next day!

, There are many ways to set up a farm in Minecraft. All you need is water, some tilled soil, and a crop. Seeds can be gathered from punching grass covering the ground, and they have to be planted on tilled soil next to water (4 blocks away at maximum horizontally and 1 block vertically) to grow Wheat in. Once planted, the plant slowly grows from tiny buds to flourishing green to fully grown Wheat!


To till the soil, you need to make a Hoe. It can be made on your crafting table with Sticks and 2 blocks of Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, or Diamond. Afterwards, you simply till the soil and plant the seed in. For PC, you right-click the soil with your hoe selected, then right-click the tilled ground with the seeds selected. For Pocket Edition, tap the soil with the hoe selected, then tap the tilled soil with the seed selected. For Console, use the L2/LT.
If you’re lucky enough to find a Pumpkin or some Melons, take them to any crafting grid, place one in a slot, and you can get their respective Seeds for you to farm. Once planted, a stalk will grow from the tilled plot and eventually spawn Pumpkins and Melons on a block adjacent to it. This means that you need at least one row of untilled soil or solid material near the tilled plot with the stalk to successfully farm your Pumpkins and Melons.
Carrots and Potatoes can be planted by themselves on tilled soil. They are rare drops from Zombies or can be found in Villages. When they’re fully grown, you can see either white or orange poking out of the ground under the leaves.

, Different animals have different needs, meaning they have different favorite foods that make them amiable towards you. Passive animals like Pigs, Cows, and the currently PC-exclusive Rabbits just follow you around when you hold their favorite food in your hand. Horses, Wolves, and Ocelots need some time before they trust you enough.


Pigs, Rabbits, Cows, Chickens, and Sheep follow you around when you bring their respective favorite food, and you can breed them with it too! Pigs and Rabbits love Carrots, Cows and Sheep love Wheat, and Chickens love Seeds! After leading them to your base, just enclose them in a pen either 2 blocks high or made from Fence Posts!

, Wolves, and Ocelots need some time before they trust you enough.


Wolves and Ocelots need to be given food before they are considered tamed. For Wolves, just feed them a Bone and they’ll immediately be tamed into lovable, adorable Dogs! Ocelots, however, need Raw Fish and extra care to be tamed.
When trying to tame an Ocelot, hold out your raw fish and approach them slowly. Do NOT directly point your crosshairs at the Ocelot (jerk your camera around to avoid pointing at it directly) or run towards them, as they are skittish. When they stop to look at you, stand still and let them approach you. Then when they stop beside you, point your crosshairs at the Ocelot and feed them the fish! Do note that you might have to feed them a few times before they become tamed. It may take you a few tries to tame them, but you’ll get a fluffy Cat as a result!
Bones can be acquired from killing Skeletons, while Fish can be obtained through fishing!

, Horses (and its Donkey and Mule variations) are a bit stubborn, but once tamed, you can ride them to great distances and leap up to 2 to 5 blocks high! You can also armor your Horses with Horse Armor to make use of them in battle, and use the Mules and Donkeys to carry extra stuff!


Taming these three animals involve mounting them by right-clicking or pressing LT/L2, being bucked off by the Horse, and then repeating until they exhibit floating hearts above them. Afterwards, you can place a saddle (right-click or LT/L2) on them and control their movements! You can also place your Horse Armor on your regular horses or a chest on your Donkey and Mule to carry an additional 15 items with it!

, Trees are probably the most indispensable renewable resource in the game. Saplings are dropped by tree leaves when you punch them or when they rot away without the trunk to support it, and are infinitely renewable. Since Wood is one of the most useful materials in the game, planting a few Saplings would ensure a steady supply of Wood you can indefinitely sustain.

, There are a lot of ways you can exploit the mechanics of the game, like making an infinite cobblestone generator from a bucket of lava and some water, or a steady supply of gold from a ""trapped"" nether portal, or even an automatic ""mob grinder"" that spawns and kills all those nasty zombies, creepers, and skeletons for you!

,

Place the bPermissions.jar into the plugin folder, and run the server so that the files are generated.






Once the server has fully loaded, type ""stop"" and close the console.







,

Inside your plugins folder you should now see a new folder called bPermissions.






Open this folder, and you will see some new files. For now, we will leave these files as they are.







,


Open the world folder and you will see a YAML file for each world you have on your server. If you have only the default worlds you will see two files, groups.yml, and users.yml.






These are the files that we use to create permission groups and assign groups to players.

,

Open the group.yml in notepad. It is usually an empty file in latest version of servers. If you should see two square brackets: []. Delete them so we have an empty file.







,

For this wikiHow, you will be using three groups, player, moderator, and admin. You may choose to have more, or less groups than this.






Write without quotes, ""default: "", and then the name of your default group, mine will be ""player"". Your first line should look like the line in the image.







,

We can now add the groups to the world file.






Go to the next line and type groups:






Then, go to the next line, and add four spaces, making sure you don't add tabs, and no tabs were added automatically. Write the name of your first group. Go to the next line, four spaces, name of second group.
Repeat until all your groups are listed. They should look similar to the groups in the image.



,

You will now need to add the basic permissions each group will have. With bPermissions, you will be assigning multiple groups to your players.






Instead of groups of players, it will be, groups of permissions added to your players. Generally, your default group will be a base group. It will contain all the permissions you want every player to have.






So in your default group, go to the next line, add 4 spaces and add the permission:







- bPermissions.build: This will allow the player to place and break blocks.
Then, under your admin type group, add the permission:



- bPermissions.admin






It should look similar to the image.







,

As the plugin Essentials has a lot of permissions and is quite popular.






Just like in the previous step, add the permissions you want each group to have. But keep in mind, the permissions should be relevant to the group.






Here are some permissions for the MOTD, teleporting to spawn, and home / sethome commands to the player group. Kick and ban permissions to the moderator group, and Bukkit server commands to the admin group.






Your groups.yml should now look similar to the one in the image.







Note: if you have a lot of plugins, you will probably have a lot of permission nodes to add. But, take your time to make sure it is formatted correctly, and no tabs have been added.





,

Now that we have the permissions added, it is a good idea to add the players that will have the bPermissions.admin node to the file. This permission will allow the player to add groups to other players in-game.






In this example there are three players; Notch, Jeb, and NewGuy.






Notch is an admin, so he has all three permission groups, meaning, he can do everything a default player can, as well as, what a moderator can, and is able to use the server commands too.
Jeb, as the moderator has the default player permissions and the moderator permissions.
Finally, NewGuy has only just joined the server, so he is automatically given the permissions of the default group.

As new players join the server, they will automatically be added to this list.
Make a new line, type players:
New line, 4 spaces, add the player name like this: Notch:
Then, another line, 4 spaces, and add the groups. Repeat for all players you wish to manually add.
Your groups.yml, should look similar to the image.





,
Your permissions are now setup. You can save the file and it should work as expected. However, many people like to add a prefix to their name so they know which players are in which groups.
To do this, you need a chat plugin. The plugin I recommend is bChat.

,
bChat has just one file, config.yml.
Open the config.yml and you are able to format the chat for your server. The format that you could use is: format: '+PREFIX +WHITE+NAME: +WHITE+MESSAGE'

,
To add a prefix to a group we must open up the groups.yml that we added all our permissions to. The prefix is added using a permission.
The permission is:
- prefix.priority.prefix
The priority works like this: The higher the number, the higher the priority.
For example, we added three groups to the player Notch. Each of those groups could have a permission node for a prefix. So we use the priority to make sure that the prefix for the highest ranking group is used.
So for the default group we might use a priority of 10, moderator could be 20, and admin 30. Here is an example of a prefix that is the group in square brackets
- prefix.30.This would produce:
Notch: message here
We can also add color to the prefix:
- prefix.30.+REDThis prefix system is useful as it allows us to use the multi-group system, while still providing a way for per group prefixes.
Your groups.yml may look similar to the image.

,
You can use commands to add/remove groups to players, and add/remove permission nodes from groups. The command is:
/p For example,
/p global addgroup admin JebAdds the admin group to the player Jeb.

, You should fill your hunger bars. Full hunger bars, or 90% full or more, will heal you slowly.

, Make sure you have full hearts.

, Diamond is recommended.

, You might lose some hunger bars.

, It could run out. You could instead bring multiple damaged armour/swords, if you have them.

, Put cobblestone right above your head, as low as possible. Like #3, but this is better because, well, trees don't spawn everywhere you want 'em to. Cobblestone is highly recommended, because Endermen cannot take cobblestone and cobblestone is probably the easiest block to get that they will not take. These basic blocks they will pick up: Grass block, dirt and sand. They even pick up gold blocks, diamond blocks, iron, melon blocks, pumpkins, TNT, clay, gravel, glass blocks/panes, stained glass blocks/panes, red sand, podzol and gravel.

, A buddy will make it much easier to kill mobs. Note: If you have your friend (or even brother/sister/relative) in your house, open to LAN by doing this: In your single player world, press Esc on your keyboard > Open to LAN > Start LAN World. Your friend/relative must be on a computer linked to your computer's network.

, Some users use Big Brother, but be aware it has been known to cause block lag. Such plugins allow the server to ""undo"" changes in blocks.

, They need to have played on your server for a while and have helped out where they could.

,, Also, if your computer overheats and doesn't shut down, then this could have a nasty result to your hardware and maybe other things, as well.

Make a hoe.,
Pick your gardening patch.,
Secure a water source.,
Provide plenty of light.,
Collect seeds.",How to Run a Successful Garden on Minecraft1," To make a basic hoe, you'll need two sticks and two wooden planks. On your crafting table, place the two sticks on the center and bottom-center tiles, and place the planks on the top-center and top-left tiles. Try replacing the wooden planks with iron ingots for a more durable hoe. All Minecraft hoes are equal in speed., You can run a successful garden above ground or below ground, as long as you have enough light. The important thing is that your garden is near where you are sleeping and working, so that it will be easy to maintain and harvest. Clear a spot of flat land near your base of operations.


Consider finding a place that will be hard or impossible for monsters to reach. This way, you won't have to worry about fighting off spiders or rebuilding your garden after a creeper has blown it up.
If you do most of your work and exploring underground, it might be worth building your garden down there. Light the area completely with torches, and make sure to find or build a space with a dirt floor.

, You can build your garden along a natural water source, like a river or pond, or you can irrigate a dry area yourself. Your crops will grow whether or not there is water nearby, but most Minecraft plants grow more quickly when they are irrigated. Farmland will be automatically irrigated if it is within 4 blocks of water.To create an inexhaustible water source, build a bucket using three iron ingots, then use that bucket to draw water from an existing water block. Dig a hole in the ground one square deep and at least three squares long. Then, right-click to pour the water into the hole. Repeat until you fill at least three adjacent squares with water. Now, when you draw water from the center, the space will immediately refill.
If you're going for water efficiency, know that one block of water will technically irrigate the 80 surrounding blocks., Your plants will only grow when the area is well-lit. If you are planting your garden outside, place a torch next to your crops. This way, they'll keep growing overnight, and they'll be ready much sooner.This has the added benefit of preventing monsters from spawning in your garden.

, Start with wheat: it is the basic piece of a successful Minecraft garden. You can also grow pumpkins, melons, carrots, and potatoes, but not until you've happened across their seeds in the wild.You can use wheat to bake bread, attract animals, and grow more wheat.


Pick up wheat seeds when you break blocks of long wild grass. The seeds only pop out occasionally, so it might take a few minutes of grass-cutting to collect enough seeds. You will also get seeds each time that you harvest your garden-planted wheat, so you don't need to collect more than a few seeds to begin with.
Look for pumpkin and melon seeds in your travels. You can craft melon seeds out of melons and pumpkin seeds out of collected pumpkins.You can also find these seeds in chest minecarts in 45.2% of chest minecarts in abandoned mineshafts.Look for carrots and potatoes in NPC villages. They are also occasionally dropped by slain zombies. There are no seeds – you'll plant the vegetables directly into the ground as you would a seed."
"
Till the ground.,
Right-click to plant.,
Plant various crops.",How to Run a Successful Garden on Minecraft2," Right-click a dirt block with your hoe to ""till"" that block. The top layer will appear light-brown and grooved. If the block is ""irrigated"" with enough water, it will quickly turn a darker shade of brown. Keep tilling adjacent spaces until you have enough to plant all of your seeds. You can plant one seed in each block.


You cannot plant a seed in an untilled space. If you wait too long, the tilled block will return to dirt.
Arrange your plants in easy-to-access rows. You can walk through wheat-grass, carrots, and potatoes at every stage of their growth, but you cannot walk through melons or pumpkins.

, Point your seeds at a tilled block and right-click. You should see a seedling take root. Move down the row until you have planted all of the seeds that you want to plant.


If you are planting melons or pumpkins, remember to leave a free space next to each plant for the melon/pumpkin to grow.If you are planting carrots or potatoes, remember that you don't need a seed – simply plant the vegetable into a tilled earth patch.

, In a standard garden, you will probably plant wheat, and you may plant melon, pumpkin, carrots, or potatoes if you have come across them. Consider diversifying your garden by planting other things: red and yellow flowers, red and brown mushrooms, cocoa beans, sugar cane, and even various trees. These plants can add color and utility to your garden.

"
"
Be patient.,
Harvest mature crops.,
Replant the seeds.,
Expand your garden.",How to Run a Successful Garden on Minecraft3," Wait for your crops to ripen. Plants will grow more quickly when they are irrigated and well-lit – including at night. Try using bone meal on plants to make them ready more quickly. Two doses of bone meal should bring a freshly-planted wheat seed to full maturity.


Wheat will grow up slowly from green to golden-brown. When it fills the full air-block, you'll know that it's time to harvest. If you aren't sure, look online for photos of mature Minecraft wheat.

, Left-click or ""punch"" mature plants to harvest their bounty. You can also use your hoe, although there's no advantage here. The crops will fall to the ground, ready for you to pick them up, and a few seeds may also scatter in the process. Collect and store the harvested wheat, pumpkins, melons, etc. Your crops may not all ripen at the same time unless you are very efficient in your planting process.

, Most of the time, harvesting a crop will reveal seeds. This is especially true of wheat: you may only get one seed per plant, or you may find several. Either way: quickly replant seeds in each of the tilled, harvested blocks to keep your garden growing. You may need to re-till some spaces.

, As you collect more seeds and more varieties, you may want to plant more crops and make your garden larger. You may be able to slowly and ""naturally"" grow your garden by planting any extra seeds that you get from the harvest. Remember that the larger your garden grows, the more water you will need to keep it evenly irrigated.


Read up on efficient ways to organize your garden. Get creative. Try to figure out how you can grow the most plants with the least water, or how you can harvest the plants more quickly.
There is no limit to the size of your garden. You may find that even a small wheat garden relatively quickly fulfills your survival needs – but it doesn't hurt to expand!

Find the more lush land.,
Look for sunny, exposed areas.,
Listen for oinking.,
Know that you can’t craft saddles.,
Find Saddles in chests.,
Fish a Saddle out.,
Trade for a Saddle.,
Equip the Saddle.,
Get on the pig.,
Ride!",How to Ride a Pig in Minecraft," For some of you unlucky enough to spawn in areas like, say, the desert or the middle of an ocean, you might find it difficult to find pigs. According to the source code of the game, pigs spawn on top of grass blocks. Which means that biomes like Deserts, Extreme Hills, and Mesas won’t host any delightful oinkers in the vicinity. Places full of snow also don’t spawn them, but “cold” places with blue grass and snow when you climb up do. Move to greener areas like Forests and Plains. Just make sure you explore each area thoroughly, in case you miss some areas leading to goodies or resources.;
, Pigs also spawn in sunnier places, making Plains and its cousins the best place to search for them, with the Forests a close second. Roofed Forest biomes alternate between being dark and light, so don’t rely on that area to find pigs.

, Once you’ve found a nice wide, open grassy area, keep an ear out for walking sounds and oinking, and watch for vague pink shapes in the distance. You can, of course, kill the pig you find, but where’s the fun in that? You’re here to RIDE PIGS!

, Before fulfilling your dreams of pig-riding, you’ll need a saddle. Saddles are pretty uncommon in Minecraft, and can’t be crafted by the player. They have to be found or traded for.

, When you go exploring above and underground, you’ll sometimes find specially generated areas with some resources for your taking. Saddles have a chance of being found in most dungeon-type areas and inside the blacksmith’s house in villages.


Dungeons include Strongholds, the Nether Fortress, Desert and Jungle Temples, Abandoned Mineshafts, and End Cities.
Blacksmith houses basically resemble “clean” stone building with an open “forge” in a pool of lava and some furnaces, and a small interior “workshop” that includes a chest of loot.

, Fishing is a simple activity where you cast out the line, wait for a bubble trail to appear towards your lure, and immediately reel it in once the lure is tugged on. If you time it right, you’ll either get nice juicy fish to eat, some random “junk” to use, or rare items like Enchanted Books, Name Tags, and Saddles!


To cast your line, right-click or press LT/L2 while facing a body of water. Reeling it in uses the same controls.

Click here for instructions on creating a Fishing Rod.
Fishing can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Saddles are part of the “treasure” category of items found by fishing, and the overall chance to even acquire a treasure is about 5%. It might take a while before you can receive one, depending on how lucky you are.
For more experienced players, having a fishing rod enchanted with Luck of the Sea III would improve your chances of getting rarer items to 8%. This will not immediately assure you’ll get a Saddle, however, but simply improves your chances to get “treasure” items.

, If you’re lucky enough find a village, a leather worker villager (one of the possible “jobs” of villagers with white aprons) will sometimes be partial to trade you a Saddle for about 8-10 emeralds (the currency of villagers, acquired by trading) apiece as a third-tier trade. You can unlock these trades by trading with them at least two times.

, Now it’s time to suit up mister piggy for your riding pleasure! This is done by right-clicking (PC) or pressing LT/L2 (console) on your piggy while you have the Saddle selected. The pig will then have a spiffy little saddle on its back, perfect for riding!

, Now it’s time to ride the pig! You can press the same buttons you used when equipping the saddle to get on the pig.


Crouching (left-Shift on PC and holding R on Xbox) would dismount you.

, Now you just sit back and watch your character be dragged everywhere by a single pig. You can’t steer the pig at all without a bit of help, so sit back, relax and let him move.


There’s a special item you can craft called Carrot on Stick. Place a Carrot and a Fishing Rod beside each other on any crafting grid. Equip it, select it, and you can then steer or guide your pig-steed up until the carrot runs out, leaving you with a fishing rod.
Carrots are quite uncommon, but once you have them you can renew them infinitely by planting them. Carrots are also rare drops from Zombies but can also be found in villages as crops. You can also use Carrots to tame and breed pigs.

Press LT to mount the horse if playing Minecraft on the Xbox 360 or Xbox One., This means that your horse has been officially tamed., A saddle is required to control a horse while you’re riding it.

Make sure you build this is the right biome; snow golems will melt in biomes with a temperature greater than 1.0, or dry/warm biomes ;
, Do this by placing two snow blocks on top of each other, and then a pumpkin on top of that. After placing the pumpkin, the snowman will come to life.

",How to Raid a Base in Minecraft PvP1," When raiding an enemy base, nighttime is the right time. Daytime is the worst time because your enemy could easily spot you. If you want to, dusk and dawn are the next best times, but the full moon provides just enough light to guide you while not revealing you to your enemies. This is the most bold method for the fearless ones.;
, See who's there and how to use the terrain to your advantage. For example guards can be taken out by sneaking around the back of a ravine and shooting them with a bow and sentries can be taken out by hiding around a hill and sniping them with a bow and arrow.

,, This is what makes this method so dangerous. Place TNT on the unguarded wall and light it with flint and steel or a Flame-enchanted arrow. The TNT will blow up, giving you a pathway into the base.

, Fight as best as you can (including splash potions) and resort to TNT at your last cost. All the enemy inside the base will be dead and you can do whatever you want with the base.

",How to Raid a Base in Minecraft PvP2," When raiding an enemy base, nighttime is the right time. Daytime is the worst time because your enemy could easily spot you. If you want to, dusk and dawn are the next best times, but the full moon provides just enough light to guide you while not revealing you to your enemies. This is the most quiet method for the fearful ones.

, You will be invisible but hide your sword just in case. Armor and tools show up during invisibility.

, Time to sneak in! Tunnel in through the base by a 6 block high and as many as the blocks until the floor wide. Poke a tunnel upwards otherwise and replace the hole with any block. Since you are invisible the enemy will not see you.

Warn an admin or OP.",How to Protect Your House from Griefers in Minecraft," 'Spawn' - short for 'spawnpoint' - is the place where players spawn when they join your server. When your house is close to spawn, this is the first thing a griefer will see. A good rule is to build your house where you can't see it from the world's spawnpoint.
, It's obvious you shouldn't grief, and reverse psychology tells us people will do something when they're told to not do it., It might be tempting to ask someone for help and give them your coordinates via the chat, but this means everyone - including griefers - knows where your house is., Though this isn't a foolproof method, making your house less attractive means griefers won't think there are lots of valuable items. So trade your fancy, two-story, modern loft for a simple cabin, and see how it works out., Loose chests and random gardens, it's just asking for trouble. Instead, keep all of your chests inside, preferably deep underground, and keep gardens and stables where you can monitor them., This won't always stop them, but when you're dealing with a rookie-griefer, they might be too scared to continue griefing., You can't guard your house 24/7, but try to keep an eye on it as often as possible., You obviously don't want a TNT trap, because then your house will also blow up, but a pitfall trap filled with mobs or lava at the door will prevent the griefer from entering your house. Make sure you include a way of temporarily deactivating the trap, or you have to able to dodge your trap, so you are still able to enter your own house., When a griefer breaks a hole in the wall to trespass, silverfish will come out of the blocks. As you may know, attacking the silverfish will only summon more from nearby blocks. Your griefer may flee, or if he's well-equipped, he might be able to defeat them and enter your house anyways.

If you want silverfish blocks, you have to

Break silverfish blocks with a pickaxe with Silk Touch (silverfish blocks can be found in Strongholds or Igloo basements)
Cheat them in using /give monster_egg
Get in Creative mode and get them from the Creative inventory


Note that experienced griefers might be able to tell that they're silverfish blocks and just climb over your wall.

, This is a very extreme measure, but it is a very good method to prevent griefers from stealing and destroying your stuff., You might be able to stop them if you close a good deal., They can kick and ban the griefer."

If kits are available, use one based on how much currency you have.,
Know the map.,
Grab some loot as quick as possible.,
Find chests hidden throughout the map.,
Conserve your food.,
Team up.,
Pick up your fallen opponent's items.,
Take some time to craft.",How to Play the Minecraft Survival Games2," For example, if you do not have a lot of currency, buy a weak kit such as chainmail or gold or leather. If you have more currency, you could buy something more powerful such as iron or even diamond. Not all maps have kits, but if yours does, it is better to go in with a kit than with nothing at all., If you play the map multiple times, you will memorize it and know where the good loot is, like studying for a big exam., As soon as the game starts, decide how you want to get your initial loot. A lot of players will attempt to loot the Cornucopia at the start of the round. Decide if you want to risk the crowd and score some loot, or immediately run off and hide.


Don't immediately equip anything good that you find. This will make you a quick target for other players who want what you have. Save your equipment for important fights later.
If you decide to head straight for the Cornucopia at the start of the round, grab as much as you can and then immediately run away. The Cornucopia will soon turn into a slaughter, and you probably don't want to be around for that.

, Most maps have chests scattered around that can provide a lot of helpful items. If you know where these chests are located, make a beeline to them. Not only will this help you get good items, but you can set up an ambush at the chest for other players.

, Food is essential for staving off hunger, which has a direct effect on your stamina. Try to hoard some food so you can survive while hiding and keep your health up.

, Although there can be only one survivor, you might last longer if you team up with someone. This can be mutually beneficial and can improve both of your chances at survival. It's much easier to win fights if you're working with someone else.


Make sure your teammate does not have more powerful items than you; this way you can kill them and they cannot kill you easily, but give them a little bit so they do not know what you are planning.
At some point, you're going to have to turn against your teammate. Make sure to always keep an eye on the other person, in case he or she decides to strike first.
Many times, offers to team up will just be traps. Be very wary when invited to join up with someone else.
A good time to sadly kill your teammate is before the deathmatch or if they try to kill you.

, After killing someone, make sure to take most of everything they were carrying. They may have powerful equipment that can help you out, or they may have healing items that can help prolong your life.


Above all else, taking your dead opponent's items keeps those items from falling into another player's hands.

, If you have lots of materials, you can try to craft some better items. These can give you an edge in battle, but crafting can be dangerous. Make sure that you're in the clear before you start crafting, or you might find yourself dead with your menus still open.

Learn how to circle strafe.,
Surprise your opponent.,
Jump when attacking.,
Attack from afar.,
Know when to run.,Try to get the first hit on a player.,
If the player has a better weapon than you (e.g.",How to Play the Minecraft Survival Games3," Survival Games always comes down to fighting other players. This means you will need to have some mastery of combat if you have any hopes of surviving. One of the most important skills you can learn is circle strafing.When circle strafing, you move sideways in a circle around your opponent. This allows you to continuously strike your opponent while they have to try to keep up with your circling.
Press the left or right strafe keys (usually A and D) and move your mouse in the opposite direction. This will keep your target centered while you circle around.

, You will have a massive advantage if you can get the drop on your opponent. If you are able to sneak up, you may be able to get off enough hits to kill the person before they even realize what's happening.

, Always jump when you're swinging your sword at your opponent. Jumping increases the chances of landing a critical hit, which deals much more damage than a standard attack. Jumping also makes you more difficult to hit by other players.

, Using the bow and arrow is a great way to inflict damage on your opponents while keeping a safe distance. You can use it to pick off players without giving away your position, or to put a few points of damage on an approaching opponent.

, There will be times when you don't have a hope of winning a fight, either because you're outnumbered or your opponent is better-equipped than you. If you find yourself in a bad situation, do everything you can to lose your opponent and run away to collect yourself and prepare to reenter the fray.


Try to steer the person chasing you into another player. They may start fighting, allowing you to get away easier.

Know the basics.,
Launch Tekkit Classic and create a new world.

,
As in vanilla Minecraft, immediately find trees and collect wood.,
Dig an underground home.

,
Go mining for days.

,
At the end of your mining adventure you should have around these total of ores: 128 Coal (not Charcoal), 32 Diamonds, 64 Gold, 32 Lapis, 3 Stacks of Redstone (at least), 64 Copper, 64 Tin, 3 Flint, 20 total of Sapphires, Rubies, and Emeralds (not vanilla Emeralds) and 64 Iron or more.,
Begin experimenting with different BuildCraft pipes.

,
Construct a macerator and double ore output by placing ores into the top slot.,
Construct a quarry and power it with engines or an energy link.,
Now the game begins to open up once you begin to gain a steady income of ores so you can begin to experiment with EE.

,
Continue to upgrade your energy sources.,
Make your factory completely automated by using Buildcraft pipes and engines and Redpower transmitters and receivers.

,
Enjoy the open-endedness.

",How to Play Tekkit (Kind of)," Before you start you need to know what's what. Know the main mods in this pack and what they do.


IndustrialCraft adds a way to power everything, as well as the ability to manipulate electricity. It also adds new weapons, armor, and ores.
RedPower adds many new uses for redstone as well as new world-generation.
BuildCraft aims to automate a lot of boring stuff in the game, such as mining and chest organizing. Great if you are the lazy type.
Equivalent Exchange II adds lots of of very high end-game items such as dark matter and the Philosopher's Stone.;
,, If on Hardcore, (not recommended for your first time) find wool as well.

,,, You should also go out and harvest rubber trees with a tree tap. Do not be surprised if you find new ores.

,, To use the macerator you will consume energy. To store energy you will need to make wires, a batbox, and some kind of generator (solar, water, or wind are the best early on).

, To create a quarry you will need: 28 cobblestone, 28 Iron Ingot, 30 Sticks, 16 Gold, and eleven diamonds. You can adjust the size of the quarry with Landmarks.

, Most servers will put you in a lobby where you can select games by interacting with signs, or by using items in your hotbar to navigate a menu. Some servers have more than one type of Skywars games available. Here are a few examples:Solo Mode: a free-for-all where only one player can win.
Team Mode: players are divided into teams. You might be able to select your team in advance using menu options or special server commands (such as /p on Hypixel).Some servers let players vote on special modes, which might add more powerful gear to the map, double your health, or add crazy special events.

, In Skywars, each player starts on a separate island, with chests of randomized loot. There is no respawning (when you're dead, you're out), and the last person left alive wins. On the most common type of map, the player islands are arranged in a big circle. The islands in the center start out uninhabited, and usually have chests with more powerful loot.


In Team Mode, your teammates start on the same island.

, Skywars is a fast-paced game, so stay alert as soon as you drop down onto your island. Your neighbors could throw snowballs at you within seconds. Stay near the middle of your island or stand in holes to avoid getting knocked off the edge.And if you have projectiles of your own, keep your eyes peeled for targets building bridges or standing in front of an edge.


If you keep getting hit by projectiles, build a wall at the edge of your island. A wall two blocks high in front of you will block arrows. A wall one block high behind you will stop you from falling if something knocks you back.

, Your island should have at least one chest, and might have more down on the lower level. Armor, weapons, and food are obviously valuable, but many items are more useful than they look:


Pick up every building block you see. You often need to build many bridges and towers to win the game.
Fishing poles let you snag other players and pull them off bridges.
Any tool with Knockback is worth keeping, along with your highest attack weapon.
Buckets for water or lava come in handy.
Stash sticks, metal ingots, and diamonds if you can craft them into better weapons.

, You're not going to do well in Skywars if you try the same thing every game. You'll get better at planning a strategy with practice, but for now follow these basic rules:


If you got good armor and weapons, make a surprise attack on your neighbors.If you did not get good items, lay low and defend until you see a chance to build to the center or sneak attack a neighbor.
If you have an average mix, decide based on the map. Maps with islands clustered together favor quick attacks, while large, spread out maps make defensive strategies better.

, If your neighbor's not paying attention, hold down the sneak button, build a short platform out from your island, and jump over to land on theirs.Once you're on the island, it's all up to your PvP skills. Be careful — if you take too long to build or to get to the center of the enemy island, anyone nearby could knock you into the void.

, Never rush onto an unprotected bridge if anyone nearby is watching you. Instead, make sure you have plenty of blocks (breaking trees and dirt if you need to), then build across safely instead:


On the edge of your island, place one block underneath you, and one block to your left or right, toward the edge of the map.
Stand on the lower block and slowly build outward toward the other island. Alternate placing blocks on the walkway and the wall to the side. The wall will stop you getting knocked into the void.If your neighbor stands at the edge waiting for you, approach until you're just out of reach, then quickly build a tower upward. If projectiles are an issue, build your tower with walls on two sides.
As soon as you're above your neighbor, jump over them onto the island.

, Most maps have at least one central island. The chests on this island usually have powerful loot, so the first player to reach them has a big advantage.Build over there as soon as your neighbors have died or moved away — but be ready to run if you don't have good armor.If the starting islands aren't too close together, you might be able to rush to the center as soon as the game starts without getting knocked off. Practice building a staircase pattern as fast as you can, which is slightly faster than a flat bridge.On many servers, chests refill after a certain amount of time. Look for a timer on the sidebar and try to be the first to return to the center chests when it reaches zero.

, It's possible to win Skywars by hiding until there's only one enemy left, or by defeating everyone in a fair fight. Your odds are much better, though, if you can get a few ""free kills"" along the way:


As soon as you get a projectile weapon, start checking nearby bridges frequently. Knocking players off bridges as they cross is one of the easiest ways to kill them.
If you see two players fighting, wait a short distance away. Once one of them dies, charge the survivor while they still have low health. If you want credit for both kills, attack early, when both enemies are alive but severely injured., If you're forced to approach an enemy on a narrow bridge, build in a diagonal zig-zag toward them whenever possible. It is much harder for someone to knock you off a diagonal bridge than a straight line. If your enemy is guarding the edge of an island, try running through them as you attack, jumping directly onto the island before they have a chance to maneuver around you.If your enemy has better armor or weapons than you do, don't try to fight at close range. Build a tower high above them instead, then build a bridge from there until you are close enough to drop lava, TNT, or other special items and projectiles.
If you're forced into a fair fight on a bridge, knocking the enemy off is often the easiest way to win. If you don't have an item that causes extra knockback, sprint at your enemy while attacking with a melee weapon., A water bucket seems useless at first glance, but it can save your life:When making a risky crossing, empty a water bucket on the bridge. If you get knocked off, try to land in the waterfall and swim back up to the top.
When jumping or falling from a great height, empty your water bucket beneath you just before you hit the ground to avoid taking damage.

, Some maps have high powered items available, especially on the central islands or if players voted for a special overpowered mode. If you get enchanted gear or golden apples, you can go on the offensive and charge players with weaker equipment. If you get ender pearls, keep these on your hotbar to teleport to safety if you fall. Ender pearls are also very useful for attacking well-defended islands without the risk of crossing a bridge., One way to get past someone's defenses is to creep down to the bottom of your island while the other player isn't looking. Build a bridge from here to the bottom of the other island, while the defender is still looking up at surface level. Just keep an eye out above you and be ready to run back.


Remember to hold down the sneak button so your name tag isn't visible.

, One of the best ways to gain an advantage in a close range fight is to trick the other player so they run into your trap. If you find a bucket of lava or a flint and steel, keep it in your hotbar but don't equip it. Try to get another player to chase you while you run backward, then select the item and drop lava or fire behind you. This usually damages the other player enough for you to win the fight, even if they have better equipment.

, Each server has its own set of Skywars maps. Each map favors different strategies, and might have special resources like hidden chests or lava. Experiment with different tactics, and spectate matches after you die to see what works for the winning players.


If you're having trouble winning on certain maps, search the server's forums for advice.

, Most big servers have their own unique additions to Skywars. You might be able to earn special currency that you can use to buy items during the game, or to buy kits that grant bonus equipment or special abilities. For the best results, choose bonuses that match the strategies you like to use. For example, if you prefer a ""camping"" strategy (defending your island until most players are dead), choose kits that give you friendly defensive mobs, knockback items, or the ability to enchant your equipment so you aren't reliant on the center chests."

Chat with other players by pressing T. This will open the chat window which you can use to type messages.",How to Play Minecraft Multiplayer1," In order to connect to multiplayer games in Minecraft, you'll need to find a server that you want to connect to. You can't browse servers from within Minecraft; instead, you'll be searching for servers using your web browser. There are several sites that specialize in server listings, and many popular servers have their own websites. Some of the biggest server listing sites include:


MinecraftServers.org
MinecraftForum.net Server section
PlanetMinecraft.com Server section;
, It will look something like mc.wubcraft.com or 148.148.148.148. It also may have a port on the end displayed as :25565.

, There are several things you'll want to pay attention to when selecting a server. Different servers offer wildly-different experiences, and most will have descriptions that you can read. Look for a few important details before picking a server to try:


Game type - While many servers offer the standard Minecraft gameplay, there are lots of servers with all kinds of game modes. These range from capture the flag to in-character role-playing, and everything in between.
Whitelist - If a server operates a whitelist, it only accepts users that have been registered. This usually means you'll need to create an account on the server's website in order to connect.
Population - This is the number of people currently playing, as well as the maximum number of people. Keep in mind that you may not actually be playing with all of these people. Servers often split large populations onto multiple servers.
PvP - This stands for ""Player vs. Player"", and means that players can attack each other. These can be tough servers if you're new to the game.
Uptime - This is how often the server is online and available. If you plan to play online a lot, you'll want to find a server with an uptime of 95% or better.

, To connect to a server, you'll need the server's IP address. You can find this IP address in the server listing. The IP will be groups of letters and/or numbers separated by periods. Highlight the address and copy it to your clipboard.

, Servers often run on older versions of Minecraft, as it takes a while for server tools to get upgraded to newer versions. Take note of the version of Minecraft that the server is running.

, Before you start the Minecraft game itself, load the Launcher and take note of the Minecraft version displayed in the bottom-right corner. If this is different than the version the server is running, you'll need to edit your profile so that you load the correct version.


Click the Edit Profile button in the bottom-left corner.
Click the ""Use version"" drop-down menu and select the version that matches the server. Click Save Profile to save your changes.
Consider creating a new profile specifically for the server. If you find yourself connecting to multiple different servers all running different versions, you may want to create separate profiles for each one. This will make connecting a lot simpler.

, This will open the Multiplayer menu.

, This will open the Edit Server Info screen.

, Enter in a name into the ""Server Name"" field. This can be anything, but entering the actual name of the server will help you identify it.


Click ""Done"" to save the server information. Your newly-added server will appear on your list of games.
If the server doesn't appear, make sure that you've entered the Server Address correctly.

, Minecraft will then attempt to connect the server and load the world. If you get a message saying that the server is running a different version, make sure that you selected the correct version from the Profile menu.

, Most servers will spawn you in a Welcome area. Here you may find rules and instructions for using the server, as well as information on how to join the rest of the players.


When playing on a public server, make sure that you don't destroy anyone's creations. Not only is this considered rude behavior, it will likely get you banned from most peaceful servers.
Abide by the server rules. Minecraft is a more enjoyable experience when everyone is following the same guidelines. Rules vary from server to server, so make sure to read the information in the Welcome area and check out the server's website.

, Remember that when you're playing on public servers, you're chatting with strangers, so don't give out any personal information."

To find these servers, you'll need to use your web browser app. These servers run all kinds of different game types and modes, making for a unique experience every time. There are several websites that list a bunch of popular servers, including:


Minecraftpocket-servers.com
MCPEstats.com
MCPEhub.com/servers
MCPEuniverse.com/pocketmine/

, Most server listing sites will show details about each server, including the game modes that are available, the number of users connected, server location, and more. Use this information to find a server that meets your needs.


Make note of the game version that the server is running. Minecraft Pocket Edition does not allow you to change to different versions of the game, so you can only connect to servers that run the same version that you have installed. Most servers will update to the latest release within 24 hours of it coming out.

Server Name - You can type anything here. Type the server's name to help you easily identify it later.
Address - Enter in the IP address into this box.
Port - Enter the port number into this box. The port number is the number that appears after the : in the server address.

, The game will attempt to connect to the server. Once you are connected, you will be spawned in the server's Welcome area.


If you can't connect, there are a few different factors that may be causing the problem. You won't be able to connect if the server is full, and you won't receive a message informing you. If the server is offline, you won't be able to connect. You also won't be able to connect if you have the same name as another player that is already connected.
You can change you in-game name from the Settings menu on the main Minecraft PE menu.

, Some servers ask that you register before you can begin playing or earning benefits in the game. Follow the prompts to register your email address with the server. You'll need to open the verification message that's sent to your email address.

The server will be private so that only your friends can join, and you can even install mods. This requires that you have a computer that can be on and connected to the internet at all times.


The Minecraft server files are free and can be downloaded from minecraft.net/download. Download minecraft_server.X.X.X.exe.
This section will deal with creating a quick-setup Windows server. For instructions on creating a server in Linux or OS X, or for creating a server in Windows manually, click here.

, The Minecraft server will install all of its files into whatever folder it is run from. Create a folder on your desktop or other easy-to-access location and name it ""Minecraft Server"" or something similar. Copy the minecraft_server.X.X.X.exe file into this folder.

, You'll see a couple of files created in your folder, and then the program will close automatically. This is supposed to happen.

, Change this to white-list=true. This will enable the white-list which is the list of approved users. Anyone else will not be able to connect to your server, making it private for you and your friends.


You can make other changes to the game's settings here, but for now save and close the file.

, Gather your friends' Minecraft user names and add them one-by-one to the white-list with the following command: whitelist add playerName.

, Your basic server is up-and-running, and your friends have been added to the white-list. You'll now need to configure your router to allow them to connect to the server and access the game. This requires forwarding a port.


Log into your router's configuration tool. This can usually be accessed from your web browser by entering the address 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, or 192.168.2.1. The address may be different for your router model.
You'll need to enter the router administrator's username and password. Check your router's documentation for the default login info if you never changed it.

, Your computer's public IP address will be displayed above the search results. Copy this address or write it down. Give it to your friends to use to connect to the server.


Note: If you have a dynamic IP address (most people do), your IP address will change occasionally. When it does, you'll need to give out the new IP address to your friends so that they can connect again. You can avoid having to do this in the future by setting up dynamic DNS. This usually requires setting up a paid account with a service that will automatically forward users who enter your domain name to your active IP address.

, Your server is online, your white-list is ready, and your ports have been forwarded. Your friends can now connect to the server using the IP address that you gave them, but you'll need to use a different IP address.


Open the Multiplayer menu in your Minecraft game. Your game should appear in the list of games, but if it doesn't click the ""Add Server"" button. If you're playing on the same computer as the server, enter 127.0.0.1. If you're on a different computer on the same network, enter the server's local IP address (the same one you used to forward the port). If you're on a computer on a different network, enter the server's public IP address.

, Take the logs and create one workbench, one wood pick, and eight sticks.

, However, if a cave is not available at the moment, stick with the infamous ""dig down"" technique. Your top priority is to mine thirteen cobblestone. If you happen to find coal or iron, remember its location for later.

Explode TNT.",How to Make Flint and Steel in Minecraft," Gravel is a light grey block that falls when nothing is under it. You can find it in large quantities underwater, on beaches, on village pathways, and occasionally in caves. If you're not near any of these features, just dig underground until you come across it. However, be cautious when digging straight down.;
, About 1 in 10 gravel blocks drop a piece of flint instead of gravel when destroyed.Using a shovel will let you dig through gravel much faster, and if enchanted with Fortune, it will increase the chances of getting flint.A shovel requires one material of your choice (wood planks, cobblestone, iron ingot, gold ingot, or diamond) and two sticks, plus a crafting table. On the computer edition, place these in a vertical column with the material on top.

, Iron is fairly common underground and in caves, so you shouldn't have to dig deep to find it. It looks like stone with flecks of beige. You must use a stone pickaxe or better to mine it.

, You can't use iron ore until you separate the iron from the stone. Here's how to do it:


Build a furnace out of eight cobblestone using a crafting table. (In the computer edition, fill every square except the center.)
Use the furnace to open a smelting interface.
Place the iron ore in the top slot.
Place coal, wood, or other flammable items in the lower fuel slot. (This will be destroyed.)
Wait for the smelting to finish.
Get the iron ingot from the results slot on the right.

, If you are playing Minecraft on the computer or on a console with advanced crafting enabled, just place an iron ingot and piece of flint anywhere in the crafting grid.Drag flint and steel from the results box to your inventory.


If you are playing Minecraft 1.7.1 or earlier, you need to place the flint exactly one square below and one square to the right of the iron ingot., On devices with simple crafting systems, just select the Flint and Steel recipe from the crafting screen.


On Minecraft Pocket edition, flint and steel is only available in version 0.4.0 and later.You can only light fires in 0.7.0 and later.All console versions have flint and steel.

, Before you start lighting things on fire, learn how to stop it from burning down your base:Fire can spread to any empty block above a flammable surface. The furthest it can jump is one square down, one square to the side, or four squares up.
Solid barriers will not stop the fire from spreading.
Water will extinguish fire.

, Place the flint and steel in one of your quick slots and select it. You can now use the item the same way you would an equipped pickaxe or other tool. Using the item on a flammable object (such as wood or grass) will start a fire. Using it on a non-flammable object (such as stone) may start a short-lived fire. Here are a few ways to use a fire:


Temporary lighting when you're low on torches
Clearing a forest for a large building project
Lighting enemies on fire — they're flammable too! Creepers will explode, and most other mobs will slowly take damage.

, You might find TNT guarding a desert temple, or you can make it yourself by filling the crafting area with alternating gunpowder and sand. Lighting it with flint and steel gives you about four seconds to run before it explodes.To give yourself more time, light a flammable block near the TNT and let it spread to ignite the TNT indirectly.

Earn emeralds to trade.,
Find an armorer blacksmith’s house in a village.,
Open the trade GUI window.,
Trade with the armorer.",How to Make Chain Armor in Minecraft1," You can purchase chain armor from blacksmiths by exchanging emeralds. Emeralds can be obtained by trading with other villagers or through mining.


Villagers are also willing to buy items from you by paying you with emeralds. See what other villagers are looking to trade with. For example a brown robed villager will offer an emerald for a certain amount of wheat.
Emeralds can be found by mining emerald ore and can usually be found in Extreme Hill biomes. However locating emerald ore is very uncommon and is more time consuming than initiating trades with villagers.
The price of chain armor pieces vary. A Chain Helmet requires 5-6 emeralds, a Chain Chest plate requires 11-14 emeralds, a pair of Chain Leggings requires 9-10 emeralds and a pair of Chain Boots requires 5-6 emeralds.;
, These villagers live in a Forge building that features a lava pool on the front porch and can be seen wearing a black colored apron. Only blacksmiths with the armorer job will trade chain armor. , Right-click on the villager to show the trade graphics user interface (GUI.) This will show what the villager has on offer to trade with. You will need to identify that the blacksmith has the armorer job title which you can see at the top of the trade window. Click the left or right arrows to see what items the villager has to trade with and their requirements to make the trade.


The blacksmith may have a different occupation such as a Tool Smith or Weapon Smith. These types do not craft chain armor.
If the village does not contain a blacksmith with the armorer job occupation, try finding another village.

, The armorer may not have the chain armor available for trade. This depends on their tier rating which determines the different items they have available. In order for the armorer to offer chain armor pieces to trade, you may have to trade it for other items to help it advance in it’s tier rating.


If they do not have any chain armor pieces to trade with, trade with the last item they have in their list by clicking on the right arrow to reach the end of the list and initiate the trade. Close the trade GUI screen. There is a chance the armorer will appear with a glow. This means that they have advanced in their tier rating and may potentially have a piece of the chain armor available for trade. Repeat the process until the chain armor pieces become available.

Understand the concept of hostile mob farming.,
Change the difficulty to a harder mode.,
Create traps to farm for hostile mobs.,
Kill a mob wearing chain armor.",How to Make Chain Armor in Minecraft2," Farming is a method that abuses game logic to provide the player with a higher probability of obtaining items. Hunting for hostile mobs specifically requires you to attack hostile mobs in areas they commonly appear at. This involves making an environment that allows you to corral mobs in a central area and provide efficiency of obtaining dropped items.

, The difficulty in Minecraft determines how hostile mobs spawn and how damage is dealt to the player. Changing the difficulty to a harder mode provides a higher chance for enemies to spawn equipped with weapons and armor and in some cases, they can be wearing chain armor. A hostile mob is a type of non player character (NPC) that will attack the player. The only hostile mobs that may spawn with the chain armor are the zombies and skeletons.The higher difficulty levels provide a greater chance of finding mobs wearing chain armor.


If playing in hardcore mode, the game difficulty cannot be changed.
Changing the difficulty to a harder mode provides a greater chance of being killed by mobs or starvation.
The difficulty can be changed at any time during the game. Once you find the pieces of armor you can change the difficulty back down.
Mobs do not wear armor on the Peaceful or Easy difficulty setting.

, Hostile mob farming involves setting up traps around where they commonly appear or spawn at. An example is creating a canal using water element blocks that transport mobs to a central area or moat, making it easier to attack them without them being able to attack you. Hostile mobs appear in the dark, which will require a dark room for them to appear in which can be made out of blocks in the world or can be made by mining underground.Try creating an area where the mob is not able to fight back, such as using slab blocks surrounded by regularly sized blocks that prevent movement. Mobs are not able to crawl under holes which makes it easier to attack them.
A mob spawner will periodically generate mobs which can provide an advantage through farming techniques as you will know where the mobs appear at directly. Mob spawners for zombies and skeletons appear in underground dungeons.To create a trap around mob spawners, light the area with torches around and on the spawner to prevent mobs from appearing due to the light. Once the trap is set, remove the torches to allow the mobs to spawn.
Skeletons and zombies won’t fall from high places. You can use blocks such as signs around edges as they will treat them as blocks to stand on, only to fall below them. Be careful using signs in your traps as they can also act as a barrier for elemental blocks such as water.

, If you find a zombie or skeleton wearing the armor, use your weapons to kill them. There will be a small (~5%) chance that they will drop the armor once defeated. Run over the armor to collect it. If they do not drop the armor, repeat the process until the armor pieces are obtained.


A sword with a Looting enchantment has a greater chance of the mob to drop chain armor piece."

You can also use the Crafting Table to create other tools, weapons, and armors.

, Find mushrooms in dark caves and shady areas, so look in swamp biomes or in Nether for them. They're mostly found there due to its low light conditions.


Brown Mushrooms have also been known to spawn in jungles and open caves.

, To craft Sugar, open your Crafting Table and then place one Sugar Cane in the middle of the empty boxes.


Sugar is a food item derived from Sugar Cane, and Sugar Canes are found in the newly generated world, mostly three blocks tall.
Sugar Cane is found growing naturally, but somewhat rarely on dirt, grass, and sand directly adjacent to water.
To have a constant supply of sugar for future alchemic or cooking uses, you can plant Sugar Canes on sand as long as it's next to a source of water. Harvest by removing only the top layer and leave the base layer intact to keep it growing.
1 Sugar Cane produces 1 Sugar.

, Spider Eye is a poisonous food and brewing item. Is it dropped by Spiders, Cave Spiders, and Witches.


Spiders can be found in the forest, but the best source for the Spider Eye are from Cave Spiders since they can be found quickly if there's a spawner nearby.

, With the gathered ingredients stored in your inventory, open your Crafting Table to start crafting the fermented spider eye. Place the Sugar in the middle and then place the Brown Mushroom to the left side. Spider Eye should be placed below the Sugar.


Once you're done, click on the Fermented Spider Eye, which can be found to the right side of the window, and then place it in your inventory to complete the process.

, Fermented Spider Eye is usually used for brewing unique kinds of potions. Use it for the following potions:


Potion of Weakness can reduce melee damage to 50%.
Potion of Harming damages three hearts.
Potion of Slowness slows players and mobs by 15%.
Potion of Invisibility makes players disappear, and mobs will act neutral toward the player if the player is not wearing armor.

Eat your cookies.",How to Make Cookies in Minecraft," Cocoa beans only grow in jungles, which are most likely to appear next to other medium-temperature biomes like plains, forest, and swamps. Jungles are easy to identify from their extra-tall trees, but it can take a long time to find one in some worlds.



Sailing along the coast is a good way to look for new biomes. Set the render distance as far as you can so you can see jungle trees from a distance.
If you're having no luck, download a mapping tool such as Amidst (for Computer Edition only).;
, Search for cocoa pods on the sides of jungle trees. These have three stages of growth. The small, green cocoa pods only give you one bean. If you wait for them to grow into large, orange-brown pods, you can get two or three beans.One cocoa bean makes eight cookies.

, Before you craft the cookies, save a couple cocoa beans and chop down a few logs of jungle tree wood. Once you're back at your base, use the pod on the side of a jungle wood block and wait for it to grow larger. This will give you an infinite source of cocoa beans.

, Use a hoe on a patch of dirt or grass to turn it into farmland.


If you already have wheat, make cookies by placing these ingredients in a horizontal row: wheat, cocoa bean, wheat.

, Place water within four blocks of the farmland, on the same horizontal level or one block higher. The farmland will turn a darker color to show that it's been watered. You'll also need to keep the farmland bright so the crops can grow, using sunlight or torches.Leave the water there while the wheat grows. Wheat will still grow if the farmland dries out, but it will take longer.

, Use seeds on the farmland to plant the wheat crop. Tall grass has a chance to drop seeds each time you break it.


The fastest way to gather your first seeds is to pour water on a field of tall grass, breaking it all at once.
Each seed will give you one wheat. You need two wheat for every cocoa bean to make cookies.

, After two or three Minecraft days, the seeds will turn into tall, yellow wheat stalks. Break these to put wheat in your inventory.Breaking them before they're finished growing will only give you seeds.


Wheat has seven stages of growth in the Computer edition, and four stages in Pocket edition.

, Each recipe takes two wheat items and one cocoa bean, and makes eight cookies. If you are playing an edition with the full crafting mode, place the ingredients in one horizontal line in this order: wheat, cocoa bean, wheat.

, Watch the crumbs fly! Each cookie restores 2 hunger and 0.5 saturation, or 1 hunger on Pocket Edition."

, Go out of the hole and create a small 3x3 room. Replace the top block. This should make it so that you can see the monsters' legs but they shouldn't be able to hit you.

, Test out your mob trap. If they can get you, turn it back to peaceful and make changes. You could also make a trap with redstone to kill the mobs, meaning you wouldn't have to spend so much time down there. If you can kill them, then you can turn it to whatever difficulty you want. Kill the mob and harvest exp!

Launch the game.,
Consider your Biome options.,
Explore the world to find the right Biome.",How to Make an Ice Farm in Minecraft1," On the PC, Mac, and Linux edition, if you’ve installed the game correctly and enabled shortcuts, you can find the shortcut icon of Minecraft on your desktop. Simply double-click the icon, and it will open the launcher. You can then log into your account and press the “Play” button near the bottom of the window to launch the game, then press the “Singleplayer” option once the game loads. On the console edition, simply place the CD in and run it from here.;
, Before everything else, you will need to find a place where it’s constantly snowing. This is because ice only forms when there’s snowfall on a patch of water. Biomes like Cold Taigas, Ice Plains, Snowy Beaches, and Ice Spike Plains are your best bet for an Ice farm, since it’s constantly snowing there, though be prepared, since these areas are a bit tough to survive in. These biomes are normally somewhat difficult to survive in due to the lack of abundant resources.


Other candidate Biomes are places like Taigas and Extreme Hills, which have snow the higher up you are in the biome, though it can be a bit tricky to climb, and falling off those areas can lead to instant death and loss of your items.

, Cold Taigas, Ice Plains, Snowy Beaches, and Ice Spike Plains are distinguished by the white layer covering the ground from the constant snowfall. Taigas and Extreme Hills can be distinguished by the dull, almost bluish coloration of the grass and the abundance of either Stone or Spruce Trees (trees with a very dark-brown wood and dark blue-green leaves). Normally, you can easily find these areas by exploring your world, and sometimes you’re lucky enough to be on one or near one when you first make the world.


Each biome is randomly generated across the world though. You’ll only have to rely on the scenery to determine where you are, so there are no absolute guarantees that a certain direction leads to any of them, meaning you’ll have to explore extensively if you want your farm ready!

Identify the items you need.,
Make a Torch.,
Create a Bucket.,
Make a tool.,
Create an Enchantment Table.,
Enchant the tool with Silk Touch.,
Enchant the tool through other ways.",How to Make an Ice Farm in Minecraft2," At the very least, you need 1 Bucket and a tool with the enchantment Silk Touch. With the Bucket, you can gather the water needed to provide a steady stream of water to freeze, but you can’t harvest the resulting Ice without a tool (Shovel, Axe, or Pickaxe) with Silk Touch. This is because some blocks break too easily, and yield nothing when interacted with, so Silk Touch bypasses the sensitivity, so to speak, of the block and lets you obtain the block itself.

, The most basic method asks for a singular Torch, and making a torch is also quite vital since it lights up your way and keeps monsters from spawning in the area it’s placed in. Simply take one piece of coal and a single stick, then upon opening your inventory (E key on the computer; triangle and Y on the Xbox), place the coal on the top row of the 2x2 crafting grid found next to your character. Place the stick below it. This will yield you 4 torches from the get-go.

, Before crafting your bucket, though, you first need a crafting table. To create a crafting table, open your inventory and place four Wood Planks on all the slots of the 2x2 crafting grid. Your Crafting Table will appear in the result slot next to the grid. Place it on the ground by right-clicking or pressing the Left Trigger button on your controller. You can then pull up the Crafting menu by facing the table and right-clicking or pressing the X button.


Now create a Bucket by arranging 3 Iron ingots in a V pattern on your Crafting Table like so:
i = iron
X = empty space
X X X
i X i
X i X

, Tools are easy enough to create, even in the earliest stage of the game. All you’ll need is, at most, your crafting table, 3 Cobblestone, and 2 Sticks. Here are the crafting recipes for all the tools:
s = sticks
m = stone/iron/gold/diamond
X = empty space


Axe
m m X
m s X
X s X
Pickaxe
m m m
X s X
X s X
Shovel
X m X
X s X
X s X

, While the tools themselves are easy enough to make, enchantments are much harder, and Silk Touch is the rarest enchantment of the bunch. To even consider enchanting, you’ll be needing an Enchanting Table, a somewhat late-game crafting station that lets you enchant different supplementary effects on your weapons and tools. To make an Enchantment Table, you’ll need four Obsidian, two Diamonds, and a Book. Diamonds and Obsidian can be very hard to acquire at the early stages of the game since you’ll actually need a Diamond Pickaxe to even harvest Obsidian.


To craft the Enchantment Table itself, you’ll also need your trusty Crafting Table, and lay out your materials in this format:
o = obsidian
b = book
d = diamond
X = empty space
X b X
d o d
o o o

, To enchant a tool with your table, first make sure your level is at least 30 to take full advantage of the enchanting mechanism. You can find out your current level by checking the small green number in the middle of the small tracking bar on top of the hotbar.


Take your desired tool and place it on the left slot on the Enchantment Table’s crafting window, and on the PC, you also need to put at least 1 piece of Lapis Lazuli (a very rare resource you can sometimes find through mining very deep underground or from trading with villagers) on the right slot, and you’ll see that at the right, there will be three options presented. The topmost option costs the least amount of EXP, and the third option costs the most. Select whichever one looks most promising to you, or the one you can afford, and then the weapon will then start to glow a purplish light, signifying that you successfully enchanted it.
It will take you a few tries before you can get Silk Touch, since it’s a rare enchantment.

, If you can’t make an Enchantment Table or don’t have enough resources to keep trying with that method, there are other available methods, like obtaining an Enchanted Book from either fishing, trading with Villagers, or exploring mineshafts, dungeons, temples, or strongholds. You can apply an Enchanted Book to your tool using an Iron Anvil.


Sometimes, finding a Priest Villager (purple robes) and talking to him might luckily let him enchant a tool with Silk Touch. This is somewhat unreliable because not all Priests can enchant Silk Touch, and sometimes they require tools and objects you do not have on hand.
Occasionally, Zombies will hold an enchanted tool, marked by the purple glow effect on it. Killing the Zombie will rarely give you the tool itself, but this is less reliable than the other methods. In any case, enchanting a tool might be the most difficult due to the rarity of this enchantment and the scarcity of the methods to obtain it.

Build a farm the simple way.,
Build a farm using a 5x5 area.,
Build a farm using a trench.",How to Make an Ice Farm in Minecraft3," The extremely simple way is to find a frozen river or patch of water, place a block on top of the ice (PC: press the number corresponding to your item in your hotbar, or use the mouse scroll button to select the item, then right-clicking on the area; Xbox: select items by pressing the Right and Left Bumper buttons, and place it by pressing the left trigger button), and then place a torch in the middle of it. This method is the simplest, and relies on the Torch’s ability to melt the water to provide a steady source of water. You can also place a torch on the shore and harvest the Ice forming at the fringes of the resulting path of water.


This is a little ineffective compared to the next two methods since you run the risk of running out of water, or creating an un harvestable flowing patch of water if you’re not too careful.

, This method is a bit more streamlined, but takes an area of at least 5x5 blocks. First, dig a square of land about 3x3 blocks big and 2 blocks deep. Fill the bottom of the hole with water until the whole pool is still. You can gather water with your bucket; just go up to some water with your bucket equipped, and select the water. The easiest and least time- and resource-consuming way of filling up your pool is by selecting your filled bucket again to place the water on the four corners of the pool. You can also craft multiple buckets and then fill them with water to minimize the effort of gathering water, but only if you have enough resources to do so.


Slowly place some blocks in an alternating pattern around the top of the pool, which would cover strategic parts of the pool to keep it from freezing entirely. It should look a bit like this:
b = base block (dirt, cobblestone, sandstone, etc.
w = water
X = blank space
Pool:
b b b b b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b b b b b
Cover Layer:
b b b b b
b b X b X
b X X X X
b b X X X
This method is more efficient since it covers certain areas, so that when the ice is harvested, the water flows back in without danger of running out, making the ice an infinitely renewable resource.

, The last method is yet another variation of this simple system, but streamlines the process even further and removes the possibility of errant flow patterns due to its design. Basically, you create a trench about 3 blocks wide and however long you want. Then fill in the trench with water.


One way you can do this quickly is to place water at the corners of your pool then every two or three blocks along the trench, you place your water at the middle until you reach the end. At 2 blocks above your trench, create a capital I shape like so:
Pool
b b b b b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
d d d d d
Cover Layer (must be two blocks above bottom of pool)
X X X X X
X b b b X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X b b b X
X X X X X
This streamlines the process considerably without using redstone, but also ensures the production is faster and more efficient than the first two methods.

"
"
Select your tool with Silk Touch.,
Go to the iced area you want to harvest.,
Left-click or press the Right Trigger button on the ice to gather your blocks.",How to Make an Ice Farm in Minecraft4," On the computer, you can do this by pressing the number corresponding to your tool in your hotbar, which can be located on the bottom of your screen, or using the mouse scroll button to select your tool. On the Xbox, you can select it by pressing the right and left bumper buttons, then placing it by pressing the left trigger button.


If your tool is missing from the hotbar, press the inventory button to access your inventory, select the tool, and then place it on your hotbar. If your hotbar is full, click on the item you want to replace, place it in an empty slot in your inventory, and finally place your tool on the free slot on the hotbar.

, Ice resembles translucent pale-blue solid blocks and can be quite slippery when moving across it. The exposed areas of your pool must be fully frozen to take advantage of your farm. If only one or two blocks are frozen, depending on the size of your pool, it isn’t really worth it. So it’s best to wait for a while before picking a random block of Ice to gather.

, Once gathered, you can now use your ice to create different things, from skating rinks to traps to an igloo! Remember, once you place the ice, you’ll need the tool to gather it up again or else it will break. But even if you accidentally break the ice, your farm would ensure a steady supply of the material for as long as you play!

Now place the water first, then the lava.,
Add a repeater to the block on the lava container that's right next to the first redstone wire we put down.,

Finally, adding an on/off switch.,
Mine to your heart's content.

",How to Make an Infinite Cobblestone Generator in Minecraft3,"


Place a sticky piston with a glass on top of it in the hole.

,


The lava goes on the side closer to the piston and glass, and the water goes on the other side. the hole allows the water to flow horizontally at the flowing lava, creating cobblestone.

,


Add a redstone torch and a repeater to one side and throw some redstone dust on the ground on the other. Don't actually place the cobblestone, it was just for demonstration purposes.

,


Where the redstone wire is, dig down one block towards the water, then down away from the pistons, and then to the side one towards the lava.

,


The generator will work, but just push the blocks up. Then, add another piston to push them sideways to make them easier to mine, or even to add another row of pistons to make a self-repairing wall!

,


The repeater has to be on the first tick setting. Then, add the two blocks as seen in the picture and wire them up and throw the piston on there.

,


From the block that has the redstone torch on it, place 9 redstone on the ground going away from the lava. then place a block and put redstone on it. Put another redstone torch on the ground next to that block underneath where the cobblestone is pushed. This will turn off our first redstone torch and stop the generator. Also, if you do this you don't have to reset it. When neither of the pistons can push the new cobblestone, it is left there and the circuit stays on until you break the block next to the lava. With this you can just mine the cobblestone and it keeps going.

,


Go to the block that our first redstone torch is on, and put a switch on the back of it. When the switch is off, the generator will run, and when you turn the switch on, the generator will stop.

Search for this light blue ore on layers 5–12 for best results.Dig down until you find bedrock (an unbreakable grey block), then count 5-12 blocks above it. Mine the diamonds with an iron or gold pickaxe.


Remember, never dig straight down. A ""staircase"" mine keeps you safe from pits and lava.
You'll need two diamonds to make an enchantment table. You'll also need a diamond pickaxe to mine obsidian (of which you need 4 for an enchantment table), which requires three more diamonds.
Stick to layers 11 and 12 to avoid most of the lava.;
, Obsidian is a dark black block that only appears when flowing water hits lava. You can make this happen yourself by making buckets out of three iron ingots. Scoop up lava with one bucket and pour it into a four-block pit. Pour the water from a higher structure so it flows down onto the lava. The lava should become obsidian.

, Obsidian blocks will only drop crafting materials if you use a diamond pickaxe., You can break apart bookshelves in village or stronghold libraries to get ready-made books. Alternatively, craft them yourself:


Kill cows or horses until you get at least one leather.
Cut down three sugar cane reeds.
Craft three sugar cane into paper. (Place the three reeds in one row.) Since sugarcane is hard to find, start a sugarcane farm.
Combine one leather and three paper to make a book. (Place them anywhere in the crafting area, with the paper in separate squares.)

, Select the enchantment table recipe, or combine the items as follows on the PC advanced crafting system:


Top row: empty, book, empty
Middle row: diamond, obsidian, diamond
Bottom row: obsidian, obsidian, obsidian

, Place the enchantment table somewhere with at least two blocks of space on three sides, in a room at least two blocks high. This gives you the space to improve it with bookshelves, as described below.

, Nearby bookshelves unlock more powerful enchantments from your enchantment table. To make a bookshelf, place three books in the center row, then fill the rest of the grid with planks.


These more powerful enchantments will also cost more experience. You may want to skip this step if you're low level.

, To get the best enchantments, you'll need fifteen bookshelves. Each one must be placed as follows:


On the same level as the table, or exactly one block above it.
Keep exactly one empty block between the table and the shelf. Even torches or snow will stop the effect.

, Use the enchantment table to open the enchantment interface. You can place armor, swords, bows, books, or most tools in the enchantment table. This goes in the left slot in PC edition, and the top slot in Pocket Edition.


Books store enchantments for later use with an anvil. Enchanting tools directly is more efficient.

, In the latest versions of Minecraft, each enchantment consumes 1, 2, or 3 lapis lazuli. Place the gem in the empty slot in your table.

, Hovering over an option will tell you the name of the enchantment. There is also a chance to add additional, randomly selected enchantments.


You cannot reset the available selection without enchanting something. Blocking the path to a bookshelf will reveal new, usually lower-level options.Different types of items have different available enchantments.

, There are always three options on the enchantment table. The top one is the weakest, and costs one lapis lazuli and one experience level. The middle one costs two lapis lazuli and two levels. The bottom one costs three of each.


The number next to each option is the level of the enchantment. You must be at least this level to choose that option. It does not change the amount of experience it costs.

Sticky piston = piston + slimeball
Redstone torch = redstone + stick
Pressure plate = stone + stone (smelt cobblestone to get stone)

Lever = cobblestone + stick;
, Place six stone blocks in a pattern two blocks wide and three blocks tall. This will be the ""door"" that gets pushed aside to let you enter.


You may use almost any solid block instead of stone. There are a few blocks that do not work with sticky pistons, such as pumpkins or (in Creative mode) bedrock., Place a column of three sticky pistons with their green piston heads facing the left side of the stone structure. Leave a one block gap between the stone and pistons. Repeat with another column of three sticky pistons on the right side.


These pistons are on the left and right sides of the door, not the front and back. All the blocks you've placed should be in one row.

, Place a redstone torch on the ground directly behind the stone side of the lowest piston. Repeat for the column on the other side.


The lower two pistons of each column should extend to hit the stone structure.

, To make the top piston fire, place a block of stone directly above the redstone torch (behind the middle piston). Place redstone dust directly on top of this stone. Repeat for the other column.


Again, you can use any solid material instead of stone.
Redstone ""dust"" is slang for ordinary redstone, placed on a block.

, Make the trench extend two blocks out from the door, and all the way from one redstone torch to the other. You should end with a trench 4 deep x 2 wide x 8 long.

, Stand at the bottom of the trench and face the wall underneath your wall structure. Dig out the block two below your first redstone torch and place a second redstone torch on the ground in this hollow. (The pistons should retract, pulling the stone with them.) Repeat for the other side. A profile view of the leftmost and rightmost column should now look like this, from top to bottom:


Redstone dust
Stone
Redstone torch (placed on ground)
Dirt block (ground level)
Redstone torch (placed on block beneath)
Dirt block
(Trench floor)

, Place four stone in the center of the trench, raising it one layer. Leave the rest of the trench at its current depth.

, Place one redstone torch on the left side, and one on the right. These torches must be on the side of the block, not on the ground.

, Draw a line of redstone dust between the two torches on the left side. (The pistons should extend again when this happens.) Repeat for the two torches on the right side. Finish by covering all four blocks of the raised area with redstone dust.

, Place a 2 x 2 stone at ground level in front of the door, directly above the raised area in your trench.


Take care not to destroy the redstone dust when you place these.

, Place two stone pressure plates at the end of this platform. When you step on them, they should activate the redstone below, causing the pistons to retract. The door will open, and will not close again until you walk off the pressure plates.


Be careful when walking through. If you take too long, the door will close again and suffocate you.
If the door doesn't open, double check all your redstone dust and torches are in the right location.

, Stand on the central raised platform at the base of your trench. Dig a tunnel underneath the door, extending two blocks past it. The tunnel should be on the two blocks wide, directly beneath the stone structure of the (closed) door. The tunnel floor must be on the same level as the raised platform.

, Make sure it connects to the other redstone.

, Return to the surface. Place pressure plates two squares in front of the door, directly above the buried redstone. These pressure plates should open the door when you stand on them, just like the pair on the opposite side.

, Your door is now functional. However, any wandering enemy can walk over the pressure plates and through the door. Adding a lever will allow you to lock the mechanism:


Place the lever in a convenient location at ground level. If you want to lock the door from both sides, break a hole in the wall and place the lever there.
Place more redstone dust to connect the trail in the left of the trench to the lever.
Place another line of redstone to connect the trail in the right of the trench to the lever.

, Right-click the lever and try to walk over the pressure plates. Right-click the lever again and repeat. The doors should only open while the lever is in one of its two positions. If this isn't working, examine the redstone trail leading to the lever:


Redstone trails can only rise one square at a time. Place blocks in a ""stair"" pattern to bring it up to ground level from the base of the trench.
If the redstone nearest the lever is dark (unpowered), remove one square of powered redstone earlier in the trail. Replace this with a redstone repeater to boost the signal. Make sure to place the repeater so its front is pointed in the direction the signal should travel., Now your door should be fully functional. Cover all wiring with the blocks of your choice. Make sure all redstone dust has a block of air directly above it, or it will not work.

Enjoy.",How to Make a Zoo in Minecraft," These can include cows, pigs, chickens, and other peaceful mobs, as well as hostiles. You'll need to have an idea before building the zoo, so that you know what sorts of structures are needed to contain them well.;
, A suggestion to do would be creating a 10 block by 10 block square for each mob's pen. Avoid counting any wall space.


After all the pens are done, you could put little stands next to each pen, with Squidward or villagers.

, For cows, you could put a plains area with a tree or two and some tall grass and flowers. For zombies/skeletons, you could make a cave and have water outside so they don't burn.

, You can make them out of any material, but it's preferably at least one row of glass. For hostile mobs, you must make a roof or covered area inside.

, You can make them out of any material, but for example sand.

, If you are in creative you can spawn them. In survival, you have to lead them to your zoo, and some will be impossible, like bats(1.4), squids, etc.

, You could try to get Testificates to come by using minecarts or spawning them.

Has different biomes.
Has no giant hazards, such as a lava lake.

, 2 or 3 are good numbers, but if you have a lot of time and space you could make 4 or even 5 clans.

, 'SnowClan' would be good for a clan in a snowy biome, and 'TreeClan' would be good for woodlands.

, You could do this by placing a line of blocks, or placing one block occasionally. Make sure that each clan has enough territory to support themselves.

, You could have the dens dug into the ground, and line the camp with leaves, or you could even have the whole camp underground. You can even use abandoned monster caves as your clan's camp. It's up to you!

, This can be anything, as long as it can fit most of the cats in your clans, and there is a place for the leaders to stand to address the cats.

Draw out your design.,
Write down what will be in each room.,
Have a schedule if desired.,
Research key factors of your factory.",How to Make an Automatic Cake Factory in Minecraft1," This is optional, but it can help give you a good sense of where everything will go. Using graph paper is recommended, since one square on the graph paper can resemble four Minecraft blocks. So, say your wheat farm is made of 20 squares on the graph paper, the room is 80 blocks in Minecraft.;
, Include things like redstone mechanics, important features, materials, etc. Having a list helps you stay on task and prevents you from overdoing it. It also helps you since you can make connections between rooms and lists, like the storage minecart from the egg farm leads to the ingredient room.

, Obviously, it will take more than a real day to build this cake factory with all the features and redstone. Plan out what you will do each day to reduce stress. Day 1 could be marking out the perimeter of the entire building and each room, day 2 could be building up these walls, and so on.

, For instance, if you plan on making a redstone timer to when you harvest all of your wheat, research how long it takes for wheat to grow in a bright, moist environment. For redstone components, look them up on YouTube and take notes on the videos.

Build the perimeter of your building and the rooms.,
Build up your walls.,
Specialize each room.,
Add a personal touch to each room.,
Finalize each room.",How to Make an Automatic Cake Factory in Minecraft2," Make sure you have enough building room, and enough room for redstone. By marking out the perimeter, you can make additions and cuts to certain rooms, and ensure that your space is reserved so others don't end up using it. If it is far from your house, mark out a pathway or minecart system to allow you to travel between these areas.

, The two types of walls are interior and exterior. Interior walls are the walls of each individual room. Make these walls out of whatever you think would be best for each purpose. For example, the milk room could be a wool room that looks like the pattern on a cow's hair. The exterior walls should revolve around a specific plan. One neat idea is to make the sides look like a cake, then choose a spot in the middle of the roof to make a crafting grid. Use the remaining roof space to make it look like cake. This makes your building really define its purpose to those who see it.

, This step is where you decide what the purpose of each room will be and decorate the rooms based on their functions. For instance, the sugar cane room might have rows alternating between sand and water, with a viewing platform (find out why in redstone). Then, ensure each room has enough space for the redstone mechanics, and enough room for players. You don't want a room that can't fit redstone or players.

, Add holes for redstone lighting, decorate fences with flower pots and flowers, line hallways with carpets, etc. Now is also a good time to build the pathway and place flowers around the outside of the factory too, since you are about to move on to the final phase with redstone.

, Fix any mistakes now, and make tweaks that make the factory look nicer. For instance, if the wheat farm has hay walls, maybe you can change it to look like minecraft plains and beautiful sky. Also, smooth out any bugs, like the sugar cane farm has a leak, or cows can escape the milk farm. You don't want to be dealing with these things once the redstone is set up, so do it now to ensure smooth sailing.

"
"
Add in the redstone for harvesting your items.,
Create lighting.,
Have protection measures.,
Set up minecart tracks.",How to Make an Automatic Cake Factory in Minecraft3,"


For the sugar cane, have dispensers at the ready that are full of water. Have them all flow to a special place that places them in a storage minecart, which was placed when the water went off but will send the minecart on its way when the lever is turned off. The dispensers activate when the lever in the sugar cane or wheat farm is flipped, then you wait for everything to be harvested, then turn it off to deactivate the water and send the minecart on its way.
The egg farm has chickens floating in a glass funnel. When an egg is laid, it is carried under the farm. It is placed in a chest, and when the user flips a switch, it sends the minecart to the ingredients room, where it is unloaded and sent back. When the minecart is gone, a block above the hopper is blocked off with a piston, so eggs stay where they are until the minecart returns.
Milk farms are slightly less complex. You do everything the same except the water under the cows. When you milk the cows, you throw the buckets of milk in a chest, then flip a lever to send it on its way. You send it back, and repeat. The milk farm is the easiest room to set up with redstone, so you shouldn't have a hard time with it.

, Up until this point you might of had the room lit by torchlight. Use the cherries on the roof to make solar panels. Half should allow you to generate energy during the day, and half should allow you to do so at night. The redstone signal is sent to glowstone lamps, which will light up when the signal is received. They also produce their own redstone signal, so any other glowstone lamps directly touching one of the lamp's sides will light up as well.

, These features are just for protecting the factory, and ensuring that everyone gets cake for supper in minecraft. Have a factory lockdown switch, including iron doors, iron bars deploying, covering all doors from two sides in the event of an emergency, and a security feature within the lockdown feature. This should include:


All chests including special items being moved down by pistons, and covered up by a floor block.
Make all dispensers unable to work, and prevent hoppers from dispensing items.

, Have one going to a minecart station. This one is used for players to travel to and from ""work"". The other should be where cake and other goods from the cake farm are exported, and this one comes from the factory and travels underground until it reaches your house. From there, you can export goods of all kinds to places where you want them to go.

"
"
Fix up the structure.,
Make the pathway look prettier.,
Tidy up redstone.",How to Make an Automatic Cake Factory in Minecraft4," If there is an uneven bulge, move everything around a little bit, just enough to smooth it out. Bulges make it look unprofessional, so you might want to fix anything structurally.


If there is a weird hole in the wall, patch it up, or a bad accident could happen.
Patterns are tricky, so make sure it looks like right. Redo the floor if it doesn't, and try not to completely block of the room during construction.
For safety measures, inspect the building before anyone comes in so you know everything is safe. If griefed put TNT next to a pressure plate and someone stepped on it, your workers might not come to work ever again.

, Build a little stream and a bridge going over it. Line it with flowers, and have benches and tables along the way for players to rest on. You can even add in little special features like a beach or a place to have fun on the way home. Swap out stone for a prettier, more natural material, like red sand or gravel. Grow trees for shade, and don't worry about mob-proofing it. Just tell players to have a sword handy on the commute to and from work.

, Make sure it is all hidden, and test it to ensure it works. If not, have someone else try to use it while you inspect it, and find out where it went wrong. Once you fixed that area, test it again to see if there are any other errors. Fixing this before the factory opens is a plus.

Find the animals.,
Lure them to their pen.,
Get a friend to help you.,
Fill your hotbar with luring food.,
Walk towards the target whilst switching between the foods.,
Attack as you please.",How to Make an Animal Army in Minecraft," Ideally, you'll need three kinds of animals: ones who actively attack your target when you've been hit (e.g., dogs), ones who attack whoever attacks them (e.g., polar bears), and animals to confuse the enemy (e.g., cows). This is an ideal set-up, and it is very hard to get all three kinds in significant amounts, so do what is the most convenient for you.
, You don't need to restrict yourself to only one kind of animal, that would be very hard if you want to make a big army.

Avoid mobs that will attack you instead of the target. Here are some examples of animals you may want to use:

Wolves - they have to be tamed in order to become dogs, so they're pretty hard to get in large numbers, but they are very good attackers and deal lots of damage.
Polar bears - these fluffy animals have been implemented in the 1.10 update. You can't tame them, but if someone hits them, they turn hostile and start attacking whoever hit them.
Ocelots - though they are hard to tame and as annoying as real cats can be, they attack creepers, which is pretty good if creepers form a threat to you or your army.



, You can just fence of a large piece of land, or you could make a huge military base. - It's all up to you. Keep in mind the location: if you are going to use this army only once, build the base close to your target, so you don't have to lead your army across half your world to get them there. If you plan on using it multiple times, build the base close to home, where you can keep an eye on them.

If you have animals that attack other animals (e.g., wolves attack cows), put them in a separate area.
Make sure other mobs, especially hostiles, can't enter the base.

, If you want cows, you'll need wheat to get them to follow you -from their natural habitat to your base, or from your base to whomever you want to attack. If you want dogs, you'll need bones and meat to tame wolves and keep them healthy., Different animals spawn in different biomes, so you have to find out where each animal lives. You can look this up by searching 'Minecraft biome'.

The earlier mentioned animals and their spawn zones:Wolves - forest, taiga, mega taiga, cold taiga, and cold taiga M biomes
Polar bears - ice plains, ice mountains and ice spikes biomes
Ocelots - jungle biome



, The place you built earlier is where they need to go. You'll need the correct food to get them to follow you (e.g. cows will follow you if you're holding wheat). This is usually the same type of feed you have to breed them with.

Wolves and ocelots will automatically follow you (more or less) after you've tamed them.
If you're having some difficulties getting them in their pen, ask a friend to help you, or use leashes to pull them inside.

, Directing and managing an animal army can be a difficult task for only one person., You want them to follow you to your target., Ideally you have as many friends to help you as there are types of animals, so everyone can direct one kind. If that's not the case, switch to the luring food of the type of animal that isn't following., It all depends on the of the enemy, the army they have and your army, but try to get all your animals to follow you all of the time."

It does not matter whether you get oak wood, spruce wood, or any other type of wood.;
, The default key for this is E. You should see a 2 x 2 grid next to your character picture. This is your crafting area.

, Planks will appear in the results box to the right of the crafting area. Drag the planks to your inventory. You've now turned the wood into planks.

, Place one of the planks you just made on the lower row of the crafting area. Place a second plank directly above it. Now you've made a bundle of sticks, which you should drag into your inventory from the results box.

, Fill the entire 2 x 2 grid with planks to make a crafting table. Drag this to your quick slot bar at the base of your screen. Close your inventory and place the table on the ground. (To place a block, select it in your quick slot bar and right-click the ground.)


Remember not to confuse planks and wood. Only planks will work for this recipe.

, Right-click the table to open an expanded crafting interface. From here you can make recipes that require a 3 x 3 grid.

, The sword recipe only fills a single column of the 3 x 3 grid. All ingredients must be in the same column, but it does not matter which column you choose:


A plank on top
A plank in the middle (directly below the first one)
A stick at the base (directly below the planks)

, Drag the sword to a quick slot and select it to equip it. Now left-clicking will use the sword instead of your hand. This is much more effective at killing enemies or animals, but be careful. A wooden sword is still pretty weak. Skip down to the section below on better swords if you want an upgrade.

, You can break apart trees with your bare hands in Minecraft. In Pocket Edition, just hold your finger down over the tree and keep it there until it's turned into wood. On consoles, use the right trigger button.

, Crafting is simple in these editions of Minecraft. The crafting menu has a list of available recipes, and you click the one you want. As long as you have the right ingredients, they will turn into the desired item. Here's how to get started:In Pocket Edition, tap the icon with three dots and select Craft.
On Xbox, press X.
On Playstation, press Square.
On Xperia Play, press Select.

, The crafting table gives you access to many more craftable items, including swords. Here's how to make one:


With Wood in your inventory, craft Planks.
With four Planks in your inventory, craft a Crafting Table.
Select the Crafting Table in your quick bar and tap the ground to put it down. (Left trigger in console editions.)

, This is another multi-step process:


With Wood in your inventory, make Planks.
With two Planks in your inventory, make Sticks.
With one Stick and two Planks in your inventory, make a Wooden Sword from the Tools crafting section., When you have a sword selected in your quick slot, tapping the screen or pressing the left trigger will swing your sword. This will hurt enemies and animals much more than your bare hands.


Try jumping as you swing your sword. If you hit the target while you're falling (but not on the way up), you'll do a critical hit for 50% more damage.Keep reading if you want to upgrade to a more damaging and durable sword.

, You'll need a pickaxe to gather the stone or metals for a better sword. Here's a brief summary of how to find these, from most to least common:


Stone is widely available in mountainsides and just beneath the surface. Mine it with a wooden pickaxe.
Iron (stone with beige flecks) is fairly common just beneath the surface, and requires a stone pickaxe to mine.
Gold and diamond ore are very rare and only found deep under the earth.

, Combine two cobblestone and a stick to make a stone sword. This deals 6 damage and lasts for 132 hits before breaking. (In comparison, the wooden sword does 5 damage and lasts for 60 hits.)As with all swords, the computer recipe fills only one column, with the stick at the bottom.

, Iron is a great dependable material you'll be relying on for a long time. Once you have iron ingots (see below), you can make an iron sword that does 7 damage for 251 hits.


After mining the ore, you'll need to smelt the iron ore into ingots using a furnace.

, Despite its rarity, gold is not very good for tools. If you smelt the gold ingots and make them into a sword, it will deal the same damage as a wooden sword but only last for 33 hits.There is one advantage to golden swords: they have the best chance at a high level enchantment. Many players still don't like to enchant them since they're such temporary tools.

, Now you've really made it in the world. Diamonds are the best material for tools and weapons, and do not require smelting. A diamond sword does eight damage and lasts for 1,562 hits., Place two damaged swords of the same type anywhere in the crafting area. The result will be a sword with more durability than both of them put together. You cannot increase the durability past the sword's normal maximum this way.A ""damaged"" sword is any sword that has been used at least once. You should see a small bar next to the item icon showing you how much durability is left.

Gather at least nine slime blocks.,
Arrange the slime blocks in a wide, flat pad.,
Build a tower next to your trampoline to jump off.,
Jump onto the slime blocks.",How to Make a Trampoline in Minecraft1," In Minecraft, slime blocks have a slight ""bouncy"" effect when you jump on them. On top of this, you don't receive any falling damage from landing on them — no matter how high you fall from.This makes them perfect for making a trampoline! Since you'll want to make a trampoline that's big enough to hit when you're falling from a great height, you'll probably want at least nine before you get started.


Slime blocks are crafted from nine slimeballs at the crafting table.You can get slimeballs by killing slime mobs, which tend to appear underground and in swamps.;
, Make a square or circle with the slime blocks. Keep it one layer thick — multiple layers won't change the properties of the trampoline. This will be the ""bouncy"" surface of the trampoline that you'll jump on to.


If you wish, you can just put this pad on the floor. However, if you're going for a realistic-looking trampoline, you may want to make a frame of wood, stone, or metal a few blocks off of the floor. Putting a ladder on one side is a nice touch.

, Use whatever spare blocks you have to build your skinny tower — stone and wood work fine. There's no ""right"" height, but the higher you jump from, the more you'll bounce.


Unless you want to build a system of stairs, a ladder will be a huge help for getting to the top again once you jump. Craft ladders by arranging seven wood sticks in an ""H"" shape at a crafting table., You should bounce several times before gradually coming to a rest. Now, just climb up and try again!

Place one plank above a second plank in the crafting area. Shift-click the Sticks in the results box.

Note — all crafting instructions in this article describe the computer edition. On consoles or Pocket Edition, just open the crafting menu and select the name of the recipe.;
, If you don't have a crafting table yet, place four planks in the crafting area to make one. Place it on the ground and right-click to use it for the next steps.


On Pocket Edition, just tap the crafting table. On consoles, just open the crafting menu while standing near the table.

, If you don't have a pickaxe, make one now. Here's the simplest pickaxe you can make, a Wooden Pickaxe:


Place a stick in the center of the crafting table's 3 x 3 grid.
Place a second stick directly below it.
Fill the top row with three planks.

, Coal ore looks like stone with black flecks in it. It is fairly easy to find in cliff faces, shallow caves, and anywhere large amounts of stone are exposed. Mine this by equipping your pickaxe and breaking it to get coal.


If you cannot find any coal, skip down to the charcoal method instead.

, Place coal directly above a stick in the crafting area to make four torches. They're very useful objects, so make as many as you can.

, If you can't find any coal ore, here's another method of making torches. Start by making a furnace out of eight cobblestone. Place the cobblestone in a crafting table's crafting area, leaving only the center empty. Place the furnace on the ground.

, Use the furnace to open the interface. Place wood in the top slot, above the outline of flames. This wood will burn into charcoal once you start the furnace.

, The lower slot of the furnace is the fuel slot. As soon as you put something flammable in here, the furnace will start. Planks are more efficient at burning than wood, so put a few planks in this slot.

, The furnace will burn through the wood fairly quickly, leaving charcoal in the results slot on the right. Move this charcoal to your inventory.

, Place charcoal directly above a stick in your crafting area to make torches. Each pair of ingredients makes four torches.

, Move the torch to your quick slot, select it, and click the ground or wall. A torch can go on any solid, opaque surface, and will burn indefinitely. You can pick up the torch again by ""breaking"" it, or by breaking the block attached to the torch.

, Most mobs (enemies) cannot appear in brightly lit locations, although they can wander into torch-lit areas without harm. Here are a few examples of minimum torch placements to prevent monsters from appearing:In a one block wide tunnel, place torches at eye level every 11th block.
In a two block wide tunnel, place torches at eye level every 8th block.
For a large room, place torches in a row on the ground every 12th block. At the end, walk back along the row 6 blocks, walk left or right 6 blocks, and start another row. Repeat until you cover the floor in these staggered rows.

, When exploring caves or going on long overnight journeys, place torches to find your way back. In caves, keep these only on your right as you go further in. This way, if you get turned around, you know you're heading back to the surface if the torches are on your left.

, Torches aren't all that bright, but they are still visible from pretty far away. Build a tall tower of dirt or other materials, then cover the top in torches. Now you can use this as a landmark if you ever lose track of your base or other important location.

, These red torches create light but not enough to prevent mobs from spawning. Redstone is Minecraft's version of electricity, so redstone torches are most commonly used as part of circuits.They also create a spooky atmosphere, so you could use them when building a haunted house.

, This is found when mining deep underground. To mine redstone, you need at least an iron pickaxe.

, This recipe is the same as a normal torch, but with redstone instead of coal.


You can also make redstone torches flicker.

Make a sticky piston.,
Position the sticky piston under a pad of slime blocks.,
Put a set of tripwire hooks above the slime blocks.,
Connect the hooks to each other with string.,
Link the switches to the sticky piston with a redstone circuit.,
Connect the redstone to the piston with a redstone comparator in the middle.,
Make a side circuit with a repeater.,
Step onto the trampoline.",How to Make a Trampoline in Minecraft2," For this method, which makes a trampoline that automatically shoots you up, you'll need a sticky piston block. You can make this from a slime ball and a normal piston.To make a normal piston, craft it from the following at a crafting table:Top row: Three wood planks

Middle row: Cobblestone, iron ingot, cobblestone

Bottom row: Cobblestone, redstone, cobblestone





, Place the sticky piston facing up. On top of it, build a flat layer of slime blocks. You'll probably want at least a 3x3 square so that you can land on the trampoline easily.



Note: If you're giving your trampoline a frame, be sure to make it out of obsidian. Most other building materials will stick to the slime when the piston moves it up.

, Now, you need to start building the mechanism to power the piston. Make a two-block high wall on opposite sides of the trampoline. Put a row of tripwire hooks on the inside of each wall facing each other.


You can craft a tripwire hook by arranging an iron ingot above a wooden stick above a wooden plank at a crafting table., Stretch string from one hook to the one directly across from it. Repeat for each set of opposing hooks. You should now have a set of tripwires that completely cover the trampoline. To get to the trampoline, you should be forced to touch the tripwire.


You can get string from killing spiders or by mining it from tripwire traps in the game., This is the tricky part. You need to connect the piston to the tripwire trap so that when you touch the strings, the piston will shoot you upwards.


First, wire the string traps to the ground with redstone. Redstone can move up and down one block at a time, so you may need to make ""stairs"" to get it to ground level.

, The front (the end with one torch) should point towards the piston. The comparator should be in subtraction mode.

, This circuit should start in front of the comparator (on the same side as the piston) and connect to the comparator from the side. Put a redstone repeater in the middle of this circuit. The front of the repeater should face toward the piston.


See this helpful video for a good visual guide. This article on comparators and this article on repeaters may also be of assistance., Now, if everything is wired correctly, when you move onto the trampoline, you'll trigger the tripwire, which will activate the piston. The piston will push the slime blocks up, shooting you into the air. The repeater in the circuit will cause the piston to keep firing, sending you up again and again. Congratulations! You've built an automatic trampoline.


Try putting a small pool of water (or some slime blocks without a sticky piston) just to the side of the trampoline. You can fall into this when you want to get off.

Build a rollercoaster using a combination of slopes and Powered Rails.",How to Make a Minecart in Minecraft," You can find Iron Ingots in fortresses and dungeons, but it may be easier to just mine some Iron Ore and smelt the Ingots yourself.


Iron Ore can be found in layers 1 - 63, and will occur in veins of between 4 - 10 blocks. You are more likely to find it at lower layers.
You'll need a Stone Pickaxe or better in order to mine Iron Ore.;
, In order to smelt the Iron Ore into Ingots. You can craft a Furnace by placing eight Cobblestone blocks around the edge of the Crafting grid.

, The furnace needs fuel in order to smelt the Iron Ore into Ingots. Fuel comes in a variety of forms, and more efficient fuel means you'll be able to smelt more Ore per piece of fuel. You can use any wooden object as fuel, but the most efficient fuels are Lava Buckets, Coal, and Charcoal.

, Place the fuel in the bottom box of the Furnace window, and place a block of Iron Ore in the box above it. After a few moments, an Iron Ingot will be created. Repeat this until you have five Ingots.

, Now that you have enough Ingots, you can use the Crafting Table to open your Crafting window and create a Minecart.

,,,, There are four special Minecarts that you can create that can help with working deep in your mine. With the following crafting recipes, place a Minecart in the bottom-center box, and the special ingredient directly above it in the center.TNT Minecart - Minecart + TNT. Use this to safely excavate from a distance.
Furnace Minecart - Minecart + Furnace. Use this to smelt ores while you're excavating.
Hopper Minecart - Minecraft + Hopper. Use this to collect mined materials. The Minecart with hopper is great for automated mining.
Chest Minecart - Minecart + Chest. Use this to store materials and essential items while you're working in the mine.

, In order to use Minecarts, you'll need create Rails. These are the only objects that Minecarts can be placed on. To create a batch of 16 Rails, you'll need six Iron Ingots and a single Stick. See the first section for information on crafting Ingots.

, Open the Crafting window and place three Ingots in both the left and right columns. Place a Stick in the center. Drag the batch of 16 Rails from the Results box into your inventory.

, Look at the block you want to place it on and click to place it.

, Pieces of Rail will automatically connect when placed next to each other. You can create corners by placing a piece of Rail to the left or right of the end of a track. The bend will happen automatically.


You can create T-intersections and four-way intersections, but the tracks will not appear connected.

, You can push your Minecart forward on a flat surface. Minecarts will pick up speed as they go downhill, and will lose speed when making turns or going up hills. Minecarts will also gradually lose speed on flat planes.Taking advantage of momentum can help you create a useful and fun Minecart track network. A large drop will allow you to go up and over small inclines, or take a few turns. With a system of multiple drops, you can create a track that can take your Minecart a long distance without any extra help.

, You can have your track slope down or up by carving out single-block ""steps"". When you place a piece of Rail on a step down, the track will automatically slope downwards. You can continue laying sloped track if there are more steps.

, You can simulate a diagonal track by making a zig-zag of single clock turns. The diagonal will look rough, but the Minecart will move smoothly through it in a straight line. Diagonals will slow the cart down as if it was making each turn.

, Grab it from your inventory and place it on the track to use it.

, You will enter the Minecart so that you can start controlling it.

, The Minecart will begin moving in the direction you are facing (track permitting). You can move forward on a flat plane by using the Forward button, but you won't pick up a lot of speed. Going down a slope can increase your speed to up to 8 blocks per second.

, If there is only a block of headroom above you when you try to exit, you'll take a half heart of damage.

, After several attacks with your fist, or a single attack from a sword, the Minecart will be destroyed and you can pick it up and add it back to your inventory.

, Powered Rails are special Rails that can propel a Minecart, and are essential for large track networks or other complex track creations. With Powered Rails, you can create a launcher that blasts the Minecart off at high speed, you can build tracks that automatically take you back to the surface, and much more.Powered Rails require six Gold Ingots, a Stick, and a Redstone. Place the Gold Ingots in the left and right columns like the Iron Ingots for a regular batch of Rails. Place the Stick in the center, and then place the Redstone in the bottom-middle box. This will produce a stack of six Powered Rails.
Powered Rails need to be activated by either a Redstone Torch or a Lever.

, The main function of a Minecart is to get you and your supplies to different areas of your mine quickly. If you're actively mining or building in an area, a network of Minecart tracks can help you move between the different areas much more quickly.

, One Powered Rail can propel a Minecart for 80 tiles on a flat plane. Placing a solid block behind the powered rail will create a launcher that can propel your Minecart forward away from the block. Stack a few Powered Rails at the start of the launcher to give your cart a big boost. Placing a Powered Rail every 38th piece of track will keep your Minecart moving at nearly top speed indefinitely.


You may need to play around with the spacing of your Powered Rails depending on your inclines and speed needs.

, A popular use of Minecarts is creating rollercoasters. YouTube is filled with videos of Minecraft rollercoasters, and there's a lot you can do to make yours exciting and unique.


When a Minecart leaves the tracks, you won't take any fall damage if it lands back on tracks. Use this to your advantage to create crazy jumps and drops.

, Watch for lava because it may be right underneath you!

,, The room you're about to create should be a 16x16 room, completely empty except for torches here and there. It should be 3 blocks high.

, Check the room you made. It should be at least 3 blocks high and at least 16x16 (I recommend 16x16) and empty except for torches.

, Go to the second block up from the floor and break that block. Then go two blocks over and break that block. You must go horizontally around the whole room, leaving two blocks in between every hole in the wall.


The wall will look like this after you're done: BBEBBEBBEBBEBBE (B= block still there, E=Empty)

,, The room should be 16x16, 3 high, and have that wall pattern. It should be empty except for torches.

, You will need to do what you did on the wall and break every other block, then place torches in them.

, Repeat steps 1-10 in the room above the bottom room.

, You will have two rooms that are identical, 16x16 rooms, 3 high, with the patterns on the walls and roof, with torches inside each hole in the wall/roof.

, You need to make this room 16 blocks wide and expand out to 26 blocks long. 

, You should have two rooms, a top one 16x16 and a bottom one 16x26. The top should have the patterns on the walls/roof, the bottom one's patterns can be expanded out to the 26th block, but isn't a need as torches just keep other mobs from spawning.

,, You will have 2 rooms, 3 high, 16x26, and the patterns may/may not go all around the rooms. They should be pretty identical.

, You need to dig a 3 block deep pit. If you hit bedrock, just go around it. You need to make it go along the back wall, so it should be 16 blocks long and 4 blocks wide.

, I recommend 4 buckets if possible, then dig a 4 block hole in the ground and put the water in so you can keep refilling them and not have to run back up. 

, It may be hard to even out if there is uneven bedrock, but just keep experimenting with it and it should even out soon.

, This will create your water trap, because slimes cannot swim.

,,, You should have two rooms. 16x26, 3 high. The bottom floor should have a water pit and walkways on both sides, with one having a ladder leading up to the top. 

, It could take as little as minutes or as long as hours.

, As slimes cannot swim, this will kill it.

, Remember that it may take a while!

Continue creating and placing maps.",How to Make a Map in Minecraft," Paper is crafted from sugarcane, and sugarcane can be found growing naturally along the edges of bodies of water. Sugarcane is fairly common, and you should be able to find some without too much effort if you're exploring your waterways.


In the console editions of Minecraft, the player starts with a map item in their inventory.;
, Sugarcane is very easy to harvest, and you can simply run through it to knock them down.


If you intend to create a lot of maps or expand your map significantly, it may be beneficial to create a sugarcane farm. Sugarcane needs to be planted directly adjacent to water blocks. Bonemeal does not speed up growth like it does many other crops. See Build a Basic Farm in Minecraft for more details on creating a farm.

, 1 Sugarcane will create 1 paper. You'll need 8 pieces of paper, but paper is crafted in batches of 3, so you'll need 9 pieces of sugarcane.


If you're playing Pocket Edition, you can create a map with 9 pieces of paper and no compass, but it will not have a position marker on it.

, This will result in 3 pieces of paper, which you can add to your inventory.

, Place another 3 sugarcanes in the crafting grid to get another 3 pieces of paper. After grabbing the paper, do it one for time for a total of 9 pieces.

, If you're playing Pocket Edition or the Windows 10 Edition, you don't need a compass to create a map. Maps created without a compass will not have a position marker on them, so you may want to get a compass anyway to make the map more useful.


Compasses are required to create a map if you are playing the original computer or console versions of Minecraft.

, You don't have to go through the process of mining and crafting to get a compass, if you're lucky. There is an 11% chance that it will appear in a Stronghold Library chest. You can also trade for a compass with a village librarian for 10-12 emeralds.

, You'll need a stone pickaxe or better in order to mine iron ore from the ground. Iron ore blocks are gray with flecks of brown, and take about 1 second to mine when you have a stone pickaxe (less with more advanced pickaxes). You'll need 4 iron ore blocks to create the ingots required for the compass.


You can find iron ore anywhere from bedrock to slightly above sea level, though you'll increase your chances by mining deeper. You'll find the most iron ore in layers 5-54, and no iron ore at all above layer 68.Sea level is layer 62. The biome you're in does not affect iron ore generation.This means the best way to find iron ore is to start mining downwards at sea level.

, You'll need a furnace in order to smelt your iron ore into iron ingots. You can create a furnace by placing 8 cobblestone blocks around the edge of the crafting grid. You can also find furnaces in the blacksmith's hut in many villages.

, Fuel is anything in the world that is flammable, such as wood blocks and wooden creations. You can use any type of fuel to create an ingot from your iron ore. If you are making a lot of ingots, you may want a more efficient fuel source such as charcoal.

, Once the smelting process is complete, you'll have an iron ingot. Remove it from the furnace interface and place it in your inventory.

, You'll need four ingots in order to create the compass.

, This will likely be the most difficult part of creating your compass. Redstone ore only generates in the bottom 16 layers of the world, which means you'll need to mine deep in order to find it. You'll only need one pile of redstone dust, and a block of redstone ore usually drops 4-5 piles.


You can also find redstone dust by killing witches or disabling jungle temple traps. You may also find the dust in dungeon chests.

, Once you have 4 iron ingots and a pile of redstone, you can make your compass. Open your crafting table window and place the redstone in the center of the grid. Put an iron ingot above, below, to the left, and to the right of the redstone. This will create a compass., You'll need 8 pieces of paper and your compass in order to create the map. If you're playing Pocket Edition, you can create the map with 9 pieces of paper, but it will not have a location marker.

, Use your crafting table so that the crafting grid appears.

, If you're playing Pocket Edition, you can substitute the compass for another piece of paper, but the resulting map will not have a location marker.

, Place 8 pieces of paper around the compass. You should see the map appear in the result box.

, Drag the empty map from the crafting window to your inventory. Place the map in your hot bar so that you can quickly access it. You can now use the map like an item by holding it.

, The map will be blank when you first create it. In order to fill the map, you'll need to hold it as you move around the world.


The map will not fill itself unless you are holding it as your active item while moving through the world.

, Press the Use key or button to start using the map. The map needs to be used in order to begin filling up.


It may take a few moments for the map to fill the first time you use it.
Your map will begin filling in the direction you are currently looking. North will always be at the top of the map.

, You'll see the world begin to appear on your map from a top-down perspective. The first map you create is a 1:1 representation of the world, so each pixel on the map represents a single block in the world.


As you walk while using the map, you'll see the edges of the map start to fill with data.
Your initial map will only fill until the space is taken up. Maps do not scroll to show more space, so you'll need to expand your map to see more.
Maps are created based on the current ""chunk"" you are occupying. This means that when you start to fill a map in, your location indicator will likely not be in the center of the map. Instead, the map generates based on the chunk, which is how the world is divided when being generated.

, Your location will be noted by a white oval on the map. If you constructed your map without a compass (Pocket Edition only), there will be no indicator., While you can't merge two maps together, you can zoom the current map out using your crafting table. You can zoom a map out up to four additional times. Each time you zoom, the map will be able to show double the amount of content.

, You can zoom out the map by crafting additional paper onto the map. Open your crafting table to do so.

, This is the ""base"" of your new zoomed-out map.

, Fill the rest of the crafting grid with 8 pieces of paper. You'll see a new map object in the result grid.

, When you zoom out on a map for the first time, it will show 4 times the original content. This means that each pixel represents a 2x2 set of blocks in the world.


Since the map has been zoomed out, you'll likely need to do a fair bit of walking to get it filled in with content, since the map still fills at the same rate as the original (128 blocks from the player position).

, You can repeat the crafting process with your new zoomed-out map to zoom it out again. You can do this four times total, resulting in a map that covers four times the area of the original. At the highest zoom, 1 pixel represents 16x16 blocks in the world, and covers an area of 2048×2048 blocks.

, Cloning a map will create a perfect copy of the original, which is great for distributing maps to other players in your game.

, You can clone maps by crafting them on the crafting table.

, Place your original map in the middle of the left column of the crafting grid.

, Each piece of paper you add will create an additional clone, for up to 8 clones and the original.

, Each clone is an exact duplicate of the original, and all the clones will update at the same time while exploring.

, You can place the clones in chests so that they can pick them up, or simply drop them in the world.

, You can place maps on a wall if the wall is covered in frames. This allows you to create a massive map of your world using multiple map items.


Create a frame by placing a piece of leather in the center of the grid, and then surround it with 8 sticks.

, Create a grid of frames on your wall. Each frame will hold a different map. For starters, try a 2x2 set of frames on your wall.

, After making your frame wall, create your first map using the methods outlined above.

, Face one of the frames and use your map. It will be attached to the frame, and expand to cover the entire block. This allows your map pieces to be seamless.

, In order to create a seamless map, you'll need to create new maps based on where the original ends. Move outside of one of the edges of the first map and use your second map. This will generate a map based on the next region of the world.

, Place the map in the frame that lines up with the correct border of the first map. If you created your second map correctly, the two should seamlessly transition along the matching edge.


The maps will need to be the same zoom level in order to be seamless.

, Repeat the steps above to keep making more maps. Always move off the edge of the previous map in the direction that your next map needs to be. You can do this as many times as you'd like to create a massive map of your world."

There are lots of ways that you can get inspired, and seeing all the options that are available will give you great ideas for things you may not have thought of before.


Look at other minecraft mansions. There are lots of great mansions already existing which you can find images or video tours of readily online.
Look at your favorite structures from familiar tv shows, movies, and books. Maybe you want to make Hogwarts castle or Superman’s fortress.
Look at house plan websites. There are many websites online where people go to buy plans for actual houses. You can use these as inspiration, as they will show you the layout of the house, as well as how the outside looks. Such preview images should always be free.;
, Once you’ve got a good idea of the general layout of the house, think about what rooms you want and where you want them to go. This will help you plan ahead, for locating doors, windows, and improving the flow of your house.


You can include basic rooms like kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and dens.
You can also include silly rooms like a dungeon, art gallery, trophy room, or chicken storage.

, There are a limited amount of material types in the game and, unless you change the material textures, you're going to have to keep in mind not just what material you want your house to be made of but what color you want things to be. You will need to be strategic about the materials you use if you want your walls a certain color, and so on.

, Once you’ve got a general idea of your layout and what rooms you wish to include, you can use Minecraft drafting tools to draw out your mansion plans. This drawn out plan will help you decide how much of each resource you need, as well as where those resources should go. It will make the process of building the mansion much faster.


You can use free services like MineDraft to draw out your plans.
If you do not have or want access to tools like this, you can use paper and color-coded color pencils to help you plan.

, It takes a long time to build a really great mansion in Minecraft. You need to be committed to the task, though the rate that you finish it is up to you. Schedule your building time and make it a routine, to help keep you motivated to finish.


You can use it as a reward for finishing homework or household chores. 1 hour of play = 3 hours of work, for example.

, You will need a place to build your mansion. You can place it in neighborhoods with other players (if you are allowed), or you can build it in single-player, creative mode, in a superflat environment if you just want to build your mansion and environment from the ground up for your own enjoyment.

, If you are not playing in Creative mode, you will need to make sure you have all the necessary materials to build with. Make a checklist of what you need and how much of it you think you’ll need.

, Divide the structure into sections to complete if that makes it easier for you. Constantly check your work against your plans, to keep you from having to go back and move large amounts of misplaced materials.

, If you’re building a basement, it’s probably a good idea to build that first, so that you don't have to worry about moving floors or other structures if you mess up. It will also give you a better vantage point, so you can see what you're doing.

, Seeing where all the first-story walls will go, without having to spend a lot of time building them up, will help you make sure that everything is laid out correctly.

, Once the layout is correct, build up your walls. Then, continue to go story by story until your mansions is the desired height. Cap it off with a roof.


Create windows and doors by leaving gaps as you go. This requires more planning but is easier than having to remove all of those materials later.

, This article told you it would take a long time! Don’t give up, though. Think about how much fun it’s going to be when you’re done.

, Once you’ve finished building your mansion, you will want to fill it with furniture. Some items can be crafted in game (like bookshelves) but some items (like toilets) will require you to get creative and use other items that resemble what you are trying to create.


This is a good time to get inspiration from other Minecraft homes. However, make sure you add your own style, and not just copy every detail from something else,

, Once the main house is done, you can continue to perfect your property by make a great yard, adding a pool, or building outbuildings (like a barn, carriage house, guest house, or pool house).], You can share your mansion with your friends and other community members if playing in multiplayer. You can make your mansion a haven of community or just a great place for you and your friends to hang out and plan your adventures.

Find a few reference images.,
Gather several shades of construction paper.,
Cut the paper into small squares.,
Arrange the squares.,
Draw a grid onto the box.,
Glue the squares onto each side of the box.,
Cut out spaces for the eyes.,
Attach a cap to the inside.,
Try it on.",How to Make a Steve Head1," If you've memorized how Minecraft Steve looks, you might be able to skip this step. In most cases, however, it'll be a good idea to find a few pictures online to use as a reference.


You can look at the game itself for a reference image or do an Internet search using your favorite search engine. Looking for ""Minecraft Steve images"" should be enough.
Once you find a few good pictures, print them out or keep them open on your computer screen. Refer to these images as you work.;
, You will need several shades of brown, beige, and white.


You do not need to use blue paper for the eyes since the eyes will eventually be cut out, anyway.
The more shades you use, the more accurate the Steve head will look. At minimum, try to find white, beige, tan, light brown, brown, dark brown, and reddish brown.

, Use a paper cutter or paper trimmer to cut the construction paper into 2-inch (5-cm) squares.You will only need two white squares (one to go on either side of the eye holes).
Cut a relatively even number of squares from the remaining construction paper. You will need a total of 320 squares.
Scissors can be used if you do not have a paper cutter, but make sure your sides are as even and straight as possible.
Note that these squares are sized for a 16-inch (40-cm) cubical box. If the box you use is larger or smaller, you will need to adjust the size of the squares accordingly. The squares will be arranged into an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) grid, so you will need to divide the length of one side of your box by eight to determine how long/wide the paper squares should be.

, Arrange the squares into five separate groups on a flat working surface. Piece them together so that they resemble the face, back, sides, and top of Steve's head.The squares must be arranged into 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) sides.
Use the darker brown shades for Steve's hair and the lighter browns and beige shades for Steve's skin.
Leave blank space for the eyes approximately four grid spaces from the bottom and three grid spaces from either side.

, Mark the center of the box on all four sides by drawing a grid. Do the same for the top of the box.


Use a ruler and pencil to draw a line down the vertical center of each side, then draw a line down the horizontal center of each side. The point of intersection will be the center of that side.
If necessary, you should also take this time to fold the flaps of the open side into the box and out of the way.

, Carefully glue the paper squares onto each side of the box using a glue stick or hot glue gun.


Work on one side at a time, using the grid to guide you as you place the squares.
Remember to leave blank spaces for the eyes.
If using a glue stick, you'll need to apply glue to the entire back of each piece. If using a hot glue gun, only apply glue to the corners of each piece.
Allow all glue to dry before continuing to the next step.

, Find the blank spaces you left for the eyes. Use a craft knife or utility knife to cut out the cardboard there, creating eye holes.


Keep the sides straight by placing a ruler along each edge as you cut.

, Form a loop with heavy-duty packing tape and stick it to the top of a cap. Stick the other side of the tape to the center of box from inside.


The cap is not strictly necessary, but it can help the head stay stable on the wearer's head.
Make sure that front of the cap faces the face-side of the head.

, The Steve head should now be done and ready to wear.

Think of what materials you want in order to construct the kitchen.,
You can't find buttons.,
To make trapdoors, gather wood from the trees.,
To find and make colored wool, find some sheep.,
Make the stove by placing a black or gray wool where you want your stove to be.,
Make the refrigerator by placing one white wool on the place where the refrigerator is going to be and put another white wool on top.,
Make counters with wooden planks, sandstone, or stone.,
Make a microwave by putting a white, black, or gray wool on top of the counter and put a button on it.

,
Design the kitchen floors by doing black and white checkers or leaving it plain.

,
Place the trapdoors above the stove so it looks like the smoke is coming out above the trapdoors.,
Place furnaces as the official cooking.,
Other designs for the kitchen are some tables and chairs.",How to Make a Kitchen in Minecraft," You will need buttons, trap doors, some colored wool, etc.;
, But, gather four cobblestone. After that, head back to your furnace and place the cobblestone in and decide what are you going to use to start the fire, wood, or coal (coal is the best choice). Next, wait for the cobblestone to finish cooking. You should see stone. After obtaining the stone, head to the crafting table, and put the one stone in the bottom right corner and the other Stone on top. A button should appear. Take the button. (You need at least three buttons)

, Then craft the wood into wooden planks and start by placing three wooden planks on all of the slots of the bottom row of the crafting table. Next, place another set of three above the placed wooden planks. You should be able to see trapdoors. Obtain them. (You need at least three trapdoors)

, The sheep can be white, black, or gray. You should take plenty of the white, black, and gray, wool you see. If you can't find black, or gray sheep, first, find squid. Squid live in water. Kill the squid and see if the squid dropped some ink. If the squid did release ink, head back to the crafting table, put one white wool in the middle slot of the bottom row, then place the ink on top of it. If you can't get gray wool, put the black wool in the same bottom spot, and put bonemeal on top.

, Then, place a button so the button looks like the handle of the stove.

, Then put a button on the top white wool so it looks like the handle of the fridge.


Or, make a fridge by putting an iron block, and a dispenser loaded with food, then put a button on the iron block and an iron door.

, (Sandstone recommended) Place the counters anywhere you want.

,,, It looks more kitchen-like.

, Furnaces can cook pork, fish, etc.

, Make the table by putting one fence post on the ground and then a pressure plate on top. Make the chairs by putting one step down and putting two signs beside the steps.

Find and save the pattern.,
Print the pattern out.,
Trim away any excess.,
Prepare the box.,

Try it on.",How to Make a Steve Head2," You can find several free Steve head patterns online. Once you find one you like, save it to a USB drive.


You should be able to find a pattern by searching ""free Minecraft Steve head pattern"" with your favorite search engine. If you are unable to find a pattern, a standard high-resolution image could also work.
Free patterns can also be found at:

http://fpsxgames.com/download/printable-minecraft-steve-mask.pdf



, Take the pattern to the nearest copy shop and print it out onto heavy poster paper.


You could technically print the pattern using a home printer, but the quality probably won't be as good and you will likely need to piece together the images along each side, creating awkward seams. For these reasons, professional printing is strongly recommended.
Make sure that the printer prints the images to a length of 11 inches (8 cm), or to the length of your chosen box edge.

, After printing off the pattern images, use a paper trimmer to cut away any white margins.


If you use scissors instead of a paper trimmer, work slowly try to keep your edges as clean and straight as possible.

, Turn your box to the open side and fold the flaps inward to keep them out of the way. If the flaps will not stay down, use packing tape to secure them.This tutorial calls for an 11-inch (28-cm) cubical box. You can use a different size, but the box must remain a cube and must be scaled to match the length and width of your pattern images.
If the seams of the box appear weak, cover them with packing tape, as well.

, Coat the back of the top hair image with glue from a glue stick, then carefully press the hair onto the outer top side of the box.Spray adhesive can be used, as well.
If the hair overlaps the edge of the box, you can use clear packing tape to reinforce the edge of the paper. This tape will likely be hidden by the side pieces of the pattern.

, Apply glue or spray adhesive to each of the side pieces and attach them to the sides of the box.


Work with one side at a time until all four sides are covered.
Make sure that the pieces line up in the proper order. The face should be at the front, the back should be on the opposite side, the left side should be on the left, and the right side should be on the right.
Allow the glue to dry before continuing to the next step.

, Carefully cut out the eyes using a ruler and a craft knife or utility knife.


Locate the eye squares at the face side of the head and evenly cut through both the paper and cardboard layers.
Line the ruler up along each side and use it to guide the blade as you cut.

, If any of the colors did not print well, you can use acrylic paint or poster paint to touch them up.


You may need to blend colors to achieve the right shade.
Note that this probably won't be necessary if you use an actual pattern image and print with high-quality ink. If you enlarged a smaller image or used a low-quality printer, however, you may need to follow this step.

, Take a piece of clear packing tape and form a loop with the sticky-side out. Attach one side of the loop to the cap and the other side to the center of the box top from the inside.


The cap should make it easier for the wearer to keep the Steve head stable when worn.
By using tape instead of glue, you should be able to remove the cap and use it later for another purpose.
Make sure that the front of the cap points to the face-side of the head.

, Your Minecraft Steve head should be finished and ready to wear at this point.

Gather your materials.,
Place the cobblestone in the crafting grid.,
Place the stick in the crafting grid.,
Drag the lever into your inventory.,
Place the lever.,
Use the lever.",How to Make a Lever in Minecraft," You'll need cobblestone and a stick in order to make a switch. Sticks are made from wood, so you'll need that first. These are some of the most common materials in the game, so you are in luck!


Sticks are made by crafting planks (place one wood at the center of the crafting grid) and then placing two planks in the crafting window. One will be at the center and the other in the center-bottom position.
You can find cobblestone really easily in mines and often near lava sources as well.;
, Open your crafting table and place the cobblestone in the center-bottom position.

, Next, place the stick in the center position.

, The lever should now be showing in the completed item box. Take the lever by left or right-clicking on it and then placing it into your inventory.

, Right click with the lever selected in your inventory in order to place the lever. You will need to place the lever next to redstone, since the lever is used to control the current of the redstone.


Levers can be placed on the ground, wall, or a ceiling. They cannot be placed on snow, ice, or glowstone.
The orientation of the lever effects which position is considered on and which is considers off, so you may need to adjust the orientation to suit your needs.

, There are lots of different uses for a lever and much like the rest of Minecraft, you're mainly limited by your imagination. As long as you can find a use for the function of a lever, activating or deactivating a redstone current, then you can find a good use for a lever.


A lever provides a stable charge. It remains on or off until you actively press it again, unlike buttons, which switch themselves off. Levers are therefore useful when you need the switch to stay on, such as on a minecart track or for a lock you wished to keep locked.
Levers are usually used for controlling lights in houses or other buildings. You can also use them to control doors from afar.
Levers can be used in place of redstone, if you're running short (really only good for replacing one redstone). This is also helpful for letting you control the power current as well.
It is important to remember that mobs cannot activate levers unless you have some kind of mod that allows this.

Surround the house with a picket fence.",How to Make a House in Minecraft," Before you start, the most important thing is to make a crafting table. It’s the single most important amenity in the game because it lets you create most of the items you’ll be needing throughout your gameplay!
, The first thing you need to do is to find a tree. When you find one, press and hold the left mouse button (PC), press the left bumper button (Xbox) while facing the trunk, or simply tap the trunk with your finger (PE). You’ll see your character’s hand punching at the wood and leaving cracks on it. Continue punching until one block of wood pops off, and it automatically goes to your hotbar.

You can keep punching trees until you feel like you have enough wood for later, but for now, this single block of wood is all you need to make your crafting table.
Make it big enough to put enough rooms.

, Press the “E” button (PC), the X button (Xbox), or the icon (PE) to view your inventory, and you’ll see, aside from several boxes where your items are stored in, there is also a set of four empty boxes arranged into a box formation, with an arrow pointing towards a single empty box. That is your initial crafting grid, where you can make various things. But seeing as it only has 4 slots in the grid, you can’t make anything complicated with it, which is why you need a crafting table., Place your wood on one of the slots by selecting it (clicking on it for the PC versions, scrolling to it with the RB and LB buttons on the Xbox, and tapping it in PE), and you’ll see that an item appears on the single box. It’s a plank, and one block of wood is worth 4 planks right off the bat. If you’ve got more wood, feel free to convert it all to planks, but for now, all you’ll be needing are 4 wood planks, Place one wood plank on each box of the four boxes in the crafting grid, and you’ll see another item on the rightmost box again. Take that item, and you now have a crafting table!, To use the crafting table, simply drag it to your hotbar, “hold” it by using your mouse’s scroll button or by pressing the corresponding number on its hotbar placement, place it on the ground by right-clicking while holding it, and then right-click it again. It will bring you to a window that has a 3x3 version of the crafting window in your inventory.,, Feel free to punch some more trees and turn some of those wood into planks! Around 3–5 pieces of wood would suffice, depending on how many of these you’ll be making., On the PC, all you need to do is right-click it. On the Xbox, press X. On PE, just tap it., Now, you’ll be needing some sticks, which you can make by crafting two planks placed vertically on the crafting window, and it will reward you with 4 sticks. You’ll be needing this to make the torches, pickaxes, and axes, which you will need to gather materials. At least 3 blocks worth of planks would suffice for the creation of many basic tools for your venture., Fill up the first row of the crafting table’s grid with planks—or cobblestone, if you managed to get those and want a better pickaxe—then put two sticks on the middle column.

It should look like this in the grid:
X = empty space
m = material
s = stick
m m m
X s X
X s X
The resulting item will appear in the single box at the side of the grid. Take that, and congratulations! Your first tool!

, Making an axe is similar, but the third plank from the left is moved to the first block second row.

It should look like this in the grid:
X = empty space
m = material
s = stick
m m X
m s X
X s X


, To use your tools, simply place them on your hotbar, which can hold up to 9 items at a time. Hold the item you want to use the tool on by scrolling to it with the mouse scroll button or pressing the number corresponding to it in your keyboard (PC), using the left and/or right bumper buttons on your controller (Xbox), or tapping it with your finger (PE). Then use your tool by holding the left mouse (PC), holding down the left trigger button of your controller (Xbox), or tapping and holding it (PE)! You can use the axe to chop trees down faster and pickaxes to gather cobblestone by going to a gray block and hitting it with your pickaxe!, Now, in Minecraft, practically everything around you could be used to build a house! Most blocks can be stacked together and on top of each other to make your house, though some exceptions include sand, gravel, cacti, and regular ice blocks. If you’re aiming for the simplest house you can build, dirt blocks are efficient enough until you can gather more materials, like stone and wood, but a better (and nicer-looking) house normally has different materials., Having at least a full stack (64 is the maximum amount per stack) of each material you want to use is always a good idea, though more complex structures need more materials, depending on what kind of house you want.

Blocks like wood, sand, dirt, gravel (a darker gray block with a rougher texture than stone) and clay (grayish blocks with a texture like sand sometimes found in bodies of water) can be gathered without tools, while harder materials like stone (pure gray “streaked” material) and ores (stone with colored speckles) need a pickaxe to gather, since just punching them or using other tools would just “break” the block and not give you any material.
Gravel can be acquired underground or poking from hills and mountains. Dirt can be found everywhere in the world except the surface of the desert. Sand is dominantly found on deserts as a surface material. Clay can be found underwater. Wood can be found almost everywhere in the surface world.
Stone-based and other “hard” material have to be mined with a pickaxe. They’re normally available underground or poking out of hills and mountains. Sometimes, they have different-colored materials dotting the surface. Those are ores, and when mined, they break up into smaller items you can’t place. Ores are essential for long-term survival. Coal (distinguishable by black speckling in stone) is the most common encounter when mining, but you’ll occasionally find Iron (pinkish orange) or rarer ores like Gold (bright yellow) and Diamond (bright cyan) if you’re extremely lucky or have dug deep enough.
Most of the time, you’ll be spawning in places with trees nearby, and stone and dirt are always abundant if you dig down. Sometimes, though, you’ll be stuck in a desert with nothing but sand as your building material, which isn’t ideal because you can’t make a roof with sand since it’s affected by gravity (falls down when placed above ground). An easy way to remedy this problem is to go to your inventory, then place sand in all four boxes of the crafting grid to make sandstone! You can also encounter sandstone if you dig downwards, but you won’t be able to gather it without pickaxes.
Clay is a bit of a troublesome material as well since it breaks up into items instead of blocks, but you can make clay blocks the same way you make sandstone blocks, and then smelt them in a furnace to make hardened clay blocks! Or you could smelt the clay items into bricks, and then create brick blocks the same way you make sandstone and clay blocks.
You can tell if it’s a hard material if punching it doesn't immediately show “cracks” in the surface.

, Certain blocks have to be made, however. Blocks like glass, bricks, and hardened clay need a furnace, and you can make one by using the crafting table and filling up all the squares in the grid but the centre square with cobblestone, and it requires wood or coal to use.

To smelt things, you put the material you want converted, like sand or clay, on the top square, then put something flammable like wood or coal on the bottom square, and after a short wait, your item is converted to another!
You can also smelt ore into other materials for later, too!

, Now, one valuable material you can make whenever you want are torches, and for that you need coal and/or charcoal. Coal is somewhat easy to find, since it resembles stone with black spots on it, and when you gather it with a pickaxe, a piece of coal is dropped. Charcoal is also easy to make if you have a furnace and some wood. You simply smelt the wood, not planks but actual wood, and it turns into charcoal!

Crafting torches is as simple as stacking a piece of coal over a stick on the crafting window, and you immediately get 4 torches. Which is good, since you’ll need as many of them as you can to light the way and ward off monsters!

, At the absolute minimum, you’ll be needing about a 5x5 square of free space to build your house. This is to accommodate a bed, a chest, and a crafting table without running out of room to move, but you can build a bigger house if you feel like it or if you have enough resources.

If you want to clear out an area, simply start punching the ground blocks in the nearby area until you have a flat space. You might need a pickaxe or axe if the area is rocky or full of trees.
At the very beginning, it’s best to build your house near the spawn point, which is where you first appear once you make your world, and where you end up in whenever you die. This would provide you a steady shelter from whatever monsters lurk in the night, and a place to keep all your stuff.

, Line out your house’s shape by laying down blocks, which can be done by selecting your desired material and pressing the right mouse button (PC), RT (Xbox), or tapping it, on where you think the house corners would be. It should preferably be different from the main material you plan on using. This is both to keep track of the size and shape of your building and to keep it looking nice.

Lay out the outline of your house with your prefered main building material, but remember to keep one space open to serve as your door so you can go in and out. Build up the corner blocks by placing more blocks on top of the corner blocks until it’s at least 4 blocks tall. They’ll serve as the guide to how tall your house is, or even as a base for a second floor if you want.

, A house needs walls, so slowly fill in the spaces between the pillars by building on the outline of the house, but take care to leave the door space at least two blocks high and to leave a small window now and then to let in light., A house also needs a roof, so fill in the top of the wall by placing blocks inwardly from the topmost blocks until the inside of your house is covered.

Now if you don’t want a square-ish house, you can slope the roof a bit. The simplest way to do this, and the method that works best on a less-complicated house design is to line a row of blocks around the topmost block of the walls adjacent to your door, then stacking the blocks on both sides diagonally until they meet.
Another way to create a nice roof is by crafting stairs! To craft stairs, you need your trusty crafting table. Starting from the left, fill the entire leftmost column with stone, wood, or brick. Fill the bottom row with the same material, and then place a block of the material on the middle block so it resembles a stair.
X X m m X X
X m m or m m X
m m m m m m

You’ll be rewarded with 4 stairs. You can then repeat the same process of stacking them diagonally on your house like in the blocky roof method, but if there is a single block of free space between them, make some slabs by lining a row with the same materials you made stairs from and use those to join the stairs. Make sure to line the bottom of your “roof” with the same material as your pillar, and fill the rest of the gap with the main building material!
Out of the two methods for creating a roof, the “stairs method” is the most convincing and visually pleasing, but costs more time, materials, and effort.

, Making a door is both nice-looking and useful, since it prevents monsters and other creatures from invading your little hideout when you keep it closed.

Take six wood planks, and access your crafting table. Fill two columns on the crafting space and you’ll get three doors. Go up to the house opening and install the door by placing it on the open space you left on the wall so you can protect your privacy!

, Beds are wonderful, soft things. The best part is that if you die, you just wake up beside it, though you drop all your stuff where you died and you’ll have to get it back. To make one, like the bottom row of your crafting table’s grid with planks, then the middle with wool, and take out your resulting bed! Now place it inside your house, and then at night or during random thunderstorms you can right-click it to sleep the danger away!

Wool can be acquired by killing or shaving sheep. To kill sheep, keep punching a sheep or hitting it with your tool until it falls down. Killing yields 1 Wool. Shaving requires Shears, which can be acquired by smelting iron ore into iron ingots, then laying them diagonally in your inventory crafting grid or crafting table. Now select the Shears and go up to your sheep. In the PC version, you right-click it; on Xbox, you press LT; and on PE, you tap and hold. Shearing a sheep would leave you a bald-but-alive-sheep and 1–3 Wool.

, Grass is nice, but not for indoors, so scoop out the first layer of dirt blocks on the inside of your house and replace them with any material you want. Remember, choosing a different material from your main building material, or choosing a different kind of wood if you’re using a certain kind of wood as your main building material, would add a dash of color and make your house look inviting., While you may have some holes punched on the walls for your windows, they’d look lovelier (and be safer) if you put some glass on them. Simply smelt some sand, which you can usually find near water or a desert, and place it on the holes. Be careful when placing them inside the window gaps, though, they break too easily, and you can’t gather the glass back if you place the block wrong!, Now, when it gets dark, you’d prefer some light, so putting some torches along the walls would definitely brighten up the space! The windows do a fair enough job during the daytime, but when night comes, the light keeps the monsters from appearing in your house, so better invest on torches!, A picket fence is also nice to look at, and adds a layer of protection from the monsters. Line two stacks of planks on the left and the right columns of your crafting table, and line two stacks of sticks on the middle column, take your fence, then place it around your house, but be sure to leave a gap you can go through!

The recipe for PE and Xbox uses sticks and only sticks lining two rows of the crafting grid.
Adding a fence gate makes it more secure, and the recipe is just the reverse of the fence itself: line the left and right column with two stacks of sticks each, then grab your brand-new fence gate and place it on the gap on your fence! Ta-da! A nice little picket fence with a sturdy gate!
Now all you need to do is fill the house with goodies, furniture, and such. Experimenting with slabs, stairs, blocks, and fences are the way to go with this one, so run wild and feel free to create whatever you want!

Leave the room with your second pressure plate.",How to Make a Door That Locks in Minecraft2," Open your crafting table and place a chunk of redstone in the center. Place a redstone torch on either side, then three stone blocks on the lowest row. Repeat this recipe to make a second block.


Look for red-flecked redstone ore deep underground (at least 47 blocks below sea level.) Mine it with an iron or diamond pick.You'll need several extra chunks of redstone as well.
To make a redstone torch, craft one chunk of redstone above a stick.

, Place a single iron door wherever you need your entrance. Place a pressure plate on the external side of the door, but not near enough to activate it. Keep a second pressure plate in your inventory for now.


Craft an iron door with a tall 2 x 3 pattern of iron ingots.
Craft a pressure plate with two stone or wooden blocks side by side.

, Place a redstone chunk directly on any solid, opaque block next to the pressure plate. Make a line of redstone from the pressure plate to a redstone repeater, then another line from the repeater to the door.


Make sure the line on the repeater connects the lines of redstone.
You can hide the redstone underground to make the entrance look nicer, but you might want to practice with everything out in the open first.

, Normally, pressure plates can be used by any player or monster who walks over them. You'll need to block the redstone connection to lock the door. The first step is placing a lever near the interior side of your door, but not right next to it.


Craft a lever by placing a stick over a block of stone.

, Turn 90 degrees and place a second redstone repeater next to the first. The line of torches visible on one repeater should be at right angles to the line on the second.When this second repeater is activated, it will block the first repeater, breaking the connection between the pressure plate and the door.

, Use another line of redstone to connect the lever to the second repeater. As before, make sure the line of redstone meets the line visible on the repeater.

, From outside, walk over the pressure plate and through the door. Wait for the door to close, then use the lever to push it to the ""on"" position. This will lock the door in its current state (closed), preventing the pressure plate outside from functioning.

, Place your second pressure plate on the interior of the door, right in front of it. This one is not connected to the redstone, so you can use it to leave the room at any time. Careful — if the lever is in the locked position, you will lock yourself out.

You can start a game in Creative mode and then transfer it to Survival mode when you're finished building.

If you've already started a Survival mode game, open the Pause menu, select ""Open to LAN,"" and then make sure cheats are enabled. You can then type /gamemode c in the chat window (T) to change to Creative mode.;
, A castle should be an imposing sight to behold, and were traditionally placed in highly defensible positions. You'll also want it near important resources, such as at the mouth of your main mineshaft, near your farms, or close to your Nether Portal. Scour your map for a good place to construct your new castle.

You may want to build near a village so that you can act as their lord.
Consider placing your castle high up on a mountain, or at the mouth of a river.
Get creative with your castle placement. Suspend it between two mountains, build it in the treetops, carve it out of a cavern deep underground. The possibilities are essentially endless.

, Depending on how big you plan on having your castle, you may need to do a little terraforming before you start construction. Use your tools to clear out vegetation and level the land.

Take your landscape into consideration when getting ready to build your castle. Depending on your design goals, you may want to preserve some natural structures.

, A sheet of grid paper and a pencil are all you need to design a layout for your castle. This can help immensely, as building from plans will speed up the building process and ensure that everything lines up properly.

You can use different color squares to indicate what types of materials you want to use.

, There are tons of castles you can take inspiration from, both real and fictional. You could look up castles in Europe for a traditional medieval style, or look at Japanese or Chinese castles and palaces. You can look up pictures of Lord of the Rings and other fantasy castles.

Many real castles will have layouts available online, potentially as part of their tourism information. You can use these layouts as a guide when designing your own castle. Some real castles, such as the Dover Castle in England, have official Minecraft recreations and instructions.Lots of Minecraft players have posted their own castle layouts online. Simply search ""Minecraft castle blueprints"" in Google Images to see a large number of layouts you can copy or use as a starting point.

, Your castle doesn't have to be a boxy collection of square rooms. By learning how to create circular structures, you can create realistic towers and more creative room layouts. Below is a basic 7-block circle that you can use as the basis of a tower stairwell:XXX

, If you're building your castle while playing in Survival mode, you'll need to gather the materials for it yourself. This isn't necessary in Creative mode since you have unlimited access to all the materials in the game. Some essential castle materials include:

Stone Bricks and Cobblestone Bricks
Stone Stairs and Cobblestone Stairs
Stone Slabs and Cobblestone Slabs
Fences
Glass Panes
Wood Planks
Ladders
Trapdoors

, Lay the foundations of your castle by referring to the layout you diagrammed on grid paper. You only need to put a single layer of blocks down to begin with to get a feel for how the castle will look and flow from room to room., As you build up, you can create multiple floors for different rooms. Use staircases to reach the upper floors. You can also use ladders to reach your castle walls and the top of your towers, with trapdoors to cover the hole.

See Make a Trapdoor in Minecraft for instructions on making an using trapdoors.

, Many castles are more than just stone buildings. Pay attention to the grounds of your castle, including your courtyards, stable areas, and entryways. There's a lot you can do with elevation changes and foliage to create a believable, realistic castle grounds., Save your wall for last, in case you decide you want to expand the inner portion of the castle beyond your initial plans. Once you're satisfied with your keep and grounds, you can build your outer wall., Staircase blocks can be placed rightside up or upside down, and can create a much more convincing sloped look than regular blocks. Use these for your roofs and for embellishing wall supports.

See Make Stairs in Minecraft for instructions on creating staircase blocks.

, Stone fences make very good ramparts along the top of your castle walls. This will look a lot less blocky than using full-size blocks for ramparts.

See Craft a Fence in Minecraft for a guide on making fences.

, For a secure entrance, place an Iron Door in the open entry to your castle. You can place a pressure plate on each side of the door so that it opens when you walk up to it. An iron door will help protect your castle from monsters.

Check out Build a Door in Minecraft for a guide on making doors and using pressure plates to operate them.

, Once your castle is finished, you can dig a moat around the wall to add an extra layer of protection. Dig the moat at least three blocks deep and run it around the entire edge. Once you're finished digging the moat, you can use buckets to fill it with water. For a more intense moat, fill it with lava!

Make sure you have a bridge over the moat before filling it so that you can access your castle.
If you have access to redstone and some time to tinker, you can create an automated drawbridge. See Build a Piston Drawbridge in Minecraft for more details.

Save your creation.",How to Make a Castle in Minecraft2," A Minecraft editor will allow you to create massive, complex structures using advanced editing tools, instead of constructing your castle one block at a time in the game. The most popular and robust editor is MCEdit. You can download the latest version for free from mcedit-unified.net.

Run the installer after downloading it to extract the MCEdit files. By default, a new folder will be created in your Downloads folder.
MCEdit does not require Minecraft to be installed in order to use it, but you can load any of your Minecraft maps into the editor.

, You'll find an ""mcedit.exe"" file in the folder you created when installing it. Run this to start the program.

Make sure Minecraft isn't running at the same time, at least not with the same world you plan on creating your castle in.

, You'll be prompted to either create a new world or load your saved game. If you have a map that you want to build a castle on, browse for it in your Minecraft save folder, which opens by default. Make sure you aren't currently playing the map in Minecraft, or you can permanently corrupt it.

It may take a while for your map to load for the first time.

, WASD will let you fly around the map. Unlike in Minecraft, you can fly through anything. You'll be able to see all of the subterranean caves and mineshafts if you fly beneath the surface.

Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to look around.

, There's a whole lot you can do with a program like MCEdit, so you'll want to start with just the basics and practice creating blocks with the brush. You'll see the various tools displayed along the bottom of the screen. Click the Brush button (it looks like a gray circle in MCEdit).

The brush tool options will appear in a new window, allowing you to select the size and shape of the brush, as well as the type of block you want to create with it. For example, to quickly make a huge castle wall, enter H 10, L 30, W 2. You'll see the cursor change into a very large wall section. You can switch directions by swapping the L and W values.
Move your mouse around the world and click the left mouse button when you've found the spot you want to create the blocks. Larger brushes may take a few moments to appear in the world.
By practicing with the brush tool, you'll quickly become adept at creating complex using any material available in the game. You can use the tool to create very small and very large brushes, allowing for a lot of control over your creation.

, You can use the selection tool in MCEdit to highlight a portion of your castle and then copy and paste it over and over again. This is great for creating lots of similar rooms, or extending a piece of an elaborate wall.

With the selection tool activated, click and drag to create a cube in the game space. This cube represents the currently selected blocks. Creating the box can be a little finicky in 3D space, but you just need to start it in the general area and you can easily resize it manually.
To resize the selection, click and drag on one of the walls to move it in or out from the center of the selection. Do this to all of the walls until you have exactly what you want selected. Use the movement keys and the mouse to see all angles of your selection.
Click the ""Copy"" button to copy the currently-selected blocks. Click the ""Paste"" button and your cursor will turn into a copy of your selection. You can then place this copy just like you would a brush. You can rotate, roll, mirror, and flip the piece by clicking the appropriate button in the tool menu.

, When you're satisfied with your castle, you can save your changes to the world. MCEdit will overwrite the original save file with your new creation, and you'll see your new castle when you start up your game in Minecraft."

, Each bookshelf near the enchantment table unlocks more powerful enchantments. You must place them as follows for them to count as ""nearby:""Exactly two squares away from the table.
Either on the same level as the table, or one higher.
The space between the table and the shelf must be empty. Even a carpet, torch, or snowfall will block the effect.

, The highest-level enchantments become available once fifteen bookshelves are set up as described. There are a couple easy ways to do this:


Surround the table with a large square of bookshelves, leaving a gap in between. Leave one gap in the square to walk through.

Or make a 4x5 L shape out of eight bookshelves. Place a second stack of eight bookshelves over the L. (This is one more than you need, so you can skip one from the second level.)

, Some enchantments are only available at lower levels. You might also need to save XP by making low-level enchantments.

Get materials for the pyramid base.,
Get obsidian.,
Get glass.,
Get a Nether Star.",How to Make a Beacon in Minecraft1," You will need a base, in the shape of a pyramid, which is made of iron blocks, gold blocks, emerald blocks, or diamond blocks. In order to make the most powerful beacon (the power is determined by height), you will need 164 blocks of any one of those four materials.


All four blocks are made by crafting 9 of the smaller base material into a block. Iron ingots make iron blocks, diamonds make diamond blocks, etc.
Gold and iron ore are found in same way as most ores (iron much more readily than gold). Emerald is incredibly difficult to find and located only in Extreme Hills.;
, You will need 3 obsidian to make the beacon itself. This is easily found or created by exposing lava to flowing water. The water must come down on top of the lava, rather than the other way around (which makes cobblestone).

, Glass is easily made by smelting sand in a furnace. You will need 5 blocks of glass.

, Now, here’s the tricky part. If you’re in Creative mode, getting a Nether Star won’t be hard but getting one in Survival Mode will be a bit of a challenge. In order to get a Nether Star, you have to kill a Wither. He will drop the Nether Star.


Summoning a Wither is done similarly to making a Golem in Minecraft. Place four soul sands (found in the Nether) in front of you in a T shape and place 3 Wither Skeleton heads on top (the heads are dropped when killing Wither Skeletons).
The Wither will spawn and its health bar will begin to fill. When the bar fills it will explode. Wait for it to do that first, before trying to kill it.

A boat can also be placed on land by right clicking. It can be controlled on land but its movement will be extremely slow. They also sink into ground so you may need to get out by destroying a block beside it.
The boat can be placed on lava, but it will break when you try to enter it.

, Right-click on the boat to enter it. You can do so from any direction, including beneath it after diving. Press the left Shift key to exit the boat.

, The boat will go in any direction you are pointing your cursor when you hold the W button. Pressing the Back S key will quickly turn the boat around in the opposite direction.Boats are extremely fragile, and can break easily in a crash.To prevent them from crashing, slow down before you get near an island. If a boat does get destroyed in a crash, it will drop three Wood Planks and two Sticks. If the boat is destroyed by an attack, (skeleton shoots it) it will drop a Boat.
You can Sprint while using the boat to move slightly faster.

Consider your computer's capabilities.,
Check your Internet connection speed.,
Be sure to have the most current version of Java on your system.,
Create a folder for the server application program.,
Download the right Minecraft server application program for your system.,
Ready the application program for use.,
Customize settings for the way you want to play Minecraft.,
Determine who can access the game.,
Determine who has administrator privileges.,
Configure your router to make the server visible to players outside your immediate network.,
Find your public IP address.",How to Host a Minecraft Server," If you plan to use your computer as a server for Minecraft, you'll need to have a fast CPU and sufficient RAM to handle the number of people you anticipate logging on to your server to play. This is especially true if you plan to use the computer to play the game yourself as well as function as a server for others.

, You'll need a fast upload and download speed to allow players to interact with one another in real time.

, The software that enables you to use your computer as a Minecraft server requires Java to run. The most current version, as of when this article was originally written, is Java 7.

Windows computers do not usually come with Java pre-installed. You can install a current version of Java from http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp. Java is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. You can run 32-bit Java on a 64-bit computer, particularly if you're using an older browser that only supports 32-bit Java, but you can't run 64-bit Java on a PC with 32-bit architecture.






Macintosh computers, in contrast, usually come with Java pre-installed and update it automatically. If your Mac doesn't have a current version of Java installed, you can get it from the same source as the Windows version.







, This is primarily a housekeeping chore to make sure you know where the application was installed if you need to access it directly. Give the folder a meaningful name such as ""MinecraftServer.""


You may want to place the folder in the root directory of your hard drive, which for most computers is ""C:\"" or in your Desktop folder.





;
, Which file format you download depends on whether your computer runs Windows or MacOS.

For a Windows system, download Minecraft_Server.exe and save it to the folder you created in the previous step. This file is available from Minecraft.net.






For a Macintosh, download minecraft_server.jar and save it to the folder you created in the previous step. This file is also available from the Minecraft website.







,

For the Windows executable, double-click the file to run it. You'll see an interface window and a series of messages.






For the Macintosh .jar file, create a command file by opening TextEdit and choosing Make Plain Text from the Format menu. Copy the instruction ""#!/bin/bash cd ""$(dirname ""$0"")"" exec java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar minecraft_server.jar"" (without the quotes). Save the file in the same folder as the .jar file, using the .command extension and a descriptive name such as ""start"" or ""startserver."" Then, open Terminal and type ""chmod a+x ,"" (including the space, but not the quotes), and drag the .command file into the terminal window and press the Enter key. You then double-click the .command file, which in turn runs the .jar file.






At this point, with either the executable or the jar file, you may see some ""missing file"" warnings. These are for files that don't yet exist but will be created when the program runs for the first time. Once you see the word ""Done"" after the last ""Preparing spawn area"" message, enter ""stop"" in the text field. Press Enter.







, You do this by accessing the Server.Properties file, using either Notepad in Windows or TextEdit in MacOS. Once you have configured the settings the way you wish, save your changes.


Leave the game mode setting at ""0"" if you want to play Minecraft in survival mode, where players have to gather food and other resources while risking injury from enemies. To play in creative mode, where players take no damage and can place and destroy blocks instantly, set the game mode to ""1.""






To adjust how severe the survival mode setting is, change the value of the difficulty setting. A value of ""0"" is Peaceful, where there are no enemy mobs; a value of ""1"" is Easy, where the mobs exist as a minor threat; a value of ""2"" makes the mobs a moderate threat; while a value of ""3"" is Hard, where the mobs are a major threat.






You can learn about the other settings and what they control from the Minecraft wiki.

, You need to enable your fellow players to have access to the server in order to play Minecraft, but you need to prevent other people from invading the game.

First, enable the white list in the Server.Properties file by changing the White-List setting value to ""True."" Then, edit the White-List file, adding your username and the username of each player you want to allow access to your server. Press Enter after each username.







, Administrators, or moderators, can issue commands from chat mode while the game is running to add or block players or otherwise change the game. You assign administrator privileges by entering usernames into the Ops or Admin (for older versions of Minecraft) list the same way as for the white list. You'll want to enter your own username to the Ops list, along with the username of someone you trust to assist you.

, You'll have to set up the router to forward port 25565 (TCP) to the Minecraft server. The exact instructions vary according to the brand and model of your router; a list of routers with instructions for port forwarding can be found at http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/.

, You'll need to provide this address for anyone outside your immediate network to connect to your Minecraft server. You can find your public IP address by doing an Internet search with an argument such as ""what is my IP.""


The last two steps are necessary only if you play Minecraft with players who are in a different physical location than you and your server are. For a LAN party or game room at a science fiction convention, where all the players will be in the same room, you won't need to know your public IP or port forward your router.
