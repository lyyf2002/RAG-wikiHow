Find the server's website.,
Know the rules.,

Write in complete sentences.,
Explain what happened.,
Apologize for your actions.,
Share a screenshot if possible.,
Make a deal.,
Wait for a response.,
Stay polite if they deny your request.",How to Get Unbanned from a Minecraft Server," Sometimes, trying to log onto the server will display a screen that tells you where you can appeal your ban. Otherwise, a quick online search for ""Minecraft"" plus the name of the server will often lead to the server's website and forums, if that does not work then ask a friend..;
, Most likely, you were banned because someone reported you for breaking a server rule. Find the rules of the server on the website. Read them all to find out whether you actually broke them. You can argue you case more effectively if you know the rules.

, Search the forums for ""Unban Request"" and ""Ban Appeals."" It's very important that you read any ""stickied"" posts made by administrators in these threads. Often, these posts include format instructions that must be strictly followed.


You may need to create an account on the forums before you can see these posts.

, If you can't find any unban request instructions, look for the contact information for server operators. These are also called Ops, moderators, or administrators. This can be a difficult process. Follow all instructions to the letter to increase the chances of a response.


If there are no instructions posted, post in the forums asking for help.
If there are no forums, ask friends who can still access the server to ask around for the operators contact info.
If the operators won't talk to you, try to find someone who plays on the server. Ask him to negotiate on your behalf.

, Be sure to use your best grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The administrators are more likely to take requests seriously when they are well-written.


If you know a friend who's good at writing, ask him to look over your posts before you send them.

, Tell the operator everything that happened, and be polite about it. Acting rude or threatening will definitely not help your chances. Don't leave anything out of your story.


Don't make excuses, even if they're true. ""I didn't know it wasn't allowed"" or ""My little brother got on my account"" will almost never work.

, If you broke a rule, acknowledge that fact and apologize. If you offended another player, send the apology to her as well, or ask the operator to send it for you.


If you did something against a server rule, but didn't know it was a rule, collect evidence or witness testimony showing that you did not know. Present it in a polite and easy-to-understand fashion.

, If you have any screenshots or screen recordings showing what happened, post them on the forum or share them with your contact. It's always a good idea to take a screenshot of the ban screen, as it will say the reason you were banned, and sometimes a message from the person who issued the ban.


If you were mistakenly banned for ""flying"" or other cheats, take a screen recording on another server that shows severe lag causing this effect.

, If you're good at negotiation, you may be able to strike a deal. Try volunteering for some of the following:


Helping others build, gather, or work on other projects.
Trading only low-value items (if your ban was trade-related).
Staying out of certain areas.
Avoiding conversation with certain other players.
Compensating other players for damaged property (if relevant).

, The operators will look into your request. They may interview witnesses, take screenshots, look up your account information, or ask you questions. Wait patiently as they make a decision.


Depending on the server, this can take anywhere from one day to several weeks.
While waiting, you can participate on the forums. Posting compliments, advice, or inoffensive opinions could be taken into consideration.

, If you follow correct procedure and they still won't add you back, stay polite. Don't act abusive or give the server bad press, or you may find yourself on a blacklist that blocks you from many other servers. There are plenty of servers out there. It's time to find another.


Wait at least two or three weeks before trying again with another appeal. Check the server rules to see if they have specific rules about repeated appeals.
Some bans are only temporary, usually lasting between one day and one month. As long as you don't break any more rules, you will be allowed back once a temporary ban expires.

Build an enchantment table.,
Surround your enchantment table with fifteen bookshelves.,
Reach level 30.,
Avoid over-leveling.,
Place your item in the enchantment table.,
Place lapis lazuli in the second slot.,
Mouse over the enchantment options.,
Enchant any item to reset the options.,
Enhance an enchanted item with anvils.",How to Get the Best Enchantment in Minecraft," You'll need a book, two diamonds and four obsidian.You can make a book with one leather and three paper, or loot them by breaking bookshelves in an NPC library.
Diamonds are occasionally found in chests. You can also mine them from diamond ore with an iron pickaxe. The ore is rare and only found on the deepest levels.
Obsidian requires a diamond pickaxe to mine. The easiest way to get it is to pour water onto lava.;
, To get access to the highest level enchantments, you'll need fifteen bookshelves. Place each bookshelf exactly two squares away from the table, on the same level or one level above it. When correctly placed with no objects in between itself and the table, the bookshelf will send glyphs through the air to the table.


Even snow or a torch will block the effect of a bookshelf. This can come in handy if you're looking for a lower-level enchantment.
To craft a bookshelf, place a row of three books in the center of the crafting table and fill the rest with six wooden planks.

, You must be level 30 to get access to the most powerful enchantments.Killing mobs, mining, smelting, and cooking are the most common ways to gain experience. If you need to grind experience quickly, here are a few ways:


Make a mob spawning operation with a mob spawner item or without one.
Breeding then killing animals is a very efficient way to boost your xp. Chickens are particularly efficient, due to cheap feed (seed) and low hp.
""Late game"" players can collect fire resistant potions, enter the nether, and find a blaze spawner to gain levels in a matter of minutes. Mining nether quartz is another, decently fast XP option in this area.

, Each time you choose the highest level enchantment, you lose three levels. Enchant something as soon as you reach level 30, then gain back the levels afterward. Dropping from level 30 to 27 costs you 168 XP, while dropping from level 33 to 30 costs 216 XP, wasting 48 XP., Some items have a better chance at getting high level enchantments than others. There is a random element as well, so there are no guarantees, but keep the following info in mind:Gold is the best by far in terms of enchantment level, but its low durability makes it unattractive unless you have lots of experience to spare. (Similarly, wood tools and leather armor are the run ups, though far behind gold.)
Iron swords and tools are significantly better at getting enchanted than diamond ones. However, diamond armor is slightly better than iron.

, Minecraft 1.8 added a lapis lazuli cost to all enchantments. If you're going for the best enchantment (lowest slot on the table), you'll need three lapis lazuli each time.


Lapis lazuli ore is most common on levels 13 through 16, although it's still only slightly more common than diamond., Minecraft 1.8 also added the ability to see the enchantment before you choose it, by hovering your mouse over the option. You are guaranteed to get at least this enchantment, but it is possible to get a second one as well — or if you're very lucky, three or more., There is no way to change the three options you have available without choosing one of them. However, you will see different options for different types of items, and enchanting one will reset the options for all of them. For example, if you don't like your options for enchanting a sword, check out what's available for bows, tools, armor, or fishing poles. If you enchant any of them then look with your sword again, you'll see three new options.


If you don't think any of the options are useful, choose the cheapest (top) option so you only spend 1 level and 1 lapis lazuli. Consider using a book so you can add it to an item on the anvil, as described below.

, You can make an anvil with three blocks of iron (top row), plus four iron ingots (bottom row and center square). Among other uses, the anvil lets you pay experience to combine enchanted items and transfer enchantments from books. Here's an overview of how this works:Books have worse odds at getting a good enchantment, but can be combined with any item with the anvil. This will only work if
Two identical items (material and type) can be combined at the anvil to recover durability and combine enchantments.
Before combining enchanted items, make sure the enchantments are compatible. (See Warnings below.) If two enchantments are not compatible, the one from the second item will disappear.

If you don't have enough blocks, you are going to have to use this method.,
Find the bottom block of the wall of the hole.,
Climb onto the bottom block.,
Continue doing this until you reach the top.",How to Get Yourself Out of a Hole in Minecraft2," It requires a lot more work than the Block Method.

, Delete all of the blocks above it, as far as you can reach.

, Then, find the second bottom block of the wall in front of you. Delete all of the blocks above this block and step onto it. Do the same for the third bottom block, the fourth and so on.

, The result should be a staircase leading up to the ground. It takes a long time to do this from scratch, so if you don't complete it when nightfall comes, either persevere and face the monsters on the surface or wait until morning.

You need a pickaxe or a spade, again, if you don't have them it's possible, but it's very difficult. You also need the blocks that you harvested during the dig down to the bottom.

, Make sure there is one step, or a bottom block. Jump into it.

, Carefully jump into it.

, This is where it gets tricky. You need a lot of accuracy for the next few minutes as you journey to the top. You'll notice that, as you go to make the crevice in the opposite wall again, there is no floor in the crevice because you deleted it while making the first crevice. Carefully make the three block high crevice directly opposite, but just a little bit higher than your crevice. Then, make a bridge to the crevice using your blocks. If you have a low amount of blocks and you need to save them, make a floor for the opposite crevice and carefully jump into it.

, That is why you have to be very careful."

, Tekkit is, after all, still Minecraft.

, One of the biggest mods in Tekkit, IndustrialCraft 2, requires this device to craft nearly all of the machines. While searching for wood, you may have noticed darker trees with strange orange spots on them. Right-clicking on these spots with a treetap will yield sticky resin, which can be smelted in a furnace to obtain rubber at a ratio of 1:1.


An IC2 machine obtainable later on, the extractor, will produce rubber at a ratio of about 1:3.

, Copper wire, redstone, and refined iron (made by smelting iron ingots) are needed for (arguably) the most important IC2 produced material, the electronic circuit.

, These important and helpful blocks double your ingot output and provide energy for the former, respectfully. Their recipes can be found to the right, or in the in-game Not Enough Items recipe book.

, The alloy furnace, much like the vanilla furnace, can be powered off of any fuel (like coal or wooden planks).

, By using some very simple Lua code, you can automate in-game robots named turtles. They can be equipped with diamond tools and crafting tables to further their abilities. Lua code is common in video games (such as in World of Warcraft and Garry's Mod, among many others), and examples of code for mining turtles can be found on the ComputerCraft forums.

, BuildCraft pipes are used to move items, blocks, and liquid from machine to machine without player intervention. To get started, surround one piece of glass with wooden planks, cobblestone, regular stone, gold, redstone, or diamond to get pipes with different abilities. Their abilities differ depending on what material you use for them (diamond pipes sort, wooden pipes can pipe out of machinery with the help of engines, and so on). If you craft cactus green dye into pipe waterproofing and craft it onto a normal BC pipe, it can also be used to hold liquids.

, One big thing to craft early on is the BatBox, which can hold generator power for later use. Commonly, you would have your generator wired up to a BatBox, or its big brother, the MFE, which you would then wire up to the rest of your machines. Also, crafting solar panels and water mills provides an alternative energy source that's not reliant on your coal supply.

, Depending on the defined worth of an item, you can turn one item into another. After crafting one of these two items and dropping it into a crafting table you can do things such as turning one dye into another, turning four cobblestone into flint, turning four gold into diamond, and so on. Both stones also have a portable 3x3 crafting grid, accessible by pressing C with it equipped.

, Do you want armour that lasts quite long and takes all damage? Do you want a machine that produces items that can be used to craft anything? Do you want to defeat the ender dragon with a few nukes? As Tekkit is extremely open-ended, set some goals for what you want to achieve here.

Nearly all modern widescreen TVs support this, but some older tube TVs will not. If you aren't connected to an HDTV, you won't be able to play splitscreen.


If you know you already have your Xbox 360 connected to an HDTV and can play games at HD resolutions, skip down to the next section.;
, In order to display an HD image, you'll need to connect your Xbox 360 to your HDTV using either an HDMI or component cable. Component cables have three video prongs and two audio prongs. The video prongs are red, blue, and green. The audio prongs are red and white. The Xbox 360 also has a sixth yellow prong, but you won't be using this.


You can use any HDMI cable with the Xbox 360, but if you want to use a component cable, you'll need one made specifically for the 360.
The early versions of the Xbox 360 do not have an HDMI port, so you'll need to use the component cable.
Composite (RCA) cables will not work. These are three prong cables with a red, white, and yellow prong. This cable is not capable of transmitting HD video, and thus will not allow for splitscreen in Minecraft.

, You can do this by pressing the Guide button on your controller., This will allow you to check your display settings to ensure that you are displaying in HD., This should be ""720p,"" ""1080p,"" or ""1080i.""

If you don't see ""720p,"" ""1080p,"" or ""1080i,"" you may not be using the correct cable., If you just want to play with some friends or family in the same room, you'll want to play a local splitscreen game. None of the players will need an Xbox Live Gold account to play, but they will need local Xbox 360 accounts. You won't be able to play online while you're playing a local splitscreen game.

This will allow up to three other people to play locally without an Xbox Live account., The game will begin with the first player taking up the whole screen., This will open the Sign In screen.

If this menu doesn't appear, you either didn't uncheck ""Online game"" or you aren't using an HDTV.

, The second player can choose any account on the system. The account will need to have been created before starting Minecraft in order to select it., You can sign in with up to three other controllers for a total of four players., You can play splitscreen online with your Xbox Live friends. This allows up to four people to play locally with up to four other people online, for a total of eight players. This requires at least one Xbox Live Gold account.

You must have validly purchased your copy of Minecraft in order to purchase a Minecraft Realms server.
Uninstall any mods or texture packs, as these can often cause Realms to not work properly.
Minecraft Realms is currently only available for the PC version, though a Pocket Edition version is planned for the future.;
, As soon as you click on Minecraft Realms, you will be directed to the network window, similar to Multiplayer.


You can see the More Info button at the bottom of the screen, which, if clicked, will pop up a browser that leads to the Minecraft website.

Lastly, you will find the Play button.

, In order for you to create your very own Realm, you must subscribe first. Depending on which type of subscription you purchase, you will have a different length on your server rental.


Existing subscription can be renewed via the link in-game found in the Minecraft Realm page by clicking More Info. This will take you to your Mojang account page where you can choose to extend your subscription.
Anyone wishing to buy a Realm must migrate their account to a global Mojang account.
Subscriptions are available in chunks of one, three, and six months. The basic price per month is $13, but this goes down for longer subscriptions.

, After subscribing, the Create Realm option will be available and ready for you to use. Click on Create Realm, give your Realm a name and a description, set the difficulty, and you're ready to play the server.

, Click the Subscription Button. This button will allow you to view your remaining subscription time for that Realm, as well as follow a link you can use to extend it.

, Click Close Realm. This is to close down your created Realm. This will make your Realm unavailable to anyone but you. It's not yet proven if this is reversible, so it's best to leave it alone for now.

Also, if you have any resource packs installed, remove them.

, Some sites let your upload your skin directly to Minecraft, but most require that you save the skin and add it to your character yourself.

, If you want to tweak someone else’s design, or you want to change your own, open the .png file in a photo editor like Photoshop. Here, you can change the colors or edit the pattern. You must stay within the boundaries of the skin, or the skin will not fit your Minecraft character.

, You will be prompted for login information after you connect. Enter root as your username, and then the password you created when you signed up for your account. If you can't remember the password, click the ""Root"" button in the ""My Servers"" tab to enter a new password.

, You can use the command line to edit your Minecraft server settings. Once you are connected to the server, type nano minecraft-server/server.properties to open the server properties file. You can then edit the properties so that the server is to your liking.


Find the -Xmx entry in the server settings and change it to -Xmx384M.

, After making the changes to your server configuration, you will need to restart the server. Return to your vps.me dashboard and click the ""Reboot"" button at the top of the ""My Servers"" tab. After the server reboots, you and your friends can connect to it!

, In this time, the VPS is built.

, FileZilla is a popular FTP client, quite easy to use.

, Click on the SSH button and copy the IP address that appears there. You will also need the port.

, In the upper part of the program there will be some fields, ""Host"", ""Username"", ""Password"" and ""Port"". In the ""Host"" field put in the copied IP address from the SSH tab in Vps.me, but in front of it type sftp://; in the ""Username"" fill in ""root"" (without quotes); in the ""Password"" fill in the password that you received in the e-mail from vps.me after registering (the one you've chosen) and finally in the ""Port"" field fill in the port you copied from the SSH tab.

, Once you enter in the connection information, the server will be added to your list. You can now connect to it like you would any other Minecraft server.

, There are some reports of vps.me being unreliable, and there's no denying that their free servers are on the slow side. If you want to get a free Minecraft server, there are several sites that offer free hosting, though the server options are usually fairly limited. Some of the more popular sites include:


GratisServer.nu
Aternos.org
Zipp-Hosting.com

, If you have a spare computer in your house, you can turn it into a dedicated Minecraft server for you and your friends. This can be significantly cheaper than renting one, as you only have to pay the power and internet costs from your home. See this guide for detailed instructions for creating your own server.


Creating a Minecraft server is free; you don't even need to own Minecraft to set up a server.

, If you are currently renting a server or want to set up a server, you can look into getting it sponsored. Usually you would apply for sponsorship from server hosts or from companies that would want to advertise. A sponsored server is paid for completely by the host, while still allowing you to run the server itself.


In order to get a sponsorship, you will need to prove that your server can draw in a sustainable population.
Sponsors usually want to be able to monetize the server, so be prepared to pitch servers that have donation plans.
If your server offers unique features that help it stand out from all the other Minecraft servers, this looks very good to sponsors.
When contacting a hosting company for sponsorship, be sure to use professional language and spell out in detail all the benefits your server would bring to their company."

Understand how to get gunpowder from creepers.,
Place cactus in the creeper's path.,
Fight creepers underwater.,
Kill creepers in hand to hand combat.,
Lure creepers into burning terrain.,
Shoot creepers with a bow and arrow.,
Tame ocelot bodyguards.",How to Get Gunpowder in Minecraft1," Each creeper drops 0, 1, or 2 units of gunpowder, but only if you kill it before it explodes. Now that you know the basics read on for a few ways to kill it without damaging its precious goods.


The steps below are organized by the tools they require. Methods lower down are faster and easier but require more advanced items.;
, One way to kill a creeper without fancy tools is to place cactus blocks behind you as it chases you. The cactus will damage them when they brush past it.This is much faster if you just let the cacti injure it enough to finish it with a single sword blow.


Thirteen cacti hits and one iron sword blow will kill a creeper.
Twelve cacti hits and one diamond sword blow will kill a creeper.
One cactus will sometimes hit the Creeper more than once. The creeper makes a noise each time it gets hurt, so you can count these to keep track of cactus hits.

, Explosions cannot hurt you underwater.Lure the creeper to water deep enough to submerge yourself completely. Staying underwater, kill it with a sword.


Remember, you need to kill the Creeper before it explodes to get gunpowder. The water is a safety feature if something goes wrong.

, You can kill creepers without any fancy tactics. Needless to say, this is dangerous. Stash all your valuable items in a chest, and pick up an iron or diamond sword. Here's how to make a successful attack:Lure the creeper to open ground.
Double-tap the forward key to start sprinting. (On Pocket Edition, this requires version 0.12.1+.)
Strike the creeper with your sword while sprinting to knock it backwards. This should cancel its explosion countdown.
Immediately retreat to get some distance between you.
Repeat. The creeper will die after three hits with a regular iron or diamond sword.

, Equip flint and steel. Get the creeper to chase you over grass, planks, or other flammable ground. Run backwards and light the ground in front of you on fire. The creeper will catch on fire, then slowly burn to death. This will not cause an explosion, so you can still pick up any gunpowder that drops.

, This is one of the easiest ways to kill creepers, especially if you start on the higher ground. Here's how to get this weapon:


Each skeleton killed has a small chance to drop a bow and/or 0 to 2 arrows.To make a bow instead, combine three sticks and three strings. You can get string by killing spiders or breaking cobwebs with a sword.
To make your own arrows, combine one flint, one stick, and one feather. Flint is an uncommon drop from gravel. Feathers come from chickens.

, Ocelots are cat-like animals that spawn in jungles, available in all versions of Minecraft. (You may need to update Pocket Edition to 0.12.1.) Creepers will not come near ocelots, so hunting for gunpowder is much easier with these cats around. Here's how to tame them:Gather as much fish as you can, usually by fishing.
Approach the ocelot, preferably in an open area. Sneaking is recommended. Hold the fish.
Stay still and wait for the ocelot to look at you and approach.
Feed the fish to the ocelot. Use the left trigger or L2 button on a console. Hold down the right mouse button on PC.
Keep feeding fish until the Ocelot turns into a cat. It will now follow you.

Check your version number.,
Know the odds.,
Find a witch hut.,
Dig a trap in front of the house (optional).,
Shoot the witch when it spawns.,
Kill the witch with a sword.",How to Get Gunpowder in Minecraft2," Witches have been in the PC edition since 1.4.2, and in the console edition since December 2014. They are not available in Minecraft Pocket Edition.


A known bug in the PC edition version 1.8 prevents witches from spawning in witch huts for some players (possibly just in Windows 7).As of November 2015, there is no word on whether this will be fixed in 1.9.

, Each witch killed only gives about a 16% chance of dropping gunpowder, compared to a 66% chance when killing creepers. However, the witch can drop up to six items and may drop other items like spider eyes or glowstone. This makes them more profitable if you're interested in these extra items.

, You can find witches anywhere, but they're much more common around witch huts. These wooden buildings on stilts only spawn in swamp biomes, which are watery areas filled with trees.


Witch huts can be difficult to find. You can try using a mapping mod such as AMIDST.

, Dig a small pit in front of the hut's doorway. A short distance away, build a small hill or tower. Make sure you have line of sight to fire bows from this high ground into the pit. Include a barrier to hide behind as well, since witches throw damaging potions.


Warning: the hut may contain a witch. Be prepared for a fair fight before you set up your trap.

, Bows and arrows are the easiest way to kill a witch. If you draw back the bow fully before firing, three arrows will do the trick.


Witches can drink healing potions so that you may need additional arrows.

, Alternatively, just run up to the witch and kill it with a sword. Once you know how the witch's potions work, this isn't too difficult:The witch will slow you down if it sees you from more than eight blocks away. Ambush it from behind a tree or barrier to prevent this.
The witch will poison you. Poison cannot kill you, but it can bring you to one health. Have a healing item ready to recover after the combat.
Each subsequent potion will deal six damage. You should survive if you have decent armor and can kill the witch quickly.

Decide whether to hunt Ghasts.,
Make a nether portal.,
Craft armor and a bow.,
Hunt for Ghasts.,
Create a barrier (optional).,
Shoot them with your bow and arrow.,
Deflect the fireballs.",How to Get Gunpowder in Minecraft3," Ghasts are extremely dangerous enemies that shoot fireballs from sixteen blocks away. They drop gunpowder at exactly the same rate as creepers. The main advantage is that they can also drop Ghast tears, a special item used in potion brewing., Follow the instructions in the linked article to make a nether portal from obsidian and fire.

, Entering the Nether is not recommended until you have diamond armor, plus a bow and arrows.


Ideally, enchant your equipment to make it even better. Fire resistance will come in handy.
A diamond sword is useful for killing other enemies in the Nether, but won't help much against flying, agile Ghasts.

, Look for Ghasts in large, open spaces, anywhere in the Nether. They are giant, flying white monsters with short, dangling tentacles.

, The Ghast fireballs are extremely powerful, but the Ghast will not fire through solid blocks. A glass barrier is a useful way to hide between shots while still keeping an eye on the Ghast.

, A Ghast dies from about three arrows, depending on how far you draw back the bow. Move behind your barrier in between shots, or shoot while running to dodge the fireballs.


Take care not to fight the Ghast above lava. If the gunpowder drops in lava, you will not be able to retrieve it.

, The fireballs move pretty slowly. You can knock them off course with an arrow or sword. Knock them away from you, and try to hit them straight back at the ghast.

Know the odds.,
Locate a dungeon.,
Place a torch on the monster spawner.,
Dig through the walls instead.,
Destroy the chest.",How to Get Gunpowder in Minecraft4," This method is not guaranteed to return gunpowder. Gunpowder is randomly available in chests, as one of many possible items. But you'll at least get something else for your efforts even if there is no gunpowder!

, Dungeons are small underground structures made from cobblestone or mossy stone. They only spawn within solid blocks, so mining may be a more effective way to find them than exploring caves.In the upcoming 1.9 edition for PC, you can also find gunpowder in desert temple chests., Each dungeon has a monster spawner that sends out a steady supply of mobs. Fight your way to the spawner and place a torch on it to stop more monsters from showing up.

, Alternatively, if you want to avoid the spawner, dig around the sides of the dungeon to reach the chests. Chests are usually located around the walls of the dungeon, allowing you quick access and getaway if you come in from the sides.

, This is the fastest way to collect the loot and chest. If there is gunpowder inside it, you have got what you came for!

, Zombies have a rare chance—1 in 40—of dropping carrots when defeated.It does happen, but it's generally not efficient or safe, so don't count on it.

, You can create farmland out of dirt or grass blocks. Assuming default controls, right-click (PC), press the left trigger (console), or tap (mobile) with a hoe selected in your inventory.

, Each block of farmland will need to be within four blocks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally of a water block. The water block(s) must be either on the same level or one block above the farmland.


You can also manually hydrate farmland with an iron bucket, crafted from three ingots of iron. Rain will also hydrate farmland.

, Carrots are their own seeds, so you can simply plant any carrots you have to make more carrots.


You can find carrots from any of the previously listed steps for finding carrots: pilfering through village farms, slaughtering zombies, or looking at naturally-spawned chests.

, Carrots take eight stages to reach maturity. You will see a bit of orange peeking through the farmland when the carrots are ready to be harvested.


You can speed up the time it takes for the crop to mature by using bone meal as fertilizer. Bone meal is crafted using a single bone, which produces three bone meal., When you harvest a carrot, you will receive one to four carrots from a single farmland block.


Harvest by ""mining"" the fully-grown carrot crop.

Click here for more detailed instructions and tips on creating effective farms in Minecraft.

, You can eat carrots raw from your inventory. Each carrot you eat will replenish three Hunger (marked by one and a half Hunger icons being filled).

, Farmers will buy anywhere from 15 to 19 carrots in exchange for an emerald.

, Carrots allow you to lead and breed both pigs and rabbits for better food. To breed an animal, you will need to lead two of them close together and then feed each one a carrot.Click here for more detailed instructions on breeding animals in Minecraft.
If you have a Golden Carrot (see next step), you can use it to breed horses and donkeys.

, There are several things you can craft with some carrots and other materials. You cannot currently craft any carrot-related items in Minecraft Pocket Edition.Carrot on a stick - You will need an undamaged fishing rod in the middle-left box, and a carrot in the bottom-center box.

Golden Carrot - You will need a carrot in the center surrounded by eight gold nuggets. Nine gold nuggets can be crafted by putting a singular gold ingot in a crafting table (even the small 2×2 one in your inventory).

Rabbit Stew (PC only) - You will need a baked potato in the center, a cooked rabbit in the top-center box, a carrot in the left-center box, a mushroom in the right-center box, and a bowl in the bottom-center box.

, One of the main uses for Golden Carrots, besides breeding horses and donkeys, is creating Potions of Night Vision.


Make a brewing stand, crafted using three stone slabs and a fire rod.
Use a bottle of water and nether wart (found in the Nether, most commonly in fortresses) to create an Awkward Potion.
Add a Golden Carrot to the Awkward Potion to create a Potion of Night Vision.

, Use the brewing stand to add a fermented spider eye to a Potion of Night Vision.

A fermented spider eye is crafted using a brown mushroom (found naturally), sugar (crafted from one sugarcane), and a spider's eye (a 1 in 3 drop from a spider).Fermented spider eyes always reverse the effect of a potion (Potion of Strength to Potion of Weakness, Potion of Night Vision to Potion of Invisibility).

, With either potion, you can add one of three substances to said potion in a brewing stand to enhance the potion's abilities.


Redstone - Increases potion's length.

Glowstone - Increases potion's strength.

Gunpowder - Makes the potion a splash potion. This means the potion, when thrown, will affect everyone around the potion. Each person will be given a small or large fraction of the potion's original duration, dependent on how close the person was to the splash potion's landing site at the moment it hit the ground.

Kill the guardians carefully.,
Create a spawn point inside the monument for safety.,
Cook the raw fish before eating.,
Eat the fish as you would other food.,
Alternatively, give raw fish to ocelots.",How to Get Fish in Minecraft," To make a fishing rod, you'll need three wooden sticks and two pieces of string, plus a crafting table. Arrange the sticks in a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right in the crafting grid. Arrange the two strings in the spaces on the right side.


To get sticks, first craft a set of wooden planks from raw wood (which you can get from trees.) Then, craft the sticks from two planks stacked vertically.To get string, kill spiders and cave spiders and destroy their cobwebs — you will receive it frequently as a drop. Alternatively, you can get string from the tripwires in jungle temples and from chests in dungeons. Finally, you can get string randomly while fishing.;
, To go fishing, you'll need to find a pond, a lake, or an ocean. You can even make a small man-made body of water and fish in it — it's up to you. Nearly any body of water will do.

, You can fish from the shore, while standing in the water, or from a boat. While you don't need a boat for fishing, they can be helpful for traveling quickly over water to get to your favorite fishing spot. Additionally, if you're trying to get fish by killing guardians, boats can help you get to ocean monuments quickly.


To make a boat, arrange five wood planks in a ""U"" shaped pattern at the bottom of a crafting table's crafting grid., Besides fishing, the other way to get fish in minecraft is by killing guardians — special underwater enemies. Guardians can be challenging for new players to defeat, so to give yourself the best chance, you'll want to use the sturdiest weapons and armor that you can — craft them from diamond, if possible. See the relevant section below for more information.


See our guides on Minecraft armor and swords to get started.
You will also need to find an ocean monument, as guardians only spawn in and around these structures.Since these are located at the bottoms of oceans, having a few potions of water breathing is essential. See our Minecraft potions guide for more information.

, When you're at a lake or ocean, equip your fishing rod. Use the rod to cast into the water. You should see a small bobber appear on the surface of the water.


At this point, don't move too far away from the bobber. Moving more than 32 blocks away (or un-equipping the fishing rod) will cause it to disappear., You'll need to wait a random amount of time (specifically, 5-45 seconds) after you cast for a fish to bite.Keep your eye on the bobber! This is your clue for when a fish is biting on your line.


When a fish is getting ready to bite, you will see a small ""trail"" approaching the bobber unless your particle effects are set to minimal. Get ready to reel in when you see this.

, When you get a bite, the bobber will disappear beneath the water. Use the reel again (right-click by default on computers) to reel in the fish. Your window of opportunity is very small here — about half a second — so be ready!If you successfully catch the fish, it will fly towards you and you will catch it unless your inventory is full or there are blocks in the way.
If you miss the fish, you can re-cast or simply leave the line in the water and try again.

, With a basic, un-enchanted fishing rod, you have about an 85% chance of catching a fish with each successful reel.However, it is possible to get other surprises while fishing — specifically, you have a 10% chance of getting a junk item (such as leather boots) and a 5% chance of getting treasure (such as enchanted books and golden pickaxes.) If you have the patience to fish continually for a long period of time, this can be an effective way to get great items.


The Minecraft Wiki has an excellent guide to the loot you can get while fishing (available here.)
Enchanting your fishing rod changes the odds of getting the different types of loot. Luck of the Sea enchantments make it slightly less likely that you will catch junk and slightly more likely that you will catch treasure, while Lure enchantments make fish bite more quickly.

, Guardians, which can be killed for fish, only spawn in and around large underwater structures called ocean monuments. Finding these ocean monuments can be a major challenge in and of itself. Use the tips below to find a suitable ocean monument.Ocean monuments generate naturally near the centers of deep oceans and other deep aquatic biomes (lakes, frozen oceans, frozen rivers, etc.)
Ocean monuments spawn only in areas that have not been inhabited for more than three minutes.
You can use a potion of night vision to see ocean monuments from far away (since they allow you to see even where visibility is zero.)
Thus, a good strategy for finding ocean monuments is to set up a potion-brewing base, brew many potions of night vision, and use the potions to look into deep oceans without getting in the water. Ocean monuments are large, blocky, somewhat pyramid-shaped structures. See this link for more information., Ocean monuments are dangerous areas to explore, even for high-level players. In addition to the constant threat of drowning, the guardians and elder guardians that inhabit these underwater temples can be challenging opponents. If you die deep under the ocean, you can lose all of your best equipment easily, so you will want to ensure you are well-prepared when you descend to the monument. Equipment recommendations include:


Diamond-grade weapons and armor.
Several potions of water breathing
Several potions of night vision
Food
Healing/regeneration potions
Strength potions
Sponges (for creating air pockets)
Iron or diamond pickaxe (for mining gold blocks)
Bed (for resetting spawn point)

, Guardians look like spiky grey-green fish with one eye. Elder guardians (stronger enemies) are greyish-white. Guardians' main attack is a ranged laser. The guardian will begin charging its laser for several seconds when it notices the player. When the laser becomes bright yellow, it will fire. The attack hits instantly and is unblockable. In addition, it can penetrate armor somewhat (though higher-level armors still give the biggest benefit.)Moving out of range or behind a solid block will stop the guardians' attacks. In addition, if you get close to a guardian, it will stop its attack and swim away to get to a good range before resuming its attack.
The guardians' second attack is a defensive one. When you strike the guardian while its spikes are extended, it will deal a small amount of damage to you. This is greatly reduced by armor.

, Every player makes mistakes. Unfortunately, in an underwater monument, these mistakes can be serious. If you die, it can be very difficult to retrieve your items in the five-minute window you are allowed. Since these items are likely to be quite high-level, this can be a major setback. However, you can make the risk somewhat smaller by making a spawn point inside the monument so that you don't have to travel to the bottom of the ocean again once you die. To do this:Kill the enemies inside an area of the monument.
Clear the water out of the area with sponges to make an air pocket.
Place a bed in the dried-out area. Use the bed to wait until night. This resets your spawn point — if you die, you'll restart here, rather than on dry land.
Optionally, you can bring a chest and fill it with backup items and potions so that it's easier to reach your ""good"" equipment if you die.

, You can catch four kinds of fish: normal fish, salmon, clownfish, and pufferfish. Once you catch a fish, it will appear in your inventory — for normal fish and salmon, it will be ""raw"" (i.e., raw fish, raw salmon); for the other fish, it will just appear as the name of the fish. You can eat the raw fish for a small amount of food, but it is much more efficient to cook them first, as this will give you a much bigger bonus.


Cook fish the same way you'd cook other meat — in a furnace with any fuel source.
Note that pufferfish are harmful to eat but have other uses (see ""Tips"" below.)

, When your character becomes hungry, eat your cooked fish for a boost. Ordinary fish restore five hunger points (three icons), while salmon restore six.Both fish types restore only two hunger points when eaten raw.
Clownfish restore only one hunger point. Once again, pufferfish are poisonous and should not be eaten.

, All fish — even pufferfish — can be used to tame wild ocelot mobs. Ocelots spawn naturally in jungles above sea level. If you encounter one, you can attempt to tame it with these steps:Get within 10 blocks of the ocelot.
Wait for the ocelot to enter ""begging"" mode. This happens when the ocelot looks at the player and walks slowly near it.
When the ocelot gets very close (within three blocks), throw it a raw (uncooked) fish. Ocelots will not be poisoned by pufferfish. There is a 1/3 chance it will become a tame cat when it takes the fish. If your attempt fails, try again.
Don't make sudden movements when you're within six blocks of the ocelot — this can cause it to exit ""begging"" mode.

Join a game.,
Use the Armorsmith kit.,
Throw your bottles of enchanting on the floor.,
Once you are prepared, build across with your blocks.,
If anyone is around, build a wall around your bridge.,
Get over to the middle.,
Watch out for enemies!,
Loot mid.,
Fight off everyone else with your gear.,
When you get your first kill, as long as you didn't egg the person you killed off, they drop their gear.,
Once you have fought off every single player, you have won!",How to Get Better at Minecraft Skywars," You can go into the SW Lobby and chose a game mode, such as Teams Insane, Solo Insane, and more.;
, With this kit you get a Diamond helmet, a Sharpness/Protection book, an anvil and 64 bottles of Enchanting. This gives you the ability to enchant items at the start, making your gear better than most other people in the game. However, on the map Shire, people will attempt to jump you so use a kit with a sword.

, Just watch out for people trying to shoot you. This will make you take damage.

, But make sure nobody else is trying to egg you off! Look around.

, If there's nobody else around, ignore this step.

, Look for anyone building across and knock them off. This will get rid of a bunch of potential threats.

, If you think you can take them on, chase them. If you think their gear is better, stay away.

, The middle often gives you Iron and Diamond armor (in Normal) and OP Armor (in Insane). If it's already looted, wait for refill and camp somewhere. Maybe make a fortress!

, A good tip is to use a PvP texture pack such as Huahwi's Infinite x16 Edit, and set your attack keybind to something simpler like R (for laptops).

, If they have anything better than you, make sure nobody is trying to ""clean-up"" and get the useful gear!

, Good job!

You can use mods to add capes to the game (see the section below), but these will only be visible to you when you play online. If you want a cape that everyone can see, you'll need to go to an official Minecraft event like MineCon.MineCon is typically held in November, though it took place in July in 2015. 2016 dates have now been announced to be occurring on September 24-25, check mojang.com for more announcements.
Other than being heavily involved in the development or community, this is the only way to obtain an official cape.;

, Follow the link in the email that you receive to add the cape to your Minecraft account. When you're wearing it, anyone you're playing multiplayer with will be able to see it.

, Besides MineCon capes, the only other players to receive capes have been a select few that have been heavily involved with the development and community aspects of Minecraft. These include a handful of translators, bug fixers, and the occasional lucky user. This requires a lot of time and hard work, so you probably shouldn't undertake translation projects just to try to get a cape.

, It's impossible to earn many of the capes that you may have seen anymore, so try not to worry too much about not having one. If you really need a cape while you play, you can try a cape mod.

, if you managed to get a cape, or even more than one, you can change them from your Minecraft Profile page. Visit minecraft.net/profile and log in with your Minecraft account. You'll be able to select from any of your available capes.

Wait for it to grow.,
Harvest.,
Fertilize crops with bone meal.,
Surround the area with farmland.,
Fence in your crops.,
Keep your crops well lit.,
Cover the water.",How to Grow Seeds in Minecraft PE," You can grow four types of seeds in Minecraft Pocket Edition. Here's how to find them all:


Wheat seeds have a chance of dropping each time you use a hoe on a grass block, or use shears on tall grass.(Version 0.4 or later required.)To get beetroot seeds, harvest beetroot crops in village farms (Version 0.12.0 build 8+), or cut grass as described above (earlier versions).
Find pumpkins growing in plains, savannah or taiga biomes. Craft the pumpkin to make seeds. (Version 0.8+).Find melons growing in jungles. Craft the melon to make melon slices, then craft the slices to make seeds. (Version 0.9+).;
, Crops grow fastest in warm biomes, where green grass and trees grow naturally. Although crops can grow anywhere, the following are signs of an area where growth will be slow:Snow
Frost-covered leaves
Steep mountainous terrain
Sand (except for beaches)
Yellowish grass

, Equip your hoe and use it on grass or dirt to make farmland. You can identify farmland by the parallel lines on the surface.

, Wheat grows much faster when watered, and other crops require it to grow at all. Your farmland will become ""hydrated"" (and look darker) if there is any water block within four blocks, although crops may grow fastest within three.Early in the game you'll want to farm next to an existing water source. Once you have buckets, you can transport water to use space more efficiently:


Extra efficient: Prepare a 9 x 9 block of farmland, dig a one-block hole in the center, and fill the hole with water.
Less efficient but more attractive: Prepare three rows farmland, one row water, six rows farmland, one row water, then three rows farmland.

, Simply select your seeds and tap the farmland to plant them. Note that melons and pumpkins will grow to cover two squares, although the second square doesn't need to be farmland., Crops will grow on their own, going through several stages of growth. Here's how to tell when the crop has reached maximum potential:


Wheat is ready when tall and yellow-brown.
Beetroot is ready when it has tall, bushy leaves.
Melons and pumpkins are ready when the fruit appears on a block next to the stem.

, Just click and hold on the crop to turn it into the fully grown product. Wheat and beetroot has a chance of dropping seeds as well, so you can start a new farm.


Melons and pumpkins do not need replanting; just harvest the fruit and leave the stem, and it will grow a new one.
If you harvest wheat or beetroot before it's fully grown, you might get seeds but you will not get the food item.

, Gather bones from killing skeletons or fishing, then craft them into bone meal. Each use of bone meal instantly advances your crop by a random number of stages.


If you're short on seeds, this is a great plan for your first plant so you can harvest more seeds to plant.

, After you run out of seeds or water, prepare unplanted farmland in a border one block wide on all sides. In the PC version, nearby farmland significantly speeds up growth, and the same might be true of Pocket Edition., Wandering mobs can trample your crops. Build a fence around your farm to protect it.

, Crops only grow when exposed to light. Torches every four or five spaces will speed up growth by letting your crops grow at night as well as day. This won't have any effect if you skip nights by sleeping in a bed.Oddly enough, farmland is transparent. Dig beneath your farm (careful to avoid the water) and place torches there to make your farm glow.This does not happen on other versions of Minecraft, so it's likely that this will be removed in a future update.

, Walking through your crops doesn't break them, but jumping on the farmland can turn it right back to normal dirt.If you fall in to the water and are forced to jump out, you'll be losing food. Prevent this by covering the water with slabs or other ""half height"" blocks that don't require jumping to walk onto.


In cold biomes, covering the water will also prevent it from freezing.

Prepare for the night.,
Create Projects.,Enjoy the view.",How to Get Started on Minecraft Pocket Edition," The game of Minecraft is around 4.50 pounds or $6.99 on the Android Market and App store. There is also a free version (demo) where you can add blocks, make houses, kill zombies just like the full version. However, for the most complete and up-to-date experience, you'll ultimately want to choose the full version. If you can not get to the app store or the Android Market there should be a link somewhere on the internet.;
, To make the world go into the Game and click Play. Then you press New in the top right corner of the screen. You can enter a seed if you know one. There are also 2 modes:


Use Survival Mode. Survival mode is where you can kill monsters and make a house. In this mode you can collect your own items and get hurt and die.
Try the Creative Mode. In this mode you can create anything with unlimited blocks and items. Monsters are not available in this mode unless you spawn them; you can also fly in it. This is the best mode if you want to start a project. The only way to die is to go under the world (breaking the bedrock).

, Jumping (middle button), Left (left button), Right (right button), Forward (top button), Backwards (bottom button),Sneak (Double Tap far right button.) Fly (creative mode: Double tap on the jump button to start flying. To go higher, hold the jump button down and tap on the move forward button.), Smashing blocks (Hold down on the object you want to break) Hurting mobs (Tap on a mob). The controls will not change on any device.

, Get a crafting table and start crafting weapons, blocks, tools etc. Crafting tables are crafted with 4 wooden planks taken from trees and crafted into wooden planks.

, To make a house you will need to find a spot that you like. You can find out about the blocks for your house in the tips. There are many different ways to make your house, and many blocks can be used to design one. It's best to make a shelter on your first night. You can build a dirt, wood or stone hut, or you can burrow into a mountain or hill. You could also just dig a hole in the ground.

, To smelt you will need to craft a furnace from crafting table, the items needed are 8 cobblestone which you can get by mining stone with a pickaxe. No other tool will work, if you do try it it will be slow and you will not be able to collect anything.

, To mine, you need to have the right equipment: At least one pickaxe (wood, stone, iron or diamond) and torches. If you want to be really prepared, take a pickaxe, shovel, 2 buckets, at least 32 cobblestone, some food and a sword. To mine you need to make steps down underground; you can find gold ore, diamonds, iron ore, coal, redstone, emeralds, and lapis lazuli. You can mine by making long steps down, but NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN.

, You should remember that most monsters can't climb so crafting ladders and climbing a tall tree is a good strategy. When night comes you need to have your sword built and ready to fight the monsters that appear. A good starting sword is probably a stone sword. Diamond swords are the easiest way to kill any monster.

, Now you have got used to crafting, smelting, and the controls you now have enough experience to create projects. Try starting with stone. You can create anything from a spaceship to a floating mansion.

Update Minecraft Pocket Edition.,
Find a seed online (optional).,
Make sure villages are enabled.,
Choose a world type.",How to Find an NPC Village in Minecraft PE1," You must have Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.9.0 or later in order to encounter an NPC village in the game. Update your app if necessary before continuing.


Your version number is typically displayed on the main menu.;
, Each Minecraft world is generated using an algorithm based on a ""seed,"" or string of text. A particular seed will always result in the same world, so if you find a seed online that is known to have villages, this can make your search much easier. Search online for ""Minecraft pocket edition seeds villages,"" along with your version number and the OS you are using to play Minecraft (such as Android or Apple.) Once you've found a seed that starts you near a village, or gives you directions to one, enter that seed in the ""Seed"" box when you create a new world. If you can't find one, use the steps below instead.


For Android Pocket Edition version 0.9, try using ""kop,"" ""johnny appleseed,"" or ""super pig,"" without the punctuation or quotation marks. ""1388582293"" will start you in a massive village, while ""AcE"" creates a village built on water.You might also need to use the same settings as the person who posted the seed online, such as ""infinite"" or ""flat.""

, Click Create new world → more world options, and make sure the checkbox next to ""generate structures"" is checked. this box must be checked in order to have villages in your world.

, When you create a new world, you'll have several options for which type of world you want to create. ""Large Biomes"" increases the chance of villages spawning, and makes searching for them easier. ""Superflat"" increase the chance even more, but you may not enjoy playing on a completely flat world. If these options are not available, choose ""Default.""


Some devices will lag or crash in large worlds. If this happens to you, you will have to create an ""Old"" world type, and hope that a village is present in the small, finite world.

Craft an Iron Pickaxe (wood, stone or even gold pickaxes won't work) so you can receive diamonds when you mine Diamond ore.,
Gather some food.,
Bring some weapons.",How to Find Diamonds in Minecraft PE1," In order to create an Iron Pickaxe, you will need 3 Iron Ingots and 2 sticks.;
, Diamonds are found in the lowest levels of worlds, so the journey will be a long one. You'll want to ensure that you have enough provisions to able to stay and mine for a good amount of time without dying of hunger.

, You'll be down in the deepest reaches of the Minecraft world, so you're sure to come across some hostile mobs. Make sure you have some good armor and a trusty sword before heading out. Be prepared!

"

Make and equip a large map.,
Prepare for a long journey.,
Tame a mount (optional).,
Increase your render distance.,
Locate a flat biome.,
Use your map while searching the biome.,
Repeat until you find a village.,
Follow large groups of zombies.",How to Find an NPC Village in Minecraft PE2," Craft a compass and eight piece of paper to make a map, and equip it to create a ""minimap"" of your surrounding area as you explore. Expand the size of your map by crafting the map with eight additional pieces of paper. You can expand a map up to four times, requiring a total of 40 pieces of paper, but you do not need to expand it until your travels take you to the edge of the current map.


To create a compass, combine one redstone and four iron ingots.

, It can take hours to find a village, especially if you are not using a special world type as described in the world creation section. Stock up on basic tools, a bed, food, and weapons before you set out. Do not expect to return to your starting point for a long time.

, If you found a saddle somewhere, you can use it to get a mount and speed up your exploration. Find a horse and interact with it several times with an empty hand, until it doesn't throw you off. Sneak up to the tamed horse and saddle it to make it controllable while you ride it.A pig can also be saddled, but requires a steady supply of ""carrot on a stick"" items to be controlled. You can create these items by combining a carrot with a fishing pole., Go to the Options screen and increase the render distance to the maximum, so you can see farther while you explore. If this makes your game lag, reduce it, then increase it again for a short time whenever you are on high ground looking for the next place to search, as described below.

, Villages appear most often on biomes that are mostly flat, such as plains (short grass), savanna (tall grass and a few trees), or desert (sand). If you do not see areas like this nearby, climb a mountain or tree to search for one, or build a tower out of dirt or gravel.


At night, you might be able to spot a distant village by its torchlight, but beware of monsters in Survival mode.

, There is no guarantee that a biome has a village, but thoroughly explore the whole area to increase your chances of finding one. Look at your map once in a while to see if there are any tell-tale signs of a nearby village marked on it:


In plains or savanna, villages are made of wood, and will show up on the map as brown pixels on the green background.
In deserts, villages are made of sandstone, which appears almost identical to the sand on the map. This makes them harder to find, but these sometimes contain pyramidal temples with valuable loot.
Either type of village might have unusual tile types that give their location away on the map. Look for rows of wheat, small water tiles (wells), bookcases, pressure plates, or crafting tables.

, Once you've explored a biome completely, climb a hill or other tall structure, and locate the next plains, savanna, or desert biome. You may need to explore hills for a short time to find the next flat biome, but try to get back to flat land as soon as possible to increase your chances of finding a village.


You can make the most efficient use of your map by moving in a large circle around the point where you first used your map. If you keep moving in one direction only, you will only be able to use a small part of your map before creating a new one.

, Occasionally, a large group of zombies will spawn to attack a village. If you spot an unusual number of zombies in the distance, it might be worth checking out where they're headed. Needless to say, be prepared for a fight.

"
"
Put out the blacksmith fire.,
Be careful of iron golems.,
Search for crops and other loot.",How to Find an NPC Village in Minecraft PE3," When you locate a village, first check if a blacksmith is present. This is a rectangular wooden buildings with a stone roof. Besides a chest that might contain good loot, there is a square of lava. In Pocket Edition, this lava can sometimes start a fire that burns down the whole village. Scoop it up in a bucket, or cover it with a stone slab to prevent this from happening.

, If the village is large enough, an iron golem will spawn with it. If you attack or kill enough villagers, the iron golem will attack you. These are tough enemies, so do not destroy the villagers unless you are well prepared.

, Villages typically have one or more farms, with rows of crops or seeds that you can harvest to start your own farm. Less obvious loot is usually found in chests within the village's blacksmith, temple, or other buildings. Some buildings may have traps, so be careful when you explore.

Be a Good Miner in Minecraft.,
Start your mine.,
Branch out.,
Keep digging.",How to Find Diamonds in Minecraft PE2," Find a good cave system until you hit bedrock. This is the lowest you can go in the world, and will help you know how deep you are when you're mining. Diamond ore is typically found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8.


Never, ever dig straight down, as you don't know what is underneath those blocks. You might fall into a dungeon or a pool of lava.

, Once you hit bedrock, go back up until you're around level 8 and start your mine. Dig a central room about 2 blocks tall, 4 blocks long, and 4 blocks high.


Some players like to start the mine around layer 11. This will result in a slightly smaller chance of finding diamonds, but you are less likely to tunnel directly into a lava pit this way. Remember, diamonds usually spawn near lava.
It is recommended that you create a chest in the central room of your mine so that you have a place to store excess ore as you build the mine., Dig a corridor 2 blocks high and at least 50 blocks long in each direction. These will be your starting branches. Walk down one of your corridors and start mining to the left and right every six blocks. This will maximize your efficiency the amount of blocks you can see as you mine. 

, Diamonds are one of the rarest things in the game to find, E, and occur in less than 1% of the blocks in the lower levels. Finding diamonds is more of a game of luck than anything else, and patience is the most important thing to have when mining for them.


If you are lazy and don't want to do this much work, set off some TNT or craft the Wither. But it's best to go into Survival Mode before setting of any explosives. Also, using explosives can shorten your time mining but you might destroy some valuable ores like gold ores or the diamond ores you came for.(The Wither destroys any blocks in its way.)

, There are a couple of different ways to obtain food in Minecraft:, No matter where you start in the game, you'll be within a short distance of animals or oak trees.

Kill an animal and pick up its dropped items. You can kill an animal by repeatedly tapping it so that it flashes red.
Only oak and dark oak trees drop apples. None of the other trees yield edible items.

, Especially early on in a game, your best bet is either to find a pig, a sheep, or a chicken and repeatedly tap it until it dies, or to find an oak tree and remove all of its leaves. You can remove leaves by tapping and holding a chunk of them until the circle around your finger completely fills up. This should (rarely) drop apples.

Foods to avoid include rotten flesh (from killing zombies) and spider eyes (from killing spiders), since these items will poison you.
You don't need any tools for these steps.

, You can do so by tapping its icon in the hotbar at the bottom of the screen, or you can select it from your inventory by tapping … on the far-right side of the hotbar and then tapping it in your inventory., Your character will move the food toward their face, and after a few seconds, the food will disappear. You will also gain some of your hunger bar back.

Remember, you can only eat food when your hunger bar, which is in the top-right corner of the screen, is at less than 100 percent; otherwise, your food will simply act as a tool with which to hit blocks.

, To cook food, you'll need a furnace, wood or coal, and a piece of meat or potatoes. Furnaces require a crafting table for their construction, as well as eight pieces of cobblestone.

To create a crafting table, chop one block of wood.
To mine cobblestone, you'll need at least a wooden pickaxe.
Chop an extra block of wood for the furnace's fuel. This will cook one item. Alternatively, chop two extra blocks of wood: cook one to make charcoal. Charcoal will cook 8 items.

, It's on the far-right side of your hotbar at the bottom of the screen., You'll find this option on the left side of the screen, just above the tab in the bottom-left corner., The 4 x button is on the right side of the screen, and it has the wooden crate's icon to its right. This will convert your one block of wood into four wooden crates., It resembles the tab you're currently using. This will create a crafting table., Doing so will place it in your hand.

If the table isn't in the hotbar, tap … twice, then tap the crafting table icon.

Input - This is where your food goes.

Fuel - You'll place your wood here.

Result - The cooked food will appear here.

, Doing so will place it in the ""Input"" box., This will place the wood in the oven, thereby starting the cooking process., Once an item appears in the ""Result"" box, your food is done., This will add it back into your inventory., You can do so by tapping its icon in the hotbar at the bottom of the screen, or you can select it from your inventory by tapping … on the far-right side of the hotbar and then tapping it in your inventory., Your character will move the food toward their face, and after a few seconds, the food will disappear. You will also gain some of your hunger bar back.

Remember, you can only eat food when your hunger bar, which is in the top-right corner of the screen, is at less than 100 percent; otherwise, your food will simply act as a tool with which to hit blocks.

, To find coal look around at surrounding cliff or mountain sides and see if there are any blocks with small black rectangles in them. If so go up to it and hold down your mouse button to mine the coal block. Coal is commonly found in caves.

, Iron is commonly found in caves, you can either look for a cave or mine a staircase into the ground and keep a careful look around. If you see any blocks with pale yellow rectangles in it. Iron can sometimes be found close to the surface.

, Redstone is found deep in the ground as blocks with red rectangles. Mining redstone requires an iron or higher tier pickaxe .

, Gold is found in underground and in caves as blocks with bright yellow stripes. Mining gold requires an iron or higher tier pickaxe.

, Diamonds are found in the deepest layers underground, layers 2 to 16. Mining diamonds requires an iron or higher tiered pickaxe. To find diamonds, get to layer 10, 11 or 12. From there, dig out a branching mine of 2 block high and 1 block wide tunnels in all directions.

For one, there are no enemies in the PocketMine world, as there is no AI to control them. Also, as of this writing in October 2016, PocketMine only supports MCPE 0.14.0, which means you'll need to downgrade your app if you keep it up to date., PocketMine is a Minecraft PE dedicated server that you can run from Windows or macOS. PocketMine is not affiliated with Mojang. It doesn't support all features of Minecraft PE; most notably there is no enemy AI.

Type curl -sL http://get.pocketmine.net/ | bash and press ⏎ Return. This will install PocketMine. Keep the Terminal open for now.

, You'll need this file to support the most recent possible version of Minecraft PE. As of this writing in October 2016, PocketMine supports MCPE v.0.14.0.

Visit bintray.com/pocketmine/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP-phar/view#files

Download the last file in the list, which will be the newest one.
Rename the downloaded file to PocketMine-MP.phar and place it in the server folder. Confirm that you want to override the original.

, You'll need to update the PHP files in the PocketMine folder to PHP7 so that the server can run properly.Download the PHP7 Windows files from https://bintray.com/pocketmine/PocketMine/Windows-PHP-Binaries#files

Download the PHP7 Mac files from https://bintray.com/pocketmine/PocketMine/Unix-PHP-Binaries#files

Extract the files using 7-Zip, which you can install from 7-zip.org

Replace the /PocketMine-MP/bin/php/ folder on your computer with the ""php"" folder from the extracted file.

, Now that you have the latest PHAR and PHP files, you can start your server up for the first time.

Windows - Double-click the start.cmd file in the PocketMine-MP directory.
Mac - Type ./start.sh in the Terminal window.

, Once the server starts for the first time, you'll be prompted to select the language you want to use for the server. Type the code for the language you want to use., You'll need to type y to accept the license for PocketMine., Type y to skip the set-up wizard. You can go back and change your server settings later on, but for now you can just get the server up and running., Windows may prompt you to allow PocketMine through the firewall. Click ""Allow access"" so that others can connect to it., You'll need this address to connect to the server from Android and iOS devices that are on the same network. You'll also need to know the IP if you decide to open ports and make the server accessible from the internet.

Windows - Press ⊞ Win+r and type cmd to launch the Command Prompt. Type ipconfig and press ↵ Enter. Find your active network connection and note the IPv4 Address.
Mac - Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences."" Click the ""Network"" option and then select your active connection. Find the ""IP Address"" line and note the address.

, You'll need to be running the same version of Minecraft PE on the device as the server. As of this writing in October 2016, the server only supports 0.14.0, while the app is on version 0.15.10. Downgrading on Android is fairly straightforward, but is not possible on an iOS device unless it is jailbroken.

Android - Uninstall the MCPE app on your device. Open the Settings app and select ""Security"" Tap ""Unknown sources"" and then enable it. Perform a web search for ""mcpe 0.14.0 apk"" and then find a trustworthy source to download the file. After downloading the APK file, run it from your Download folder to install the old version.
Jailbroken iOS - Open Cydia on your jailbroken iOS device. Search for ""App Admin"" in Cydia and install it. Open the Minecraft PE page in the Apple App Store after installing App Admin. Tap the Update/Open/Download button and then select ""0.14.0"" from the list of available versions., The Android or iOS device running Minecraft PE will need to be connected to the same wireless network as the computer running the server., You'll see your new server appear automatically in the list. It will have a green dot next to it.

If you don't see your server, you're either not on the same network or not running the same version of MCPE as the server is.

, In order for players not on your network to connect to your server, you'll need to forward a port on your router to allow outside connections to the server.

Open your router's configuration page and log in. The process for this will vary depending on your router. See Access a Router for details.
Open the Port Forwarding section of your router's configuration. Again, the location and wording will vary by router. See Set Up Port Forwarding on a Router for details.
Create a new rule forwarding TCP port 19132 for your server's local IP address. This will open the port that Minecraft PE uses to connect to the server.

, This is the address for your network on the internet. You'll give this to players that you want to connect to your server. The quickest way to find the address is to perform a Google search for ""my ip"" on your server computer., Now that you know the public IP address and your port is open, other players can connect to the server. Remember, they'll need to be running the same version of MCPE as the server (0.14.0 at the time of this writing in October 2016).

Start Minecraft PE and tap the ""Play"" button.
Tap ""New"" in the upper-right corner.

, This button is near the top of the screen., It's near the top of the screen., This option is on the right side of the screen, and will likely display ""Survival""., This will set your world mode to ""Creative"" where you'll have unlimited resources and be able to fly., It's on the left side of the screen. Doing so will create a new game in Creative mode, wherein you can begin to create your hotel.

You may first want to review the rest of the options below the ""Default Game Mode"" section, such as the game's difficulty or the world type.

, It's on the far-right side of the toolbar that's at the bottom of the screen. In Creative mode, this button opens the item selection menu., This will select it. Keep in mind that you'll be replacing the selected item, so only select something with which you don't want to build., This will add it to your hotbar in place of the currently selected item.

For example, you might equip a type of stone instead of a sapling.
Repeat this process for as many building materials as you need.

, It's on the right side of the screen, just above the tab you're currently on (which is in the bottom-right corner of the screen). This is where you'll find decorative building materials (e.g., glass) as well as non-building items like pictures.

Don't forget to first select an item in your hotbar that needs replacing.

, It will replace a currently selected item in your hotbar.

Repeat this process until you have everything you need in your hotbar. You may need to switch items out as you build.

, It's in the top-left corner of the screen. This will close the menu, allowing you to proceed with creating your hotel., You should start at around twenty blocks by twenty blocks, since this size will allow for several spacious rooms and a hall for each floor of your hotel., To do so, double-tap the button on the right side of the screen.

You can use the up and down arrows that appear here to raise or lower your character's altitude.
To exit flight mode, double-tap the footprint between the two arrows.

, Ideally, you'll find a flat, open, twenty-by-twenty (or larger) space, but if you want to build in the middle of a forest or right by a lake, you'll likely have to clear out some items before you begin building., This process will definitely vary based on your chosen biome; however, there are a few things you'll likely need to do for most locations:

Add or remove blocks to make sure your building area is level. You can remove blocks here by tapping and holding them briefly; unlike in Survival, blocks will require only one hit to remove them.
Remove trees, brush, and/or existing structures.
Fill in water areas with stone or dirt.

, You'll later fill in this area with your hotel's ground floor building material (e.g., cobblestone or wood).

For example, using a twenty-by-twenty area means you'll mine out 400 blocks.

, Do so by tapping it in your hotbar., This is a relatively simple, if tedious, task: to do so, fill in the entire foundation area with your hotel's floor's building material.

For example, if your cleared area is the aforementioned twenty-by-twenty space, you'll place 400 blocks of your selected building material here.
It's best to first fill in the perimeter so that you don't accidentally stray outside of the boundaries of your hotel's foundation.

, The ideal number of blocks between the floor and the ceiling is at least four., Each column should be as tall as you're hoping to make the hotel. To calculate this number:

Take the height in blocks you want each room to be, plus one block for the ceiling/floor of the subsequent room.
Multiply the height in blocks by the number of stories you want.
Discount the layer of blocks that comprises your hotel's foundation.

, The easiest way to do this is by creating horizontal beams that connect all of your hotel's columns, then filling in the horizontal space for each beam. You're essentially re-creating the foundation on each story.

Be sure to leave several spaces for your hotel's stairs to connect each floor.

, While optional, doing this will complete the building's skeleton.

Make sure you leave the walls facing out of the hotel open, since you won't have enough light with which to work if you don't.

, It's best to start with the second floor or up, since the first floor will likely differ in appearance from the subsequent floors., The hallway should be a minimum of two blocks wide. To get a feel for how spacious the rooms will be with the hallways in place, add two parallel rows of blocks where the hallway walls will be, then review the space between the inside of a row of blocks and the hotel's outer wall.

If you have less than four blocks of depth in a room, you may want to either narrow your hall or expand your hotel.
If your hotel is an odd number of blocks wide, your hallways will need to be at least three blocks wide.

, These walls should run perpendicular to both the hall walls and the walls opposite of them. As with the hall walls, feel free to lay down a one-block-high wall to see what the walls will look like in practice before committing to building an entire wall.

This is a process you'll complete for each floor.
Consider varying room size, since a real hotel would do the same.

, The way to do this will vary based on your hotel design thus far. You have a couple of options:

Place a staircase in a hallway that branches off from the main hallways.
Alternate staircases between each end of the hallways for subsequent floors.
You can select stairs from the building materials tab in the ... menu.

, You'll need two blocks' worth of vertical space for one door, though you'll need a four-by-four space if you're planning on adding double-doors., You can add the bed to your hotbar from the items tab. To add a bed to an area, simply look at the ground and tap it while the bed is selected.

Beds require two free spaces to place.
In some cases, you may want to add multiple beds.

, Again, you'll find the door item inside of the items tab of the ... menu., To create a sign, you'll add it to your hotbar, place it in front of the room in question, and then tap it to edit the text that appears on it., This is a stylistic choice, but adding things like paintings, plants, bookcases, and chests will lend a homey touch to each individual room.

If you do decorate your rooms, try to vary the style a bit between rooms so that each room is unique.

, This process will vary based on your own preferences; for example, you may want to create a row of rooms at the back of the lobby and have a simple desk up front, or you could replace all of the walls in the lobby with glass and place a pool in the middle of the room., As you build, you'll likely have new or better ideas about room placement, decoration, or any one of innumerable aspects of your hotel. Feel free to change or add onto your hotel as you go."

Take the elytra from the item frame.,
Jump in mid air to glide.",How to Fly in Minecraft and Minecraft Pocket Edition1," The only way to fly in Survival Mode without cheats is to use a pair of wings called ""elytra."" You'll need plenty of equipment and resources to find these wings, as they are only available in the End, the final zone of the game. Read this guide for instructions and advice on how to find and defeat the Ender Dragon.


Elytra were added in Computer Edition official release 1.9, Pocket Edition official release 1.0, and Console Edition in the December 2016 update. If you are playing on an old Console world, select More Options from the world select menu and choose Reset End to get the new version with Elytra.;
, Defeating the Ender Dragon activates two portals. The one in the center, with a dragon's egg on top, is the end portal. Walking through it will give you an achievement and return you to the overworld. To explore the rest of the End zone, look for the other portal. This one is near the edge of the island, too small to walk through, and usually floating high in the air.If you walk through the end portal, you can return to the End zone using the same portal you used the first time.

, Since the gateway is too small to walk through, you'll need an Ender Pearl to teleport through to the other side. This will take you to one of the other islands in the End zone.

, End Cities are tall towers or groups of towers made from yellow and purple blocks. You may need to explore the End zone for a fairly long time before you find one., Each End City has a small chance to include an End Ship floating nearby. Walk into the cabin of the ship and defeat the shulker guarding the treasure.Throwing another ender pearl is the fastest way to reach the ship. Some ships have a nearby walkway where you can stand to throw the pearl.
The End City itself has treasure, but never an elytra.

, Break the item frame behind the treasure chest, and a pair of ""elytra"" (beetle wing cases) will drop onto the floor. Pick these up and equip them to your chest slot.

, With the elytra equipped, you can press the jump button in mid-air to start gliding. You will fall very slowly, and move forward as you do.


You can press up to rise higher, but if you do this too sharply, you will stall and start to fall faster.You can still take falling damage if you are moving too fast when you hit the ground.

",How to Flourish on a Minecraft PVP Server," The more the better! Every trustful ally you have increases your chances of surviving and getting rich.;
, You could be a miner. Friend 1 could be a hunter. Friend 2 could be a builder and so on. This way you will get precious items faster, especially if you are well organised. If you are alone, though, make sure you schedule your day like this: 1. Build a house. 2. Find food. 3. Go mining. 4. Make a bed. Try to get allies as fast as you can - joining a faction is a good way to do this.

, If you see a guy weaker than you attack him. If you see some pro with a diamond set either run away or call your friends for backup and ambush him. Know your capabilities or you'll be killed like a fly.

, Give your friends what you have and don't be shy to ask them for anything. Having a collective chest for everyone to use is a good idea.

, Trading is the best way to get in-game money/rare items. You mined tons of gold and you don't need it? Exchange it for some diamonds, which you always need! Most severs have a PVP free market to trade but if there's none the spawn is always an option! Advertise yourself in the chat but don't spam because you'll probably get kicked.

, Griefing is always legit in PVP servers and it's a good way to gets some easy items. Homes with valuable items are always strongly protected, though and sometimes they have faction protection. The only way to get items from them is with TNT (As long the faction officer forgot to protect the claimed land from explosions).

, A common way to do it is to live underground but it's certainly not the most secure. If the server has factions they are the best way to do it. 1st Make a faction with /f create . Next make a description with /f desc (description). Invite all your friends and allies with /f invite (their name) and /f officer (their name). Last but not least make sure to type /f (desc) peaceful and /f (desc) no boom. The last two could vary, so be sue to ask an admin if they don't work. You could also enter /f auto-claim to claim land for your faction automatically. if this faction thingy is too complicate for you just make it impenetrable with secret rooms, traps, and giant walls. It's certainly not that secure but it's a lot more awesome.

Make a fishing rod.,
Consider enchanting the rod.,
Look for a rainy area if possible.,
Break everything directly over the block of water.,
Find water.,
Use the rod on the water.,
Watch for small splashes.,
Pick up the item.",How to Fish in Minecraft," You'll need three sticks and two pieces of string. Place the sticks in a diagonal line. Place the strings in a vertical line, underneath the sticks.;
, There are three enchantments that enhance a fishing rod. Unbreaking increases durability, Lure speeds up fishing, and Luck of the Sea increases the chance of getting treasure instead of junk.Unbreakable is much more common than the other two. Your chance of getting either Lure or Luck of the Sea is about 35% at level 15, and about 53% at level 30., If it's raining over your fishing bobber, it takes about 20% less time to catch something. Unless your rod has Lure, this means you'll catch something every 20 seconds on average, instead of every 25.Rain falls in all temperate biomes at once.As long as you've checked one forest, swamp, or plains, you know whether or not it's raining anywhere.
If cheats are enabled, enter /weather rain to start a downpour., Once you've chosen a spot to fish in, break all blocks directly above it. If anything blocks sunlight or moonlight from hitting the water, fishing will take twice as long. Anything non-transparent (including leaves) will block light, and anything that blocks movement will block rain., It doesn't matter which body of water you fish in. You can even dig a hole and pour a bucket of water in it. It does help to make the hole at least two blocks wide and two deep, so it's easier to cast the line without hitting a solid block., Equip the fishing rod and use it on the water (right-click on the computer edition). The string will fly out with a bobber attached to the end of it.


The bobber can hook onto objects and mobs, so watch your aim.

, Initially the bobber will sink, then it will rise to the surface of the water. Watch and listen closely. When you see small splashes around the bobber and hear a splashing noise, immediately use the fishing rod again to reel in the catch. If successful, a fish or other item will fly out of the water and land near your character, along with an experience orb.You will not see the splashes if particle effects are set to ""minimal"" in your settings.
If you miss your chance, the fish will escape. You can leave the bobber in the water to try again.

, If the item doesn't land nearby, look around. If it hit a solid block when reeled in, it could be off at a right angle somewhere. Here's your chance of getting each type of item with an unenchanted fishing rod:85% chance of fish. This is usually just the ""raw fish"" item, but you can also get salmon, clownfish, and pufferfish. Careful: pufferfish are poisonous.
10% chance of junk. These are miscellaneous items like damaged leather boots, tripwire hooks, or ink sacs.
5% chance of treasure. There are six possibilities, all equally likely: a damaged, enchanted bow; a damaged, enchanted fishing rod; an enchanted book; a name tag; a saddle; or a lily pad.
The items are the same on all editions, but the percentages are only confirmed for Computer Edition.

Keep track of your landmarks.,
Track the position of the sun.,
Keep track of your route while mining.,
Build paths along common routes.",How to Find Your Way to Your House when Lost in Minecraft1," The most surefire way of keeping track of your surroundings is to use a map, but this can be resource-intensive. Craft a map by placing a compass in the center of a crafting table, with paper surrounding it. Use the map while you are at your house, and it will begin to fill out the surrounding area with your house at the exact center.


On console versions of Minecraft, one map may be able to cover the entire world. On PC versions, the world is infinite, and long expeditions may require keeping many maps in your inventory and keeping track of which one is which.;
, To create a larger scale map, place your map at the center of a crafting table and surround it with paper. This will result in a larger-scale map centered on your current location., On short expeditions to gather materials, carry around a stack of dirt or other mostly useless material. Every few steps, drop a block of dirt. On your way back, follow the line of objects back to your base.


You can also mark your tracks with torches so when you go back you can follow the torches with ease.

, On longer expeditions, build high towers that are easily visible from each other. One of the fastest ways to do this is to look straight down at the ground beneath you, jump, and place a block under your feet. Repeat quickly until you are at the top of a tall tower. Use torches, glowstones, or beacons to make your landmarks visible at night.


Make sure that each tower is visible from the last one.
Be careful coming down from your tower. If you do not want to build a large number of ladders, you may need to step off the tower and stop your fall several times with blocks of dirt on the way down. This can be dangerous if you ""misclick"".

, On your way back, you might want to destroy your landmarks so you don't get confused on a later expedition. Alternatively, make an arrow shape with any material next to your landmarks, pointing in the direction of your house.

, The sun always rises in the same direction and sets in the opposite direction. When setting out on an above-ground expedition, note which way you are walking in relation to sunrise or sunset.


If you can't see the sun, plant sunflowers, which always face the sun's current position.

, While you're underground, put torches on one side of the wall only. For instance, if the torches are all on the right side going in, you'll know you're returning home when the torches are on your left side.


You can also use wooden signposts with more detailed information, or use dyed wool as a code. For example, red wool could mean ""lava this way"" and blue wool could mean ""toward the exit.""
If you are completely lost, you can dig straight up to the surface and look for landmarks. This is risky, since gravel or lava above you could kill your character.

, If you often journey between two locations, build a path to follow out of torches, walkways, fences, or another obvious marker. As you develop your world more, you might want to build powered railways with mine carts for traveling long distances, or create a series of outposts along the road to rest in at night.


For quick travel between extremely long distances, you can build a road through the Nether. If you built a Nether portal near your house, build a portal where you are, then search for your old portal in the Nether.

If necessary, destroy your beds and kill your character again.,
Use coordinates to track down your items.",How to Find Your Way to Your House when Lost in Minecraft2," Press F3 at the top of your keyboard while you are in your Minecraft game. Text should appear displaying your coordinates. The X and Y coordinates describe your North-South and East-West location, and the Z coordinate describes your depth or height above sea level. Notice how your coordinates change as you walk around.


On an Apple computer, you may need to press fn and F3 at the same time. The fn key is on the lower left of most Apple keyboards.

, Write down your X and Y coordinates, or take a screenshot while they are displayed. If you are at your house, keep track of these so you can always use the coordinate display to find your way back. If you are already lost, write down your current coordinates anyway, and use the following method to suicide your way back home without losing your items.


This method does not work in Hardcore mode, which deletes your world when your character dies.

, If you have any items you don't want to lose when you die, build a chest and place them inside it. In a single-player world, it's a good idea to keep your chest in a visible location, such as at the top of a tower. If you are playing with monsters on, you might want to protect your chest from exploding Creepers by building a protective shell around it.


If you have an ""ender chest,"" you can access your belongings inside it from any other ender chest in the world, without having to travel to the other chest's location.
Alternatively, if cheats are enabled, press T to open the chat window, and type /gamerule keepInventory true into the cheat box. This should keep your items in your inventory after you die, which saves you the trouble of having to track down your items again.

, Jump from a tall location, let a monster kill you, or use any other method to kill your character. When your character dies, he will respawn at the last bed you rested in, but without any items. If you do not have a bed, or if all your beds have been moved, destroyed, or covered by another object, you will appear in the world spawn location instead, where you first appeared when you entered this world.

, If you do not recognize your respawn point, destroy the bed you appeared next to and kill your character a second time. If there is still a bed in your house, you will eventually appear next to it.


If you appear next to the world spawn point instead of a bed, and your house is not nearby, you may need to use a map or cheats to find your house again, or build a new house.

, Press F3 again to display your coordinates, and write these down as your house coordinates. Watch the x and y coordinates change as you walk around, and walk in a direction that causes them to approach the coordinates of the chest that contains your items.


Here's a simplified example. Say the coordinates of your house are x-50 y-100 and the coordinates of your chest are x-50 y-300. Walk around until you find the direction that keeps the x coordinate unchanged (near x-50), and causes the y-coordinate to increase, towards 300.
Finding your way back should be much easier now that you know the coordinates of your house.

Use this method to find your original spawn point.,
Acquire iron and redstone.,
Smelt four iron ingots.,
Craft a compass.,
Equip the compass and follow the needle.",How to Find Your Way to Your House when Lost in Minecraft3," Each Minecraft world has a world spawn point, where new players appear. Compasses only point to this location, which may be helpful if you built your base near where you first appeared. They will not point to your individual spawn point, which is the last bed you rested in.


See the other methods if you are trying to find a house far away from the world spawn point.

, To make a compass, you'll need four iron ingots and one redstone. Using an stone pickaxe or better for iron, or a iron pickaxe or better for redstone, you can obtain the raw ingredients. Redstone ore looks like a stone block with red flecks, and is found deep underground, less than 16 blocks above the bedrock.Iron ore has beige flecks instead, and is usually fairly easy to find.


You can also find redstone by killing witches, trading with villagers, or looting jungle temples.

, Build a furnace and click on it to begin smelting. Add any type of fuel, such as coal or wood, to the lower box, and put the iron ore in the top box. This will smelt the iron ore into iron ingots.

, Click on a crafting table and place a piece of redstone into the center box. Place the four iron ingots above, below, to the left, and to the right of the redstone. A compass should appear in the results box. Drag it to your inventory.


If you want to save materials, you can look at the compass needle, then take the ingredients back into your inventory instead of the compass. The compass needle in the icon will point toward the spawn point, just as it does when equipped. It can be tedious trying to use a compass this way on a long trip, however.

, Hold the compass, and you should see a larger image of the compass appear in your character's hand. The compass needle will point toward the world spawn point, and will change direction as you do. Walk in the direction the compass is pointing until you find an area you recognize.

On newer Mac computers, you'll need to press Alt+Fn+F3.

, You'll see a lot of information on the debug readout. Simple coordinates are labeled ""Block,"" while the detailed coordinates are labeled ""XYZ."" You'll also see a ""Facing"" entry which will tell you which direction you are currently facing.

, Your location is determined based off of the starting block for your Minecraft world. The ""Block"" entry displays the three coordinate numbers (XYZ) without labels.


""X"" is your location to the east or west of your starting block (longitude).
""Y"" is your location above or below the starting block (elevation).
""Z"" is your location to the north or south of your starting block (latitude).

, This will help you grasp how the coordinate system works. If the ""X"" value is negative, you're to the west of the starting block. If the ""Z"" value is negative, you're north of your starting block.


While you typically start at X,Z:0,0 (unless that block is in the water), your starting location's Y value will typically be around 63, since this is the sea level.

Wait for slimes to spawn.",How to Find Slimes in Minecraft," Swamp biomes are characterized by dark trees and grass, vines hanging from trees, and numerous bodies of water. You'll usually find them in ravines or as an extension of a forest biome.;
, Swamps are generally flatter than most other biomes, but you'll typically want to find a flat, wide area within the swamp.

, On Mac and PC, you can do this by pressing the F3 key; after doing so, you'll see a bunch of white lines of text pop up in the top-left side of the screen.


On the console and PE versions of Minecraft, you'll need to open a map to view the ""Y"" coordinate.

, When in a swamp area, slimes will appear between the 50th layer and the 70th layer.


For reference, sea level is at the 65th layer.

, The light level of your chosen area must be seven or less. You can create an artificially dark area by covering a section of the swamp's canopy with a dirt block ceiling and walls, or you can just find an area with a low enough light level.


You can view the light level by looking for the ""rl"" value in the second-to-last line of text when you have the coordinates view enabled.

, Slimes require two and a half blocks of vertical space to spawn, so you may need to clear out some foliage, which may in turn raise the light level.

, Slimes won't spawn if a player is within 24 blocks of the spawn area, and they will de-spawn if a player is 32 or more blocks away.

, Slimes spawn most frequently during a full moon, so you may want to build a small shack with a bed nearby and wait for the full moon part of the cycle.


Slimes will never spawn during a new moon.

, By creating several platforms with at least three blocks of vertical space between them, you can increase the number of surfaces on which slimes can spawn.


If you do this, make sure that all of the platforms fall within the 50- to 70-layer range.

, If you aren't able to prompt slimes to spawn in a swamp biome, you may have more luck underground. Slimes spawn in caves located in ""slime chunks"", which are 16 x 16 x 16 block areas.


You have a one in ten chance of coming across a slime chunk.

, When below layer 40, slimes can spawn in any light situation; adding torches will both make mining easier and prevent other hostile mobs from appearing.

, This constitutes a chunk. Slimes won't start spawning immediately while you're here, but you may be able to force them to do so by adding platforms.

, These platforms should be stacked on top of each other with three blocks of vertical space between each. Having these platforms increases the possible spawn area for slimes.

, As with the swamp biome, slimes won't spawn if you're 24 blocks (or closer) away from the spawn area.

, If you don't see any slimes within a standard night and day cycle, you'll need to find a new cave.

To make a Nether Portal, place obsidian blocks in a rectangle four blocks wide and five blocks high, skipping the corners and interior of the rectangle. Activate the lower obsidian blocks with a flint and steel.

The Nether is a dangerous area. Prepare yourself with high quality food and equipment.
;
, Blazes are yellow, floating monsters surrounded by smoke. They are only found in Nether fortresses — structures supported by pillars over a lava ocean. Defeat blazes and collect the blaze rods they drop. You'll usually need at least five blaze rods to find and activate the end portal, and it often takes seven or more.

It's much easier to find Nether fortresses if you travel along the x-axis (east or west).Killing blazes is difficult, and the rods only drop if you kill them directly or with a tamed wolf. It helps to have an enchanted bow, or plenty of snowballs (it takes seven to kill one blaze)., Endermen are the black, tentacled mobs that only attack when you look at them. If you don't have plenty of ender pearls yet, kill Endermen until you do. You'll need two ender pearls for each blaze rod.

Endermen are more common in the Overworld (the regular Minecraft map) than in the Nether.


, Eyes of ender have the ability to locate end portals, and to activate them. You'll usually need at least nine eyes of ender for this, often more. Craft them using these recipes:

Place a blaze rod in the crafting area to turn it into two blaze powders.

Place a blaze powder and an ender pearl anywhere in the crafting area to make an eye of ender.


, Equip the eye of ender and use it. It will float up into the air, then travel a short distance horizontally in the direction of the nearest stronghold. (All end portals are found inside strongholds.)

In the Computer version of Minecraft, the closest strongholds are at least 1408 blocks away from the world's origin point.Get to at least this distance before using any eyes of ender.


, Each eye of ender has a 20% chance of breaking each time you use it. The other 80% of the time, you can pick it up from where it fell., Strongholds are very far apart in the Computer and Pocket editions, and there is only one in the entire world in Console edition. To avoid wasting eyes of ender, walk at least five hundred blocks before using an eye again.

Try to walk in the straightest line possible. If you keep your cursor on the eye as it floats, the direction you're pointed in should be perfect. Check your coordinates and keep the Facing as steady as you can.


, If the eye travels down to the ground, you are close to an underground stronghold. If the eye floats back the way you came, you passed the stronghold already.
, Dig a staircase down until you find a room in the stronghold. The eye of ender just points to the stronghold, not the end portal.You might not see what you're looking for yet, but you're close.
, Every stronghold has one portal room, with a staircase leading to a platform over a pool of lava. The end portal is on top of the platform, with a border of green squares. Be prepared to fight silverfish on the stairway.

Strongholds can have many rooms, and they are not necessarily all connected.If you only find dead ends, dig around the surrounding area to find more rooms. It can take a long time to find the portal room.

There's a small chance that another structure (such as a mineshaft) breaks into the portal room. If it interrupts the portal, that portal is not usable. On a PC, you can find another stronghold. On a Console, there is only one stronghold per world, so you can't reach the End without cheats.


, Unless you're very lucky, the portal won't be active when you first find it. To activate it, put an eye of ender into each of the twelve green squares (ender portal frames) around the portal. The portal usually spawns with a couple eyes of ender already attached, so you usually don't need to make all twelve yourself.
, When you place the last eye of ender in the portal, a starry black portal will appear. Jump into this when you're ready to enter the End and fight the Ender Dragon.
, Press F3 on the computer, or equip and use a map on the console. Locate the x, z, and Facing values on the number overlay.

On some Mac computers, you'll need to press Fn+F3, or ⌥ Option+Fn+F3.


, Move your cursor to the point where the eye hovers. Write down the x, z, and Facing values on your screen. The x- and z-coordinates describe your position on the map, and Facing tells you the direction you are looking. You only need the first number listed after Facing, not the second.
, Travel two or three hundred blocks away from your last position. Do not walk in the direction the eye traveled, or directly opposite it. Use an eye of ender again, move your cursor over the point where it hovers, and write down a new set of x, z, and Facing values.
, The information you wrote down describes two lines on your Minecraft map, each pointing to the stronghold. Finding the intersection of the lines takes some trigonometry, but there are several online tools that will do the math for you. Try this one, or search online for ""minecraft stronghold locator."" The tool should give you the x and z coordinates of the nearest stronghold.

Since the Computer edition has many strongholds, there's a small chance that the two eyes were pointing to different ones. This is unlikely as long as the two points were less than a few hundred blocks away from each other.


, If you can't find an online tool, you can calculate the coordinates using these formulas:Label one group of coordinates X0,  Z0, and F0 and the other group X1, Z1, and F1.

If F0 > -90, add 90 to get DEG0. If F0 < -90, add 450 instead. Repeat with F1 to get DEG1. This sets the f-values to between 0 and 360 degrees.

Use a calculator to find S0=tan⁡(DEG0){\displaystyle S_{0}=\tan(DEG_{0})} and S1=tan⁡(DEG1){\displaystyle S_{1}=\tan(DEG_{1})}. Set the calculator to degrees, not radians.

The x-coordinate of the stronghold XS{\displaystyle X_{S}} is Z1−Z0+S0X0−S1X1S0−S1{\displaystyle {\frac {Z_{1}-Z_{0}+S_{0}X_{0}-S_{1}X_{1}}{S_{0}-S_{1}}}}.

The z-coordinate of the stronghold is S0XS+Z0−S0X0{\displaystyle S_{0}X_{S}+Z_{0}-S_{0}X_{0}}.


, Each Minecraft world has a string of letters and numbers called a ""seed."" This determines the whole terrain layout, including the stronghold locations. Locate and copy (or write down) this string:

Computer edition: Type /seed. If commands are not enabled, turn them on first using Esc → Open to LAN → Allow Cheats → Start LAN World.

Console edition: Go to the select world menu and look for the seed next to your world. (If it isn't listed there, you may need to download a seed finding tool.)

Pocket Edition: Go to the main menu. Hit Play, then Edit. The seed appears underneath each world name., Create a new world set to Creative mode. On the world creation screen, enter the seed exactly as it appears. (Click More World Options first in the Computer edition.)

Select the same world type as your main world.


, Since you're in Creative mode, you can put unlimited eyes of ender in your inventory. Use them and fly in the direction they're moving until you reach a stronghold.
, Since you used the same world seed, your Survival world should have a stronghold in exactly the same coordinates.On the computer, press F3 to view your coordinates. On some Mac computers, press Fn+F3, or ⌥ Option+Fn+F3 instead.

On a console, use a map item to find your coordinates.

On Pocket Edition, the easiest method is to use a third-party program.

Watch the coordinates change as you move.",How to Find Your Coordinates in Minecraft2," In the console versions of Minecraft (Xbox, PlayStation, Wii U), you can find your coordinates on your map. All players start with a map when a new world is created. Open your map in your inventory.

, Your current coordinates will appear at the top of the map while you have it open. There are three coordinates: X, Y, and Z.

, The coordinates are based off of block you first spawned on. ""X"" is your longitude; your location east or west of the starting block. Z is your location north or south of the starting block. This is your latitude. Y is your current elevation above bedrock.


Your starting block will usually be X,Z:0,0. If 0,0 would be underwater, your starting block will be nearby.
Your starting Y coordinate will vary depending on the height you spawn at. Sea level is Y:63.

, You can see the coordinates change in real time as you move through the world. If the ""X"" value is positive, you are east of the starting block. If the ""Z"" value is positive, you're south of your starting block.

, At first glance, this map may seem like a small, barren survival island. However, if you go down into the cave opening in one corner of the map, you'll eventually find a large cave full of lava, mineral wealth, and monsters to explore. Watch your step when mining near lava pools.Tip: Use the trees on the neighboring island to make your first tools.

, This world is truly a sight to behold. You start near a mountain that's so enormous that it goes through the clouds. Scaling this massive peak is a fun challenge in survival mode, but watch out for the waterfalls and lava flows!Tip: For an even greater challenge, try carefully building your way up to the various floating islands next to the mountain.

, This world makes it a cinch to get high-level resources and goods right off the bat. With several villages and two temples within a reasonable distance of the spawn, it's not hard to accumulate a good starting package of loot within the first few minutes.

Try ""dqdd"" for a spiky ice landscape.,
Try ""AUS"" for a lush jungle.,
Try ""grouper"" for a massive underground mine.",How to Find Unique Seeds on Minecraft2," This striking seed starts you near a set of villages built around (and on top of) a steep savannah cliff. With amazing visuals, decent loot, and lots of easily-fortifiable positions to explore, some internet commentators are calling this one of the best PE seeds of all time.Tip: Try exploring beneath the villages' wells to find dangerous strongholds full of surprises — including a well-hidden end portal.

, This frozen world has plenty of snow-capped forests, but the real attraction is the collection of massive ice spikes a short journey away from the spawn point. To get to the ice spikes, fly or walk past the low-ish hills to your right when you spawn. When you see what look like giant, upside-down icicles, you're in the right spot., This spawn starts you in a thick, deep jungle not far from a set of gorgeous beaches. Explore the jungle's darkest depths, using the ample supply of wood to get a head-start on building your base, or just chill out by the water — it's up to you!Tip: Directly beneath the spawn point is a mineshaft with coal and iron ore.

, Want to do some serious subterranean exploring right away? Try loading up this world and digging directly down below the spawn — you'll find a deep, expansive mineshaft. Whatever loot lies within the deepest depths of the underground complex is unknown. If you think you have what it takes to map out this vast cavern, you may be the first to find out!Tip: It's a good idea to mark the spawn point, then craft yourself a few basic tools, weapons, and torches before starting to explore.

Try ""pearljam"" for a rich, varied world.,
Try ""Grasslands"" for villages and fungal zones.,
Try ""-772097003"" for a varied desert landscape.",How to Find Unique Seeds on Minecraft3," One of the most famous, best-reviewed seeds for the PS3 is, oddly enough, named after the popular alt-rock group. This world has it all: multiple biomes, several temples, various scattered villages, mineral wealth, and even a few libraries. With this and so much more to find, this seed makes a great all-around choice for any game mode., This seed spawns you next to a set of standard villages. The catch? They are right next door to two fungal biomes, giving you a chance to see giant mushrooms and more up-close.



Tip: One of the villages has a diamond in it — a rarity in the early game.

, This huge world contains an impressive desert and much more: numerous villages (some with blacksmiths and diamonds), a few surface dungeons and desert temples, and even a set of mob spawners. If you're willing to explore, you can find other biomes as well.

, This seed spawns you near a basic village not far from a deep, deep canyon. Finding a way to climb safely down can be an interesting challenge, but if you get frustrated, just take a leap down into one of the pools of water at the bottom, which should break your fall.Tip: If you jump into the ravine, make sure you have the resources to get back out!


, This seed creates a world with several different biomes and several scattered villages. However, if you want to experience these things, you'll need to be alert, as the spawn point is very near to a zombie-spawning room. You'll have to work quick to get the equipment to fight them — or run!, This seed is perfect for players looking for nautical adventure. With many small, unique islands (including mushroom islands) scattered throughout a giant ocean, you'll need a boat to get around. Once you have one, though, cruising from sight to sight is a blast alone or with friends!

, This seed has you start out in a fairly standard village. Once you gather some resources, however, you'll be able to make the journey across the water to a nearby mushroom biome. In addition, there is temple near a second village in the opposite direction.

, Be careful with this seed — you start next to not one, but two different mob spawners in the middle of a desert. Luckily, you're not completely trapped: there are hills nearby you can escape into, plus a town with a blacksmith.

Try ""-881572542"" for a difficult survival island.,
Try ""932248179"" for a world with floating islands.,
Try ""XboxOne"" for a rich, varied world.",How to Find Unique Seeds on Minecraft6," This is a fairly standard survival island map, with one twist — there's only one tree near the spawn, and it isn't on your starting island! The swim to the nearby island will cost you precious time and hunger points, putting you at a disadvantage in survival mode. An entertaining map for players looking for a challenge.

, This seed gives a large, lush world full of various features. One of the most noticeable features, however, are the large floating islands near some of the map's mountains. Making a journey up to these isn't easy, but it's a rewarding experience (not to mention the fact that floating islands make great fortresses in survival mode.)

, Strangely, you can get an amazing world in the Xbox One version of the game by using the name of the console as your seed. This world has almost everything you could ask for: many different biomes, a varied landscape, and plenty of resources, making it a memorable map for basically any game mode.

Go hunting for zombies at night.,
Start killing zombies.,
Crank up the difficulty for more zombies.,
Alternatively, look for potatoes in village gardens.,
Eat them raw for a small amount of health.,
Put them in a furnace for a baked potato.,
Plant them as crops.,
Use them to breed pigs.",How to Find Potatoes in Minecraft PE," If you're playing in the standard survival mode, enemy zombies will spawn every night. You shouldn't have to walk far to find one or two once the sun goes down.


Make sure to bring a weapon or two that aren't likely to break. Swords are a good choice because they are easy to make and do good damage. See our article on making swords in Minecraft for more information.;
, You should quickly find a zombie or two. Kill the zombies you see, taking special care if you come across any with ranged weapons or high-level equipment. When killed, zombies may drop one of three items: rotten flesh, carrots, and potatoes.Be patient. You may need to kill a few zombies before you get your first potato.
If you can't see any zombies, listen for their telltale growl. If you hear it, you're definitely close!

, If you aren't seeing as many zombies as you'd like, you can increase the difficulty with the slider in the options menu. The harder the difficulty, the more zombies that will spawn at night.


Be careful — at higher difficulties, it's easier to get swamped by hordes of deadly zombies. You'll want a few high-damage weapons before you start (armor is also a big plus).

, It's also sometimes possible to get potatoes without resorting to violence. For this, you'll need to find an NPC village on the map. These will be small gatherings of houses, churches, wells, and so on that are populated by computer characters.Look for small gardens or patches of cultivated land. You will often find wheat, carrots, or potatoes planted in these places. Potatoes will look green on top (about 3/5 of a block thick) and will have a beige color under the green.


The problem with this method is that not every map has NPC villages. If you do find one, you may be able to get a few potatoes easily, but you may want to be prepared to kill zombies if you can't locate a village.

, Like other food items, potatoes can be consumed to satisfy the player's hunger and restore health. A raw potato will not restore very much health — it will only give about half a heart. However, in a pinch, this can be better than nothing., A much more efficient way to consume potatoes is to cook them first. Place the potato in a furnace block (the same way you would smelt metal ores or cook meat) and allow it to cook for a minute or two. When it's done, you will have a new item: a baked potato. This is much more satisfying than a raw potato — it restores three hearts when eaten., Like the other vegetables in Minecraft, potatoes can be planted in the ground and farmed. Unlike wheat, you don't need a special seed to grow potato crops — you plant the raw potato itself. This is the same way that carrots are planted in the game.To convert land for farming, you'll need to till the dirt and irrigate it with a source of water. For a good guide, see our main article on farming in Minecraft.

, Potatoes can also be used to make new baby pigs in the game. Pigs are the only livestock that eat potatoes, but they will also take carrots and beetroots. To breed pigs:Get two adult pigs close to each other.
Feed them both a potato (or carrot or beetroot).
They should enter ""love mode"" — you will see a bunch of hearts appear around them.
They will move close to each other. In a minute or two, a baby pig will appear.

, You will need to bring some torches with you, as it can get dark and impossible to see.

, Get a large amount of dirt. At least 80 pieces. You will be using this to lift yourself out of the mine you create.

, Caves are the best way to find Iron Ores. They usually appear in veins at a time. Stop wasting your time digging down from the surface, as this will only yield a small chance of success.

, Iron occurs in veins, or groups, so if you find one, there is likely more nearby. Check diagonal blocks as well. The usual size of a vein is 2x2x2 blocks.


Iron looks like peach or pink-ish splotches on grey stone.

, Recover them when you can.

, Using your map or the debug mode, check out the ""Y"" axis: this indicates your elevation. Remember that Iron Ore only occurs from levels 1-63.

, Coal goes at the bottom slot, Iron Ore goes on top.

If you do eventually find a Lapis Lazuli ore, when you mine it with an iron or diamond pickaxe, you will get between 4-8 shards of Lapis Lazuli.

",How to Find Lapis Lazuli in Minecraft," It's very simple and easy and especially quick. (If you find any Lapis Lazuli on your way digging down, consider yourself extremely lucky)! (Sorry for no pictures, I forgot my account password).;
,

The first choice is to simply place ladders to get back up to the top (note this will make future steps harder)

,, Bedrock is level 0. You want to get to the 17th to 19th levels. Build corridors going left, right and forwards. Backwards is optional so do it if you can. (This is why the ladder choice is harder).


You should find the Lapis Lazuli after half an hour or so. If you don't know what it looks like just type in ""Lapis Lazuli ore in minecraft"" on google images. It is an ore with many dark blue spots on it. Not light blue because that's diamond.

Equip an iron or diamond pickaxe.,
Dig down to the right level.,

Mine in branches to find gold.,
Explore special features.",How to Find Gold in Minecraft1," You cannot mine gold with any other tool.;
, Always dig at an angle, not straight down, to avoid falling. Leave a trail of torches behind you if you're traveling through caves.

, Gold is found only below layer 31. You can check your current layer by pressing F3 on Minecraft for computers, or by checking a map in the console edition. The y-coordinate tells you which layer you are on. Here are the best layers to look for gold:Layer 28 is the highest and usually safest layer where you'll find the maximum amount of gold.
Layers 11–13 are the best places to look for gold and diamond at the same time. Try to avoid digging below layer 10, where lava becomes much more common.

, Dig a main horizontal tunnel to get started. Mine branches off this main tunnel one block wide and two blocks tall to search for gold. Gold ore typically spawns in groups of four to eight blocks.This means you'll find almost all of the gold if you keep three solid blocks between each tunnel.


To find every single gold block (but at a slower rate), keep two solid blocks between each tunnel.

, While mining, you might encounter a stronghold, dungeon, or abandoned mine shaft with these features. Each of these can contain chests with gold or more precious items.

"
"
Look for a mesa biome.,
Excavate at any level.,
Search abandoned mine shafts.",How to Find Gold in Minecraft2," Mesa biomes look like deserts with red, often striped hills or spires. These biomes have the special features described below, only in Minecraft Pocket Edition.

, Gold can appear at any elevation in mesa biomes. This makes them the easiest and safest way to find gold in Pocket Edition. Dig branches into the hillsides, or just walk along and scan the cliffs for gold ore.

, Mesa biomes also have the only above-ground abandoned mine shafts. These features have minecarts with chests inside them, and about one in four chests contain gold.Beware of spiders as you search.

Smelt gold ingots.,
Craft ingots into a clock.,
Build powered rails.,
Make gold pressure plates.,
Create golden apples.,
Make blocks of gold.,
Break gold into nuggets.",How to Find Gold in Minecraft3," Just like iron ore, you'll need to smelt the gold ore in a furnace to turn it into usable ingots. Don't bother making golden tools or armor unless you like the look, since they're weaker than iron. Instead, use the ingots for the special items described below.

, Place a redstone in the center of the crafting area, with one golden ingot on each side (four total). This makes a clock which shows you the position of the sun or moon.


Place an item frame (eight sticks and one leather) on the wall and place a clock in it to make a wall clock., Place a stick in the middle of the craft area, fill the left and right columns with gold ingots (six total), and place redstone at the bottom. This powered rail will make mine carts move on their own, if you power it with a redstone torch or powered redstone circuit.

, If you want to start a redstone circuit when something falls on or walks over a square, build a pressure plate with two ingots side by side.

, Place an apple in the center of the craft area and surround it completely with golden ingots (nine total). This will make a golden apple, an excellent healing and protection item that you can eat even with full hunger.


You can make a more powerful ""Notch apple"" in most version of Minecraft by using gold blocks (see below) instead of ingots. This recipe will disappear in Minecraft 1.9., Flaunt your wealth by filling the crafting table with golden ingots to make a single golden block. This bright yellow cube is mostly used just for decoration.

, A single ingot anywhere in the crafting area will turn into a pile of gold nuggets. These have a few uses:Glistering Melon: Melon slice completely surrounded by nuggets. Used for potions.
Golden Carrot: Carrot surrounded by nuggets. Used for potions, food, and breeding/ healing horses.
Firework Stars: To make a firework, place any dye in the center and gunpowder to its left. Adding a gold nugget directly below the dye during crafting makes the firework star-shaped instead.

Look around for animals.,
Look for a village.,
Kill zombies and/or spiders.,
Look for melons when in the jungle.,
Break oak leaf blocks.",How to Find Food in Minecraft," Animals are the easiest source of food in Minecraft; you can get meat from pigs, chickens, cows, sheep, and rabbits. Use a sword so they will be killed after a few strikes.;
, Villages usually have multiple fields full of wheat, carrots, and potatoes. Carrots and potatoes can be eaten raw, though a baked potato will fill your hunger bar more. (Use a furnace to bake a potato.) Wheat needs to be made into bread using a crafting table.


Villages aren't overly common and only appear in grasslands and deserts, although they sometimes overlap another biome if near a border. Make sure you limit your search to these biomes.
If there is a blacksmith's shop, you will find a chest inside, which can contain food, armor, diamonds, and other useful things.







, Zombies drop rotten flesh and spiders drop spider's eyes, both of which can be consumed by the player. However, spider's eyes will poison you, causing you to lose an amount of health, so only eat them when your health bar is full or nearly full. Zombie flesh will most likely give you the Hunger status effect for a time. However, both of these can be cured by drinking milk (which can be acquired from a cow using a bucket).


A spider might also drop thread, which can be used to craft a fishing rod. Fishing takes a while, but can give you a steady supply of food.

, Melons are a good source of food in jungle biomes. Cocoa beans can be made into cookies, but only if you have wheat as well.
, There is a chance that an oak leaf, when broken, will drop an apple, which can be eaten. This method is a bit iffy, as there is no guarantee any given oak tree will contain an apple.

, In your crafting table, put:


3 wooden planks in a horizontal line across the top 1/3 of the grid
2 sticks in a vertical line down the middle of the grid

, With your wooden pickaxe, dig four blocks down into the earth until you find smooth stone. Mine only 3 stone while making sure that you still have 2 sticks left over. In your crafting table, put:


3 cobblestones in a horizontal line across the top 1/3 of the grid
2 sticks in a vertical line down the middle of the grid

, For your next step, you'll need a furnace. Furnaces can be found in NPC villages, or made using 8 cobblestones, lined around the outside edges of your crafting table.

, With your stone pickaxe, start searching for iron ore. Iron ore can be found above ground and in caves. You only need to mine 3 iron ore.


In your furnace, smelt together iron ore and coal to create iron ingot. Alternately, craft a block of iron into 9 iron ingots.

,"
"
For coal, dig down four levels of stone, then strip mine.,
For iron, find a beach or a desert, and dig under.,
To find redstone, dig down about sixty blocks in the desert, and create a floor.

,
For Lapiz lazuli, dig until you find a ravine deep underground, and explore it.,
To obtain gold, dig down three blocks above bedrock, and strip mine until you find it.

,
For diamond, search on the sixteenth or twelfth layer of bedrock, and strip mine until it is found.

,
To get emerald, find the Extreme Hills Biome.",How to Find Different Ores in Minecraft,";
, In addition to being able to obtain iron, you shall also find some coal to be able to smelt it.

,, Abandoned mineshafts can also be good places to search.

,,, Once you get there, dig to bedrock level, and dig four by four tunnels until it is found. Emeralds only spawn in blocks of one. So it's impossible to find a vein. If you want more than one, try strip mining.

If there is no lava, mine the emerald!",How to Find Emeralds in Minecraft," This is the only biome where emeralds will be found. Extreme hills biomes are fairly common, so you won't have to go very far.;
, Don't dig straight down, or you'll probably fall in lava. Emeralds can be found anywhere from levels 4-32, but level 11 is best. To see what level you are on, press F3 and look at the y-coordinate.

, You can also make ""branches"", or little tunnels branching off from the main tunnel.

, If there is, you could get a nasty surprise...

, Take your reward and either head out of your mine or continue looking for emeralds.

Before you start, know that diamonds can sometimes be found above ground in naturally generated chests.,
Make sure you have adequate supplies before you go diamond mining.,
Know that diamond can be found in layers 1 to 16.,
Make a staircase that goes down.,
Once you reach bedrock, dig around and find the bottom-most layer.,
Go up to layer 12 (1 block is 1 layer), and make a small room there.,
Start digging using a digging pattern.,
If you can, try using a Fortune enchantment on your pickaxe while mining.,
Dig around a diamond block before mining it.",How to Find Diamonds in Minecraft2," These chests can be found in villages or abandoned mine shafts. Although it's possible to find diamonds without mining them, it's generally less successful. It's recommended to mine for diamonds if you want to collect them efficiently.

, Your mission is to get diamonds, but in order to realize that mission, you first need some supplies. Be prepared with the following when you dig underground to mine:


Lots of torches (more than 100)
An iron pickaxe, or a diamond pickaxe if you have one
Weapons and armor, in case there are mobs in caves

, Diamond distribution is reputedly highest between levels 8 and 13, with level 12 having the highest likelihood for containing diamond ore. Diamond ore blocks come in small veins of 1 to 10 blocks. There's a chance you could find more than 10 blocks close to one another if the random generation is kind to you.

, To make this, make a 3 block high hole, make the same hole that starts at the middle of the hole to one block below the lowest block of the original hole, and repeat. Keep doing this with a pickaxe, and it is advised that you come back every 10 minutes or so to get more food, store goods in chests, and make more picks and swords, etc.

, That is layer 0.

, Make chests, a crafting table, and a furnace, so you do not have to go all the way above ground to craft more tools.

, There are several digging patterns that you can use to efficiently mine for diamonds. Here are just some of them that have worked well for other players:


Make one main shaft that is 2 blocks tall and 1 block wide going in a straight direction for some while. Create small arms that start at the main shaft and appear every 5 blocks. Dig the arms in 2-tall, 2-wide blocks.
Go in a straight line in 3x3 chunks until you hit diamond ore.


, Enchanting your pickaxe with a Fortune enchantment will increase the diamond drops you get while mining. There are three Fortune levels you can enchant your items with.


Level I gives you a 33% chance to multiply drops by 2 (a 33% increase on average), while level II gives you a 25% chance to multiply drops by 2 or 3 (yielding an average 75% increase), while level III gives you a 20% chance each to multiply drops by 2, 3 or 4 (averaging a 120% increase). Fortune level III enchantment is extremely rare, so be prepared to only get a Fortune I or II when you enchant your pickaxe.

, Diamond ore is often around lava; when you mine them, there's a chance that the diamonds could accidentally fall into the lava, destroying them. Because diamonds are precious, it's best to make sure that they fall into your inventory, not the lava, when you mine them.


Place stone, dirt, or gravel blocks on top of the lava if you happen to encounter a lava lake beneath the diamond ore. That way, if the diamonds fall down, they won't be sucked up into the lava.

Saddles have a small chance of appearing in most chests that you find. You'll have more luck in certain areas of the world., You'll have the best chance finding a saddle in the dungeons scattered throughout your world. Chests in dungeons have a 54% chance of spawning a saddle as loot. You'll know you're in a dungeon by the cobblestone + mossy stone walls, floors, and ceilings. They typically have a zombie, skeleton, or spider spawner, and one or two chests. It is possible, but very rare, to find a dungeon without a chest. With two chests, the chances are good that you'll find a saddle in one of them.


Dungeons can occur anywhere in the overworld.
The 29% spawn rate for saddles as of Minecraft 1.10

, Nether fortresses are another spot where saddles have a higher chance of spawning in chests. To access the Nether, you'll need to build a Nether portal frame using obsidian blocks. See Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft for detailed instructions. The Nether is a dangerous place, so make sure you bring strong gear and lots of supplies.


You'll have a 40% chance of finding a saddle in Nether fortress chests. This will go down to 35% in 1.9.

, These structures appear in the desert biome, and the floor of the temple structure will always be at Y:64. This means that the temple may be partially or completely covered by sand.


When you find the temple, look for the blue clay block in the centre of the floor. Digging this out will expose the secret chamber containing four chests. Each of these chests has a 15% chance of spawning a saddle, but this will go up to 24% in 1.9. This means you'll be almost guaranteed to find a saddle from the four chests.
Watch out for the TNT booby trap when you drop into the secret chamber. Don't drop anything else first to set off the pressure plate, as all the loot will explode.

, Villages have a fairly high chances of spawning a blacksmith. Blacksmith's have a chest in their building, and there's a 16% chance of finding a saddle inside.

, These two locations spawn chests that can contain the saddle, but your chances are at around 15% for each of these locations' chests. The jungle temple has two chests protected by a variety of booby traps, while abandoned mineshafts may have multiple minecart chests, depending on the size of the mineshaft.


In 1.9, saddles will no longer spawn in abandoned mineshafts.

, If you're playing the computer or console versions of Minecraft, you can trade items for emeralds, and vice versa, with villagers you find in villages throughout the world. By completing available trades, you'll open up additional trade opportunities. The leatherworker villager (white apron) can trade you a saddle as the third tier trade option.


Trading is not available in Minecraft PE.

, You'll need anywhere from 9-16 emeralds to unlock the ability to buy the saddle, plus 8-10 more emeralds to purchase the saddle itself. Emeralds can be found while mining, obtained from chests, or traded for with other villagers. See Find Emeralds in Minecraft for tips on finding emeralds while mining.

, Once you have some emeralds, right-click on the leatherworker to open the trade window.

, Close the trading window after making the trade. This will advance the leatherworker to the next trading tier.

, This will set you back 7-12 emeralds. Make sure to close the Trading window again to advance to the next tier.

, The leatherworker should now have the saddle available for 8-10 emeralds. Purchase the saddle if you have enough emeralds.

, The chances are low (less than 1%), but it is possible to reel in a saddle while you're fishing. You probably don't want to make this your primary method of obtaining a saddle, but if you fish a lot you may come across one.

, You can make a simple fishing rod from three sticks and two pieces of string. Sticks can be crafted from wood Planks, and string can be obtained from cobwebs and Spiders.


Place the three sticks diagonally from the bottom-left of the crafting grid to the top-right. Place the two pieces of string in the other two slots of the right column.

, You can fish out of any water, and the results will not change depending on where you are.

, Use your fishing rod to cast your line out to the water. Watch the bobber closely to determine when to reel in.

, This indicates that you've caught something. Reeling in at the right moment will cause your catch to come flying through the air towards you.

, This enchantment increases your chances of finding treasure while fishing. The third level of this enchantment will give you a 1.77% chance of getting the saddle, up from 0.84%.


Avoid the Lure enchantment if you are trying to get the saddle or other treasure, as this will lower your chances.
See Make an Enchantment Table in Minecraft for more details on the enchanting process.

, In order to access these options, you'll need to have cheats enabled for your world. There are two ways you can enable cheats, depending on if you've created your world yet or not:When creating a new world, you can enable cheats from the Create World menu.
If you've already created your world, open the Pause menu and select ""Open to LAN."" Toggle ""Allow Cheats"" ON.

, The easiest way to cheat and obtain a saddle is to simply open your world in Creative mode and place a saddle next to your player.


To switch, open your chat window (T) and type /gamemode c. You can then select the saddle from the list of available items and place it in the world. When you switch back to survival (/gamemode s), you can pick up the saddle and use it.

, You can use console commands to spawn a saddle in your inventory. Open the chat window by pressing T and type the following command to receive a single saddle:



/give playername saddle 1.

, If you don't want to go through the process of finding a horse to tame, you can use cheats to spawn a horse complete with a saddle. Open the chat window by pressing T and type the following command:/summon EntityHorse ~ ~ ~ {Tame:1,SaddleItem:{id:329,Count:1}}

, You will climb on top of it, and will likely be thrown off. After a few attempts, it will allow you to remain on it and will give off heart animations.

, Make sure that you have the saddle available to use.

, You can now ride around on the horse, using the same controls you use to move normally. Horses can charge a jump by pressing and holding the Jump button.

, To remove a horse's saddle, select the horse and take it out of their inventory.

, You're not stuck just riding horses! You can saddle pigs and ride them around the world:


While holding the saddle, Use the pig you wish to wear it. The saddle will now be attached to the pig permanently.
Control the saddled pig with a carrot on a stick. After a while, the pig will run five blocks per second.
You can't remove a saddle from a pig without killing it.

Prepare your inventory for strip mining.,
Dig downward to a height of at least 16 blocks.,
Set up your home base.,
Dig your main tunnel.,
Dig a branch on the left or right side of your tunnel.,
Dig a a small branch a few blocks left or right.,
Dig back to the main tunnel.,
Mine anything in between the two tunnels.",How to Find and Mine Diamonds Fast on Minecraft," Strip mining involves digging down to a Y coordinate of between 16 and 5, setting up a home base, and mining in two-by-two tunnels in each horizontal direction. The more ground you cover, the more likely you are to come across diamonds. To prepare for strip mining, you'll need the following items in your inventory:


Iron pickaxe - Requires three iron bars (three smelted iron ore) and two sticks. Iron pickaxes and diamond pickaxes are the only pickaxes that can mine diamond.

Bed - Requires three wooden crates and three blocks of wool. Your bed becomes your spawn point once you sleep in it, so if you die while mining, you'll respawn nearby.

Torches - Require one stick and one piece of coal or charcoal. Since you'll be underground, torches will help you see where you're going.

Chests - Require eight wood crates (two wood blocks) each. Chests will allow you to store the ore you mine while looking for diamond.

Furnace - Requires eight cobblestone blocks. Having a furnace will allow you to smelt any ore you come across (e.g., iron, gold, or diamond), meaning you can make a conceptually unlimited number of pickaxes.

Crafting table - Requires four wood crates (one wood block). A crafting table in your base will allow you to build more tools and structural items as you dig.

Doors - Require six wood crates. A door will keep monsters out of your home base while you sleep.

Wood blocks - Wood is one of the two resources you likely won't find in your mine. It will allow you to create handles for your tools and other structural replacements. Aim for at least 64 wood blocks.

Map (console and PE only) - Requires eight pieces of paper and a compass. The map will track your coordinates and update as you dig downward.

Raw meat - The other resource you won't find in your mine. Having meat you can cook while you're in your mine will help keep your hunger and health bars full.;
, Diamonds occur between the Y-coordinates 5 and 16, though they occur most often between layers 5 and 12. You can check your Y-coordinates by opening your map (console and PE), or by pressing F3 (PC) or Alt+Fn+F3 (Mac).You may want to do this in a zig-zag fashion, since digging straight down might lead to falling through the top of a cavern roof.
If you can't make a map or your map isn't working, dig down to the bedrock (unbreakable) layer; this layer marks a height of 4, which means your character is standing at 5 and 6 whilst standing on bedrock.

, To do so, you'll want to hollow out a three-block-tall, five-by-five (at least) space, create a doorway, and place all of your items (e.g., your torches, bed, table, furnace, and chests)., You'll want it to be around twenty blocks and two blocks wide to start. This tunnel can go straight out of your base's doorway, or you can create a right angle that branches away from your base.

You'll be digging perpendicular to this main tunnel, so make sure the first branch off of the tunnel won't go through your base.
Place torches every few blocks so that you don't get lost.

, Start with about twenty blocks of length. This branch can be one or two blocks wide; you'll be expanding it eventually.

Make sure you dig this branch a few blocks back from the end of your tunnel.

, You shouldn't go past the row of blocks where your tunnel ends, so keep that in mind as you dig., Once you reach the main tunnel, you should have two equally long, narrow tunnels a few blocks apart from one another., Doing so will clear out a strip of the mine; as you dig, make sure you're looking for diamonds in the ceiling and floor as well.

You'll repeat this process until your whole main tunnel has been expanded, then dig further and repeat as necessary.

Use a seed that starts you close to a village.,
Enable ""Large Biomes"" when creating the world.,
Explore the plains, savanna, and desert biomes.,
Explore the Oak Forest biome in Minecraft PE.,
Keep exploring.",How to Find a Village in Minecraft1," The quickest way to find a village is to start a new game with a seed that guarantees a nearby village. ""Seeds"" are bits of text that are used to generate a Minecraft world. Entering a specific seed will always generate the same world. This means that you can use seeds that are known to have villages near the starting point. Seeds are different for Minecraft for PC, the console editions, and Minecraft PE, but they work under the same principles for all versions.


Find your version of Minecraft on the main menu screen in the lower-left corner. Seeds change depending on the version, so you'll need to know your version before searching for seeds.
Search online for ""Version number village seed."" This should return a lot of results with different seeds that start near villages. You may find seeds in forum posts, YouTube videos, blogs, and other Minecraft fan sites. Seeds are different for computer, pocket, and console editions.
You can enter a seed by opening the ""More Options"" or ""Advanced"" menu when creating a new world.;
, If you're creating a new survival or creative world, enabling ""Large Biomes"" will give villages more space to appear in supported biomes. You'll also want to ensure that ""Generate Structures"" is enabled in the options for the new world, or else villages will not appear at all.

, These are the only three areas of the world that villages will spawn in. In version 1.10, you'll be able to find villages in taigas as well.Plains biomes are mainly flat and grassy. These are the most common biomes for villages.
Savanna biomes can be identified by the dry grass and acacia trees.
Desert biomes are sandy and have cacti growing throughout.
Taiga biomes have spruce trees and ferns. You may find wolves here.

, The Oak Forest biome in Minecraft PE may rarely have a village in it. These villages are not common, so you may have better luck trying the other biomes., Villages are random, and there is no sure-fire way to find one in the game without using third-party tools. For the best chance at finding a village, take the time to explore each compatible biome you come across.


You can make the exploration process a bit quicker by using a different mode of transportation, such as a saddled horse or pig.

Visit a village finder tool in your web browser.,
Enter your seed or load your save file.,
Zoom out on the map.,
Make a note of several villages to check out.,
Find your coordinates in-game.,
Check out another village if the first one isn't there.",How to Find a Village in Minecraft2," Minecraft fans have created tools that analyze your seed or save game and locate the villages for you. You can then take these coordinates and use them to find the village in your game. Note that these finder tools are usually about 66% accurate, as one-third of villages do not spawn as they should.


One of the most popular village finders is Chunkbase's. You can access it at chunkbase.com/apps/village-finder. Use an up-to-date browser like Chrome to access all of the features of the finder.
There is currently no village finder tool that works for Minecraft PE.

, The quickest way to load your world is to enter your current seed. If you're playing on PC, you can load your level.dat file from %appdata%\.minecraft\saves.


To find the seed for your current game, type /seed into the chat window. If you're playing a multiplayer game, you'll need to ask one of the admins for the seed.

, After loading the seed, the grid below will be populated by brown dots representing villages. If you're too zoomed in, you may not see any dots at first. Zoom out by scrolling the mouse wheel down until you see some dots.

, As you move your mouse cursor over the map, you'll see the coordinates change at the bottom. Move your cursor over one of the dots to see the coordinates of the village in the game. Because the map shows all possible villages, you'll want to make a note of several in case a few didn't get generated correctly.

, Once you're playing, you can look up your coordinates to help you find the village. You can also use the teleport command to move directly to them without having to explore.


On PC, press F3 to find your coordinates. If you're playing Minecraft PE, you'll need to use a third-party tool to find your coordinates. On the console versions, you can see your coordinates when you use a map. See Find Your Coordinates in Minecraft for more details.
To teleport to a specific location, type /tp name X Y Z when cheats are enabled. For Minecraft PE you'll need to use an inventory editor app to teleport. In the console versions, you can only teleport to other players. See Teleport in Minecraft for more details.

, The village finder will display all possible villages, but the game will only generate about 2/3 of them. This means you have a good chance of coming across a non-existent village at the location you picked. If this happens, just move on to the next coordinates you noted.


The console editions of Minecraft exhibit odd behavior for villages, and you may come across many that are only a well with no buildings. The village finder tool can also miss villages for the console versions. This can make finding a valid village more difficult in the console versions.

Open your survival map in creative mode.,
Start flying.,
Find some suitable biomes.,
Check the entire biome.,
Switch back to survival mode.",How to Find a Village in Minecraft3," One of the easiest ways to find villages in your existing game is to switch over to creative mode so that you can fly around until you find one. The process for switching modes varies depending on your version:


PC - Type /gamemode 1 in the chat window to switch your world to creative mode. You'll need to have cheats enabled to do this.
Pocket - You'll need to load your level into an inventory editor app and use the tools to switch modes.
Console - It is not possible to switch between survival and creative modes on the console editions of Minecraft.

, Once you're in creative mode, you can start flying by pressing Jump twice. On your keyboard, press Space twice to start flying. On Pocket, double-tap the jump button.


Hold the jump button while flying to go up, and the crouch button to go down.
Double-tap jump again to stop flying.

, While you're flying, you can move very quickly across the world. Use your new skill to find biomes that support villages: plains, savanna, desert, and taiga (1.10+ only).


You can use this method in combination with the previous one to check multiple locations from the village finder utility much quicker than by exploring for each one on foot.

, Villages can spawn anywhere in the biome, so search the whole area before moving on to a new location.

, Once you've found a suitable village, you can switch your game back to survival mode and continue playing.


PC - Type /gamemode 0 in the chat window to switch back to survival mode.
Pocket - Use the inventory editor tool to switch your world back to survival mode.

Build a computing machine with command blocks.",How to Find Building Ideas for Minecraft2," This is the first thing many players do in the game to make a safe place for themselves.


If you're trying to get creative, make yourself a place with style! Try adding stairs, windows, wall decorations, and more to give your home a ""finished"" feel. This can make your home something you're proud of — not just a place you stop to use the crafting table.






Looking for an extra challenge? Try to recreate your real home in the game!

, A person's home is their castle! Once you've finished your Minecraft house, give it a set of walls. Stone blocks are plentiful and look great for this project. Not only will you make your home look more impressive — you'll also protect yourself from mobs if you're playing in survival mode.


If you're looking for an extra project, try adding a secret underground entrance so that only you can get through the walls.

, One easy way to get noticed is to build something so tall that it can be seen from miles around. Building a super-tall tower isn't terribly hard, but if you're playing in survival mode it's easy to die from an accidental fall, so watch out!


For an even cooler project, try putting a spiral staircase in your tower so that you can actually climb to the top of your tower.
If you build your tower near water, you can jump off the top and you won't be hurt (as long as you land in the water).

, Minecraft's block-by-block building style makes it easy to write out giant words and messages. For example, you might try marking your territory by building your name in huge letters or recreating the Hollywood sign. The possibilities are endless.


Careful with dirty words and profanity — some servers may ban you for this.

, What's better than one house? A whole community! Building a collection of small buildings is a fun way to make your mark on the Minecraft world. You might even try making special buildings to hold crafting tables, furnaces, treasure chests, and so on.


This is especially great if you often play with friends — each person can make their own house for a village you can call your own.

, This project isn't that hard to actually make, but it can throw newbies who don't know how to build it for a loop. Start by building a tower up to the height you want your fortress. Then, build a thin bridge out to the side. Make a wide, flat area of blocks connected to the bridge. Build your fortress, then, when you're done, get rid of the bridge. Your building will stay floating in the sky!


Try using the /sethome command while you're inside your floating building. Later, you can use /home to teleport yourself back so you don't have to build another bridge., After you've been building amazing projects for a while, reward yourself with a monument to your glory. For example, you might try making a giant statue of yourself in shimmering gold blocks. Alternatively, if you're a little more modest, you can try making something more abstract, like a pyramid or an obelisk.


Consider using the sign block (crafted from six wooden planks over one wooden stick) to give your monument a plaque at the bottom. After all, what use is a monument if no one knows who it's to?

, Minecraft's blocks are perfectly square, just like the tiny pixels used to make 2-D computer images. One ambitious project is to make an exact replica of a pixelated image. Video games are a common source of inspiration for projects like this. Minecraft experts sometimes go to great lengths to make exact replicas of Mario, Megaman, and other heroes of the 16-bit era of video games.


To do this, you'll need to have a copy of the pixel image you can look at while you're building. It's easy to find pixel images of video game characters on Google Image Search and similar sites, but you can also make your own pixel art here., In terms of the time and attention required, it's hard to beat making your own city. Getting an entire city perfect down to the last block of sidewalk can take weeks or months, but the result is truly impressive. You can make your own city from scratch or use an existing city for inspiration. Minecrafters have replicated everything from modern day New York City to fantasy cities from The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.


For an added challenge, make buildings that you can enter and interact with, not just hollow boxes.

, History's biggest, most impressive architectural achievements are ripe for imitation in Minecraft. Making a scale model of something like the Eiffel Tower can take some serious time, but they're guaranteed to look amazing when they're done — after all, that's why they were built in the real world.


As other examples, you might try to recreate The Great Pyramids, The Empire State Building, The Colosseum, The Great Wall of China, or another famous piece of architecture.

, Water physics in Minecraft can be complicated, but you can make some truly amazing structures if you figure them out. For example, you might try building an area filled with long, curvy slides full of running water to make your own water park. Don't forget to build a way to get to the top of the slide!


You'll need plenty of buckets for this so that you can transport the water. You can craft a bucket from three iron ingots arranged in a ""V"" at the bottom of the crafting box.

, Bored of ordinary Minecraft building projects? Using the game's specialized command blocks, it's possible to make simple computers within the game world.These computers can then be programmed to perform various tasks — just like real computers!


Building one of these in-game computers is a very complex process. Luckily, there are a few good video guides available online, including this one. Know that you'll need lots of redstone ore for this project to build the command blocks and their ""circuits"".

, If you're on PC, then set your game to hard mode. This is because more mobs are likely to spawn, so it'll be more likely that a spawn at night will be a spider jockey., Once you've found one, be sure you are prepared, and go into the cave. While the chances of this happening are extremely small at only 1%l, if you find a spider dungeon, there is a chance that one spawn will be a spider jockey. However, this may take awhile, so unless you have equipment, it is not reccomended to stand in a spider dungeon for a long time., Again, the chances are very small, but if you find an abandoned mineshaft with a cave spider spawner, a spider jockey could be spawned. However, be prepared, as these types of spider jockeys can sometimes be even more dangerous., Again, at 0.8%, the chances are extremely small, but if you use a spider spawn egg, a wither skeleton jockey could be spawned. However, this can only be done in the nether, and it is even more rare for it to happen naturally., Usually, this is the easiest option. Once it is nighttime, head out with your sword, and search for a spider jockey. Again, the chances of it appearing are just 1%, but it can still happen., This too can take forever, but if you keep at it, it just might work.

Create a new world or enter an existing one.,
Find a large desert.,
Look for the pyramid shape of a desert temple.,
If you have a map, look for a squarish grey shape.,
If you're sick of looking, use a Desert Temple Finder App.",How to Find a Desert Temple in Minecraft1," Start your Minecraft game as you normally would. You can potentially find desert temples in any map with large desert regions — it doesn't matter if you're playing by yourself or online with others.



However, in multiplayer games, there's always the risk that a temple you find may have been looted or vandalized by others before you get there, so if you want to find a desert temple that's guaranteed to be ""pristine,"" play a single-player world.
If you don't want to go to the trouble of exploring for desert temples yourself, it's not hard to find world seeds online that make the task much easier. For instance, the following seed will create a world with a desert temple near to the spawn point (this seed should work in version 1.8):Seed: 8678942899319966093;
, Desert temples spawn randomly in desert biomes. There won't necessarily be one temple in each desert — there can be more than one or none at all. Thus, your best bet is to start searching in the largest desert you can find — the more space in the desert, the better chance that there is at least one temple in it.


There isn't really any single ""right"" way to find a desert, unfortunately. Deserts are generated from the world seed, so, unless you're already familiar with the world you're in, you may need to wander for quite some time (especially in the unlucky event that your world seed doesn't have many deserts.)There is a way to ""cheat"" outside of the game, however — see below.

, Once you're in a desert, you'll want to start looking for a large, blocky pyramid-shaped structure made from sandstone in the distance. There will be two large, square towers at the front of the temple with markings on them made from orange clay. Since there are few visual obstructions like mountains in the desert, you should be able to see it from a long ways away.


Desert temples always spawn with their floor at y = 64.000. In some cases, this can lead to them being partly buried.If you see what looks like a small pyramid with none of the rest of the temple, you may actually be looking at the very top of a buried temple!

, Having a map can make it a little easier to find temples (and to find your way back to one once you've discovered it.) Desert temples show up as gray on maps (just like plain stone), but have a characteristic boxy shape that's not normally seen for natural stone deposits.See our article on making a map in Minecraft if you're not sure how to get your hands on this useful tool.

, So you've tried finding a desert temple the old fashioned way and you've come up frustratingly empty-handed? There is still hope! Use the Desert Temple Finder online app from chunkbase.com to get the coordinates for all desert temples in a given map. Simply input your world seed (or select ""random"" to get a random one), click ""Find Desert Temples"", and zoom in and out on the map to see where the temples in your map are located.Note: By default, pressing F3 (or Function +F3 on Macs) in-game brings up a menu with your x/y/z coordinates."

Enter the temple's central chamber.,
Carefully dig beneath the emblem to avoid the trap.,
Mine the pressure plate.,
Grab the loot!",How to Find a Desert Temple in Minecraft2," Desert temples can be entered through the small doorway at the front end (between the two square towers.) Inside, you should find a darkened chamber with a diamond-shaped design of orange clay and a single blue clay block in the very center. This design marks the location of the temple's secret treasure.


If you've found a buried temple, you don't necessarily have to dig down to the door to get in. You can fall through the hole in the top of the pyramid to enter the chamber as well — however, be careful for falling damage!


, Beneath the central diamond floor design is a 3x3 room that contains four chests which can house valuable items like gold ingots, horse armor, and even rarities like diamonds and enchanted books. However, in the center of this small room is a stone pressure plate connected to nine blocks of TNT. Touch this square and you will most likely lose your life (and the treasure in the room.) The pressure plate is directly beneath the blue clay block. Thus, you will want to carefully dig into the room from a spot to the side of this pressure plate.


One good way to do this is to dig a set of stairs into the secret chamber starting from a few blocks away — this way, you enter the chamber from the side, rather than from above, making it less likely that you'll fall onto the plate or suffer falling damage.

, Once you are in the small treasure, take the time to disable the trap and prevent any tragic accidents. Use a pickaxe to carefully mine the stone pressure plate block in the center of the room without actually touching it. Once the pressure plate is gone, the room should be safe as long as you don't light the TNT manually.

, The four treasure chests in the chamber are filled with a selection of items — some common, some rare. Each chest contains 2-6 stacks of items; each stack may have one or several of its item. Some of the items that can be found in desert temples include the following — note that these items are rare and may not appear in every desert temple:Iron ingots
Gold ingots
Diamonds
Emeralds
Saddles
Iron/Gold/Diamond horse armor
Enchanted books

Gear up.,
Learn the location of your base.,
Set out.",How to Find a Cave in Minecraft1," You never know where a cave in Minecraft is going to take you, or where exactly you could end up while exploring. Caves are some of the most dangerous areas in the whole game, and it’s important you have all the essential items you need for survival before you set out.


Weapons: Some players like avoiding combat whenever possible while others seek it out. No matter your preference on this, it’s a good idea to bring at least one weapon with you just in case. The easiest weapons to craft are swords and a bow and arrow. Swords are a bit easier to get the hang of while bows can do ranged damage. You can either take both, or choose the one that best fits your preferred playing style.
Armor: This is completely optional, but it can prevent you from taking as much damage should you find yourself in combat, and that can mean the difference between life and death. You can have a helm, a chest piece, and boots all equipped at the same time, and the best part is that it doesn’t even take up inventory space.
Torches: These are probably the most important item to have with you if you plan on entering a cave. Since caves are underground, they often contain areas that are either poorly lit or not lit at all, so you’ll need to be able to provide your own lighting. Bring a lot of torches, and keep a stack in your item bar for easy access.
Pickaxes: Caves are primarily made of stone, so it’s a good idea to have a couple pickaxes on you just to help you get around. Caves will also have a lot of good resources that you’ll need a pickax in order to mine.
Bucket of water/bucket: Depending on what exactly you’re aiming to find in the cave, it can be useful to carry a bucket of water with you. You can pour water onto lava, which not only neutralizes the lava as a threat but will also create obsidian. Alternatively, an empty bucket will allow you to pick up water from its spawn point, which can sometimes make it easier to explore areas of a cave that would otherwise be flooded or waterlogged.
Food: You could be out exploring for a while, and if you’re successful in finding a cave, you could be out even longer. While caves are rich in many resources, they’re not good for finding food, so you’ll want to bring your own. You want to keep your fullness meter filled because that will ensure that you are able to regenerate any health that you might lose along the way.;
, The last thing you want to do is lose the way back to your base, so before you leave you need to make sure you know exactly where you’re at. If getting lost is still something you’re worried about, there are a couple options to ensure you’ll be able to find your way back.


If there are any memorable land formations or decorations you’ve added around your base, be sure to take note of that so you have something to look for.
Leaving a trail can be a good way to not get lost. You can put down torches, or even decorative blocks like flowers, and then follow the trail back to your base when it’s time to return.
Using a map is also an option if you either have one already or have the tools needed to craft one. Maps are a great way of knowing where you are in relation to your base.

, Some caves are exposed, meaning that they have entrances you can find just by walking around the surface. Walk in any direction you like, keeping in mind not to get lost, and keep an eye out for caves.


Exposed cave entrances are usually stone and are most typically found in the mountain biomes.
Exposed caves will often have at least one ore block near the entrance, so you can be tipped off if you see a lot of coal or iron while you’re walking, and you should investigate.
Don’t just look for caves, listen for them. In addition to the ambiance music that plays when you get close to a cave or a cave entrance, you can also frequently hear monsters making noise from the cave, and sometimes you can hear lava and waterfalls as well.

"
"
Pick a location.,
Gear up.,
Dig down.,
Don’t get discouraged.",How to Find a Cave in Minecraft2," One of the benefits of looking for caves by digging is that you can decide where to put the entrance, picking somewhere that is convenient for you.


When choosing a location, it’s probably best to pick somewhere near your base so that you won’t have very far to travel when you’re going between your cave and your base.
You can put your cave entrance inside your base if you want, and then you don’t have to go outside when you’re trying to return, which could be dangerous, particularly if you’re exiting the cave at night.
If you plan on putting your cave entrance inside your base, you might want to either seal it off or mark it so that you don’t just have an open hole that you could risk falling into.

, Preparing yourself to tunnel down into a cave is a little bit different than just looking for a cave. If you’re digging into one, your entrance is somewhere that you picked and is probably a lot easier to find than a naturally exposed cave entrance. This means that it will be a lot more convenient to get supplies. Instead of preparing yourself for what you’ll find in the cave, you just need to have the supplies needed to make the entrance.


Torches: Since you’ll be digging down, you’re going to run out of natural light very quickly, so it’s important that you have lots of torches so you can see what you’re doing. It’s not going to be very easy to get lost this way, but if it’s too dark you won’t be able to see if you come across any valuable materials that would be worth mining.
Ladders: Ladders are made from sticks, and while they’re not the only method of getting back up once you’ve dug this hole, they are definitely the most efficient.
Pickaxes: Since you’ll be coming across a lot of stone as you dig, it’s important that you have at least a couple pickaxes with you. They’ll also be important to have if you find anything to mine along your way.
Shovels: While you don’t technically need shovels, there’s a good chance you’ll come across either dirt or gravel on your descent, and shovels will really speed up the process for moving those blocks.

, Simply begin your descent by making sure your pickax is highlighted (or shovel if the blocks your mining are dirt) and left-clicking on the block you want to remove and holding down the left mouse button until the block is gone.


Keep in mind: you never ever want to dig straight down from the block that you’re standing on. Although it’s one of the quickest ways to tunnel downward, it’s also the most dangerous and can result in the death of your character.

If you happen to be tunneling toward a cave ceiling and you remove the block you’re standing on, you would fall and could take a lot of damage. You could also tunnel yourself into lava.


Instead of digging straight down, you’ll need to make your entrance two blocks wide. Stand on one of the blocks as you dig the other and switch back and forth. That way if you remove a block that is directly above either nothing or lava, you can stop, climb out of the hole, and find another place to dig.
Put down ladders as you dig. To do this, you simply make sure that the ladder section in your toolbar is highlighted and right-click on the block where you’d like to place it. You can highlight the slot that an item is in either by scrolling to it with your mouse wheel, or pressing the number that corresponds to that slot. (If your ladders are in your third item slot for instance, you’ll want to press the 3 on your keyboard to highlight that item.)

Since you’re going to have to use ladders to get out of the hole and back to your base, it’s important that you put them down as you dig deeper and deeper. It’s easier to put them down as you’re dig than as you’re climbing, and this will also make sure you don’t run short on ladders.
If you run out of ladders at any point, you should resurface and make some more before continuing your descent, as running out of ladders could get you stuck.


In addition to putting down ladders, you should also be putting down torches. It’s a good idea to put torches on the opposite wall of your ladder as this will offer the best visibility.

You won’t need to put a torch on every block, just put them down when you feel that your surroundings are getting too dark. You need to be able to see as it will help you avoid falling should you find a cave.
You can easily put torches on the wall just like you would with a ladder, making sure that your torches are highlighted from your toolbar and then right-clicking where you’d like to place it.



, Digging straight down like this will only lead you directly into a cave about 50% of the time. If you keep digging down all the way until you hit bedrock (which is the bottom layer and impossible to dig past) and you still haven’t found a cave, don’t worry. You haven’t wasted your time, and you can still find what you’re looking for.

Keep listening. If you hear anything as you’re climbing up and down on your ladder, it could be a sign that you’re near a cave. You can often hear monsters, water, lava, and ambiance music to let you know when you’re close. If you hear anything, you can start tunneling in the direction that it’s coming from, which should lead you to a cave.
If you don’t hear any cave sounds, then the best tactic is to tunnel straight in any direction from 10–12 layers above the bedrock. Go all the way to the bottom of the hole you dug and place down 9 blocks directly beneath you. Start tunneling from there.

The reason for this is that the most valuable resources usually spawn in the layers 10–12 blocks above bedrock, so searching for a tunnel from this point will not only lead you to a cave, but it also has the best chance of leading you to a cave with gold and diamonds.

Pick a spot to start digging.,
Gear up.,
Start digging.,
Stay attentive.,
Find a cave.",How to Find a Cave in Minecraft3," Much like with digging straight down, you can choose where the entrance to your cave starts. It’s good to pick somewhere that is easy for you to find and is either connected to your base or close by. That way you can avoid getting lost and you have easy access to your base when you’re returning from mining the cave once you’ve found one.


When you’re digging down diagonally, you’re essentially creating a staircase that goes straight into the cave. For this reason, it’s a good idea not to create the entrance inside your base without blocking it off, or adding some kind of barrier since enemies would be able to follow you back up from the cave.

, Like with digging straight down, it’s most important that you just focus on the tools needed to get you to the cave, not the tools you’ll need once you’re in the cave. This is because it’s much easier to return to your base to restock on supplies. These are the most essential tools to bring when looking for a cave in this fashion.


Pickaxes: Most of the blocks in between you and the cave you’re looking for are going to be stone, so you’re going to need one very durable pickax at the least.
Torches: While this method can sometimes provide more light than digging straight down, you’re still going to be underground, and torches are still going to be extremely useful.
Shovel: You’ll most likely encounter a lot of dirt blocks and a lot of gravel blocks, which can be tedious to move out of the way by hand. Though a shovel isn’t required, bringing one could save you a lot of time.
Food: Digging out steps into the ground is a lot more time consuming than just digging a hole, so you might want to bring some food to help keep your fullness meter up.

, Like with any aspect of Minecraft, there are a lot of personal preferences involved in how you want to dig. If you tend to get claustrophobic while playing, for instance, you may want to make your staircase more than a single block wide and make the ceiling above each of your steps higher. There is no wrong way to do it, but here are a few things to keep in mind.


You need to have at least three blocks of blank space above each of your steps in order to be able to get up and down the stairs smoothly.
The wider your staircase is, the more time it’s going to take to dig out, but the easier it’s going to be to find, and the more ground you’ll cover. You should weigh those thoughts before deciding what you’re comfortable with.
If you’re building any structures where you’ll be using a lot of cobblestone, a wider staircase will help you collect more of it to work with.
If you’re hoping to find a cave more quickly, a single block staircase is going to get you to one the fastest, and might be a better option for you.
If you’re unsure of how wide you’d like your staircase, you can always start small and then expand later if you find yourself wanting more space, or wanting your entrance to be easier to find.
Signs are also a great way to mark your stairs so you don’t lose them from inside the cave and are a faster alternative to making a wide, easily visible staircase.

, If you have to dig down any length of time before you find a cave or anything of interest, it can get tedious, but you need to pay attention for the following things:


Music: When you’re near a cave, there’s ominous music that will play. If you hear the music before finding a cave, it might mean that you’re right next to a cave and should start heading in that direction.
Water/lava: You can hear both running water and lava when you’re close enough to them. If you hear the sound of rushing water, it would be a good idea to mine in that direction. If you hear the sound of lava, it probably does mean there’s a cave nearby, but you should exercise more caution when mining in that direction to avoid actually touching any lava.
Monsters: Monsters such as skeletons and zombies will make noises that you’ll be able to hear through a couple blocks, so if you hear them, digging in their direction will most likely lead you to a cave, but prepare yourself for combat before heading in that direction.

, This is the most effective method for cave finding. If you reach bedrock, and still have not located a cave, there are a number of options of where to go from there.


When you hit the bedrock, you can ascend until you’re 10–12 blocks above that and keep mining. 10–12 blocks above bedrock is where things like diamonds and gold naturally spawn, and they’re most commonly found at the bottom level of the biggest caves, so this is a good place to continue your search at.
You can always start this process over, digging yourself another staircase from a different starting point.
Another option would be to continue forward, and dig yourself a staircase that goes up, the opposite direction from the way you came in.
If you’re tired of digging, you can always resurface and try to find an exposed cave entrance.

Restock supplies when necessary.",How to Explore/Mine in a Cave in Minecraft," If you're entering a cave that is right next to your main house/shelter, then obviously you won't really need a base. However, when you're exploring a cave or ravine a distance away from your home, you should always build a base. There's no need to make it fancy; a small cobblestone or dirt room will do. Your base should be on the surface (not underground) or at least not very far underground (for example, just inside the cave would be perfectly fine). It should be easily accessible from both above ground and inside the cave or ravine, and ideally it should be near a source of wood. This way, you can easily stop mining to go to your base, so that you can refresh your supplies and gather more wood for torches, tools, etc. You'll need a furnace, crafting table, at least one double chest, and preferably a bed.;
, In a cave or ravine, you could find yourself in many situations - you have no idea how large the cave system will be, what you'll find inside, or how many monsters you'll have to fight. Don't be afraid to spend several in-game days gathering tools and materials to take with you. Below is a list of items you should take.


At least two full stacks of torches - You can truly never have enough torches!
At least 4-5 pickaxes - Wood is useless, and while gold mines blocks faster than any other type of pickaxe, it doesn't last long. You should use iron if it's available, but if not, stone works, and of course, always use diamond pickaxes whenever you can.
1-2 shovels - Digging through dirt/sand/gravel/etc. with a pickaxe will wear down your pickaxe faster and is less efficient, so you should bring along at least one shovel. If you have an iron (or diamond) shovel, one should be enough, but if you have to resort to stone, you should probably bring along an extra.
At least 50 ladders - It's a really good idea to bring along some ladders, especially if you're entering a ravine. Many caves have ledges you won't want to jump off of, and a ravine is going to be very deep and have lots of long drops.
Around 30-40 blocks of dirt or cobblestone - Small gaps can easily be crossed with a small bridge of dirt or cobble, and if you have to cross a pool of lava, you're going to need something that won't burn up. You shouldn't worry too much about bringing a large amount of dirt/cobblestone, though, because you'll have easy access to lots of cobblestone when you're underground.
2-3 swords - Stone is okay, but iron or diamond is ideal. There will likely be many zombies and skeletons, and probably some creepers, so you want to arm yourself properly.
Armor - A full set of leather armor would work fine, and so would even just boots and a helm made out of iron. You don't need much, but let's face it - no one can detect every creeper before it's too late. With a good set of armor, you'll be a bit better protected.
A bed - If you're playing with someone else, you should take a bed along so that you can hide out in a little hole or walled-off section of the cave so the other player can skip to daytime when they need to.
At least 1 bucket of water - If you're careful, you won't need to use this, but many cave systems have lava, and you can put out flames with water if you do catch on fire.
A bow and as many arrows as you can get - Use your bow against creepers and other enemies as you see fit.
At least 8 steaks/porkchops/bread/etc. - Food is essential for mining. You need your health to regenerate, because even when you're leaving the cave, you won't last long if you've only got a few hearts left and your hunger bar is low.
A crafting table - You can do without this if you built a base, since you can make torches without a table and you should have brought lots of tools. If you do choose to bring one along, you can restock your pickaxe/sword/shovel supply from inside the cave, and you can also make a furnace or a chest to store items. If you don't, you can always go back to your base.

, When you're in a cave, it's easy to lose direction.


A really excellent, simple way to keep from getting lost underground is to only place torches on one side of you. For example, if you're right-handed, only place torches on your right - you'll be able to remember that it's your right because you should be able to remember that you're right-handed. When you want to go deeper, keep the torches on the side that you're placing them on. When you want to return to the surface, keep them on your other side. It's really easy to do and it's quite efficient.
Try to remember where you've been and where you are. If you forget which passage leads where, or where you have already explored, it's easy to get lost.

Always place torches and keep the cave well-lit. If you don't, you will not only miss iron/coal/etc., but you will also lose track of which areas you've already seen.

, After a while of playing Minecraft, you should be able to easily distinguish the sounds made by various monsters - zombies moan, skeletons rattle, spiders have a sharp hiss, etc. In a cave, you'll need these sounds to warn you of enemies. Use your senses to your advantage. Of course, you won't be able to detect creepers unless you see them - you'll just hear the ""tsss"" sound as they explode behind you. However, this sound gives you a split second to leap away and take a bit less damage.

, Lava is extremely dangerous, and burns your items when you die; water gets in your way and hides valuable ores from you when it flows across the cavern floor. Fill any buckets you need to, then block the water/lava source block with cobblestone or dirt.

, If you don't have enough torches to see where you're going or if you only have one pickaxe that's about to break, or you're out of swords, go back to your base and restock your supplies. This should be easy if you use the trick about keeping torches on one side of you, and you'll have a chance to put valuable items in a chest and go back with room for more in your inventory.

Get inspired.,
Brainstorm!,
Start your sketch.,
Ask important questions.,
Bring your sketch to life!,
Beware of obstacles and milestones.,
Give yourself a pat on the shoulder.",How to Expand Your Imagination Through Minecraft Construction," Some of the most effective methods of acquiring inspiration and ideas come from a little research. It is imperative that builders choose a project (however large or small). For example, if a builder chooses to build a Medieval Village, it would be wise to research what Medieval Villages entitle. In the specified example, some of the attributes of a village include: farms, commoner's houses, noble's houses, shops, and a city wall. Even just a little research can inspire you to create something amazing!;
, Once you've found a reasonable project and goal, the next objective is to brainstorm with an ambition of a tiger looking for its afternoon meal. Ask yourself these fundamental questions:


How long do I expect this project to take me?
What kind of materials will I use?
How do I plan to illustrate my plan of action?
Do I have the ambition to complete it?

, If you can answer, ""heck yes!"" to all of the questions in Step Two, then you're ready to brainstorm on paper. Get out some paper and pencils (be sure to bring lots of erasers), it's time to draw! On your piece of paper, draw out a very rough sketch of what the ""big picture"" is. Let's refer back to the Medieval Village example used in step one. A good start would be to draw out a rough city plan, making little notes of where the houses, the farms and where the city walls would stand. Remember, there is no ""wrong"" sketch! Any drawing is an exceptional masterpiece if you can understand what you've drawn, the drawings will (hopefully) serve as a reference when constructing your project in-game.

, In reference to your preliminary sketch of your project, now is the time to evaluate the logistics of your project. Ask yourself:


Does my sketch provide reasonable parameters for what I plan to accomplish?
Who is my audience? (Friends, family, -- maybe yourself, he-he).
What are my inspirations from researching in Step One and how do they take part in the project I'm planning?
Does my sketch provide ample (this is a subjective definition -- you decide what it means!) information on how the project is going to be completed?

, If you can answer all of the questions above with confidence and determination, you're one step closer to bringing your project to life! Now is the time to put your imagination to the limit. Get out your blueprint (your first sketch), put your thinking cap on, and start building your creation.


Building is a complicated and lengthy process (in most cases) and your first structures may take a long time to build, which is completely normal! It's important to be satisfied with what you've built and use all available resources to help you build your best structure yet. Going back to the Medieval Village example, if you get stuck on building a house, you can look up related term items on the internet like, ""medieval house ideas"" or ""how to build a medieval house"".

, Remember that getting demotivated and lacking ideas is completely normal! Take a break; take a 2-3 hour break in between building.


Going back to the Medieval castle example, you might have rough idea of how you want to build it on paper, but when it comes to putting my imagination to the block, you go blank! After a prolonged break and searching up new inspirations and castle-building tutorials, little by little you can create a castle and be satisfied with the final product. Sometimes, inspiration is all you need!

, You've read all the steps without smashing your computer at my lack of verbiage and the repetitive use of the Medieval Village example, congrats!

If you wish to destroy blocks, hold left mouse button until the block breaks. To place a block, click the right mouse button. You can interact with some blocks by pressing the right mouse button without a placeable block in your hand.

, When you feel bored in Minecraft, you can always explore other caves, install some mods, learn how Redstone works and build to whatever you desire. You could even create hidden corridors, gather even more resources, look for villages and trade with the villagers.

, These can help enhance your experience in Minecraft by changing textures or certain aspects of gameplay. Mods can add dinosaurs, wands, better dungeons, mythical creatures and basically anything to the game. There are even mods for purple dirt!


You can find both on the Minecraft forums and Planet Minecraft.

, If you wish to avoid enemies and have the most peaceful experience in Minecraft, you could turn your difficulty to peaceful. If you're not interested in surviving, or you want to test (Redstone) creations before you build it in your survival world, you could always start a creative world.

, This can give you several new modes of gameplay such as economy and hunger games. You can look on Planet Minecraft or Minecraft-servers for servers to play on.

Make a Compass.,
Make a map.,
Mark your path.,
Keep an eye on landmarks.",How to Explore a World Without Coordinates in Minecraft1," If you’re lucky enough or have played long enough, you might find yourself with a stock of Redstone Dust and some Iron Ingots. With this you can craft one very helpful tool called a Compass. Unlike real compasses, this one points towards your spawn point (or Bed, if you made one) instead! This is useful if you plan on exploring nearby areas but want to be able to return home just as quickly. You don’t have to “use” it, per se, just keep it in your hotbar or inventory, and even without selecting it, the sprite will constantly be pointing to the general direction of your spawn point.


The Compass is made on a crafting table with 1 Redstone Dust and 4 Iron Ingots. The format is a cross-shape, with the Ingots as spokes and the Redstone as the center.;
, This can be considered as an upgrade to your Compass, or a great partner for it, if you know what you’re doing. It needs Paper to make, though, but is quite worth it. Each map can initially show you the nearby 128 x 128 area (8 x 8 chunks) from where you first use it. In any case, a map can be useful if you want to know the lay of the nearby area while keeping track of where your original home is. When you’re holding your map, it slowly fills and shows a general view of the area you’re in. This, combined with your Compass, will ensure that you know exactly where you are and how to get back home.


On the PC, the Empty Map is crafted on your crafting table with Paper and a Compass. Place the Compass in the middle of the table’s grid, then surround it with Paper. You start with a map in the console edition, but can use this recipe to make duplicate maps. To use the Empty Map, select it then press right-click or LT/L2 in the area you wish to map out, then simply walk and watch it fill itself up automatically.
In the PC edition, the Empty Map becomes a map item with a number (Map #1, Map #2, etc.) and each map depicting different areas are separate items. You can duplicate your map by placing an Empty Map beside it on any crafting menu.
Paper is acquired by breaking Sugar Canes growing beside bodies of water and is crafted by placing three Sugar Canes horizontally on your crafting table.
Preferably, you’ll want to be around or beside your spawn point before using the Empty Map to know where your spawn point is exactly.

, If you don’t have the resources for a Compass or Map, the easiest solution is to lay down blocks, torches, or fence posts as you go along. Avoid blocks that blend too easily to the surroundings, like Dirt Blocks in a Plains or Sandstone in a Desert. This way, when you turn back, the path home is easily seen.

, In general, keeping an eye on your surroundings is a must when exploring. Sometimes, it’s easier following the river back to your home than by looking for several paths and blocks you laid out, or scrambling to find the area home with your Map or Compass. Keep a close eye on memorable landmarks, like large cliffs, a single tree in the middle of a Plain, a cluster of Pumpkins, or even the presence of livestock. As long as you keep a clear head and remember your surroundings, exploration will be much easier.

Know what mapping is.,
Make “zoomed out” maps.,
Learn how to use multiple maps.,
Making an Item Frame.,
Create a “world map” in your base.",How to Explore a World Without Coordinates in Minecraft2," Mapping is the method used by experienced players to explore the area using multiple maps and Item Frames to mark and record their surroundings. On the PC, this method tends to use up a bunch of Redstone and Iron Ingots in the process to make the maps, which means you need to have a stockpile of both resources ready before attempting this.

, This is a very useful feature currently available only in the PC edition. Zooming out your map gives you a wider scope of the area around you for less resources. You can zoom out a single map four times, for a total of 40 sheets of paper and a total area of 2048 square blocks (128 chunks).


To zoom out your map, place it in the middle of the crafting table’s grid, then surround it with Paper. You can repeat this three more times for a single map.

, Since you can use multiple maps on the PC and you can’t map out the same area using maps with different numbers, once you reach an area outside the “borders” of your first map, you can just use another map to help you scout out the area. Since there are no map overlaps, this is pretty convenient, as long as you remember what order your maps are arranged in.

, When you place a map in an Item Frame, the location of the frame is marked out in green in a map of the same number you’re holding and its counterpart in the frame. This can be used both in the console and PC edition, but is more useful for the PC when you have multiple maps.


The Item Frame is made with 8 Sticks and 1 Leather on a crafting table. Place the Leather in the middle of the grid then surround it with the Sticks. Any item can be placed into the Frame, normally as a display.
Items placed in the frame can be rotated manually by pressing right-click or LT/L2, or via timed redstone signals.
You can only “link” one frame per map, meaning you can’t have multiple frames of the same map in the same world.

, This is an extension of the Item Frame step and is dominantly a PC-only method, due to the Console’s inability to let you generate multiple individually numbered maps. Basically, you lay out an array of framed maps in order into a dedicated wall of your base’s room, and slowly add to it the more areas you explore. You can also note some noteworthy finds or locations on a sign below or beside each map in your base.


You can do a modified version of this method in the console by simply placing signs with some noteworthy details and locations surrounding your singular framed map.

To farm wheat, get wheat seeds.,
Once you have enough seeds, make a hoe and a bucket.,
Then, find a nice stretch of grass blocks and use the hoe to till it to make farmland.

,
Plant the seeds by right clicking the farmland.

,
Then, you can dig a canal next to the growing seeds and put water there by using the bucket.,
Then, wait for the seeds to grow.

,
Once the seeds are fully grown, you can harvest the crops and place new seeds.",How to Farm Crops in Minecraft1," To get wheat seeds, you will need to destroy long grass. Long grass is easy to find if you are in a plains biome. When destroyed, long grass will drop wheat seeds.;
, Hopefully you know the crafting recipes for these items. If not, just search for them on Google, they are pretty easy to find.

,

Pumpkins and melons will grow on an open dirt block that is immediately adjacent to the seed.
The seed will not produce any additional pumpkins or melons until the current ones are harvested.
There is no need to replant them, as growing does not consume the seed.

, Draw the outline of the sword using the grid as a help to make the best symmetry and neatness. You may wish to use a line tool, or just freehand

, If using a drawing software, draw the inner details of the sword with a very fine line before removing grid. If your using pen and paper you still may wish to use the detail lines but it may look messy

, Most of the default swords use different shades of the same 2 colors, but if you wish to be creative, go ahead.

, If you have some more time and patience you can try to shade the bottom and top of the shapes with different shades. For each colored shape in the add more black and/or less saturation to the color, and color a rounded shape in the bottom corners; vice versa shades for the top corners.

, For a very small but effective final touch you may like to add a little reflection 'glint'. They can be as simple or as advanced as you want from an easy 5 point star to a complicated pointed shape.

, You can only eat when when the Hunger bar is not completely full. The only exceptions to this are chorus fruit, golden apples, and milk.


Your Hunger bar will shake when it begins to lower. Once at least one of your hunger icons starts to deplete, you can eat.

, Open your inventory and drag the food item onto your hotbar at the bottom of the screen. Press the hotbar number to select the food and hold it in your hand.

, This is usually the right mouse button, but can be changed to other keys. Continue holding the button until the food has been completely eaten.

, The Hunger bar does not go down in Creative mode or Peaceful mode, so you won't be able to eat if you're playing either of these.

, You'll only be able to eat if you Hunger bar is not completely full. The only exceptions to this are golden apples and milk.


If your Hunger bar is shaking, it will begin lowering. You'll be able to eat once at least the first hunger icon begins to get used up.

, If you pick up food without anything in your hands, it will be selected automatically. You can tap the ""..."" button to open your inventory, tap a hotbar box, then tap your food item to add it to your hotbar. You can then tap it in your hotbar to hold it.

, You may have to look around a little bit before you are able to start eating, as you may accidentally be trying to click a block. Press and hold your screen until the food has been eaten., Many animals you find in your Minecraft world will drop meat when killed. All of this meat is safe to eat raw, except chicken meat, which can give you food poisoning. Cooking meat will increase its benefits.


You can get meat from cows, pigs, chickens, mooshrooms, sheep and rabbits.
See Start an Animal Farm on Minecraft for instructions on farming animals for meat.

, If you have a fishing rod, you can fish for food. Raw fish, raw salmon, and clownfish are safe to eat, but pufferfish will cause food poisoning and nausea. Cooking raw fish will increase its benefits.


See Fish in Minecraft for details on how to fish.

, Various crops and plants will drop food when harvested. You can farm potatoes, carrots, beetroots, apples, and melons. You'll find these plants in various locations throughout your world, though you may be able to find a lot concentrated in village farms.


See Build a Basic Farm in Minecraft for instructions on creating your own farm to harvest crops.

, Although you only see the Hunger bar in the game, there are actually two hunger systems at work: Hunger and Saturation. The Saturation level is hidden from the player, but affects how the Hunger bar depletes. The hidden Saturation level needs to completely deplete before your Hunger bar starts to drop. Certain foods give higher Saturation bonuses, allowing you to go longer without having to eat.Your Saturation level drops as your perform strenuous activities like sprinting. The Hunger bar will begin to jiggle when your Saturation level has been completely depleted.

, This will give you the largest Saturation bonus, and allow you to go the longest without having to eat again.


High-Saturation foods include cooked porkchops, steak, cooked mutton, cooked salmon, golden carrots, and golden apples.

, You can eat any of the raw meat and gain a small amount of food points, but you'll get better results if you cook the meat first. In order to cook meat, you'll need a furnace. You can create a furnace by placing 8 cobblestone blocks around the edge of your crafting grid.


Once you have a furnace, place some fuel in the bottom box and your raw meat in the top. The meat will be cooked and will give you about 3 times the original Hunger benefit and about 5 times the original Saturation benefit when eaten.
Cooking chicken is the only way to safely eat it. If you eat raw chicken, you have a 30% chance of getting food poisoning.
Putting a potato in a furnace will create a baked potato, which has better hunger benefits.

, There are a variety of food items that can be created by combining ingredients. These can provide good Hunger recovery, but don't offer as much Saturation. Eat these when your Hunger meter is low to get the best effect:



Bread - Crafted from 3 wheat.

Cake - Crafted from 3 milk, 2 sugar, an egg, and 3 wheat.

Cookie - Crafted from 2 wheat and a cocoa bean.

Mushroom stew - Crafted from a mushroom and a bowl.

Pumpkin pie - Crafted from an egg, a sugar, and a pumpkin.

Rabbit stew - Crafted from a cooked rabbit, a carrot, a baked potato, a mushroom, and a bowl.

Golden carrot - Crafted from a carrot and 8 gold nuggets.
Golden apple - Crafted from an apple and 8 gold nuggets.

, There are several foods that have a chance to get you sick if you eat them, or don't prepare them properly. When you get food poisoning, you lose 0.5 Hunger units per second for 30 seconds. Drink milk to counteract the effects of food poisoning.Raw chicken has a 30% chance of giving you food poisoning. Cook chicken to avoid this.
Rotten flesh has an 80% chance of giving you food poisoning. There is no way to make it safer.
Pufferfish has a 100% chance of giving you advanced food poisoning, which will take 1.5 Hunger units per second for 15 seconds. It will also give you Poison IV, which will drop your player health. You cannot cook pufferfish.
Spider eyes have a 100% chance to give you Poison, which will drop your player health by two full hearts.

Create a new folder on your desktop. Name it “Minecraft Backup” or something similar.
In your search bar or explorer window, type in %AppData%. Press Enter. In your AppData folder, open your Roaming folder. Inside, you'll find a folder named minecraft. This folder contains all of your Minecraft program files.
Copy the entire “.minecraft” folder to your new backup folder. Be sure to leave the original in the original location as well.

, While each version changer will look a little different, they all do essentially the same thing. The program should detect the location of your Minecraft installation automatically, and then offer a list of versions to change to. This list goes all the way back to early alpha (a) and beta (b) versions.

, Select the version you want to play from the list. The correct files will be downloaded and installed automatically. Once the process is complete, close the version changer program.

, After being patched, you can log in and play Minecraft just as you normally would. You will not be able to connect to servers that aren’t running your version, but you can play single player or on servers that are running your version. Mods may be incompatible."

Prepare to acquire the required items for brewing.,
Make a Nether portal.,
Enter the portal.,
Create a brewing stand by placing 3 cobblestone on the bottom 3 squares of a crafting table.,
Turn the fuel (the blaze rods) into blaze powder by placing it in the crafting table.,
Collect Nether wart which grows in Nether fortresses on soul sand.,
Collect the other supplies:

Redstone (Found underground around diamond and lava level, in which each ore yields 4-5 redstone dust.,
Once you have collected all the ingredients, proceed to the next part.

,
Place your brewing stand down on a block that is sturdy and resistant to explosions.,
Add a cauldron to the brewing area if there is no standard way to get water, or the brewing area is far from a water system.,
Add decorations like bookshelves to give your brewing area a cool look.,
Know the basics.,
Add ingredients based on your goals for positive potions:


To make a Strength Potion, add a blaze powder to an Awkward Potion.,
Add different ingredients to make negative effects:


Add a spider eye to an Awkward Potion to make a Poison Potion.,
Customize the potions in other ways if desired:


Add glowstone dust to most potions to increase their power of effect.,Have fun messing around with whatever potion you have made!",How to Do Basic Brewing in Minecraft," This will require a trip to the Nether and visiting a structure called a Nether fortress to collect an item called a blaze rod, which drops from a blaze in the fortress. It is ideal that you take multiple of these as they will be very important in brewing.;
, To create a Nether portal to reach the blazes, you need 14 blocks of obsidian to create a 4x5 square. You may leave out the four corners, meaning you'd need only 10 obsidian to create it. After creation you must immediately light it with a flint and steel, which can be made from a piece of flint and an iron ingot which you may have found early on.

, This will transport you the Nether Dimension. It may take a long time to find the fortress depending on how far it is from your portal. Once you have found the fortress, find the blaze spawners, which look like a black miniature cage with a blaze spinning inside. Kill as many blazes as you want; blaze rods are absolutely important and will be used as fuel in brewing. 20 blaze rods will last at least 1200 potion creations or upgrades.

, Finally add the blaze rod to the very middle to create a brewing stand.

, You now have two  ingredients to brew, the fuel and blaze powder to use for strength potions.

, You do not need to always get your Nether wart from the fortress, you may grow Nether wart by placing harvested Nether wart on soul sand. You then need to seek out glowstone dust, which you may find by breaking glowstone in the Nether; fortunately there is an abundant supply almost everywhere in the Nether.

, You may also kill witches which drop 0-6 redstone at a time.)
Fermented Spider Eyes (Created by placing a brown mushroom, spider eye, and sugar in a crafting table.)
Sugar (Crafted by placing a sugarcane in a crafting table; sugarcane is found in shorelines along rivers, beaches, and lakes.)
Glistering Melon (Crafted by surrounding a melon with golden nuggets in a crafting table.)
Spider Eye (Dropped by spiders, cave spiders, and witches.)
Ghast Tear (Dropped by ghasts in the Nether.)
Golden Carrot (Crafted by surrounding a carrot with golden nuggets.)
Pufferfish (Obtained by fishing.)
Rabbit's Foot (Rare drop from a rabbit.)
Dragon's Breath (Optional, dropped by the endgame boss known as the Ender Dragon.)
Gunpowder (Dropped by creepers when killed; can also be dropped by witches.)
Magma Cream (Dropped by magma cubes in the Nether.)

,, Or you may place your stand in a secure place and use hopper systems to automate it. The choice is up to you., It is also better to have two separate chests to differentiate the place to store the ingredients and potions. Add a crafting table because brewers need to craft frequently to get their desired materials., Adding an enchantment table and book shelves makes the place more mysterious and bright, since enchantment tables emit light.


Redstone torches are sure to give ambience of a mysterious brewing room, so are item frames with enchanted books and a stick to look like a wand.

, There are 4 base potions needed to brew potions. You simply have to fuel the stand with powder, add the 3 water bottles to their respective positions and add a Nether Wart to make an Awkward Potion, glowstone dust to make a Thick Potion, or redstone to make a Mundane Potion, and a fermented spider eye to make a Potion of Weakness.,
For a Regeneration Potion, add a glistering melon.
For a Water Breathing Potion, add a pufferfish.
For Fire Resistance Potion, add a magma cream.
For a Leaping Potion, add a rabbit's foot.
For a Night Vision Potion, add a golden carrot
For a Swiftness Potion, add sugar.

,
For an Invisibility Potion, which counters night vision, add a fermented spider eye to a Night Vision Potion.
For a Weakness Potion, add a fermented spider eye to a water bottle.
For Harming Potions, add a fermented spider eye to either a Healing Potion or Poison Potion.
For a Slowness Potion, add a fermented spider eye to either a Potion of Swiftness or Leaping.

, For example if you add it to a Harming Potion, if it upgrades to a Harming Potion II using glowstone dust it will do more damage.
Add redstone to increase the time of effect of a potion.
Add gunpowder to transform the potion into a Splash Potion, which is effective since it is thrown instead of drank, making it easy to use it in combat.
Lingering Potions are made by combining Dragon's Breath and Splash Potions. Lingering Potions can be thrown and will stay and give the effect it provides to anyone in range of the area of effect; it will stay for a long time, making it useful for PVP and giving buffs to your team when playing UHC's or Survival Games. It is also used to create tipped arrows.

Consider why you're deleting your Minecraft account.,
Uninstall the game from your computer.,
Make sure your Minecraft account is attached to Mojang.,
Log into your Mojang account and request deletion.,
Contact Mojang's customer support.",How to Delete a Minecraft Account," For most people interested in deleting their accounts, they're wanting to rid themselves of Minecraft due to its addictive properties. Many people have found countless hours swept away by the game, and would prefer to do something else. Because the deletion process is irreversible, you should take some time to consider whether you really want to quit. If you think you can't have it as part of a healthy life, then proceed with deleting it.


If you're addicted, try limiting, rather than deleting your Minecraft experience. You might try putting a strict limit on the amount you can play each day; that way, you'll have lots of other time to do other things. While it may seem hard at first, the self-restraint you'll learn from this will actually help you in many other ways.
Because there is a monetary value associated with a Minecraft account, it may be preferable to give the account away to someone who might get enjoyment out of it, rather than deleting it completely.;
, Uninstalling the Minecraft software is a good first step towards quitting. Delete any trace of it on your computer. If you have a console, toss out or trade in the disk. If you play it via a mobile device, remove the app. Uninstalling the software but leaving the account intact is another option, as it'll give you the opportunity to return to it if you ever have a change of heart.

, This shouldn't be a problem if you have a relatively newer account, but older accounts will require migrating your Minecraft info to Mojang. You won't be able to follow through with deleting your account otherwise. This can be done via the Mojang account migration form. , Go to https://account.mojang.com. From there, log in and access your 'Settings' tab. At the bottom, there should be a 'Request Deletion' button. Click the button, and you'll be asked to verify some of your information. In the majority of cases, your account should now be eliminated.

, If you cannot delete an account on your own for whatever reason, you might try contacting Mojang directly. They'll either be able to guide you through the process, or delete the account for you themselves. If you only recently purchased the account (within the past 30 days) and want to delete it, you should send Mojang an email requesting a refund.

, Another option is to watch your house, wait for the griefer, and either see their username, or take a screenshot of them griefing you.

, Post in the chat to warn others users of the danger.

, We all hate being griefed, it sucks right? So why not work on preventing it?;
, If you say leave a chest full of important stuff out in the open, the more like someone is to steal all of it, and to destroy your home.

, This one is pretty self explanatory.


Make sure friendly people know where these traps are though, no sense in slaughtering a friend.

, If they know there is good chance they will die, they are a lot less likely to try it.

, Above all though, know that from time to time someone is going to grief you, so have a secret backup supply stash ready, and move on. Make sure this secret stash is thousands of blocks away from spawn and use a x-ray proof design. It should get you back on your feet especially if there are no admins, mods, or owners around.

, There are plenty of anti-griefing Bukkit plugins out there ranging from region-protection to block logging. Check them out!

In single player, place the chest somewhere obvious, such as on the top of a hill.
In multiplayer, hide the chest underground to hide it from other players. Mark the land above it with a torch so you know where to dig later.

, These coordinates will tell you exactly where you are in the world. Check them while standing next to your chest:


In Minecraft for Windows or Mac, press F3. (If that doesn't work, press Fn+F3.)
In Minecraft for Xbox or Playstation, make a map, equip it, and use it.
Unfortunately, there is no way to find coordinates in Minecraft Pocket Edition. Try making a compass and following it back to your spawn point instead.

, With the coordinates open, walk around and watch the X, Y, and Z values change. Find the direction that causes these values to approach the coordinates you wrote down earlier. When you reach them, look around for your chest. Pick up your items, and walk back to your spawn point using the same method.


X and Y are the North/South and East/West coordinates. Get these right first.
The Z value tells you how far you are above or below sea level. You can usually ignore this unless you died underground or on a steep mountain slope.

Obtain redstone.,
Obtain a stick.,
Combine the redstone and stick via the crafting menu.,
Have extra redstone handy to create a flicker effect.",How to Create Flickering Redstone Torches in Minecraft1," The most important ingredient in a flickering redstone torch (and the one that gives it its name) is Redstone. Redstone can be obtained in a variety of ways, though perhaps the most straightforward is to simply mine it from redstone ore. Redstone ore occurs naturally underground and requires an iron pickaxe or better to mine. Each block of redstone ore yields 4-5 redstone. Redstone can also be obtained several other ways, including:By trading with a villager priest
By killing a witch, who drop 0-6 redstone when they die
By collecting redstone dust in jungle temples, where it naturally occurs
By crafting from a block of redstone. (Uses 8 redstone);
, As is the case with ordinary torches, redstone torches require a wooden stick for crafting. Luckily, this ingredient is fairly common, as it is used in many craftable items. Sticks can be crafted from two wood planks (one above the other), which, combined, will yield 4 sticks. Other ways to obtain sticks include:Killing a witch, who drop 0-6 sticks when they die
Finding them in a bonus chest (Not in Minecraft Pocket Edition)

, When you have your redstone and stick, open your inventory and use the crafting menu to combine them. A single redstone torch is created from one stick and one redstone.


A word of caution when using redstone torches - since the light they provide is significantly less than that of a normal torch, mobs are able to spawn nearby. Don't be caught unprepared!

, You've now created a fully functional redstone torch. However, to create a pulsing/flickering effect, you'll need additional supplies of redstone for the purpose of laying redstone circuitry. Thus, you may need to mine more redstone ore as needed or be ready to obtain it through one of the other methods.

Find a suitable wall.,
Place your torch at the top of the wall.,
Add redstone dust to the top of the wall.,
If desired, surround the redstone dust with blocks.",How to Create Flickering Redstone Torches in Minecraft2," For your redstone torch to flicker, it must be mounted on a wall, rather than planted on the floor. Find the spot where you want your final flickering torch to be. Note that the torch must be mounted on the highest block of the wall - for the ""flicker"" to work, it can't be any lower.


Also note that because it's necessary to lay redstone dust on top of the block the torch is on, you'll want unimpeded access to the top of the wall.

, Equip your redstone torch and mount it on the top block of the wall. To be clear, you must mount it on the side of the top block in the wall, not on the very top of the wall.

, Lay one redstone dust on top of the block with the redstone torch on it. This should cause your torch (and the dust) to begin to flash on and off.

, If the redstone dust on top of your wall ruins the aesthetic of your structure, you may want to hide the dust by concealing in the construction of your wall. Use any sort of block you wish to conceal the redstone dust. Note, however, that, if you're creating a building, you may need to work these blocks into the plans for your ceiling..

Get to know the game.,
Join the game!,
Gather your armor.,
Develop a strategy!,
Stay hidden.,
Barricade the monument you are in.,
Repeat the process!",How to Destroy a Nebula Monument in Avicus," Before you can weave in and out of structures and defeat member upon member, you have to understand how the game really works. The focus point of DTM is to destroy (hence the name, destroy-the-monument) the other team's obsidian. These monuments are located on either side of the spawn point. Each time you respawn into your team's headquarters, you will be equipped with materials such as a stone or iron sword, golden apples, a diamond pickaxe, so on and so forth.;
, Unless you buy ranks gold, emerald, or diamond, you cannot choose the team you're placed on. Don't be discouraged, however! The teams are equally divided among the players so no one team is overpowered. Depending on the team you are placed on, you will be assigned a different color. This color is the color of the base and armor so you do not confuse your teammates as enemies.

, Some games can have up to 80, or possibly more, players on a team, so it is essential to stock up on armor and golden apples. The closer you get to a monument, the more you may be attacked in efforts of saving the obsidian. Iron and diamond armor is the best for this type of gameplay. Three blocks of either iron, gold, or diamond is enough for a full set of protection, so don't take more than you need!

, Diving headfirst into a crowd of the opposite team probably isn't the best idea, nor is going alone. You want to gather some friends, or teammates to say the least, to go along with you. The bigger group you have, the better chances you have of destroying the monuments. The best routes to take conclude of either going underground, above, or around the bases. For the journey you will need a lot of blocks to get you there!

, Though crouching may be a slower way of moving through the map, it covers up your name tag so others can't pinpoint you. This works best if you are underneath a base, for the other team will be able to see the name tag sticking above the ground! Make sure that your path is not too close to the middle, either. It takes more blocks and time the further away from the spawn point you go, but it also makes it hard to get shot down by flying arrows.

, The moment you get to the obsidian, it's best that you cover yourself with a hard material (such as wood) to give yourself some time to break the obsidian.

, Throughout each map, there will usually be 2-3 monuments around a base. Go from one to another for the best result! Breaking monuments gives you an increased stat rate, and hey, perhaps a reputation!

Find a mountain you want to convert, or build your own.,
Build a pyramid with the rock blocks.,
Add ridges, features, and mountain like valleys into the side.,
Fill the hole with lava.,
Use Arrows, dispensers, and ignition to shoot ""sparks"" out of your volcano.,
Use TNT and gravel for an explosion.",How to Create a Volcano in Minecraft1," Beginners might want to take an existing mountain and make it your volcano, but making your own mountain is easy as well. You'll need the following blocks:


Cobblestones (to make the base of the pyramid)
Lava
Red Stone Torches (Optional)
Sticky Pistons (Optional)
Fireworks (Optional);
, Start by setting up a basic pyramid, which is much easier to build. To do it, build a large square or circle. On top of this square, put another outline of blocks, moved in one space to the center. Keep making these squares, each one block shorter on each side, until you only have one block on top. The inside should be hollow.

, Once you have your pyramid, add and subtract blocks to sculpt your volcano into the correct shape.


Beginner builders can also stick to the pyramid shape as well.
Remove the top of the volcano.
Build a platform 3-4 layers underneath the top of the volcano. Make sure there are no holes in it -- this holds your lava.

, You can build ruts or cut out openings in the sides of the mountain to make it flow, or simply let it bubble over and around the top.

, This takes some work, but you can put dispensers on the platform you've made and fill it with arrows and redstone torches.

, In your crater, place a layer of obsidian down for the platform, as it won't explode. Then place an ignition block (redstone switch) down in the corner and fill the platform with a layer of TNT. Top the rest off with 4-5 layers of gravel, then pour lava into the last 1-2 layers, right up to the rim of the volcano. Ignite and enjoy!

Connect the wires to the ""AND-gate.,
Test your lock, now that everything is done.,
Congratulations!",How to Create a Lever Combination Lock in Minecraft," This will be a door (iron or wood), a button to submit the combination, and two signs. The button is to send a circuit that checks if the door is able to be unlocked. The door is the main source of protection. And lastly, the signs are to tell you and your guests what to do.


Be aware that when an activating device (whether it be a button or lever) is beside a door, it will open it. So be sure to keep the entry button at least one block away from the door. If you don't, when your guests push the entry button, the door will open just by the button itself. Now you definitely don't want that!;
, Place the levers in one block intervals as you have done with the button.

, This will create the code. Do not place redstone torches on all of them as this will mess-up the circuit. Levers with redstone torches on them are required to be in the ""Down"" position and surrounding levers must be in the ""Up"" position for the door to be able to be unlocked. As an example, assume you have chosen levers ""2"" and ""3"" as the ""Down"" levers.

, The ""Authenticator"" should have every lever connected to it in any way possible. Remember, don't connect the entry button to it! The ""Authenticator"" should have a redstone torch on one side. This is how this works:


When all levers are switched in a position so that all the redstone wires connected to the ""Authenticator"" are off or not glowing, it will allow the redstone torch connected to the side of the ""Authenticator"" to send an active signal to something called an ""AND-gate"" which will be explained in the next step. At this step, you have to remove the signs on the inner part of the circuit that, at this point, are superfluous to the combination lock. You needn't worry about this.

, Basically, what an ""AND-gate"" does is it allows two signals connected to it to shut off two redstone torches. This will turn on the third torch which sends the signal to open the door. To create an ""AND-gate"":


Place three blocks vertically facing the main line of the levers
Place two redstone torches on each side, kind of like an ant's antennae.
Place one redstone wire in the middle of these torches.
place another redstone torch on the other side, on the middle block. This one will send the unlocking signal to the door.

, There will be three wires that should be connected to the ""AND-gate"". The following three steps are very important and mandatory for proper function of your combination lock. If you have any troubles with this part, check the image to the right.


The wire from the ""Authenticator"" should be connected to a part of the ""AND-gate"".
The wire connecting the entry button should be connected to a part of the ""AND-gate"".
Don't forget to use the third redstone torch on the ""AND-gate"" (the one on the middle block's side) to connect to the door, allowing it to open.


You've completed this part. Awesome! You'll be pleased to know that the hardest work, is now over. This is a great time to enhance your ""Entry line"" (the one that will open your door) by adding some diodes/redstone repeaters that will slow down the circuit, thus, allowing you to enter faster.

, Remember that the levers which have redstone torches on the back of them are to be ""Down"" whereas the others need to be ""Up"". When you're done, press the entry button and the door will open!

, You've done it. Now see what more you can do.

Just press any key and Command Prompt will automatically close for you.",How to Create a Bukkit Minecraft Server1,", Below that heading you will see two links that say ""In browser"" and ""Download"". Click on the link that says Download.

, Download this server and place it anywhere on your computer for now. Be sure it's in a place you'll remember later so you can access it more easily, like your desktop.

, If you see a version that matches your Minecraft version, download that file.

If you don't see one that matches your Minecraft version, you will either have to use a developmental build (not recommended for beginners) or play with a downgraded version of Minecraft that matches the current recommended build you just saw.






, Now would be the time to move the Minecraft_Server.exe you downloaded before to your desktop.

, This can be named anything you want, but try to name it something that explains what will be in the folder. ""Server"", ""MC_Server"", and ""Minecraft_Server"" are all decent examples of possible folder names.

,, Select ""Rename"" and name the file ""craftbukkit"".

, Enter the following, formatted the same way (for Windows):

java -Xmx1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar -o true
PAUSE

, Under the drop-down menu that says ""Save as type: Text Documents (*.txt)"", click on All Files. Save the file as: run.bat

, Now, double click on run.bat and you might see Command Prompt open up and a bunch of error messages. This is completely normal the first time you run a server since it is generating all of the files necessary. Once the world is generated, stop the server by typing ""stop"" in Command Prompt without quotes.

, If you go back to your server folder, you should see a bunch of files that were created after running your server. Leave these alone for now.

Installing and customizing plugins is a little complicated to most people.,
Once there, click Download on the right side of the screen.,
Now click back on your server directory folder to go back to the section with your run.bat file.,
Essentials has now been installed to your server.,
In the server.properties file, you can customize your server to suit you and your players' play-style.,
Another option is to change the default gamemode.,
Finally, save the server.properties file and close it.,
With your spawn set, all you need to do is learn how to portforward and you're on your way to playing on your Minecraft server with your friends.

",How to Create a Bukkit Minecraft Server2," For the sake of this article, let's just install default plugins that are essential to running a non-Vanilla Multiplayer Server. Ironically, we'll be installing the plugin called Essentials. Open a new browser tab and go to http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/essentials/

, You'll be taken to a new page, so just click Download again. Once you finish downloading the plugin, open up the .zip folder and copy the .jar files you see in it. Go to the folder that has your server files in it. You should see a folder called plugins. Open that up and paste the files in the folder.

, Run the server, and you should now see the tag in some messages on start-up. This is just creating the necessary files in your plugins folder. Now stop the server as described above.

, Go back to the main folder of your server and somewhere by the run.bat file should be something called server.properties. Open this file. You might have a prompt pop up telling you to search the web for something to open this file, but just click on the option to choose from existing programs, hit OK and select Notepad.

, You can also change the amount of people that can enter your server, and you can even set it to ""whitelist"" mode, which would only allow people you specify in a different file to log in to the server. Go ahead and mess around with a few of the settings as you see fit. Change some of the values that say ""true"" to ""false"". For example: By default, allow-nether is set to true. The Nether tends to cause lag on servers. Change allow-nether=true to allow-nether=false

, The gamemode by default is set to 0, which is the Survival gamemode. Change this value 0 to 1, which is Creative.

, Double-click run.bat again to start up your server and open up your regular Minecraft client once the server is completely up.. Log in to Minecraft, navigate to the Multiplayer Server page, select Direct Connect, and type in ""localhost"" without quotes. Join the server and you should successfully join the server you created. On command prompt, type in the command: op <your exact account name here> (as shown in the picture to the right). This command will give your account name operator status, which gives you access to just about every command. Choose a good looking spot and hit the T key in Minecraft and type: /setspawn

Add food:


Cooked steak for canned meat
Cooked fish for canned fish

Rabbit stew and mushroom stew for meat soup
Cooked pork for sausage (better if you retexture it!),
Add extra supplies:


Milk for healing cream (as it stops poison effects)
Potion of invisibility for camouflage paint

Potion of night vision for eye cream
Texture leather armour into the district clothes and camouflage clothes.,
If you want, you can add small amounts of gold or chainmail armour textured like a t-shirt.,
Reap tributes.,
Have a lobby for each district.,
Have a Capital area.,
Have a starting lobby, which is when players first spawn.,
When the tributes are selected, dress them in costumes made from armour (or other wearable items that are re-textured).,
Make parkour areas.,
Have your friends or people who know the game well become gamemakers and explain the game.,
Make suites for the tributes, containing beds and showers and chests.,
Have a stylist for each tribute helping them sort clothing and ""beautify"" them.

,
Give beautiful dishes and foods.,

Have ""Caesar"" interview the tributes.,
Have a teleport for each player to their starting point.,
Have gamemakers in creative mode video the games from their computer, send it to the platform.,
When the feast is to begin, refill the chests with supplies and announce in the chat box.,
When the game is near the end (3-4 tributes still alive), spawn killer bunnies and other non-flying monsters in from the edges (mutations), the tributes then would start running for survival up the cornucopia, and this is a wordless deathmatch.

,
When the victor is decided, kill the mutations with a command, and announce the victory.",How to Create a Hunger Games Game in Vanilla Minecraft," Create a wall high enough to prevent the tributes from escaping, and make sure there are no ways to somehow jump over it. The arena must be bigger than 60x60 to create the fun. (Small arenas are also fine as this could provide for quick death-matches.);
, Make a redstone circuit to fill the cornucopia after emptied for the feast and land mines with TNT to prevent cheating (use redstone!) If you installed mods with ""backpacks"", add them as they are more realistic.

, If the arena is big, use commands to change biomes and then make smaller changes as its easier. If it is a city map, ruins map or is a structure that does not naturally generate in Minecraft, you will have to build it. If there are many identical structures (such as multiple complicated redstone circuits that are identical), use commands or mods to duplicate it. If you have a mod, you can make a biome that your tributes will have a hard time recognizing.

, Introduce to your tributes how the arena and weapons work (especially if you used a weapon mod or re-textured your weapons). Give your tributes suites and capital-like feasts. Have a parkour area, maybe a trap-escaping practice area, and so on, have players who are familiar with the weapons become gamemakers.

, Create rabbits to be hunted for food. No killer bunnies; that will be for mutations later. You can also texture the animals and explain their habits to make new animals.

, Add traps with command blocks or redstone and if a tribute wanders in, possibility is that they might get killed. Do not add a specific trap in attempt to kill a specific tribute! If somehow the tribute or others find out that a gamemaker is specifically trying to kill a player in the games, they might leave the server or give you bad comments as it is very unfair to be specially targeted by a gamemaker, who can easily kill a tribute with a command. Only use commands that spawns monsters or creates fire or water. Never use teleport commands and kill commands on tributes.

, Re-texture furnaces to look like bonfires and have a lot of them hanging around, as tributes cannot craft furnaces to cook the food they have hunted.

, Make gold and iron swords. Enchant the swords if needed (or if there are modded weapons that are too strong). Never use diamond Try your best to avoid very strong enchantments or very strong weapons. Do not give any fire enchantments, as it will mess up the game. Avoid using guns or cannons or any modern weapons in mods, they will mess up the game.

,,


Make the splash potion of harming a kunai or throwing knife
Make the splash potion of poison a poison kunai or poisoned knife

Potion of Regeneration: Medical Syrup
Potion of Healing: Medicine Pills
Potion of Swiftness: Rehydrating Sugar Drink
Potion of Leaping: Excitant
Potion of Poison: Nightlock Syrup (don't name it that way, name it energy drink)

,
Add sheep and rabbits for the tributes to hunt (have furnaces textured like bonfires hanging around!)

, Do not give helmets for district clothes as it looks weird.

, Have armour stands or chests containing them in loot houses dressed like deserted houses. Make sure you add a item can-destroy tag if tributes are playing in adventure mode.

, Build a reaping area and drop random tribute heads from a dropper circuit. If its only you and a couple of friends or a downloadable map, have 24 rooms and send them ""reaping letters"" telling them that they are reaped to the games. If this is a server or if a lot of other players will be playing the game, have gamemakers with weapons ready to go. If you have built lobbies for each district, make sure that each lobby has its own reaping area and separate dropper circuits. Have a peacekeeper room in each lobby with a teleport to all the other districts.


Make sure all the players in game shows up at the reaping, and make sure to take out the heads of players who have already left the game (a command circuit will help on that)
If someone does not show up at the reaping, have peacekeepers imprison them afterwards, if it is hard to count, craft a map and keep track of them, have peacekeepers patrol the area or use a command to teleport players by force and keeping them there.

, For the career districts, put training equipment in a specific room. The lobby doesn't have to be big, but it should contain the following things:


sleeping area
eating area
wilderness (forbidden to enter)
peacekeeper room
prison
industrial area (for the district's industry)
reaping area

, Fill it with beautifully decorated blocks and food (cakes or modded foods). Lay the roads with nether bricks and glowstone instead of cobblestone or coarse dirt. If you have decoration mods it will add a surprised feeling to the tributes. Have a huge mansion for the president (skip this if you don't have a president). Build the training center and arena here, and have a lot of peacekeepers or guard dogs here; this is the heart of your game. Make the capital centered area centered, being the most protected of all districts.

, Their district and job will be randomized (offer each a book and quill to write about their background and in-game name (i.e. Sycorax Mullaska, Astrid Ondalina, Kallista Atlantica, or Warrior cats styled names such as Honeystream, Dewclover, Iceflame, and so on. Never use Minecraft usernames as it is often unrealistic and very unclear). If you want, give them a choice to skip the backgrounds and reaps and go straight to the games as an extra tribute or a random volunteer.

, Have them ride on horses, pigs, slow minecarts, or boats and create the parade. Allow tributes to change their skins.

, Practice combat zones with wooden swords and have tributes wear strong armour to prevent death. Use snowballs as arrows. Have a camouflage area which tributes wear re-textured camo leather armour to hide from enemies.

, Use zombies and skeletons as dummies for fighting (as they will fight back), witches will make good replicates for tributes with potions.

, Make the room look like a palace compared to the shack-like houses in the poorer districts. Also make a room in each suite for the stylist.

,, Have tributes take foods from item frames on the walls. Putting in desserts or decorated dishes from mods will make the meal more interesting. Have mundane (no effect) potions for drinks.

, Make sure to be fair to all the tributes and never over-score or underscore a tribute on purpose.

, Tell a gamemaker watching to videotape it and post it on a specific public place (such as a specific Twitter or Facebook account so the tributes can see it afterwards).

, Make the foot-stand one block with a pressure plate so when the tribute steps off, it explodes. Have a piston system remove the TNT once the countdown is finished.

, Meanwhile, have them check that no one is cheating, have weapons ready if something is to happen. Tell the gamemakers to announce the deaths at the end of the cornucopia bloodbath. Craft maps for them to keep control of who's where.

, Have several gamemakers videotape it, as the feast comes to also a bloodbath.

,, Give the victor a home in the victor's village (in the capital lobby or as a special district). Offer them lifetime wheat, milk, and eggs. Give them a horse or a cow. Have sugar and cake as a gift to their district house (as most districts are very poor and lack food)


If you want, put the victor's background written by him/herself in a Hunger Games museum in the capital.

, If you don't want to make animal-dinos, you can easily build a statue of a dinosaur, or you can do both. You could do something like build a ""Dirtosaur"" and a ""Cobbledon"", out of simply dirt and cobblestone. With all the blocks in the game, you can make any type of dinosaur you want!

, Make it like a zoo. Have big, wide open enclosures. For any flying dinosaurs, make sure their enclosures have roofs.

, Each craftable item has its own recipe. When you drag the right items into the crafting area, the result of the recipe will appear in the box on the right. Minecraft doesn't tell you the recipes, so it's up to you to discover them.


Example: Drag a block of wood into the crafting area, leaving the other three squares empty. The box on the right should show a picture of wooden planks, with the number four next to it. (To get wood, move your mouse over a tree trunk and hold down the left mouse button.)


, This will put it in your inventory, and destroy the ingredients in the crafting area.


Example: Drag the wooden planks to your inventory. The wood you used to make them will disappear.

, The inventory crafting screen only allows you to craft certain items. To make most Minecraft items, you'll need a crafting table. Cover the 2 x 2 crafting grid with wooden planks to build one. Drag the crafting table from the box on the right to your hotbar. (Your hotbar is the line of items at the bottom of the screen.)


This recipe won't work if you just put one stack of four planks in the same square. Minecraft recipes care about what type of item is in each square, not how many items there are total.
Right-click your stack of wooden planks to separate the items into multiple stacks. If you are on a Mac without a right-click button, use Control+click or use trackpad commands.

, Close your inventory by pressing E again. Select the crafting table in your hotbar. Move your mouse over a solid block, and right-click to put down the crafting table.

, Right-click the crafting table to open up a new screen. This looks similar to your inventory crafting screen, except it has a 3 x 3 grid. You can fit more items in this crafting area, which means you can make many more recipes.

, Minecraft is all about turning your items into better and better tools. Here's how to make a wooden pickaxe, one of the first tools many people make in a new game:


Drag wood into one square of the crafting area to make wooden planks.
Place two planks in a vertical line in the crafting area to make sticks.
Place three planks across the top row of the crafting area. Place a stick in the center square, and another stick just below it.
This last recipe makes a wooden pickaxe. Equip it in your hotbar and select it, and you can break stone blocks.

, You can experiment to discover recipes yourself, or look up instructions online. Here are some useful basic recipes to get you started:



Make a sword to fight monsters.

Craft other tools to break down blocks faster or allow you to break more advanced blocks. Get a stone axe and pickaxe as soon as you can, then mine iron ore so you can upgrade again.

Build a furnace out of cobblestone to cook food and to smelt iron ore into usable metal.

Make torches to light your house, preventing monsters from appearing inside.

Make armor out of leather or iron to protect yourself.

Craft a bed so you can sleep through night and set a new spawn point.

, The bookshelf tab on the left takes you to the crafting interface. This shows you a list of all recipes you can craft with the items currently in your inventory.


If you don't see any recipes, try chopping down some wood, then opening your crafting screen again.
The number next to each recipe tells you how many times you can craft it with your current items. If a recipe is greyed out and has no number, you have all the ingredients, but not enough of them.

, Select the item you want to craft on the crafting screen. When you select it, the grid on the right will fill up with the items the recipe requires. To transform these items into something new, tap the button underneath the grid, next to the name of the item you are making.


For example, if wood is in your inventory, the planks recipe (a wooden cube icon) should appear in your crafting screen. Select it, and you'll see one wooden log in the grid on the right. Tap the button underneath ""Planks"" to turn this log into four planks.
The game has several types of wood, so the button will actually say something like ""Oak Planks"" or ""Spruce Planks."" Different wood types look different, but they all work the same way in recipes., Only a small number of recipes are available from your inventory crafting screen. To access more recipes, you need a crafting table. Make sure you have four planks in your inventory, then make the crafting table recipe. This looked like a wooden cube with a grid on top.

, Before you can use the crafting table, you'll need to put it down somewhere. You might have already figured out how to place blocks. If not, here's how:


Tap the block tab in your inventory to return to your items.
Tap the crafting table, then tap one of the hotbar slots at the bottom of the screen.
Close the inventory by tapping X.
Tap the crafting table in your hotbar, then tap a nearby, flat, solid block to put down the table.

, Just touch the crafting table while standing next to it to bring up the full crafting screen. This works exactly like the one in your inventory, but there are many more recipes available.

, The crafting screen only shows you recipes made from items you have in your inventory. To find more recipes, fill your inventory with different kinds of blocks, plus items that drop from animals and monsters. Here are a few items to gather first:


Use wood to make planks, and planks to make sticks.
Combine planks and sticks to make various tools. One of the most useful is the wooden pickaxe, which lets you mine stone blocks for cobblestone.
With cobblestone, planks, and sticks, you can make stone tools. A stone axe, pickaxe, and sword are all very useful recipes to craft early on.
Use your pickaxe to mine new blocks like coal or iron ore to discover more useful recipes. You'll need to craft a furnace out of cobblestone to melt some ores into useful metals.

To move between these groups, press the right and left bumpers (R1 and L1 on PlayStation)., Use the analog stick or d-pad to move left and right between selected recipes in the same group. (You might only see one recipe early in the game, before you have more ingredients.)


A recipe will only show up if you have the ingredients for it. If you don't see anything, chop down a tree for some wood and check again.
Some related recipes are grouped into one column. If you see a vertical line of recipes appear when you select a recipe, press up or down to cycle through them., When a recipe is selected, the grid in the lower left shows you which items the recipe requires. If you want to turn those items into the item you selected, press the crafting button. That's A on Xbox and Wii U, or X on PlayStation.The item will appear in your inventory.


If you don't have enough of an ingredient, that box of the grid has a red background., Under the Structures tab, make planks out of wood, then make a crafting table out of four planks. The crafting table gives you access to many more recipes.

Select it, then put it on a nearby, flat, solid block by pressing LT on Xbox, L2 on PlayStation, or ZL on Wii U., Position yourself so the ""+"" crosshairs are directly over the crafting table. Open the crafting menu again. You should now see a 3 x 3 grid in the lower left, instead of the basic 2 x 2 grid. Many more recipes are available when using the crafting table, although you may need to collect more items before you can see this.

, Here's the Minecraft 101 approach for crafting items in a new Survival Mode game, after you make the crafting table:


Turn planks into sticks.
In the Tools & Weapons screen, turn planks and sticks into a wooden pickaxe. Select the wooden pickaxe in your hotbar, and use it to break stone apart into cobblestone.
Combine cobblestone and sticks to make a stone pickaxe (for mining stone and ore), axe (for trees), and sword (for fighting).
Once you find iron ore, craft a furnace (under Structures). Use it to smelt the ore into iron ingots. You can use these to make better tools, weapons, armor, and more.

You can get four wood planks from a single wood block by placing it in the center of your crafting table grid.


You'll be using four of the planks for the fence and two to create sticks.;
, Use two of the planks you crafted from the wood blocks to make sticks. You can turn two planks into four sticks by placing one plank in the center of the crafting grid and one directly below it.

, Place one stick in the center of the crafting grid and another directly below it. Place planks on either sides of the sticks so that the bottom two rows go: planks, stick, plank.

Craft any pickaxe.,
Make your way to the Nether.,
Find a Nether Fortress.,
Mine the Nether Brick.,
Return to your crafting table and craft the fence pieces.,
Add the fence pieces to your inventory.",How to Craft a Fence in Minecraft2," You'll need a pickaxe in order to mine Nether Bricks. Since the Nether is a dangerous area, it'll be helpful to have a powerful pickaxe that allows for quick mining. Try to have an Iron pickaxe or better.


To craft an iron pickaxe, place a stick in the center of the grid and a stick directly underneath. In the top row, put iron ingots in each box.

, You can create Nether Brick Fences by using Nether Bricks. These can only be found in the Nether, which needs to be accessed through a Nether Portal. See Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft for instructions on creating a portal to the Nether.


The Nether is a tough area, so this should only be undertaken if you're well-equipped. Make sure to bring plenty of healing items. See Make Potions in Minecraft for a guide on crafting some healing potions.

, These foreboding structures are unmistakable as you make your way through the Nether. They generally look like bridges rising above the ground. You'll have the best chance to find one by traveling east or west. If you travel north or south, you may go thousands of blocks without seeing one.


Nether Fortresses are home to Blazes and Wither Skeletons, both of which drop valuable materials for other crafting projects.

, The main component of the Nether Fortress structure is Nether Brick. Use your pickaxe to mine it. You'll need at least six pieces to create a fence, though you'll likely want more for larger projects.


You'll get six Nether Brick Fences for every six blocks of Nether Brick you use, essentially meaning that every block is worth one fence. You'll need a multiple of six blocks to use the recipe, though.

, Once you have at least six blocks of Nether Bricks, you can start making your Nether Brick Fences. Fill the bottom two rows of the crafting table grid with Nether Brick blocks.

, For every six blocks you put into the crafting grid, you'll get six pieces of Nether Brick fence.

When scavenging Nether Brick fences, you must use a pickaxe or the pieces will not drop.

, Wooden fences can often be found in abandoned mineshafts being used as supports. You'll usually find a lot of them when you come across a mineshaft.

, You can typically find quite a few fences around villages, including on the roofs of dwellings. Don't worry, no one will get mad if you break them all down and take them for yourself.

, The library rooms in strongholds found underground can contain fences as railings and chandeliers. You'l usually find a couple of library rooms in each stronghold.

, With huts will have fences on the front entrance and in the windows.

, Besides being the place to find Nether Brick to make Nether Brick Fences, you can also just break down the fences already on the fortress. You must use a pickaxe to break these fences, or the pieces will not drop.

On Windows.,
On Mac.,
On Linux.,
Find the saves folder.,
Find somewhere safe to put it.,
Upload it to somewhere safe.",How to Create a Back Up of Your World on Minecraft," Minecraft’s folder is always stored in a hidden folder in your user profile’s directory unless you manually moved it to another directory. Windows, Mac and Linux computers have different default directories for the minecraft folder. The .minecraft folder will be found on the AppData folder, which is a hidden folder on the main directory of your user. The easiest method would be to press the Start button and the ‘R’ key at the same time, which brings you to the launch window which lets you run or access files and folders in your computer, then typing %appdata% then pressing enter. You could also press the windows key and then enter in %appdata% and select the AppData folder.


You could also manually access it by going to your user profile directory folder, which you can access by clicking on the Start menu or pressing the Start button on the keyboard and clicking on your user profile name. The AppData folder is a hidden folder though, so if you don’t know how to show hidden folders, open up Windows Explorer, click on the Organize tab on the upper left side of the window, and click on the Folder and Search Options on the drop-down menu. Afterwards, click on the View tab, scroll down a bit, and click on the check box that says Show hidden files and folders. After that, the Appdata would appear with a lighter-looking folder icon, which means you can access the folders within.
Once you access your AppData folder, double-click on the Roaming folder, and you’ll be able to find the .minecraft folder where all your saves are hidden away!;
, On Mac, you can access the minecraft folder by clicking on the Finder tab on the menu bar of your desktop, then clicking on the Go option. Type ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft into the text field and click Go, and you’ll be able to access your saves! This is the fastest way to navigate through your files and brings you directly into the folder.

, On Linux, seeing as there are too many versions of it to truly create a generalized instruction for it, this will just tell you where to find the directory using the command terminal. Pull up your command terminal (there are too many versions of Linux to reliably generalize this step), and type in /home/yourusername/.minecraft and it’ll lead you directly to the folder. Take note that the .minecraft directory is hidden in your home folder, like with the AppData folder in Windows.


Alternately, you can use the find command. Type in the command line find -iname ""minecraft"" and press enter, and you’ll be taken there.
A lot of GUIs for Linux resemble the Windows or Mac navigation, and are similar enough that the other steps can apply to it.

, Now that you’re in the .minecraft folder, you’ll see plenty of folders, but the most important folder is the saves folder. The saves folder holds all the worlds of your game, so if you are looking to backup all your worlds, copy that entire folder. If you are looking for a specific world, double-click on the saves folder and you’ll see a collection of folders with the same names as your worlds. From there, you can copy whichever world you want to backup.

, All three OS function similarly when copying and pasting the files into other directories: press ctrl+ C (cmd+c in Mac) or right click and select copy. Now, simply paste your folders into a desired folder of your computer, or you could copy it into a USB flash drive or portable hard drive!

, There are many websites that allow you to upload folders and files called file hosting sites. Some well-known examples are Mediafire, Dropbox or Megaupload (currently known as Mega). Most file hosting sites require membership, but a free one would suffice. Each website has different instructions, but generally speaking, you just drag and drop the folder into a specified box in the website, and it will upload it. Now that you have a backup, and presumably in multiple places, you can now breathe easy knowing that your worlds have another layer of safety! Crafting and messing around in the game may be fun, but always be careful when messing with it, both in-game and outside!

Get the required materials for the jukebox.,
To get wooden planks, take down a tree.",How to Craft a Jukebox on Minecraft1," You will need eight wooden planks and a diamond.;
, Turn the wood into wooden planks.


Any variety of wooden plank will work to craft a jukebox.
Diamonds are most prevalent between level 10 and 20. You will need to tunnel down to that level with an iron pick. Caves and lava pits are the easiest areas to search because they are open air pockets that let you see many blocks at once.
Avoid dropping the diamond into lava if you find it near a lava pit.
Diamonds are often found in clumps of two to eight blocks, so it is smart to mine the surrounding area once you find a clump.

, Head to a cave at Y-level 5-12.Look around for diamonds or strip mine. Mine up any diamonds you may see.

, Retrace your steps and go back up to the surface. Go to a biome where there are trees.

, Head to a tree and collect at least one block of wood. The type of wood does not matter. Transfer the block of wood to wood planks, then sticks.

, Using your two diamonds and one stick, craft a diamond sword in a crafting table. The diamonds go in the upper and middle left spots and the stick goes in the bottom left.

Wood can be found by destroying trees. You can destroy trees with an axe but it is also possible to punch them to obtain wood, although this takes significantly longer.;
, Put 3 Wool in the middle of the three by three grid.


Wool can be found by shearing or killing sheep. Shearing (which will not kill the sheep) requires sheers, which are made by crafting together 2 iron ingots. Shearing also potentially produces more wool than killing.

, After that, put the 3 Wooden Planks on all of the bottom slots.

, The result of this process will be a bed. Click on the bed and put the bed in your inventory or your hot bar.


Understand that there is no way to change the color of the bed. Wool color will not matter. The only way to change the color of the bed is to mod your game (using a mod such as this one)

, Place your bed in your house (or any place which keeps you safe) and sleep peacefully on your bed. This has the added bonus of creating a new spawn point, after which you will always spawn next to your bed after death.

Place a container above the hopper.,
Set up an automatic furnace station.,
Deactivate the hopper with redstone.,
Combine a minecart and hopper.,
Pick up items with the hopper.,
Unload items with another hopper.",How to Craft a Hopper in Minecraft," First, make a crafting table out of four wooden planks. Place the table and use it by right-clicking. Insert these items into the crafting grid, in exactly this order:First row: iron ingot, (blank), iron ingot
Second row: iron ingot, chest, iron ingot
Third row: (blank), iron ingot, (blank);
, If you don't have a chest, make one using eight wooden planks. Place them in the crafting table area, leaving the center square blank.


Use planks, not logs. To turn a log into four planks, just place one in the crafting area.

, Search in caves and underground to find iron ore, which looks like stone with beige flecks. Mine it using a stone pickaxe. Smelt the ore in a furnace to make iron ingots. Once you have your chest and iron, make the hopper using the recipe above.

, Hoppers are placed onto containers. If you click on the container, though, it will open instead of placing the hopper. To prevent this, crouch. While crouching, you can place hoppers onto containers.


To crouch on a computer, hold down ⇧ Shift. (On Mac, press ⇬ Caps Lock once for a permanent crouch.)
On most consoles, crouch by pressing the right analog stick once. Press again to stand up.

, Think of the hopper as a large funnel (the input) ending in a small spout (the output). Hold the hopper and click on the surface where you want the spout. In other words, click where you want items to end up. This is usually a chest or other container.


The hopper will not ever change direction after it's been placed. If you make a mistake, break it with a pickaxe, pick it up, and place it again.
You can place the spout above an object or on its side. You cannot place the spout underneath an object.

, Test your hopper by dropping items into it. If a container is attached, the item should move to the container. If there is no container attached, the item will stay in the hopper.


Look at the hopper inventory by interacting with it, just as you would with a chest.
The hopper only moves one item at a time, but the items move quickly. Even a large stack shouldn't take too long.

, Any container above the hopper will drop items into the hopper funnel. Try putting a furnace on top of the hopper, and smelt some iron. As each iron ingot appears, it will fall into the hopper, then into the container the hopper leads to.

, Hoppers work great with furnaces, which use many items and normally need frequent tending. Here's the setup you need to keep your furnace running on its own:A hopper on the side of the furnace will fill its fuel slot. Keep a chest above this hopper filled with coal or other fuel.
A hopper above the furnace will fill the top slot of the furnace. Keep a chest above this hopper filled with raw meat, ore, or other ingredients.
A hopper below the furnace will pick up the finished items. The small end of the hopper should connect to a chest, where these items will end up.
Your furnace will burn until it runs out of fuel or ingredients, or until the final chest runs out of space.

, An active redstone signal will lock the hopper, preventing items from entering.Attach the hopper to a lever or button using a line of redstone dust. Use the lever or button to turn your hopper on or off.

, Place the hopper directly above the minecart in a crafting area. The result is called a ""minecart with hopper."" This travels like a minecart, and picks up items like a hopper.


This travels much farther than a regular minecart when it passes over powered rails., The minecart and attached hopper will pick up any items on the tracks or right next to them. The hopper also grabs items from any container directly above it. Place the cart below any container and wait for it to fill up. Send it on its powered track to deliver items without having to travel with them.

, At the destination, build a hopper leading to a chest. Place the rails directly on top of this hopper, just like laying a track on the ground. When the moving hopper arrives at its destination, have it stop on this track. The items will automatically drop out into the hopper beneath it, then into the chest.


If you're a redstone whizkid, you can make a system that automatically sends the cart on its way once it's reached a certain capacity. The key to this is a redstone comparator. Because hoppers are disabled next to detector rails, this is tough to set up. Minecraft players have posted many creative solutions online."

, Place another iron bar in the second column in the bottom row of the 9 boxes in the top left of the crafting menu.

, Put a third iron bar in the third column of the middle row.

, There is an arrow pointing from these boxes to another single box. This box will now display a bucket. Click on the bucket to craft it.

, Drag the bucket into the first of the 9 boxes at the bottom of the inventory.

, Just press 1 on your keyboard to select the bucket in order to be able to gather water with it.

, This includes rivers, ponds, lakes and oceans.

, Stand as close as you can to the water’s surface, and right-click on the water to fill the bucket.


If the body of water is small enough, you will notice the water go lower.

, To achieve this, left-click on an area of flat ground to break 4 blocks in the shape of a 2-by-2 square.


In order to create an infinite water well, the square must be strictly of these dimensions.

, Do so by pressing on “E” and dragging it from your inventory to the first of 9 boxes in the bottom row of the inventory.

, Press 1 to activate the water bucket so that it may be used to place water.

, Just right-click the top-left corner of the 2-by-2 square hole. This will fill the area with water.


Notice that the water appears as though it is in motion. This means that if you attempt to take water out of the hole, you will eventually run out of water.

, You can do this by right-clicking the bottom-right corner of the square, directly diagonal to where the water was first placed. This will make the water stop moving and become level.


If you attempt to take water out of the hole now, it will automatically fill back up; therefore, you have an infinite water source.

, Water will flow 7 blocks in a straight line from its source (the place where you initially right-clicked) if contained in a channel or a trench. If you right-click again where the water stops flowing, the water will continue to flow for another 7 blocks.

, If you right-click with a water bucket equipped on flat ground, the water will flow 7 blocks in each direction from the source while also filling in the area in between each direction. The end result appears like a square with jagged edges very much like a postal stamp.

, Right-clicking with a water bucket on uneven ground will cause the water to flow to the closest lower edge, and ignore any flat or higher ground around it.


If the water only falls 1 block at a time, the water will continue to flow until it reaches flat ground where it will flow for another 7 blocks before stopping.

However, you need to enable cheats in your game before you can use them in the console. There are several ways to do this:In a single player game: Click the ""More World Options..."" button while setting up your game. On the next page, use the ""Allow Cheats"" button to make sure cheats are set to ""ON.""

In a multiplayer game: Cheats can be enabled by the host of the game — either the person hosting the LAN connection or the person who created the game server — in the same way as in a single player game. In these cases, typically only the host can use cheats.
In some multiplayer games, cheats can be enabled mid-game by moderators (i.e., ""operators"") and even scripts from command blocks.;
, Once the game has started, bring up the console. By default, this is done by pressing ""T"". You can also press ""/"" to open the console with a forward slash pre-typed — since all of the commands start with a forward slash, this is a helpful shortcut.


To be clear, the console is the same thing as the ""chat window"" you may be familiar with from multiplayer games.

, There are many, many commands and cheats that you can type in to affect your game. In the section below, you can find a short list of some of the most entertaining commands. Note that this list is by no means complete — it's just meant to give you a taste of the console's capabilities., There are several different ways to find complete lists of all of the Minecraft console commands available to you. These are available both in-game and online. See below:


The command /help will give you a list of commands to choose from. There are four different pages which can be accessed by putting a number after the /help command (e.g., /help3).
You can also input ""/"" and then press TAB to cycle through the commands individually.
Finally, you can also find a complete list of commands online at the Minecraft Wiki here., Sick of slaving away in the mines to find enough diamonds for your suit of armor? Use this command to get what you want right away.


Note: the <item> value you input must be a valid Minecraft item ID (see here for a complete list.)Example: ""/give Joe123 minecraft:iron_pickaxe 10"" gives player Joe123 10 iron pickaxes.

, Nothing's more annoying than suffering a surprise death to a creeper and having to walk all the way back to the base you built with your friend on the other side of the map. With this command, you can get back to where you want to be right away.


Note: You can also use ""/tp <x> <y> <z>"" to teleport to a specific x/y/z coordinate.
Note: If you leave out the target player and just type your destination, you will teleport yourself.
Examples: ""/tp Joe123 Jane456"" will teleport player Joe123 to player Jane456. ""/tp Joe123 100 50 -349"" will teleport Joe123 to x/y/z coordinates 100, 50, -340.

, Enchantments can be some of the most challenging, time-consuming assets to get in the entire game. With this cheat, however, your items will be as strong as you want them right away.


Note: Your enchantment must be a valid Minecraft enchantment ID (see here for a complete list.)Notes: Enchantment is applied to the item the player is holding and only works if the enchantment is appropriate for the item (e.g., fishing rod enchantments won't work on bows, etc.) Level must be between 1 and the enchantment's max level; if no level is specified, the level defaults to 1.
Example: ""/enchant Joe123 minecraft:protection"" gives player Joe123 the Protection III enchantment to any armor he is holding.

, Looking to get some target practice in on a handful of pesky Creepers? This command lets you spawn animals, mobs, and even things like lightning bolts wherever you want.


Note: the entity name must be a valid Minecraft entity ID (see here for a complete list.)Note: If you don't specify coordinates, the entity will spawn at your location.
Example: ""/summon Creeper -100 59 450"" summons a creeper at the x/z coordinates -100, 59, 450.

, This command is mostly for aesthetic reasons — with it, you can change the in-game weather from nice to lousy whenever you want.


Example: ""/weather rain 1000"" makes it rain for 1,000 seconds.

, If you're looking to tick off your friends or punish griefers, this command can come in handy. Use caution, though — many players won't take kindly to being killed instantly!


Note: If you don't specify a player (i.e., ""/kill""), you will kill yourself.
Note: For really bad players, use /ban in exactly the same way as a more permanent solution.
Example: ""/kill Joe123"" would kill player Joe123.

Visit a Minecraft Hack site.,
Download your hack.,
Extract the Zip file.,
Move the hack to the Minecraft versions folder.,
Enable the hack as you start your game.,
Beware of hack restrictions in multiplayer games.",How to Cheat in Minecraft2," ""Hacks"" — downloadable programs that affect your gameplay — are widely available for Minecraft. Using one or more of these hacks is usually fairly simple, but since there are so many hacks available, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to using them. In this section, we'll give a brief overview of how to get and use a hack. For more detailed information, consult the online resources for the hack you've chosen.


One good source for Minecraft hacks is MCHacks.net.There are other fine hack sites, but MCHacks.net has a fairly easy-to-use interface and plenty of selections.

, On the hack site, browse the selection of available hacks and find one that appeals to you — usually, the features for each hack will be listed on the download page for the hack. Download the hack and locate it in your downloads folder.


For example purposes, you may want to follow along with these steps by installing Nodus Hacked Client, which allows you to fly, auto-mine, move through walls, and more. Nodus is available for download here., Most hacks come in compressed ""zip"" files. In order to install your file, you need to use a program that can decompress and extract the files. This process is fairly easy — see our articles on Winzip and other extraction programs like 7Zip for more information.


Note that the extraction process will not be identical for every hack. Always read the read-me or help file included with the download if you're not sure how to proceed.

, Usually, once you extract your hack, you want to move the hack folder into your Minecraft directory. Depending on the hack you've downloaded, this location can differ. Consult the read-me/help document that came with your hack for more information.


In the case of the Nodus Client, the precise file location you want to move the hack folder to differs based on your operating system:

Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft\versions

Mac: ~Library/ApplicationSupport/minecraft/versions

Linux: \Home\.minecraft\versions

, Most hacks need to be enabled before you start playing the game. Some even require you to set up a new profile, so, as always, use the help resources that came with your hack to guide you.


To play with Nodus, follow these steps:Open the Minecraft launcher
Select ""New Profile""
Set your profile name to ""Nodus 2.0"" and your version to ""release Nodus""
Save your profile
Select your new profile and click ""Play""

, Whenever you're using hacks, it's important to remember that not everyone in the game will appreciate the fact that you are able to do things that they cannot. Many servers will even have strict ""no hacking"" rules. For this reason, you may want to restrict yourself to servers with lax rules that allow for hacks and other cheat. Using hacks in ""vanilla"" servers is a great way to earn the hatred of your fellow players and have your I.P. address banned.


Never use hacks to intentionally screw up other players' projects or annoy them — this is called ""griefing"" and it's something most moderators will ban you for.

There is currently no ability to rotate a cloned segment; the orientation will remain the same.

, This specifies what blocks are cloned.



Replace. If you do not specify a mode1, this is the default. This mode copies every block in the selected area.

Filtered. Removes everything but the type of block specified. For example, “/clone 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 filtered normal minecraft:stone” will only clone stone from the area.

Masked. Copies every block except air.

, Use this to change how the clone interacts with the world.



Normal. This is the default setting for mode2. It puts the clone in the specified area, but it will display an error message if there is any overlapping.

Move. The blocks that are cloned are replaced with air, causing the area to appear as if it was moved.

Force. If the area where the new clone appears will cause blocks to overlap, this mode will force the blocks overlapping to be replaced.

, Now that you know what mode1 and mode2 does, choose which mode you will add to your clone command.

, Once you’ve chosen a mode, insert it after the coordinates you typed in the chat box.


For example: “/clone <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x> <y> <z> mode1 mode2”.
Modes are an optional part of cloning that give the user more control over what is cloned. If a mode is not specified, the default modes are “Replace” for mode1 and “Normal” for mode2.
If one mode 1 is specified and mode 2 is not, it will default to Normal and vice versa.

, The area will then appear at the <x> <y> <z> coordinate and with the modes you added."

Add specials.,
Make the body with the color of your choice, make specials, such as a scar or something.",How to Build My Little Pony Characters Inside Minecraft," It is recommended using creative, but survival would work too. Just be aware that you would need a lot of wool for this! If you pick survival, you should have a sheep farm to make things easier.;
, In order to get lots of sheep for survival, try breeding. The funny thing is... you can breed babies to their fathers and mothers when they grow! Try that funny glitch for Minecraft and soon you will have lots of sheep.


The dye is important too. Although you can do creative, and ignore this whole part.

, Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy––which is your pick? Be aware that certain characters are different. For instance, Fluttershy has a longer tail and mane. So she has to have more pink blocks.


Look up pictures of them to get the colors and specials right.

, Take about, 12 blocks for each leg. Remember, last step covered the colors of the wool. Of course, you can use any blocks. But wool is best and easiest to get. Make a four block base, and build up two. So you should have a 2 wide, 3 high, and 2 deep pillar of wool. Do the same 1 block over to the right. Now you have the front legs!

, The bottom part is finished.

, Build it 3 high, about a 7 wide, 3 high, and 5 deep roof on top of the legs. The body is finished.

, It should be a roof of 4 wide, 5 deep, 5 high platform halfway on the front of the body.

, Then add 2 by 1 black wool in the eyes. There, boom. Eyes. That's the main body and legs and head and eyes done!

, Then add the mane. Should be pretty self-explanatory, have it coming down the back of the head on to the body. The same with the tail, add it in on the back, having it droop down to the ground. There, the pony is basically done!

, As stated earlier, specials are the special unique thing about the pony. For wings, add a 4 by 2 extra wool on the sides. And add a horn if you want, a 1 by 2 pillar on top of the head should do. It will look okay. The specials are like this:


Applejack has a hat. Add that if you're trying to replica Applejack.
Derpy has derpy eyes. Add that if you're making Derpy.
Fluttershy's tail is longer.
Celestia is taller. The specials can be made by you.

, Specials make the pony unique. So add some to your custom pony. Easy enough.


Fillies have to be made smaller. Take off 1 block from every number. But if the number is originally one, keep it. Again, pretty easy!

, Place wood blocks directly into your crafting area in your inventory (Press ""E"" to access inventory) and turn all of the wood except for five pieces into wood planks.

, Make a workbench by filling each of the four crafting slots with wood planks. Note that while they can be any kind of wood, it will have to be the same kind of wood. It is not necessary to craft more than one workbench.

, Create a few sticks by placing two wood planks, one on top of another, in the crafting window. Place two sticks, one on top of the other, in the bottom middle and center. Then, across the top row, place 3 wooden planks.

, Mine some stone. It's best to mine about 30 stone, as it will be useful to have a little bit of extra stone later on.

, Fill every crafting slot except for the middle, at a workbench, to create a furnace.

, Use the furnace. Place some wood (not planks) in the top left of the furnace, and place some wood planks in the lower left of the furnace. This will burn the wood on the top, giving you charcoal.

, Once you have five charcoal, make five more sticks if you don't have them already. Then, place all of your charcoal into one space on the crafting area, then as many sticks as you have charcoal underneath the charcoal. This will make torches. Make as many as you want/need.

, For the first night, dig down three blocks, seal the top of the hole off, and place a torch. After you have done that, and you are safe, you can dig.

Have fun with the house!",How to Build a Wooden House in Minecraft," The first thing you need to do is to find a tree. When you find one, press and hold the left mouse button (PC), press the Left Bumper button (Xbox) while facing the trunk, or simply tap the trunk with your finger (PE). You’ll see your character’s hand punching at the wood and leaving cracks on it. Continue punching until one block of wood pops off, and it automatically goes to your hotbar.


You can keep punching trees until you feel like you have enough wood for later, but for now, this single block of wood is all you need to make your crafting table.;
, Press the E key (PC), the X button (Xbox), or the icon (PE) to view your inventory, and you’ll see, aside from several boxes where your items are stored in, there is also a set of four empty boxes arranged into a box formation with an arrow pointing towards a single empty box. That is your initial crafting grid, where you can make various things. However, seeing as it only has 4 slots in the grid, you can’t make anything complicated with it, which is why you need a crafting table.

, Place your wood on one of the slots by selecting it (clicking on it for the PC versions, scrolling to it with the RB and LB buttons on the Xbox, and tapping it in PE), and you’ll see that an item appears on the single box. It’s a plank, and one block of wood is worth 4 planks right off the bat. If you’ve got more wood, feel free to convert it all to planks, but for now, all you’ll be needing are 4 wood planks

, Place one wood plank on each box of the four boxes in the crafting grid, and you’ll see another item on the rightmost box again. Take that item, and you now have a crafting table!

, To use the crafting table, simply drag it to your hotbar, “hold” it by using your mouse’s scroll button or by pressing the corresponding number on its hotbar placement. Place it on the ground by right-clicking while holding it, and then right-click it again. It will bring you to a window that has a 3x3 version of the crafting window in your inventory.

, Go on and punch some more trees and turn some of those wood into planks! Around 3–5 pieces of wood will suffice, depending on how many of these tools you’ll be making.

, On the PC, all you need to do is right-click it. On the Xbox, press X. On PE, just tap it.

, Now, you’ll be needing some sticks, which you can make by crafting two planks placed vertically on the crafting window, and it will reward you with 4 sticks. You’ll be needing this to make the torches, pickaxes, and axes, which you will need to gather materials. At least 3 blocks worth of planks will suffice for the creation of many basic tools for your venture.

, Fill up the first row of the crafting table’s grid with planks—or cobblestone, if you managed to get those and want a better pickaxe—then put two sticks on the middle column.


It should look like this in the grid:
X = empty space
m = material
s = stick
m m m
X s X
X s X
The resulting item will appear in the single box at the side of the grid.

, Making an axe is similar, but the third plank from the left is moved to the first block second row.


It should look like this in the grid:
X = empty space
m = material
s = stick
m m X
m s X
X s X

, To use your tools, simply place them on your hotbar, which can hold up to 9 items at a time. Hold the item you want to use the tool on by scrolling to it with the mouse scroll button or pressing the number corresponding to it in your keyboard (PC), using the Left and/or Right Bumper buttons on your controller (Xbox), or tapping it with your finger (PE). Then use your tool by holding the left mouse button (PC), holding down the Left Trigger button of your controller (Xbox), or tapping and holding it (PE). You can use the axe to chop trees down faster and pickaxes to gather cobblestone by going to a hard (takes too long to crack when punching) gray block and hitting it with your pickaxe.

, Since this is a wooden house, your main resource is trees, and lots of it. So keep punching those trees until you have at least 2 full stacks (64 blocks each) of both Wood and Planks.


If you can find other kinds of trees, even better! This will add variation and color to your house. There are different trees for different biomes, and biomes are scattered around the world.
Oak and Birch are the most common trees. Birch has a white trunk with black stripes, and its planks are very pale in color. Oak is the usual kind, with a brown trunk and a lighter-brown grain.
Spruce is a very tall tree with darker green leaves and is a little harder to find, usually in very cold Biomes or high up in mountains. The wood and grain is a very dark, rich brown.
Acacia is a tree found in dry-looking areas called savannahs. The tree grows sideways, with a grayish trunk and a bright orange grain.
Dark Oak is an unusually thick and large tree found in a Roofed Forest biome and is usually found near Giant Mushrooms. It’s got a darker trunk and dark, slightly muddier grain from regular oak, and the planks are a darker brown than spruce.
Jungle Wood is the rarest type of wood currently in the game, due to the scarcity of Jungle biomes. Jungle trees are tall with unusual leaves (green speckled with oval yellowish “fruits”), and the planks have a brown-pink grain.

, While not strictly necessary for the basic structure, furnaces are useful if you want to make glass for your windows, a brick roof, or use it to simply smelt iron for better tools. To make a furnace, gather some stone, go to your crafting table, and place stone on all sides of the crafting grid, leaving the middle slot free.
m m m
m X m
m m m


To smelt things, put the material you want converted, like sand or clay, on the top square, then put something flammable like wood or coal on the bottom square, and after a short wait, your item is converted to another!
Iron and Gold ore need to be smelted before you can make items with them.

, One valuable material you can make whenever you want are torches, and for that you need coal and/or charcoal. Coal is somewhat easy to find, since it resembles stone with black spots on it, and when you gather it with a pickaxe, a piece of coal is dropped. Charcoal is also easy to make if you have a furnace and some wood. You simply smelt the wood, not planks but actual wood, and it turns into charcoal!


Crafting torches is as simple as stacking a piece of coal over a stick on the crafting window, and you immediately get 4 torches, which is good, since you’ll need as many of them as you can to light the way and ward off monsters!

, At the absolute minimum, you’ll be needing about a 5x5 square of free space to build your house. This is to accommodate a bed, a chest, and a crafting table without running out of room to move, but you can build a bigger house if you feel like it or if you have enough resources.


If you want to clear out an area, simply start punching the ground blocks in the nearby area until you have a flat space. You might need a pickaxe or axe if the area is rocky or full of trees.
At the very beginning, it’s best to build your house near the spawn point, which is where you first appear once you make your world, and where you end up in whenever you die. This will provide you a steady shelter from whatever monsters lurk in the night, and a place to keep all your stuff.

, Line out your house’s shape by laying down wood blocks, which can be done by selecting your desired material and pressing the right mouse button, RT button, or tapping on where you think the house’s corners will be. This will not only help you keep track of your house and its size and shape, but it will also make your wood house look more sturdy, and looks nice once you start adding your walls.


Connect the walls together with Wood Planks to create an outline, but remember to keep one space open to serve as your door so you can go in and out. Build up the wood posts by placing more blocks on top of the corner blocks until it’s at least 4 blocks tall. They’ll serve as the guide to how tall your house is, or even as a base for a second floor if you want.

, A house needs walls, so slowly fill in the spaces between the pillars with your Wood Planks by building on the outline of the house, but take care to leave the door space at least two blocks high and to leave a small window now and then to let in light.

, A house also needs a roof, so fill in the top of the wall by placing blocks inwardly from the topmost blocks until the inside of your house is covered.


Now if you don’t want a square-ish house, you can slope the roof a bit. The simplest way to do this, and the method that works best on a less-complicated house design, is to line a row of wood placed straight horizontally to create a “beam,” around the topmost block of the walls adjacent to your door, then stacking more beams on both sides diagonally until they meet.
Another way to create a nice roof is by crafting stairs! To craft stairs, you need your trusty crafting table. Starting from the left, fill the entire leftmost column with wood planks. Fill the bottom row with the same material, and then place a block of the material on the middle block so it resembles a stair.
X X m m X X
X m m or m m X
m m m m m m
You’ll be rewarded with 4 stairs. You can then repeat the same process of stacking them diagonally on your house like in the blocky roof method, but if there is a single block of free space between them, make some slabs by lining a row with the same kind of wood you made stairs from, and use those to join the stairs. Make sure to line the bottom of your roof with the same kind of wood as your pillar, and fill the rest of the gap with the same kind of planks as your house!
Out of the two methods for creating a roof, the stairs method is the most convincing and visually pleasing, but costs more time, materials, and effort.

, Making a door is both nice-looking and useful, since it prevents monsters and other creatures from invading your little hideout when you keep it closed.


Take six wood planks, and access your crafting table. Fill two columns on the crafting space and you’ll get three doors. Go up to the house opening and install the door by placing it on the open space you left on the wall so you can protect your privacy!
On PC, different kinds of wood make different styles of doors, so feel free to experiment!

, Beds are wonderful, soft things. The best part is that if you die, you just wake up beside it, though you drop all your stuff where you died and you’ll have to get it back. To make one, like the bottom row of your crafting table’s grid with planks, then the middle with wool, and take out your resulting bed! Now place it inside your house, and then at night, or during random thunderstorms, you can right-click it to sleep the danger away!


Wool can be acquired by killing or shaving sheep. To kill sheep, keep punching a sheep or hitting it with your tool until it falls down. Killing yields 1 Wool. Shaving requires Shears, which can be acquired by smelting iron ore into iron ingots, then laying them diagonally in your inventory crafting grid or crafting table. Now select the Shears and go up to your sheep. In the PC version, you right-click it; on Xbox, you press LT; and on PE, you tap and hold. Shearing a sheep would leave you a bald-but-alive-sheep and 1–3 Wool.

, Grass is nice, but not for indoors, so scoop out the first layer of dirt blocks on the inside of your house and replace them with any material you want. Remember, choosing a different material like stone or brick, or choosing a different kind of wood from your house’s main material, will add a dash of color and make your house look inviting.

, While you may have some holes punched on the walls for your windows, they’d look better (and be safer) if you put some glass on them. Simply smelt some sand, which you can usually find near water or a desert, and place it on the holes. Be careful when placing them inside the window gaps, though; they break too easily, and you can’t gather the glass back if you place the block wrong!

, When it gets dark, you’d prefer some light, so putting some torches along the walls would definitely brighten up the space! The windows do a fair enough job during the daytime, but when night comes, the light keeps the monsters from appearing in your house, so better invest on torches!

, A picket fence is also nice to look at, and adds a layer of protection from the monsters. Line two stacks of planks on the left and the right columns of your crafting table, and line two stacks of sticks on the middle column. Take your fence and place it around your house, but be sure to leave a gap you can go through!


The recipe for Xbox uses sticks and only sticks lining two rows of the crafting grid.
Adding a fence gate makes it more secure, and the recipe is just the reverse of the fence itself: line the left and right column with two stacks of sticks each, then grab your brand-new fence gate and place it on the gap on your fence! Ta-da! A nice little picket fence with a sturdy gate!
Minecraft PC and Pocket Edition now have fences made from different wood, so you can choose if you want a dark (Spruce, Dark Oak) fence, a light (Birch, Oak) fence, or a colorful (Jungle, Acacia) one!

, Now that your home is complete and secure, take a moment to rejoice and think up of ways to spruce it up a bit!


Feel free to fill the house with goodies, furniture, and such. Experimenting with slabs, stairs, blocks, and fences is the way to go with this one, so run wild and feel free to create whatever you want!

If you don’t have one yet, open your inventory and place four Wood Planks on all the slots of the 2x2 crafting grid. Your Crafting Table will appear in the result slot next to the grid. Place it on the ground by right-clicking or pressing the Left Trigger button on your controller. You can then pull up the Crafting menu by facing the table and right-clicking or pressing the X button.;
, You will need a Furnace to create Bricks. If you don’t have a Furnace yet, create one by laying out Cobblestone on the Crafting Table using this pattern:
s = stone
X = empty space
s s s
s X s
s s s

, The Pickaxe will be used to mine the various stones you might need for your throne. If you don’t have a pickaxe yet, make one in your inventory crafting grid with three blocks of wood, stone, metal or diamond, and two sticks like so:
m = material
s = stick
X = empty space
m m m
X s X
X s X


To use, equip the pickaxe by pressing the number corresponding to your pickaxe in your hotbar (PC) or by pressing the Right and Left Bumper buttons (Xbox). Once selected, you can either left-click or press the Right Trigger button on your desired patch of stone to mine it.

, A throne is supposed to be proof of your greatness, so first you must decide on what material to use. First, you'll be needing two blocks, four stairs, two fences or walls, and a slab. You can create the stairs and slabs using any type of Wood Planks, Bricks, Cobblestone, both types of Sandstone, Stone Bricks, Quartz Blocks, and Nether Brick. While the latter two are late-game acquisitions, the rest can be easily gathered and crafted early on in the game. You can create the walls using Cobblestone and the fences with Wood or Nether Brick. You’ll also be needing sticks if you decide to make a wooden fence.


The next few steps will explain how to get the different materials you might want to make your throne out of; it is not necessary to gather each and every kind, just select one or two, or even three, that you want to use on your throne.

, Wood and Cobblestone are the easiest to acquire, since they are the most abundant of the resources. You can immediately gather wood from nearby trees by left-clicking or pressing the Right Trigger button. Stone can be mined for cobblestone and is usually found by digging into the dirt or exposed on cliffs and hills, and can easily be mined with a pickaxe.

, Sandstone can be found while digging in the Desert or Beach, and Red Sandstone can be found in Mesas; both can be mined with a pickaxe.


Alternately, you can make these blocks by gathering Sand or Red Sand found in the same areas Sandstone generates in, and filling all four slots of your inventory’s 2x2 crafting grid with the Sand blocks.
Stone Bricks can be created in the same method as Sandstone blocks; simply pull out your inventory and lay Cobblestone in all four slots of the crafting grid.

, Bricks can be made by gathering Clay, which are smooth, soft grayish blocks found underwater, and smelting them with a furnace.


Open the furnace by pressing the right mouse button or the X button. Place Clay on the top slot of the furnace, and then place a piece of fuel (flammable materials such as wood, planks, coal, saplings, or even a bucket of lava) on the bottom slot. Then simply wait for the item to be smelted on the result slot to the right. Do note that you might need to replenish your fuel often before you get enough Bricks. You can tell how much fuel there is left by looking at the fire symbol between the fuel and item slot. When it’s fully red-orange, you have plenty of fuel left; the duller the color is, the less fuel remains, and it would need to be replenished.
You can then make Brick Blocks the same method as Sandstone—place the individual bricks on all the four slots of the inventory crafting grid and take the ensuing Brick Block.

, Quartz blocks and Nether Brick are near-endgame items found in the Nether, which you can access through a Nether portal. You’ll need an Obsidian and a Diamond pickaxe to even make the portal, which makes these two materials inaccessible for early players in Survival mode. You can gather Netherrack by hand to make bricks, and Quartz must be mined from Netherrack with larger white discolorations, which yields you small Quartz pieces.


Quartz blocks can be created with the same method as Sandstone, and you can smelt Netherrack to make Bricks, which act much like regular bricks of a different color.

, First gather 9 blocks of your preferred material.


For your stairs, lay out the blocks in an ascending order on your crafting table’s menu:
m = material
X = empty space
m X X X X m
m m X or X m m
m m m m m m
To make the slab, simply lay out three blocks of your chosen material in one of the rows in the crafting menu:
X X X m m m X X X
m m m or X X X or X X X
X X X X X X m m m
The crafting recipe for stairs yields 4 stairs, while the crafting recipe for slabs yield 6 slabs.

, In the PC edition, you need 2 sticks and four wood planks, while for Xbox 360, you only needs 6 sticks. You then lay them out like this:
s = stick
p = plank
X = empty space


PC
X X X
p s p
p s p
Xbox 360
X X X
s s s
s s s
This will yield you 4 wooden fences.

, Take 6 blocks of Cobblestone or Nether Brick then lay it out:
m = material
X = empty space
X X X
m m m
m m m


This will yield you 6 walls or Nether Brick fences.

, You can place your throne practically anywhere you want, but it’s prefered to have it inside whatever castle or building you made, or in the middle of a village. Whatever the case, a throne is your proof of superiority over the world of Minecraft, so feel free to build it wherever you want to.

, On the PC, you can do this by pressing the number corresponding to the item in your hotbar, which can be located on the bottom of your screen, or using the mouse scroll button to select your item, then right-clicking on the area. On the Xbox, you can select your items by pressing the Right and Left Bumper buttons, and then placing it by pressing the Left Trigger button.

, They should be facing away from each other so that the back side of the stairs is connected to the slab. From the top, it should look like this:
S = slab
st = stair
B = block
f = fence/wall
X = empty space
st S st

, Do this by placing a block on one of the free sides of the slab, and then attaching the other two stairs to it so that they connect to the first pair of stairs. It should look something like this:
st B st
st S st


The end result would have the three sides of the slab surrounded, leaving one space open, and will already vaguely resemble a chair.

, This will give the chair a high back. It should look like this from the front:
B
st S st

, Do this right on top of where the back pair of stairs are to give it a wider and fancier back. This is what it should look like from the front and top:
front:
f B f
st S st
top (bottom layer)
st B st
st S st
top (top layer)
f B f

People like you a lot more when you have your own unique style. Don't follow the standards start setting your own. Save up starcoins. You'll need the currency to be able to buy the gear you need that will help your popularity. Stop being anticipated at times and go for the ride your not afraid to go on. Decide what you want to buy and save for it (put it on your wishlist if you need it to be easier!).;
, This shows people how good you are with fashion!

, Get a glowing red or light pink lips. Purchase the eyes that you weren't able to see when you first made your character. Pretty Perfect or Glitter Galore are recommended.


Use a color that will go well with any outfits in the future that you might get.
Beware some colors. Do not use big and bold. ""Big And Bold"" isn't something many people would like - unless they are in light pink or a peachy orange. Instead, use light or shiny looking colors. Remember to go for more natural colors such as red, pink or even light peachy-orange. Do not use neon colors, unless it's for a certain outfit.

After you decorated your first station, start building your railway.,
Use your player Minecraft map to help yourself guide you where your next station is going to be.,
Repeat these steps until you finished your first line.,
For interchanging stations with different railway lines, you have to put a note for information about it too.

,
If any of your lines go through the sea, make sure you dig deep enough for your railway tracks to not get flooded.

",How to Build a Railway System on Minecraft1," Don't get too many items, See this list of what you need:


Rails
Minecart
Powered rails
A pickaxe (stone or better depending on what you will be going through)
An axe (optional)
A shovel (optional)
Sign (for posting information)
Extra space for mined items
Map
Redstone torches (activate powered rails);
, Draw out your plan of your railway map, bridges, tunnels, signs etc. The map of your Minecraft city must also be needed to help building.

, This is a high-class railway system, so you must build a station for the railway. A tunnel is always the best so it won't block your buildings that you might build on the ground.

, Dig in a direction, so you could build stairs instead of ladders. Dig in 2-3 blocks wide.

, Make sure you make it convenient enough for yourself. Dig until you reach 8-15 blocks deep.

, If there is a cave, change your direction.

, It could be 1-2 blocks wide. You could put it to the side or end of your station.

, This is a high-class type, so you must make your station clearer and nicer. Start putting more exits of your station, so it would be easier for you to get to it. At each of those station exits/entrances, add signs that says whatever the name of your station is. Since the wideness is 2 blocks, put 2 signs. The signs should be on top.

, It could be like an arrow pointing to the direction on the sign.

, That should be showing where the exits lead you to, where the trains head to, etc.

,, Put gold, diamond whatever you like.

, It is true that you could get it off your TooManyItems cheat, but this just makes it more real.

, Put minecart tracks along the way, but two or three powered rails at the start of the tracks without redstone torches, this helps stop the cart to stop moving. You must do that for all stations to help it stop. Between 7-14 Minecraft tracks, add one or two powered rails along with redstone torches on the wall. This speeds up the cart so it won't stop.

, According to building your first station, you must decorate this station too.

, Then, name your line.

",How to Build a Sky Island in Minecraft," In Minecraft, there is a limit to how high you can build, so if you start in a mountainous area, you will have little room to build your island. The islands shown in this article will be built over the ocean; this location offers two advantages: falling into the ocean will not kill you, and sea level is a low elevation by default.


You may have to search around a little for a good place to build. As a general rule, look for the area of lowest elevation.
While Ocean biomes work well for this, Deep Oceans may cause you some trouble if you're in Survival mode. If you aren't sure of the difference, press F3 to see data for your location. The third line from the bottom will tell you what biome you are in.;
, Dirt is best because it will not fall in the event of an accident, and it's easy to get. Place one block, stand on it, and then jump continuously (hold space bar) while placing more blocks (right click and hold). Continue until you feel you are at a sufficient height to begin building your island.

, Press and hold shift to crouch so you will not fall off the side, then build out from your pillar by placing blocks on all sides. This will become the lowest level of your island.


If you are using Creative mode while doing this, you can fly instead of standing on the platform.

, From here forward, though, make it an abnormal shape to mimic the random effects of nature.

, Make it even wider than the first level. Again, have a factor of irregularity in the process.

,, If you are in survival, use a silk touch shovel and dig some grass blocks..


Adding areas of different elevation will make it even more natural-looking.







, Put trees, tall grasses, water, and/or flowers on your island, if you want to.

, This island will hold a small house for the player.

, If this will be your home in Survival mode, you will need to have a way to get up and down. The torches will make it easier to see in the shadow of your island and make it harder for monsters to spawn. If this is just a build for you or part of a challenge map, destroy the pillar.

Consider your building location for maximum impact.",How to Build a Modern House in Minecraft," This isn't especially hard with Minecraft's block-based building system. An easy way to mimic this design style is to make your house's walls different heights. It doesn't matter if one or more of your walls go up past the roof — on a modern house, it counts as art!



Real-life example: This page has a good example of the ""squares and lines"" approach to modern houses. Note that the house itself is on a simple rectangular plot of land, but that the creative assortment of scattered rectangles in its design makes it look much more interesting.Many modern houses are designed to create clean, visually pleasing areas of contrast. They do this by incorporating many squares, rectangles, and straight lines into their exterior. Though it might seem like this would make the house look like a ""jumble"" of shapes, the actual effect is striking. This is a great way to add visual complexity to your house while still using an easy rectangular floor plan.;
, Finding wood and stone in Minecraft is easy. White building materials can be a little trickier — quartz, sandstone, wool, or lighter varieties of stone may be your best bet.Real-life example: Here you can see an interesting use of contrasting building materials. The clean white surfaces of the roof ""clash"" with the brick supporting walls and the wood-paneled chimneys for a look that's both natural and man-made.A common theme in modern house architecture is the connection between the orderly world of humans and the chaotic beauty of nature. Modern houses use often use numerous unadorned white concrete surfaces on the outside of the house to give it a ""pristine"" feel. Pairing these with panels or walls made from rich natural materials like wood and stone creates gorgeous contrast. More rarely, another neutral color like grey is used in place of white.

, You'll need lots of sand for this. Building your house on the beach gives you a scenic view and an easy source of sand for your windows. Don't forget that you can always build multiple furnaces to speed up glass production!



Real-life example: The famous Stahl House in the Hollywood hills shows off this design feature. The house's numerous glass walls offer an amazing view and make it seem as if you're living on a wide open cloud above Los Angeles — a one-of-a-kind experience.Modern architects love using large, rectangular panes of glass. These allow you to give the occupants of your house a great view — a must if you've built your house somewhere cool. They also create the impression of clean, open spaces and can be used to form contrasting squares and rectangles on the outside of the house.

, Feel free to indulge your imagination with your house's shape. Standard ""box and roof"" constructions are to be avoided. Your house can be lopsided, uneven, or even outright bizarre-looking — it's up to you.



Real-life example: This modern house in Mexico exemplifies this trend. The main entrance and hallway are located off to the left, while the big, boxy structure on the right looms over the rest of the house. The way it juts out creates a powerful impression — it's almost intimidating.
Homes and mansions from past eras often strove to create grand, awe-inspiring symmetry (see: the Palace of Versailles).Modern homes sometimes do the same thing with the opposite approach. Many modern houses seem to deliberately go out of their way not to be symmetrical, challenging the viewer with their lopsided designs.

, The insides of modern houses are usually designed to give the effect of large, open spaces. Use clean neutral-colored floors and natural materials like wood and stone to create the same sorts of spacious contrast that you used for the outside of the house. Simple stairs, high ceilings, minimal furniture, and glass openings to awnings and balconies can enhance this effect.



Real-life example: This page shows off the clean, stylish interior of a modern house. The simple but elegant arrangement of furniture and the large, contrasting black window panes make for a space that feels open and cozy at the same time.
Have a wall without many windows? Show off your modern, artsy sensibility by showing off a selection of paintings. You can craft one from eight wooden sticks around a block of wool (any color)., Modern houses often seem to have a pool in the backyard — perhaps it's because this allows architects to play with an additional surface, adding a new dimension to their design. Don't forget that you'll need a bucket or two and a source of water if you want to fill your pool. You can craft a bucket from three iron ingots arranged in a ""V"" at the bottom of the crafting box.



Real-life example:This gorgeous mansion in Brazil has a simple but elegant rectangular pool mere steps away from an offset rectangular entertainment area — the perfect example of modern luxury.Use a square or rectangular shape for your pool so that it matches the right angles of the house. Keep it level with the ground.

, Minecraft's block-by-block building style makes it easy to replicate the ""squares and lines"" style of a modern house. More abstract living spaces that incorporate curves are a little trickier. This guide to making convincing circles and spheres in Minecraft can be a huge help when it comes to recreating these difficult shapes.Real-life example: This house puts a curvy twist on the basic ""white surfaces and squares"" modern house design. The curved roof and overhangs give this swanky pad a sleek look — a little like a giant iPod., If you want to get adventurous with your house design, don't limit yourself to squares and rectangles. Tossing together odd combinations of shapes and surfaces can give your house a truly unique look. This is best for larger houses, as it's difficult to make clear, defined geometric shapes out of just a few blocks.



Real-life example: This bizarre house gives a one-of-a-kind impression. The sharp, angled polygons and triangles used in its design make it look almost like a jagged rock jutting up out of the earth., If you really want to push the limits of what can be called a ""house,"" feel free to go absolutely nuts with your architecture. You don't have to worry about whether your house will actually stand up or not in Minecraft, so don't be afraid to unleash your creativity. You can even make floating houses by building a bridge out over a cliff or canyon, building your house on the bridge, and then getting rid of the blocks connecting it back to the cliff!



Real-life example: Though this building obviously wasn't quite impossible to build in real life, it definitely looks like it was. The many different structures jut out at unpredictable angles, defying explanation., A well-placed tree or garden can give your modern house a bit of natural flair. Plus, it's a good way to mimic the ""green"" designs that have become somewhat popular in modern architecture. If you connect a grassy area to an area of plain dirt with a string of connected dirt blocks, the grass will spread to the new area very slowly. You can use this to make unique gardens, like a lawn on your house's roof. You can also cut down wild flowers to collect them for your garden.



Real-life example: This modern house has a very minimalist garden. The grass and trees are used almost just like the other surfaces — carefully confined to offer striking contrast, not allowed to grow where they please.
You probably won't want to go for lush, sprawling gardens here — modern architecture tends to use tidy arrangements when it comes to plants.

, When it comes to making an amazing house, where you build can be just as important as what you build. There's no ""right"" place to put your modern house, but you may want to look out for especially exciting plots of land. Just a few location ideas include: on the beach, on the top of a hill or mountain, carved into the side of a cliff, on a platform in the ocean, or buried deep underground.



Real-life example: Falling Water, the famous modern house built by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, is perched on top of a small creek and waterfall. The water flows underneath the house, making it not just a gorgeous sight but a serious feat of engineering as well.

, One side will have the door, so be sure to leave a space in the middle for it.

, Place a wooden plank next to each new log, leaving space for windows (if desired).

,, This should form a roof.

, To start of, put in a crafting table, a furnace, a couple chests and a bed.

, This step is optional, but it will make your house look nicer.

, Since the new update, there are plenty of flowers to choose from. An alternating pattern will look the nicest.

, You need a flat roof, some dirt, ladders for getting up there (stairs are too cramped) water, fences and seeds. Lay out the fences along the edge of your roof, so you won't fall off.

, Make a deep (at least 3 blocks) hole underneath the floor, add ladders so you can climb down. Then start a tunnel leading to a secret room! Maybe a pool, a doghouse, a cool bedroom- anything you want! Remember, since this is a secret tunnel, nobody but you should know where it is.

, Place logs one block outwards from where they were in the beginning. You should now have a one-block space in between the corners of your house. Extend the roof to these logs. Underneath this new roof space is a good spot to add flowers.

Start by choosing the biome in which you want to build your city.,
Terraforming.,
Planning.,
Start Your Construction.,
Add details: You do not want to have a dull, monotonous city.,
Once completed, make sure you roam around the city with a sword.",How to Build a City in Minecraft," Usually people prefer the Superflat biome and the terrain, as the name suggests, is flat. However, some people prefer to build in other biomes (Forest, Hills, etc...) to give the city a more natural look. Keep in mind that terrains except for Superflat may need moderate to heavy terraforming.

, Since houses of any city conventionally need to be built one a single level, or in other words, the base of the house needs to be plain, it is essential to terraform the terrain. Terraforming can be on a large scale (for the whole city/block) or on an individual, per-house scale. Apart from from making building convenient, terraforming also carries an aesthetic value if done properly. (Note: Terraforming can also cover up naturally spawned water bodies which may hinder the construction.)
, Plan out how you intend to go about it. Town planning is a tiresome yet exciting job. You could plan anything, from where to build what, to the size of the roads. The most convenient way to plan is building the roads first and then laying the foundations of houses. It gives you quite an idea about how the city will look when completed. What's more, you could add your own creativity (how about a subway system?).You are your own master!
, After you know what exactly you have to build, bring it to life! A good city may even take months to build. After and during construction, make sure you regularly save your world in a backup storage device. You definitely don't want to lose it all accidentally! (Skydrive may also be convenient, as world saves are hardly a few Kbs in size.)
, Add a few pictures and modifications in each building, and spawn Villagers with the help of Spawn Eggs. Make it alive!
, Sword will not damage your structures. The last thing you want is accidentally breaking your own creations.

Gather your materials.,
Lay out the posts.,
Fence it in.,
Add the roof.,
Place four torches on the walls inside the stable.,
Replace the dirt floor of your stable with some nice, clean stone.,
Make a wooden entrance flooring.",How to Build a Horse Stable in Minecraft," For your stable, you’ll be needing Wood, and quite a lot of it! In total, you’ll need 23 Fences, 21 Wood Blocks, 30 Wood Planks, 29 Wood Slabs, 12 Cobblestone, Stone or Stone Bricks, and 8 torches.


You can use any combination of wood types for your materials. You want to create a really vibrant-looking stable!;
, First, create a stack 3 blocks high with your Wood blocks. Now, with three spaces away from it, create another stack of the same height. Make two more until it becomes a box formation around 5x5 blocks wide.


From the top, it should look something like this:
w = wood
X = empty
w X X X w
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
w X X X w

, Now, on three of the four sides, place wood planks across the space between the pillar, then place slabs over the planks. This is to prevent the horse from climbing up on your fence. Now place fences on top of the planks, and then on the topmost pillar, place more planks to completely seal the room.


On the opening, place fence posts up to the very top in front of the posts by the opening, then place a pair of two-block-high stack of fences in the entrance gap, and close it off by connecting another fence between them.
p = planks
f = fence
s = slab

With this design, you wouldn’t need to build fence gates to keep your horse inside, because it tricks the horse into thinking the space is too narrow to go through while actually having ample space to go through!

, From the fence pillar to the back of your stable, place your slabs surrounding the walls, then fill in the remaining space in the middle with Wood Blocks. Now, between the opening’s wood posts, place two slabs below the wood block roof to create a sort of extrusion on the opening.

, This is so your horse won’t have some unwelcome visitors spawning in there. Monsters tend to spawn in very dark places, or during the night, so even just placing one torch would ward away the monsters, but more would ward them off for longer distances.

, While it only serves to make things look nice, your horse stable would look better and more well-kept with stone flooring.

, You can use your remaining Wood Blocks for this. Dig out the row of dirt from under your fence posts and the area between it, then place two upright wood blocks below the fences. Place the rest of your wood sideways until the ends meet so that it looks like a flat log. There you have it! A nice entranceway for your stable!

Congrats!",How to Build a Bunker in Minecraft," This bunker is going to be near the bedrock level. Dig a two-by-one shaft so that you can avoid falling into lava and the like. Stop when you reach around y=15.
, A 7-wide, 13-long, 4-high space works well., It will probably look better in one of the short walls., You will use this portal to access your bunker., This is probably the most dangerous part of the build. Once you have built the tunnel, you may wish to fill it with security devices., If you turn off the portal in your bunker, then anybody going through the portal system will be sent back out the top portal., If you add a layer of obsidian behind the walls, it will prevent people from using TNT to enter your bunker., You are potentially going to be staying in your bunker for extended periods of time, so you want several mechanisms to allow you to survive. In addition, these mechanisms do not want to be dependent on outside resources, such as bonemeal.

A chicken farm. Fully automatic.
A bonemeal-less crop farm.
A bed
A clock
A storage system. A shulker box loader will help.
A furnace and an enchanting table. Not strictly resource-less (they use coal and lapis), but they won't be used very often.
An ender pearl station. Again, not strictly resource-less, but won't be used often.
An under-floor armory.

, You now have an underground bunker! You can expand it with the following suggestions:

A small tree farm, to provide wood and charcoal
A charcoal smelter.
A backup nether portal, as an emergency exit.
Rooms for more people.
If you are near one, a skeleton spawner farm. With this providing bonemeal and XP, you can make all your other farms more compact.
Melon, pumpkin, sugar and cocoa bean farms.
Whatever else you can imagine. At this point, it's becoming less of an underground bunker and more of an underground city!

Some preferential criteria to keep in mind include the following:

Number of floors
Number of rooms per floor
Average size of rooms
Hotel layout
Lobby design;
, While Creative mode will prevent you from acquiring achievements whilst playing, it will also give you both an unlimited amount of resources and the ability to fly.

If you have a specific world you'd like to load, you can take the string of letters and numbers below the ""Seed"" heading in its information box and type it into your new world's ""Seed"" box to recreate it.
Under the ""World Type"" section, you can choose an option entitled ""Flat"" (PE) or ""Superflat"" (all other versions). This will create a world with no vegetation or hills, making it perfect for a quick building session.

, Typically, you'll want to find a relatively flat area wherein you won't have to remove too much vegetation or perform landscaping.

If you're in a ""Flat"" world type, you can start building wherever you like.
To fly in Minecraft's Creative mode, simply double-press the ""jump"" button.

, To do so, press the ""inventory"" button and move materials into the hotbar at the bottom of the screen. The hotbar houses all of your in-hand items, meaning you can quickly select an item by scrolling to it (or tapping it in Minecraft PE). Some common materials include the following:

Wood (floors)
Stone (walls, archways, fencing)

, To do this, simply remove a one-block-wide line of blocks around the area in which you wish to build your hotel. Once you have your building boundaries set, you can easily fill them in with the foundation, walls, and everything else that will comprise your hotel.

This process is much easier in Creative mode since each block will only take one hit to break.

, You'll be replacing every ground block inside of your hotel's perimeter with the hotel's floor material (e.g., wood). Don't worry about creating rooms or walls for now--just focus on creating the foundation on which your building will stand., Each column should be the projected height of your hotel, though you can always add more stories later if you like.

The reason you do this is so that you have an estimate of what the hotel's skeleton will look like before you begin filling it in. If the hotel looks too small, too big, or awkwardly proportioned, you can revise as necessary without have to remove several hours' worth of work.
Be sure to place a column in every corner of your hotel if the hotel isn't rectangular.

, The first floor should be at least ten blocks up from the foundation so that your hotel's ""lobby"" appears spacious and comfortable. You'll create this floor by filling in the space between all of your building's columns with a building material of your choosing.

This floor should be an example of what the rest of your hotel's floors look like.

, These sets of stairs will likely differ, since the stairs from the lobby to the first floor can lead straight up, while you'll likely need to create sets of stairs that loop (or double back) along the sides of subsequent floors to reach the next floor up.

Stairs that double back are common in real hotels.
When adding stairs that double back, you'll need a minimum of six blocks of height, as well as eight blocks of width and four blocks of depth. This is so you can have two sets of stairs facing one way, a landing, another two sets of stairs perpendicular to the first set, another landing, and finally a last set of stairs facing the opposite way of the first set.

, You'll want to leave at least a one-by-two (width x height) space in each room's wall for a door facing out into the hallway.

This process includes building the outer wall of the hotel as well, since this wall is also the outer wall for your rooms.
A good way to do this is by creating a one-block-high outline of each room to ensure you like the design before proceeding.
Make sure you have a room height in mind before doing this.

, You'll repeat this process for each floor until your hotel is complete., This will prevent your hotel from becoming too dark to navigate during night cycles., For example, you might fill in the lobby with glass rather than with stone or wood., If you want a simple roof, you can fill in the space between columns as though you're creating a new floor; otherwise, consider using ascending stairs or blocks that meet in the middle of your building to create a sloping roof. Once your hotel's structure is complete and filled in, you're ready to begin addressing individual rooms., You can do this in pretty much any way you like, but some common ways to do so include the following:

Add a window by replacing several blocks in the outer wall with glass.
Place a chest in a corner of a room.
Add bookshelves, pictures, or other visually pleasing items.
Place torches or other forms of lighting throughout the rooms.

, You should have openings for each room's door, though you can add or remove these as you please to better suit your room placement once your floors are complete.

You might also consider creating a doorway between some rooms to make a suite.
You need at least two blocks of free space in front of you to place a bed.

, Think of the lobby as the ultimate room to decorate; since it's the first thing people will see when they come to your hotel, you'll want to make sure it's well-lit with torches, as well as decorated with pictures, windows, and environmental features.

You might place a pool or a tree in the middle of your hotel's lobby.

, For example, you might add a fence around the hotel, or a pond out in front of it. This step is optional, of course, and your hotel's appearance will likely change with the passage of time as you add and remove features to your liking."

",How to Build a Basic Farm in Minecraft," Your farm can be as large or small as you want it to be. 26 by 24 is highly recommended for all players.


Remember, the larger the farm, the more supplies it will take.;
, This is where we will build the farm.


It is recommended that your land is flat, though this isn't mandatory.
There are infinite places to build your farm, but here are a few ideas.

Underground. Building your farm underground is the most versatile place to build your farm, though it is the most time consuming.
In a Field. This requires no special items, and is the easiest to build, though it isn't very safe from Mobs.
Inside. Usually this is a special building dedicated to a farm. It Should have a glass ceiling to let sunlight in. It requires that you build a building for the farm, but is safe from Mobs.


If you don't have the means to perform step 6, put your farm adjacent to a pond so you can dig the canals from there and let the pond fill them up. Keep in mind that if you do this, the number of blocks you can use in your canals will be limited, but this can work as a stop-gap solution until you can get the iron to make a bucket.

, This helps to keep monsters out.


Note: Make the perimeter two blocks high at least, or use fences, otherwise Mobs will jump over the built wall.

, This way, it prevents the Mobs from spawning in your farm.


You can use glowstone under the water canals and under the fence

, These will water the crops.


Keep in mind that the water will irrigate 4 blocks in each direction, so have 8 blocks between the canals

, Use the bucket to scoop up the water.

If you don't have the means to perform this step, put your farm adjacent to a pond so you can dig the canals from there and let the pond fill them up. Keep in mind that if you do this, the number of blocks you can use in your canals will be limited, but this can work as a stop-gap solution until you can get the iron to make a bucket.

, Crops will only grow on tilled land., Right click on the tilled land with seeds in your hand.

, Use Bone Meal to speed up the process.

, You don't need golden apples, but a stack or half a stack of meat, bread or baked potatoes are really necessary.

, You'll need an oven or two, a crafting bench, two chests and a bed.

, You'll need ladders to go up and down the mineshaft.

, Don't start your mine near a lava lake. try to avoid caves, unless you want to explore them on your way down.

, Never dig straight down. You can fall in a cave full of monsters or a pocket of lava.

, You'll find the most ores on layer 11, so it's logical to set up your base here.

You are going to want a common material, such as wood block or cobblestone. You are going to reinforce this later, so what you choose is what you are going to see, not what is going to be exposed, so whatever material you want to see is what you should choose.
, You aren't going to be able to go back up to kill a few pigs every time you get hungry, so you are going to need a farmable source of food. The most preferable source of food would be potatoes, as every baked potato can heal 2 and a half hearts, and you can get several per plant. However, things like wheat, melons, and even carrots can be used as food.

If the server you are playing on has the option to get spawners, those can be placed in a 10x10 room with grass for an infinite amount of food and experience. The best would be cows, as they can drop leather and raw beef, the leather can be used to make books and armor in a pinch, and the beef could be used for food

, Your purpose here is to minimize the amount of time needed to spend in the overworld, as people can simply follow you back to your base afterward. A list of such items follows, but any item that you might find necessary should also be included

2 buckets of water. This is to create an infinite source of water by putting 2 blocks of water diagonally from each other in a 2x2 square to get infinite water.
Saplings. This is so you can get more wood underground in case you run out in your adventures.
Wool. This is to make a bed so that you can respawn in your base in the off chance that you die.

Decide how many blocks deep and wide you would like it to be. If you decide it's too small, that doesn't matter because it's easy to expand it later.;
, These gaps (called crenels) allow your friends to shoot enemies with a bow without having to jump awkwardly whenever they fire. Add a wood plank walkway to the top of the walls below the crenels to create battlements.

, Stone bricks are a good idea to build out from the wall and create a pillar-like support that looks difficult to get through. An optional addition is to add stone brick slabs across the top of the wall to break up the large amounts of cobblestone.

, These will allow access from the top of the wall to the bottom. Also, add corners to each of the pillar sections on the wall and stairs above the stone brick running across the middle of the wall.

, Create this circle with the block you used for the wall base, (such as cobblestone) so that the tower blends in with the rest of the wall.

, Add crenels to the top, as you did before.

, Create two upper layers using stone brick blocks circling the entire tower (which helps break up the large amounts of cobblestone again). Also, add a wood plank walkway at the top of the tower to match the top of the walls.

, Create a staircase inside so that you and your allies can easily climb up and down the tower during battle. Also, use stone brick stairs to create two extra layers you added in the previous step appear smoother and extend out a little further. Finally, create a torch from netherrack for the top.

"
Decide where you want your base located.,
Claim your base.,
Clear a flat area for your base.,
Build your farm.,
Build your storage area.",How to Build a Base for Minecraft Factions2," There are only 2 really viable options for where your base can be, these being very high in the air and very deep in the ground. Each base has its notable pros and cons.

High in the sky base. Hard to spot, very easy to get to. You can safely maneuver your base without shifting in here, as it is unlikely that people will be looking in the sky for people. However, if they spot you, all they have to do is build a large tower up, however if you spot them early you can knock them off with a well placed arrow or knockback sword.
Deep underground base. Easy to see you in your base, as if people can see you in your base they can see where your base is. Hard to get to, the person must dig straight down to your base, and if you have lava around your base they run the risk of digging down into the lava.

, On most servers, the command for claiming land is /f claim, however you can do /help if that does not work.

It may be more beneficial not to claim your base, as even though people cannot break the land if it is claimed, it does tell them where your base is, making tnt cannoning a good idea

, If you are going for the underground base, you should be clearing out a space at about the 20 Y coordinate. This is because people mostly mine at Y level 11, meaning they won't accidentally stumble upon your base, however it is still pretty far down. If you are going for a high base, go about 6 blocks below the build limit, giving you a natural impenetrable ceiling. This base will only be visible on the highest draw distance, which requires a pretty decent computer to run with a decent fps., You are going to burn through food fast, so you are going to want to start getting some as soon as you can. Have a canal of water, then 8 blocks wide of crops, then another canal of water. Water can give it's fertilizing effect up to 4 blocks horizontally, meaning one on either side gives a 8 block effect. You are going to need a fairly lit place, so lots of torches, or better, glowstone, is needed., You are going to want chests several blocks high for easy access to all of them. Have a stack of obsidian next to the chests labeling what each chest is, and to protect them from explosions. If you can, covering the chests with obsidian is the best idea, as this protects them from being exploded or stolen from when you are offline."
"
Gather a lot of obsidian.,
Cover your base in lava.,
Replace the surrounding scenery.,
Add traps.",How to Build a Base for Minecraft Factions3," This is the most time consuming part of the whole process, as you are going to need enough obsidian to create a protective shell around your base. This will protect you completely from tnt cannoning, the most common method of destroying protected bases. It also makes tunnelling into your base inefficient, as it makes your attackers mine every single obsidian block to enter., If you are underground, this means people cannot just tunnel downward into your base, or they will die in the lava surrounding your base. This also acts as a protectant against x-rayers, as they will only see the lava and not the chests underneath them most of the time. This will not work in high in the sky bases, as the lava will flow down and reveal your base., If you had to dig down to get to your base, smelt some stone and build it back up, cobblestone will just let people know somebody was there. If you built straight up to your base, remove the blocks that build up to your base. The point here is to make people to not suspect that anyone was here, and that they will move on without seeing your base., There are a multitude of traps you can make, as many as you can think of. Here is just a list of ideas to get you started.

Minefields. Put wood or stone pressure pads on wood or stone blocks, and then put tnt below them. As people step on them they will explode.
Cobwebs. You can simply put these up, or you can dig a hole with cobwebs then a block of lava, making your victim watch helplessly as they fall to their death.
Cacti. Putting cacti in an ""X"" pattern can surprise players, and make them slowly pass through all of the cacti before they can reach you.

Get 2 of either: golden apple or golden carrot.,
Feed a golden apple or carrot to both horses.

,
Wait for about a minute.,
Enjoy your new foal.",How to Breed Horses in Minecraft," Pick them based on traits you want the offspring to have. The stats of the two parents will be averaged along with random stats of one imaginary horse. A horse and donkey can breed, resulting in a mule. However the mule will be sterile and unable to breed itself.;
, Golden apples cost about 900% more gold (72 nuggets compared to 8 nuggets) than golden carrots, so golden carrots are recommended. Which one you use will not affect the offspring.


Golden apples or carrots can be crafted by surrounding a carrot with gold nuggets, or an apple with gold ingots, in a workbench.

,, Leave them alone.

,


It will take approximately twenty minutes for the foal to reach adulthood (if the chunk is loaded), but this can be sped up. To make the foal grow faster, feed it hay bales, wheat, sugar, apples, golden apples, and golden carrots. To make the foal instantly grow up, feed it five golden apples (20 golden ingots), or seven hay bales (63 wheat), or 60 wheat, or 64 sugar, or 24 golden carrots (21 and 1/3 golden ingots), or 20 apples. There is an intermediate stage between the foal and the adult, which looks like an adult, but you can't ride the horse yet.

2 Muscular horses (very large body)
2 Beautiful horses (the two most beautiful horses)
2 Sneaky horses (runs very quietly)
2 Jumper horses (jumps extremely high);
, This is the easiest stage of breeding. You just need to breed one horse with the other of its type. For example, a strong horse breeds with a strong horse. Repeat this until you have 8 baby horses. Afterwards, feed each of the babies to speed up their growth, and prepare 4 new pens.

, This is the hardest breeding stage. For this, you have to breed one horse with a certain type of horse. They are:

Place the grass.,
Place the bed.,
Repeat the process to break other bedrocks.",How to Break Bedrock in Minecraft," Search for dirt and grass, and find the materials to create a bed. Dirt blocks, grass, and a bed are all required for breaking bedrock in Minecraft.


You can collect grass by using shears on any grass found in the world. Dirt can be found in most biomes in Minecraft. If you see any grass, dig into it to collect dirt blocks.
A bed can be made on a crafting table with three wool blocks and three wood planks. Wool can be collected from killing sheep, or you can collect their wool using shears. Wood planks can be collected from wood logs, which in turn can be collected by breaking trees.
When breaking bedrock, you can reuse the dirt block and bed, but the grass cannot be reused. So make sure to collect one piece of grass for every bedrock block you’d like to break.;
, Dig down at your feet until you reach the bedrock layer. It’s possible to find bedrock from any point in the Minecraft overworld. If you keep digging directly down, you’ll always eventually come in contact with bedrock as this is used as a block to mark the very bottom of the world. You may want to use a high quality tool, such as an iron pickaxe, to speed up the process.


To create an iron pickaxe, you will need 3 iron ingots (created by placing wood and iron ore into a furnace) and 2 sticks. Sticks can be created by placing one wood plank in the top-middle space in the crafting table interface and one wood plank in the very center of the crafting table interface.

, Digging directly down towards the bottom of the world can put you at risk of coming in contact with hostile mobs and pits of lava. To protect yourself from death, make sure to bring food so that you can heal yourself after any potential fights. Bring a bucket of water so that you can use it on any pits of lava you come across. By placing water on a lava pit, the lava will be removed.

, Once you find the bedrock you want to break, place your dirt block in the correct position in preparation for breaking the bedrock. Your should place a dirt block below the bedrock block you’d like to break, as well as one dirt block in front of the bedrock block.

, Equip the grass you’ve collected and place it on top of the dirt block that you placed down earlier. Your grass will be destroyed during the next step, so make sure to collect extra grass if you’d like to break multiple bedrock blocks.

, Face the dirt block and bedrock block head-on so that the dirt block is directly in front of you and the bedrock block is one block behind it. After lining yourself up, equip the bed and tap the top of the dirt block that you placed the grass on. This will destroy one bedrock block in front of you, but the bed will remain where you placed it.

, You can reuse the dirt block and bed you’ve already placed down to repeat the process on more bedrock blocks, but you’ll need to use a new piece of grass.

, Wait until you have about three weeks' playtime under your belt before doing this. Make sure that the players and staff respect and know you. Just ask if any new spots have opened, and say that you would like to become one if they have. If there are no spots open, just tell the staff that they can always ask you when they are.

, The server may have a section on their website to apply for Mod or any Admin, if so, fill out the application form with detailed text and with good spelling and grammar. Do not keep asking when they will check the application, a lot of owners find this annoying and may even deny your application.

, Being a staff member on a server does not mean you can abuse your power, it means you have been assigned to help out the players and help the community. If you do not get promoted, keep trying and improving your knowledge on the server and when you are experienced, try again."

Create a basic circuit.,
Place your TNT at the end of the redstone trail.,
Activate your circuit.,
Try a more complex circuit.",How to Blow Up TNT in Minecraft," You'll need 5 piles of gunpowder in order to craft a piece of dynamite. Gunpowder cannot be crafted, and must be found by defeating certain enemies that have a chance of dropping some, or looking in certain chests that have a chance of holding some:


Defeating creepers (before exploding): 66% (1-2 gunpowder)
Defeating ghasts: 66% (1-2 gunpowder)
Defeating witches: 16% (1-6 gunpowder)
Opening desert temple chest: 59% (1-8 gunpowder)
Opening dungeon chests: 58% (1-8 gunpowder);
, You can use regular sand or red sand. Both work the same and can be mixed during the creation of TNT. You can find sand most commonly in the following biomes and areas:


Beaches
Deserts
Riverbanks
Mesa (red sand)

, Use your crafting table to open the crafting grid.

, Place one gunpowder in each corner of the grid, then place the last piece in the center.

, Place sand blocks in the four open spaces left in the grid. This will create TNT.

, Drag the TNT from the result grid and add it to your inventory. You can now place it in your world to be blown up., This is the simplest way to detonate TNT. See Make Flint and Steel in Minecraft for instructions on crafting it. Walk up to the TNT with flint and steel equipped to light it. The TNT block will begin flashing when lit.


Make sure to back up to a safe distance before it explodes (4 seconds after being lit).
TNT has an explosive radius of about 7 blocks.

, If you want to be a little safer when setting off your TNT, you can use a flaming arrow to light it.


You can enchant your arrows with flame to make them flaming by using an enchanting table. See Make an Enchantment Table in Minecraft for instructions on creating an enchantment table and using lapis lazuli to enchant items.
You can also light an arrow by shooting it through fire or lava. So you can build a fire in front of your TNT block and shoot an arrow through it to light the arrow and detonate the TNT.

, You can create a fire charge by placing a charcoal in the center of the grid, a blaze powder to the left of it, and a gunpowder below it. Fire charges are not as efficient as flint and steel, as you lose the charge that you throw.


Throwing a fire charge at the TNT will light it. You can throw the fire charge by selecting it in your inventory and then using the item.
Putting a fire charge in a dispenser will cause it to shoot out as a fireball when triggered. This is not as useful for TNT since the fireball shoots at a random angle.

, TNT caught in the explosion radius of another TNT will light and explode. Unlike TNT you light, which always explodes after 4 seconds, TNT hit by an explosion will detonate after 0.5-1.5 seconds.


Since the explosion does not produce an exact radius, make sure your TNT is well within the explosion, no more than 3 or four blocks from the original TNT.

, If lava flows in near the TNT, it will be set off as soon as it catches fire. This can happen even if the lava is not directly touching the TNT. The same principle applies if the area around the TNT is on fire.

, Redstone powder is used to create the redstone circuit and transmit power. For a basic circuit, you can have a trail of up to 15 blocks of redstone powder. Longer trails require redstone repeaters.Redstone ore can only be found on layers 0-15, with the most abundant amount found between layers 4-13. You'll need to mine down to the bedrock layer and then begin your hunt for a redstone vein. You can use any type of pickaxe to mine redstone ore.
One block of redstone ore can be crafted into 9 piles of redstone powder. You usually get 4-5 blocks of redstone per redstone ore you mine.
You can find redstone powder in dungeon chests and stronghold chests. Witches may drop redstone powder when defeated. Jungle temples spawn 15 redstone powder for the trap.

, There are several different mechanisms you can use to trigger your redstone circuit:


Button - This item is placed on the side of a full block, and provides redstone power when pushed. You can make a stone button by placing a single stone block in the center of the crafting grid. You can make a wood button by placing any wood planks in the center grid.
Lever - A lever is placed on any solid surface, and can toggle redstone power on and off. You can make a lever by placing a stick in the center of the crafting grid and a cobblestone block underneath it.
Pressure plate - This is a button that is pressed automatically when you stand on it. The major difference with a pressure plate versus the other two is that monsters can activate the pressure plate, making it perfect for traps. You can make a pressure plate by putting a stone or wood block in the center of the grid and an identical block to the left.

, Now that you have your redstone powder and a switch mechanism, you can create your basic circuit:


Place your switch mechanism somewhere that you can use it. This will be your blasting remote, so make sure you can see the explosion.
Place redstone powder in a trail towards where you want to put the TNT. The first piece should be adjacent to your switch mechanism. You can place redstone powder by looking at a block and right-clicking while it's equipped. Redstone ore can connect one level up or down, and the total length must be 15 blocks or less.

, This is where the circuit terminates, and will activate the TNT block. Make sure the TNT box is on the same level as the end of the trail, and is directly adjacent to the final redstone powder block.

, Now that the TNT has been placed, you can activate your circuit by using the mechanism. Once you trigger the redstone circuit, the TNT will immediately be set to explode. after 4 seconds, the TNT will detonate.

, By using redstone torches, you can create advanced logic gates that can remotely detonate lots of TNT at different intervals. See Make a Redstone Lamp in Minecraft for instructions on making and using redstone lamps, which are an integral part of larger redstone circuits.

If the server you are on supports the McMMO plugin, then it may be wise to train up the skill of your weapon choice before going into battle, which will give you bonus damage, as well as with acrobatics, as that can allow you to dodge some attacks.

, This can change depending on your play style. This could mean TNT or flint and steel, or a bow and arrow, or a sword. Having several buckets of lava to put down is recomended as they can deal big damage quickly. Flint and Steel could be used too.

, Some servers also use only items such as health potions or golden apples.


If the server you are playing uses health potions, learn how to quick use them.

, Make sure they are not an admin, have better things than you, or just plain scary.

, If you caught them off guard, you should be able to land a few easy hits in before they realize what is happening. You could also put a cobweb down around them so they couldn't run away or put down a block of lava to slow them down and put more damage on them.

, This will not only make you a hard target to hit, but it can give you critical hits. Contrary to popular belief, criticals are not achieved by jumping, but rather by falling. Knowing this, time your shots so that you will hit the enemy as you are falling from your jump.

, This is where you hold the right mouse key with your sword out in between hits and jumping. Blocking reduces the damage taken from all sources by half, including TNT and other people's attacks. However, this limits your mobility, so knowing to do this when not running is vital.

, This is called strafing, and makes it harder for your opponent to hit you, but is easy for you. Many players are good at this, and will help you a lot. When strafing, you can also change sides by switching keys, and make a pattern

, Odds are your enemy will be just as skilled as you are with their attacks, so you are going to need to be able to outlast them in the food department. Using the numbers above your keyboard, you should be able to switch to the food, eat it, then switch to your weapon/other food with a matter of seconds.

This is a shapeless recipe, and the ingredients can be placed anywhere in the crafting grid.
Blaze powder is crafted by dropping a blaze rod anywhere in the crafting grid.

Build and light a Nether Portal.,
Enter the Nether.,
Find a Nether Fortress.,
Kill Blazes and gather Nether Wart.,
Craft a brewing stand.",How to Beat Minecraft2," To create a Nether Portal, you'll need at least ten obsidian blocks. Make a hollow standing rectangle, 5 blocks high and 4 blocks long (corners are not necessary; you can use any block as a stand-in). Then strike the inside of the rectangle with flint and steel. The empty inner space should turn purple and start to make interesting sounds.

, Stand in the portal and wait 4 seconds to be transported into the Nether. Make sure you have your flint and steel for relighting the portal in case it breaks from a ghast and plenty of food to keep yourself well-fed.

, A Nether Fortress is a structure in the Nether that contains Nether Wart and a Blaze spawner. They can be somewhat hard to find, so it could take a while.

, Blazes drop Blaze rods, which are needed for making potions and getting to the endgame. You will need a lot of Blaze rods.


Nether Wart is a key ingredient in potions, and it only grows on Soul Sand, so collect some Soul Sand (it's brown with a face-like pattern) and try farming it in your base. Nether Wart can be found naturally occurring in nether fortresses in two small patches alongside stairs going upwards.

, This will let you brew potions, which will help during the final boss fight.

"

Throw an Eye of Ender.,
Repeat the previous step until a stronghold is located.,
Excavate the stronghold.,
Secure the area.",How to Beat Minecraft3," It will fly up and move in the direction of the nearest stronghold, a very rare underground structure. You throw an Eye of Ender by right clicking while holding the Eye (or by tapping ""Use"" on Pocket Edition).

, You will know you have found a stronghold when the Eye of Ender starts flying towards the ground.


The Eyes have a 1 in 5 chance of being destroyed after each use so bring a lot of them.

, You will probably have to dig a bit to find the stronghold.

, The stronghold will be full of mobs, so clear it out and light it up.


Don't dig straight down, as the End Portal frame is suspended directly over a shallow lava pool! If you aren't above the frame itself, you could fall into a deep dark cave and take fall damage, along with a potential attack from various hostile monsters.

"
"
Locate an End Portal.,
Activate the Portal.,
Jump Into The Portal.",How to Beat Minecraft4," Each stronghold has exactly one End Portal. This is what you will use to get to The End.

, You activate the portal by filling the ""frame"" with Eyes of Ender. To do this, equip the eye, then use an empty block on the frame. Repeat this until all twelve blocks contain eyes.

, This will take you to The End.


You will not be harmed by the lava under the portal when you are jumping into an activated portal, but if it is not activated you will likely burn to death and lose all your equipment!

"
"
Get ready to fight the boss.,
Locate the dragon.,
Destroy the Ender Crystals.,
Kill the dragon.,
Collect the loot.,
Jump into the exit portal.

,
Beat the Game!",How to Beat Minecraft5," The End boss is called the Ender Dragon. She (yes, she was officially confirmed to be female) flies around the End skies. You must kill her to beat the game.


Watch out for Endermen, they spawn heavily in this dimension.
Saving, exiting, and reloading while in the End, if you have not yet killed the dragon, will cause a second dragon to spawn. Make sure you have enough time to finish the battle.

, She may take a moment to appear, so take this time to prepare, by sorting your inventory and such.


You may spawn underground. If this is the case, just dig your way out.

, These crystals, located atop the obsidian towers in the End, heal the Ender Dragon.


You can destroy them with any attack, including a snowball. Using a close-range weapon is not recommended, since the crystals explode when hit. On Pocket Edition, some crystals are defended by iron bars., You can damage the dragon using a sword, bow and arrows, or explosive items. The dragon is immune to lava, fire, and splash potions, but potions that buff your stats are very useful.


Since trying to sleep in the End or Nether results in an explosion, you can use beds to damage the ender dragon. Just place it in front of you, stand back, and then try to sleep when the dragon comes close.
In Computer Edition, the dragon is invulnerable to arrows while it is perched on top of the portal., The Enderdragon drops lots of Exp, and opens the exit portal.

,, Now you have ""beaten Minecraft,"" you'll spawn in your world's normal spawn after the credits, with all of your gear and a large amount of extra experience levels!


You can go back to the End whenever you want now, provided you can reach the portal. Several valuable things can be found there, such as the Endermen and their valuable Ender Pearls, and the Obsidian and End Stone blocks, which are some of the most blast-resistant blocks in the game that you can use.
The 1.9 update to the Computer Edition added End Cities and End Ships.

Explore the Nether.",How to Be an Expert Minecraft Player," Look around at your world, and try to determine what kind of biome you are in. They can be forests, deserts, oceans, taigas, jungles, etc. If there are trees, iron, water, clay and coal, you're off to a great start!;
, This may sound strange, but it is one of the only things you can do at the moment. You will need wood for the rest of the game to make pickaxes to mine later on. You can make loads of items with them! Try to collect about 10-20 wood blocks.

, You should now proceed to drag the logs into the 'Crafting' section of your inventory. On the output side, you should have wood planks. Collect at least four.

, This will make a crafting table. You can use it to make many things in the Minecraft game, including chests, beds, furnaces, weapons, and more important stuff like that!

, Put one wooden plank on the bottom, and one on the top. You should see four sticks in the output. Collect them to make torches and handles of weapons.

, You should look in the sources for the Minecraft Wiki. Look up Wooden Pickaxe, Wooden Axe, Wooden Sword, and Wooden Shovel on the wiki.

, Take your shovel and dig through the dirt, then take your pickaxe to carve a small room out of the stone.

, Again, use the wiki to learn how to make them.

, Do NOT dig straight down! Use a stair-like fashion where you can climb up and down the ledges. Mine until you find coal! If you find coal within 4 minutes, skip to step 11. Also, if you find a cave, remember where it is, but avoid it, they are far too dangerous for you to explore at the moment.

, If so, skip to step 11. If you did not find any coal. It's okay, just go to the surface and find some logs. Make a furnace (use the wiki) and put it down. Put your logs in the top part of the furnace, and some wooden planks in the bottom. The outcome will be charcoal, a carbon copy of coal (no pun intended).

, Put the stick in one of the bottom squares of the crafting table, and the coal/charcoal above it. The output should be 4 torches.

, If you need more light, repeat step 11 until you have reached your desired amount.

, By now it should be night-time. It is essential that you make a door. Make your doorway 1x2 so the door fits perfectly. You will probably start off with wooden doors. When you get slightly advanced later in the game, replace with iron doors for better security.

, In this time you should make a chest (look on the wiki, last time it will be said).

, This is probably the most dangerous time that you have experienced in Minecraft so far, so be prepared. Don't bring anything except your sword and be alert for monsters.

, Now is your time to be relaxed and have fun. Kill everything that moves except yourself, and get great rewards by doing so.

, You may have to kill animals, but if you're too nice to slaughter them, find some apples by punching more trees, or harvest some wheat with a hoe. Wheat seeds are obtainable through grass, which should be abundant in your Minecraft world. Mine with your pickaxe to find some iron and coal. With iron, you can craft shears to shear sheep so you don't need to kill them. You need 3 wool blocks to make a bed. The easy way out is to kill sheep, but if you keep them alive you can continue shearing them and eventually breed them.

, Put it somewhere in your house that looks good; it is recommended you expand your house! With a bed, you can save your spawn point, so if you die, you will respawn in your house. Continue to kill until the sun sets.

, When the sun sets, grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again, for the monsters are coming out. Go into your mine and continue mining, since iron ore will be very valuable to you. Look for iron, coal and rare ores for about 7 minutes, because that is when the sun will start to rise. Always be alert for monsters, especially creepers, which will explode if they come too close.

, If that is the case, then keep looking., At sunrise, kill all mobs again, since you will need all of the items that they drop when killed. See all of the crafting recipes you can make with these drops at the Minecraft Wiki.

,, Make a basic checklist of things you might want to find. Some suggestions are: Sand, Clay, Ink Sacs, Cactus, Birch Tree, Spruce Tree, Oak Tree, and Mountain Biome. Mountain biomes are VERY useful for mining and finding/making unique structures.

, Smelt sand in the furnace to create glass, put cacti on sand around your house to make a monster barrier, put cacti in the furnace to make green dye, use ink sacs as black dye, decorate with different kinds of wood! Really, there are infinite possibilities!

, You have iron tools, but still live in a cave. Now that you are more experienced, consider building an outside portion to your cave or even move and build an entirely new house! You can make windows if you have glass.

, Grab a stone or iron sword and of course, a pickaxe, and set off down into the cave. Be sure to bring LOTS of torches! You will find lots of coal and iron as well as gold and redstone if you go deeper down. If you're lucky you might even find diamonds, but be careful as there is often lava flowing underground. Don't bring items that are unnecessary, as your inventory will be filled to the brim after your mining trip!

, If you explored the cave, you are sure to have found plenty of iron! Smelt it, and use the wiki to figure out how to make it into armor. Of course, before you use good iron on armor, be sure to make backups for your tools.

, If you dig down to layer 11 by using F3 (please remember not to dig straight down), you will have the highest chance of finding diamond. You can make a strip mine there for a high chance to find diamond. A strip mine is usually one wide and two tall, and is the most effective way of getting diamonds. It is suggested you use a diamond pickaxe to mine it, but an iron one will also work.

, Diamonds have many of the same uses as iron, but they don't need to be smelted, are far more powerful, much more durable, and have extra purposes. Diamonds are usually favored by Minecraft players as a great achievement.

, Find a lava pool towards the bottom of the world, but be sure not to fall in! Lava deals deadly damage. If you have made a bucket with iron, you can scoop up some water from the surface and bring it to the lava pool. Right click on a wall in the room (not the lava itself), and watch the magic happen. All of the lava will transform into obsidian! Only a diamond pickaxe can mine obsidian.

, This is a very useful resource due to it being the strongest naturally placeable block in the game. You can also make a nether portal, but you will need a flint and steel. The Nether is the 'Hell' of Minecraft, a lava-filled, glowing red and dim place. To get there, you need to make 4 obsidian blocks parallel to each other on the ground. On the outer 2 blocks, place 4 more blocks on them. Then connect it at the top. You should now have a 4x5 rectangle with a hollow 2x3 inside, all 1 block thick. You can now use a flint and steel on the inside and enter the nether!

, In the Nether, it is a completely different world. Almost all of the blocks are different. You will find lots of valuable resources such as glowstone and nether wart, fight dangerous mobs and maybe even find a Nether Fortress (a generated structure). There is so much in the Nether that is unique, you will just have to see for yourself! Have fun playing!

Keep moving.,
Move left and right instead of a straight line.,
Save your arrow.,
Practice your aim.,
Jump while using your sword, as you may get a critical hit and do more damage, whilst also making yourself a harder target.

",How to Beat One in the Chamber in Minecraft," Nearly everyone uses the arrow, which is insta-death, and if you are still you are an easy target. Keep on the move!;
, This will make you a harder target.

, You only have one shot with your arrow, make it count!

, If you ""misfire"" when you use your arrow, you'll have to kill someone with the sword to get it back. Try shooting bats in Survival or a moving mob.

Help a new player out.,
Be nice in what you say to new players.,
Help a player build.,
Do not grief!,
Give things you don't really need to someone that needs them.,
Avoid swearing.",How to Be Nice in a Minecraft Server," If you find a new player in the server, help him or her with the spawn, minigames and more things that he or she does not know yet. You give help and in turn, this person will give you help too.
, Moreover, don't say such irritating things as: ""You are just a noob! No way I am helping noobs!""; or ""I don't even care! If you need help ask someone else!""; or, ""Go watch a video of this server! I am not helping anyone."" None of those things are nice and it's better to be cooperative, so that you get to share ideas and build amazing things together., Building giant and complex buildings and objects in Minecraft can be really hard. So, why don't you give your helping skills a try? Find someone that needs help building and help him or her to build it well. This will make you have new friends too; it will also help you to build better., If you grief, you will be reported and you won't be respected. Griefing and trolling might seem funny at the time but it's annoying, boring and rarely tolerated. Don't assume people will find it funny for long either; it's tedious. Griefing can also lose you friends, the people who would otherwise help you out., Do not burn or trash them. Some players may want them and they try to get them but they can't. Do not trade it, just give it if a player really needs it., Most kids play in Minecraft servers and their parents don't want them to swear. Use normal words to explain yourself; expletives aren't going to help get that structure built."

Have many good quality pickaxes.,
Carry a stack of torches.,
Never dig straight down.,
Don't dig gravel and dirt with pickaxes.,
Carry food and weapons.,
Explore the many ways to mine.,
Know how to navigate.",How to Be a Good Miner in Minecraft," There is no use in finding things like diamond and redstone and then mining them with a wooden pickaxe. You need an iron pickaxe to be able to mine those. Carry at least an iron pickaxe if you plan on mining very deep. If you are low on iron and do not have enough to make a plentiful supply of iron pickaxes, you can use a stone pickaxe to mine through the stone and the iron pickaxe to mine the ores you encounter.;
, It can get really dark underground, and you need torches to illuminate them. To place torches, right-click the ground or wall. Make sure there isn't any water around or the torch will be washed away.


You can increase your gamma if you find it difficult to see in caves. Mac: Go to Finder. Open, go at the top of the screen and Press Go-Press alt/option. Then press Library, Application Support, Minecraft. Put the Minecraft folder in your hotbar. Go to options and open with Text Edit. Go to options find gamma and increase to 1000.0

, If you dig straight down, you could fall into a pit of lava or a room filled with creepers, so always dig one in front of you, or in a staircase-like pattern downwards.

, This will wear down your pickaxe twice as quickly. Just punch the dirt or gravel, or make shovels.

, There are abandoned mine shafts and caves all throughout mining, and you'll most likely you'll find one while digging. You need to be prepared to fight your way out. If you plan to stay underground for a long time, you will need to carry a nice supply of food so that your hearts will stay replenished.

, Exploring caves can be interesting and easy, but some say it's generally ineffective (others say it's great for obtaining ores); ""quarrying"" (digging a large hole straight down) yields plenty of cobblestone, but very few ores; ""Branch Mining,"" however, is an effective alternative offering maximum ores for minimal pick usage. Simple branch mining is basically a series of parallel tunnels every three blocks (two between each tunnel) branching out of a perpendicular hallway., One of the best methods of navigating a cave or any place dark and winding is to put your torches on the right wall as you go deeper in. Once you finish, retrace your steps by following the torches on the left."

Use commentary!,
Avoid annoying laughter.,
Make good quality videos.,
No dirt houses or any other unappealing homes.,
Get a friend or co-op with someone!,
Don't tell bad jokes.,
Overreact over creepers.,
Don't use huge words.,
Don't repeat yourself.",How to Be a Good Minecraft YouTuber," Buy a microphone, good or not, it's better than nothing! Can you think of any gamer who has over 100k subscribers (and particularly does gaming videos) who doesn't speak in his/her videos?;
, Go to laughing school, after you pass, you may continue to the next step. But seriously, practice a regular laugh - not something over the roof that is straight out bizarre and loud. Something pretty medium noise level genuine laugh.

, Download a good recording software such as Hypercam, Fraps, Bandicam, or Camtasia. If you are looking for a free recorder that accepts voice and face cam, try Ezvid.

, In Minecraft, do not build a horrible house (except if you're just kidding around). Expand your house. Make traps. Maybe trap a friend to cause a hilarious reaction.

, A buddy will support you and not make you feel alone and worried. Make sure it's a good friend, or you might get worried, freak out, hyperventilation, or completely uncomfortable.

, You can tell jokes that are meant to be bad jokes, though. So if you tell a bad joke, hope the audience thinks that you're kidding around. Speak funnily after that and they would. Do that after every joke. Every joke is meant to be a joke.

, Be funny when a creeper is around. He blew up your house? Do a stupid crying, whining noise to emphasize it.

, The audience of people who may be watching you will not understand the vocabulary you are giving them, so stay with mainstream words.

, Repeating yourself isn't really interesting, as all your content will look the same, it will definitely decrease popularity level. Be sure to be confident in your videos and speak clearly to the microphone so the people watching can understand and you yourself could when you go back and edit the video.

Get diamonds.,
Get enchanted golden apples.,
Get a bow.,
Brew potions.,
Know who you will be up against.",How to Be a PVP Master in Minecraft1," Diamonds are arguably the most useful ore in the game for durability, efficiency, and others.;
, They can be found commonly in dungeons and strongholds, and give fire resistance, resistance, absorption, and regeneration. Get at least 10 of them, as you will be powering through them quickly.

If you can't find Enchanted Golden Apples in dungeons or strongholds, a regular golden apple will be just fine.







, Bows can be obtained early game, and at full charge, are stronger than an un-enchanted diamond sword. Get at least Infinity enchantment on it.

, A list of recommended potions are below. When used correctly, they can give you the upper hand in combat.

Establish clear and fair rules.,
Make connections with the people that play your server.,
Upgrade your server specs.,
Add new features as they come out.,
Offer Donation perks.,
Start a forum for your server.,
Advertise your server.",How to Be a Good Minecraft Server Owner," If you can't show that you know what good communities should act like, people will break down into chaos. Basic rules, such as no scamming and no hacking n chat are a good start, but making specific rules to the type of server you run will show people you know what you are talking about. For example, if you own a factions server, you can decide if you want a rule against TNT cannoning or not, along with many topics to decide on.;
, These are the people that choose to play on your server, and they are more likely to stay if they are friends with their owner. This doesn't mean just regulars, this means welcoming new members and making sure they have the best time possible.

, This means dedicating more RAM to your server's running capacity, increasing your bandwith, or upgrading your hosting plan. These things increase the quality of your server's connection, which in turn means that people can play easier and have more fun.

, There are dozens of plugins and minigames being released into the game on a daily basis, so stay on top of these things. That new plugin you see can take your server to the next level, and that minigame you could be the new fan-favorite, so you never know. Don't be afraid to experiment with new things in your server.

, If people like your server so much they decide to give money to it, show them some gratitude by offering them perks for the money the donate. This doesn't mean that you make them unbeatable in the game for donating a few dollars, but something is better than anything. A good ideal to go on is that donating shouldn't be necessary to have fun in your server.

, This should be a place where people can discuss what is going on in your server and their opinions, as well as receive news for what is up and coming within your server. The domain name should be similar, if not identical, to the name of your server so people can easily find it if they search it.

, If no one knows about your server, no one is going to join it. Put your server on server lists like PlanetMinecraft or Minecraft Server List. You can also buy advertising space on most of these sites, at a fairly decent rate as well.

, This gives you an advantage, as they have already taken some damage.

, Also try hitting them while sprinting, as it will knock them back.

, If the server allows it, try placing some blocks in a ""nerd pile"", a large stack of blocks.

Breaking and placing blocks, killing mobs, and running around might seem simple, but the skills might help you later on, especially when done in certain ways.


Try learning about redstone circuitry. It can be used for many useful purposes.
Try spawning mobs in creative mode and switching to survival to fight them.

Don't fight just one type of mob! There are a lot of them out there.


Try different building techniques. Minecraft isn't just for survival- it's a place to create things too.;
,


Try finding a server that is open to newcomers, or especially for newcomers.

, If they're a friend that lives near you, you can have them overage play a LAN world. If they're a sibling who lives with you, you can also play a LAN world.


If the friend or sibling lives far away, try a video chat.

, If you are better at building than fighting mobs and surviving, try creative mode. You won't have to survive and you can just build.

, If you don't like using ""W, A, S, D"", maybe using the arrow keys is better for you. If you press ""Escape"" then ""Options"" and ""Controls"", you can change the controls. There are many different controls that you can edit to your likes!

, Also try talking about something interesting that is happening in your life. Don't brag about everything you tell the audience, or they'll think you're selfish and vain! Don't swear a lot, that makes the audience think you are a VERY dirty YouTuber.

, Don't try so hard on being popular on YouTube, that'll make you lie a lot about your life! Like how SkyDoesMinecraft is funny on YouTube. He gets popular 40% because of that!

Chop trees down.,
Collect the drops.,
Move on to the next tree.",How to Be a Good Lumberjack in Minecraft PE1," An axe will allow you to chop down wood extremely efficiently. There are different types of axes with varying prices and benefits. Decide which axe suits you the best.


Wooden axe: Slow mining, short durability, but a good beginning
Stone axe: Fairly fast mining, average durability, commonly used.
Iron axe: Fast mining, rather long durability, very commonly used
Golden axe: Slow mining, short durability, but it looks very fancy.
Diamond axe: Very fast mining, long durability, it's the best one, but the hardest to craft.;
, Chopping one single tree at the time is a waste, so find a place where there are many trees, whether it is a forest or a jungle.

, Begin with a tree and chop down all the wood by clicking and holding with your axe.

, Besides your chopped down wood, the despawning leaves will give you a variant of different drops, such as apples.

, Continue chopping down trees and collecting drops until the forest is chopped down. If you still need more wood, move on to the next forest."

Trees need at least a 3x3 space to grow properly.
Trees can only be planted on dirt or grass. Therefore, a tree farm cannot be in a nether, mesa, desert, or tundra biome.

, Use fencing to enclose your farm area. Don't forget to build an entrance. Enclosing your farm will prevent hostile mobs from entering and make the farm look neater in general., Saplings are obtained by breaking leaf blocks with anything but shears. Trees won't always drop saplings, so remember, be patient if you need a large quantity of saplings., Place the saplings, so that there are at least 3 blocks between each sapling., If you would like to speed up this process, you can place bonemeal, gathered from bones of a skeleton, on the saplings., Chop down the trunk first with your axe, then break the leaves with anything but sheers to collect more saplings and other drops.

Know your Villager.,
Know what you want to trade.,
Find emeralds.,
Check for a ripoff.",How to Avoid Being Ripped off by Villagers in Minecraft1," The Villagers that currently roam their villages are librarians, priests, farmers, blacksmiths, butchers/tailors and generics (modified in). Farmers wear brown, librarians wear white, priests wear dark pink, blacksmiths wear a black apron, butchers/tailors wear a white apron, and generics wear green robes.;
, People might often just run about trying to trade whatever willy-nilly, but that won't help. If you have some paper or books you wrote, trade with a librarian! If you want something enchanted, trade with a priest (though it is usually much more efficient to enchant things yourself).

, Emeralds are used as a currency for the villagers, and every trade is an exchange of an item for an emerald. They are found in Extreme Hills and Extreme Hills Edge biomes between height levels 32 and 4. However, even when mining in an extreme hills biome they are rarer than diamonds, so it's best to just trade for them. If hoarded, emeralds can buy extremely rare or difficult to make items like saddles, enchanted books, and diamond armor, but the villagers that sell these are rare and most try to sell common items like bread or glass.

, These can easily be mistaken by people who just trade trade trade, but it is true. They can try to trade a flint and steel in exchange for an emerald, an iron shovel for an emerald, four an emerald for a diamond etc. The vast majority of a villager's trades will be ripoffs, and they will charge very large amounts of emeralds for desirable items like diamond gear and chain armor and enchanted books.

Understand that Endermen WILL attack, but only if they are provoked.,
Know how to avoid the enderman.,
Keep the end in mind.",How to Avoid an Enderman Attack in Minecraft," There are two ways to provoke an enderman, which you'll want to keep from doing if at all possible:


If you strike an Enderman with an object or empty hand, it will become hostile toward you.
If you look directly at an Enderman (by putting your camera crosshairs on it), it will become hostile. The moment you look away it will begin trying to attack you.

Try backing into a building or cave with only two blocks of vertical space, since Endermen need at least three blocks of vertical space.
If you think you may have provoked an Enderman by looking at it, listen for a creepy sound of static and distortion, along with shaking and an open mouth on the Enderman's part. Any of these mean it has become hostile toward you








Endermen will not be provoked if looked at while wearing a pumpkin on one's head.;
, If you are being attacked by an enderman, then your savior will be water. If an enderman touches water, it will be damaged. So if you are being threatened by an enderman, just jump into a nearby lake or river.


Endermen will not burn in the sun like zombies and skeletons do, but they will teleport back to the end if the daylight comes out. So, if you see the sun coming up, don't worry if an enderman sees you; it will probably just go away.
It is good practise to carry a bucket of water in your hotbar at all times. When an enderman is provoked, place the water at your feet.

, The end is a dark spooky place that is only accessible by finding a stronghold and placing an eye of ender in each slot of the ender portal frame pieces. Endermen spawn crazily in the end and it is also the home of the black and purple boss, the ender dragon. Stay away from the end at all costs!

"
"
Find a villager that trades for a mass-producible resource like paper, written books, or wheat.

,
Trap the villager in a well-lit hole or house.,
Plant/breed the resources and harvest them later (or harvest them from a preexisting farm).,
Open up the place where you trapped the villager and trade the resources you obtained.,
If the village has a large population and/or is well defended, kill that villager.,
Kill a fourth of the villagers, if there is a high population and they are well defended.",How to Avoid Being Ripped off by Villagers in Minecraft2,", That way, you won't have to find it again and to prevent it from being killed by zombies.

, Make sure to harvest only enough for seven trades.

, After making a single trade seven times (seven emeralds total) the trade will instantly disappear a new one will take its place.

, Don't use fists, arrows, or potions, as they cause the iron golems to attack and they are very powerful and hard to kill. After you kill the villager, there will be room for a new baby villager to spawn, and it may have another useful trade.

, If none of them have good trades and are not breeding, doing this will mean the remaining three quarters of the population will repopulate the lost fourth and the new villagers may have better trades.

"
Block up anything that will give you an edge to fall off of.,
Use an x-ray machine out of a redstone block and a fence to see where to build a mine.",How to Avoid Dying in Minecraft Due to Falling," Avoid the danger of falling by clogging up ravines, caves, and other holes with dirt, wood, stone, or other common materials. Don't use gravel, sand, eggs, or anvils because they obey gravity.;
, If you see lots of caves and ravines, then it's not a good mining place. One thing you should know about Minecraft is that caves are not too deep, but they are filled with monsters so it still is not good to fall into a mineshaft or cave.

Make sure to take everything valuable.,

,

From the roof of the house, pour lava or water in.,

,
Make Redstone traps, such as dart traps or spear traps, to kill owners in the base.

,
Use Silverfish.,
Bring stuff to help you heal.",How to Attack a Base in Minecraft," Take the strongest dog(s) and ocelot(s). If they have low health, they may need to be fed the appropriate meat.


Check the tail to determine if they are low on health. If the tail is high up, they have full health, but if the tail is down, they have a very low health.
Dogs basically accept any meat, even Rotten Flesh from Zombies. Ocelots must be fed fish.;
, It could lessen the time of the raid and do more damage. A group of friends is even better if there are people guarding the base.

, You should bring rails (if you can bring your loot to base that way) and minecarts with chests to take immense amounts of stuff.

, Bring enchanted Diamond armor if possible.

, It could help you to recognize the house and terrain.


You might need to look at a map to plan your attack.
An alternative is to ride to the base and scout from high up in the air, wether a mountain or literally high up in the air.
Ride pigs, horses, or an empty minecart.
You could also stand on a Ghast or other flying creature to get an aerial view of the base.

, This can get you a good at look at defenses and sentries. You can either blow yourself up there with TNT, use a Slime Block as a trampoline, or build a bridge from another mountain.


This is a pretty unsafe method, as players in the base can see your name and know you're on top of the house.

, Go at dark. This is the best time to raid, because your enemies can't really see you.

, He will be weakened, and you could get his/her weapons and their armor.


You should do this from far away. If you get close up, you have a greater chance of dying, and if you do die, the guard can warn the people inside, and your whole raid could be ruined.

, Send Ghasts, Ender Dragons, Wither, Giants, or Zombie Horses outside the base.


This might not be the best idea if you're looking for the element of surprise, because some of these enemies (Ender Dragons, Giants, and Zombie Horses) must be summoned, and the command appears in the server chat.

, You could use cannons, TNT, or even a Creeper.

, You could dig a tunnel underground, and then end up right in the middle of the enemy's base with the element of surprise.


Use rails and minecarts to quickly traverse underground.

,, This is especially effective if the house or part of the house is wood.


If you do this, make sure you can get out safely!

, If anyone hurts you, the wolves will instantly attack them. One man doesn't stand much of a chance against three wolves.

,


Make sure you know they're not going to turn on you!

,


Iron Golems would probably be best. They take more damage when attacking, and also have more health.

, If you're playing on Multiplayer, you can have one group raid the house, and one group hold off any enemy in your way.

, Destroy everything in your path.

, They create resources such as eggs and milk.

,, This way, if they die, they can't respawn in the house.

, However, make sure to evacuate your troops!

,,, These little guys burrow in random blocks and hide until that block is destroyed. Once it is, they are released and are very hard to kill.


This works extremely well with the obsidian trap method, because with all exits blocked, the owners will have to destroy blocks to get out.

, This could be rabbit stew, potions, or any type of food item.

Travel to the Nether.,
Gather your materials.,
Prepare for the fight.,
Find a good summoning location.,
Build the base of the model.,
Place the Skulls on the summoning base.,
Run away!,
Start the battle.",How to Spawn a Wither in Minecraft," In order to find the materials you need, you will need to go to the Nether. This is a very dangerous area, so make sure you are properly prepared to survive while you're gathering what you need. This means having good equipment, plenty of food, and your wits about you.


See this guide for more information on surviving in the Nether.
You will not be able to spawn the Wither if you are playing on Peaceful difficulty or have any mods installed.;
, You will need three Wither Skeleton Skulls and four blocks of Soul Sand.


Wither Skeletons can only be found in Nether Fortresses, and even then they don't drop very often. Use the ""Looting"" enchantment to help you gather the three Skulls you need. You will probably need to kill around 100 Wither Skeletons to find the three Skulls.
Soul Sand can be found in a variety of places in the Nether. Dig it up with a shovel.

, The battle with the Wither will be a long one, so you'll want to make sure you're prepared. Since the fight can take a while, and may end up underground, it is recommended that you prepare a couple Potions of Night Vision. This is because the Wither will most likely destroy your torches. Potions of Regeneration, Healing, Strength, or Golden Apples (especially enchanted ones) also greatly help.


It is highly recommended that you have a Diamond Sword with Smite V, Diamond Armor with Protection IV, as well as a Bow enchanted with Power IV or V. It is also recommended to fight the wither in the nether, but in a smaller area. That way, the Wither will not destroy anything of value, as said below.

, The Wither will destroy every block it touches, and its projectiles also cause explosions. Make sure you don't start the fight near any structures or characters you want to protect.


If you've beaten the Ender dragon at The End, this may be a good place to summon the Wither. The Wither will focus its attention on the Endermen. You can either let the Wither kill the Endermen indefinitely for a good supply of Ender Pearls, or get the Wither to half health so that it can't fly anymore, allowing the Endermen to finish it off. See Step 8 for more details.

, Create a ""T"" out of Soul Sand by placing one block on the ground and then three across the top.

, Place the three Wither Skeleton Skulls on top of the Soul Sand ""T"", one on each block. As soon as you place the last Skull, the Wither will be summoned.


You cannot use pistons to place the summoning objects, but you can place the skulls with dispensers.

, When the Wither first spawns, it will be surrounded by a blue glow and will have half its health. It will grow in size until its health bar reaches maximum, and cannot be damaged yet. Once the Wither reaches its full health, it will explode. You'll want to be a fair distance away when this happens, or you could find yourself dead before the fight even starts., Fighting the Wither is no easy task. Not only is it deceptively fast, but it's pretty much impossible to hide from it as the Wither can and will destroy every block it touches. Pummel the Wither with arrows until it reaches half health. At this point it will activate the Wither Armor which will make it invulnerable to arrows. It will also fly down to your height, so you can start beating it with your sword.


The Wither has three heads, each of which can attack on its own. The Wither fires Wither Skulls, which will cause an explosion and the Wither effect when you get hit. This will slowly drain your health until you are dead, and turn your hearts black, making it hard to tell how much health you have left. This will also heal the Wither by 2.5 hearts. The Wither will also attack all other mobs except undead mobs, so you can distract it in this way.
The Wither regenerates 1/2 a heart every second.
When killed, the Wither drops the Nether Star, an item used in crafting a Beacon."

,,, Hold down the shift key as you move around to engage the ""sneak"" mode., No saplings = no more trees, so if you do not collect at least one sapling from your first tree, you will need to start over.

,, This will keep the tree away from your lava and prevent loss of a tree (and apples and saplings) to a fire later.,, Craft a wooden pickaxe. Be careful to reserve two wood blocks (don't turn them into planks) to create your first charcoal later., You should have enough dirt to create a 2x2 pool, but you can use plank blocks on the side which will be furthest from your lava if necessary. This will create a never ending water supply since any bucket pulled from this pool is replenished automatically.

, One of the simplest methods is to dig a hole 4 blocks long and the second block 2 blocks deep.Now put a bucket of water on the end with the 2 deep hole and lava on the other end.


To make a basic cobble generator do it in this form:
D-W-S-S-L-D
D-S-D-D-S-D
D=Dirt, W=Water, S=air space, L=Lava
An alternate, more compact generator can be made as follows: (D=Dirt block, A= Air block, C=Cobblestone block, W= Water and L=Lava)
A-A-W-C-L-D
D-W-W-D-A-D
D-D-D-D-D-D

,


You can combine your water source and your cobblestone generator if you wish.

, Craft torches., With the fishing rod and your furnace, you can keep yourself fed while waiting for your garden to produce., Once you have a supply of cobblestone, extend your platform to the bottom of the island and collect the dirt, taking care not to mess up the cobble generator.

NOTE: If you craft cobblestone slabs, you can double the surface area you can create with the same amount of raw material. This slab method also has the advantages of preventing mobs from spawning in dimly lit areas.






NOTE: You have only a limited number of dirt blocks. One way to avoid losing dirt blocks is to create a platform or ""tray"" underneath your SkyBlock to catch anything that falls off the top.
You can do this by opening a one block hole in your cobblestone and placing a bucket of water into it, creating a waterfall that you can swim down through.






Drop down and place 4 blocks of cobblestone in a column/tower going down. Swim back up for air, then drop back down through the water to place a single block perpendicular to your column at the bottom of your column directly under your original hole... and swim back up.






Hop out of the water, pick up the water with the bucket.






Place a ladder and drop back down to the bottom perpendicular block you placed and build/expand a lower level or ""tray"" 4 blocks below your original SkyBlock.






""Tray"" expanding below the main level. This can be left dark as a mob spawner or lit to prevent mobs at the players discretion.







, This will give you access to mob drops such as string, bones (bone meal for gardening), specialized tools, etc.,, Expand your house, create a more efficient mob grinder, make a large mob farm, the possibilities are endless.

",How to Play Minecraft," When first starting the game, you will need to choose if you want to play single player or multiplayer. In single player, you obviously play alone, while in multiplayer you play with other people across the Minecraft servers. If playing the free version of Minecraft, multiplayer will not be available to you. You will also need to set the main options, which include the sound and difficulty settings, among other settings as well.


The difficulty settings determine whether or not monsters which are also known as ""hostile mobs"" will show up at night or underground. These are specific to each world, so your difficulty settings on one world may be different to another. Peaceful (for beginners) will prevent hostile mobs from spawning, while Easy will give you a small spawn rate, and Hard will give you a massive one. The amount of attack damage given to you by each mob will differ depending on the difficulty settings too. Also, in the hard mode, Zombies, which are hostile mobs, can break down wooden doors down and kill you!
If you are playing multiplayer, it will be unnecessary to create the world, as you can simply join someone else’s server. To find a multiplayer server, you can visit a website such as planetminecraft.com. However, if you only want to play Minecraft with a few close friends, then making your own server may be the best option.;
, If you are playing on your own, you will need to create the world for your character to inhabit. When creating this world, you will need to choose the game mode, as this will change how the world you create will work. This functionally makes the game easier or harder to play. The available modes are:


Survival: When playing in survival mode, you will have many of the familiar requirements of other games. Health, hunger, armor, and oxygen (when swimming) bars will appear, as well as inventory. You will also need to gather materials for crafting, through mining and other means, as well as gain experience points.
Creative: You will have unlimited access to materials in this mode, and your needs (such as health and hunger) will be gone. Also, you can fly.
Hardcore: This mode is the same as survival except for hardcore permanently locks the created world into the Hard difficulty setting, and your world will be permanently deleted if you die. So, be careful! (By the PC update for 1.9, you will be stuck in spectator mode after you die)
The bonus chest option will spawn a chest containing wood, tools, and food. It will spawn near your spawn point with 0-4 torches around it. This is helpful for new players.
Spectator: This mode will allow you to fly through the floor to see the world. You can only get it by using the /gamemode command or by dying in hardcore mode.
Adventure: The correct tools will be needed to harvest the individual types of materials in this mode. However, other items can still be interacted with. This will only appear in custom made adventure maps or by using the /gamemode command.

, This is a helpful menu which allows you to control the world you are creating better. You can type in a seed (or code which generates a particular world), toggle cheats, and set your World Mode, among other options.


World modes include - Default which does the basic generation, Superflat, which is essentially a flat world, Large Biomes, basically creates much larger biomes than the default settings, AMPLIFIED which generates huge mountains and deep caves, Customized that can make awesome different worlds, and finally a special mode called Debug that generates every single type of block in one world but you can only look at them.

, When you first start playing the game, the most important thing will be to survive the first night. The game goes through day-night cycles, and the monsters in the game appear at night. You will need to build yourself a shelter before the in-game sunset so that you will be protected., You will need to mine and collect materials to build anything in the game. The first material you will need to collect to survive your first night is wood. Find trees and punch them, by holding down the left mouse button, to destroy them and collect wood.


Twenty pieces is a good starting point.

, A crafting table will be used to create all of your items in the game. Build a crafting table to continue to build your shelter. You can build a crafting table by following these instructions:


Open your inventory by pressing “E” on your keyboard and place one wood in one box on the top right under Crafting. This should allow you to build wood planks.
Grab the wood planks that it gives you and put them in your inventory.
Take those wood planks and fill all four boxes under “Crafting” with wood. Do this by right clicking each square or holding left click as you drag your mouse over all four squares.
This will allow you to craft a crafting table. Take it and place it by right clicking somewhere near where you intend to build your shelter.
When crafting at a crafting table, there are nine positions in which to place items. Which order items are placed in is important, but the position isn't necessary for certain items, From here on, the positions will be referred to as 1-9, going left to right and then down (as if reading a book).

, You will need tools to harvest many materials. Build your first tools using wood and your crafting table. The primary tools will be a pickaxe, an axe, a shovel, and a sword.


Begin to make tools by making sticks. These are made using two planks in your inventory crafting boxes. Two planks make four sticks.
Make a pickaxe by placing sticks in positions 5 and 8, and wood planks in positions 1-3. Notice how it makes the shape of a pickaxe?
Make an axe by placing planks in positions 1, 2, and 4, and sticks in positions 5 and 8.
Make a shovel by placing one plank in position 2, and sticks in positions 5 and 8.
Make a sword by placing planks in positions 2 and 5, and one stick in position 8.
These tools can be improved by making them with cobblestone, rather than wood. However, don’t waste time finding stone during your first day. You can make better tools during the next day.

, You want to have some torches in your house. Otherwise, your home will be dark and hostile mobs will spawn in.

, Build some kind of structure in any location which is large enough, though on top of a hill or mountain is usually a good idea (it will be easier to defend and find later). You can build a house-like structure, or you can dig yourself a cave. The goal is to make a structure which you can shut yourself in to (although don’t forget to leave yourself an initial way to get in!). A roof is not necessary, though spiders will be able to enter. You can place an overhang around the shelter so that spiders are barred. Your character is two blocks high, so if you want a doorway, make it two blocks high.


Ensure that your shelter has enough light to prevent hostile mobs from spawning inside of it.
Craft a door by placing wooden planks in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and eight while crafting. To open a door, right click it. However, this is true only for wooden doors. If you somehow find iron and make an iron door, you will need a pressure plate or other redstone mechanism.

, It may seem cruel, but its how you will survive. They will drop 1 piece wool if you kill them but if you somehow find iron and craft shears, they will drop 1-3 pieces of wool. Collect 3 pieces of wool and 3 wooden planks to craft a bed. To craft a bed, place the 3 wool in positions 4, 5, and 6 and the 3 wooden planks in 7, 8, and 9

, Once you have survived the first night, you will want to find some food. Going hungry will lower your health over time and make you easier to kill. The easiest way to find food is to kill animals. If you are too nice, then use apples or plant seeds to get wheat. Food will be unnecessary on Peaceful difficulty.

, Once you’ve built your basic shelter and tools and you’ve survived the first night, the rest of the game can largely be played however you wish. One way to play the game is in the style of an RPG. Go around collecting and crafting better items, and slowly work your way up to The End (another world where you will need to fight a dragon to “beat” the game).

, You can play what is called “sandbox” style, where you use the materials and environments to create cool environments and structures. Minecraft players have recreated cities from Game of Thrones, the menacing Helm’s Deep from Lord of the Rings, even the White House and Notre Dame!

, The game can also be fun for budding inventors, as it has mechanical aspects. You can figure out how to build working elevators, cannons, or anything else you can think up, through the use of redstone. Some players even managed to build a working computer in the game!

, Some game modes work better for certain playing styles than others. If playing Sandbox style, for example, you’re probably better off playing in Creative mode.

, This play style can be good for people who don't want to build a house and are more into adventure.

, You will want a weapon to defend yourself from the various monsters in the game. A sword is a great place to start, and the method of building it is described above. Make sure that you use stronger materials than wood for the blade on your more permanent weapon, as wood will degrade quicker than other types of tools.

, You will want to craft yourself some armor. Armor will help protect you from damage when fighting monsters. You can create several different pieces of armor and, as with many items in the game, you can craft them out of different types of materials.Materials you can use to craft armor include: leather, iron ingots, gold ingots and diamond gems. You can also buy chainmail armor off of NPC Villagers.
Craft a helmet by placing your material in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
Craft a chest plate by placing your material in every position, but position 2.
Craft leggings by placing your material in every position BUT 5 and 8.
Craft boots by placing your material in positions 4, 7, 6 and 9.

, Monsters cannot spawn in areas with high enough light. To keep areas lit at night, you will need to place torches. To make a torch, you will need one stick and one coal (coal placed above stick when crafting).


Coal can be found in mountainous areas or underground. It looks like stone with dark spots on it.

, Mobs (or mobiles) are any creatures which move in the game. These can be good, or they can be hostile. Knowing how to identify which is which is imperative, as it can mean the difference between life or having to find your way back after respawning.Peaceful Mobs, such as cows, chicken, and sheep, will never attack you. You can attack them to collect meat for food.
Neutral Mobs will not attack you until you give them a reason. Different actions will set off different neutral mobs. Zombie pigmen, and wolves, for example, must be attacked before they will hurt you. On the other hand, endermen will become hostile as soon as you look at them (so avoid getting them in your crosshair). Endermen are neutral but will become hostile if you look at them from the upper legs and up or if you attack them first.
Hostile Mobs will always attack you if they see you. These mobs only spawn at night or underground. Common hostile mobs include skeletons, zombies, creepers, endermen, and spiders.

, Some materials, such as dirt, stone and cobblestone, are commonly found underground or on exposed hillsides. You will need to dig with the pickaxe or shovel to harvest these materials., You can also find certain materials above ground. This includes materials like wood, sugar cane, seeds, and wheat. You can also collect things like wheat in villages. Axes or your hands are often enough to get these materials.

, Some materials will need to be obtained from creatures. You can get wool from sheep (avoid killing them by using shears), eggs from chickens, and milk from cows, among other items.

, Use your crafting table or your inventory crafting to create items. Don’t forget that the shape you make when crafting items can often be important in making your recipes work (although some items do not require this). Click and drag items from your inventory into the crafting boxes, placing the lot with a left click or just one with a right click. Take the item you've created by clicking its image and dragging it into your inventory.

, There are far too many game items to list all of their crafting recipes here.You can find recipes for the different items by searching our Minecraft section or by looking at a variety of other websites online. You can also ask your fellow players.

Then, using your mini crafting box (found in the inventory), craft wooden planks from the collected wood. Place the wooden planks vertically in the mini crafting box and collect the sticks.;
, Axes are used to cut down trees much faster than if you use your hands. To craft an axe, you will need two sticks and three pieces of a material (wooden planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamonds).

, The pickaxe is used to mine and collect materials you need for tools, building, etc. To craft a pickaxe you need will two sticks and three pieces of a material (wooden planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamonds). To crafts sticks, see step 1.

, The shovel is used to collect dirt, grass, sand, etc. This is much faster than digging with your hands. To craft a shovel you need two sticks and one piece of a material (wood, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamonds). To make sticks, see step 1.

, The hoe is used to turn grass into farmland for planting seeds. To craft a hoe you need two sticks and two pieces of a material (wooden planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamonds). To make sticks, see step 1.

, Swords are used for killing mobs and destroying certain blocks. To craft a sword you will need one stick and two pieces of a material (wooden planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots, or diamond). To craft sticks, see step 1.

, Bows are used to attack mobs by shooting arrows. To craft a bow, you will need three sticks and three pieces of string. To craft sticks see step 1. String is acquired from killing spiders or breaking cobwebs, and is also found in dungeons.

, Arrows are used as ammunition for the bow. To craft a stack of four arrows you will need one flint, one stick and one feather. Flint is occasionally dropped when you mine gravel. To craft sticks see step 1. Feathers are dropped by chickens when you kill them. To craft the arrows, put the flint on the middle top square, the stick directly below it and the feather goes in the bottom middle square.

, Flint and steel is used to start fires and it can help you get to the Nether later on in the game. To craft flint and steel you will need an iron ingot and flint. You will have to mine for both. You get iron ingots from smelting iron ore, and flint is occasionally dropped when you mine gravel.

, Buckets are used to carry lava, milk, and water. To craft a bucket you will need three iron ingots. You get iron ingots by smelting iron ore.

, Compasses are used to direct the players' to their spawn point. To craft a compass you will need four iron ingots and one piece of redstone dust. You must mine for both.

, Clocks are used to tell the time of day. To craft a clock you need four gold ingots and one piece of redstone dust.

, Fishing rods are used to catch fish. To craft a fishing rod you will need three sticks and two pieces of string. To craft sticks see step 1. You can get the string by killing spiders and breaking cobwebs, and it is also sometimes found in dungeons.

, Shears are used to collect wool, leaves, vines and tall grass. To craft shears you need two iron ingots. You get iron ingots by smelting iron ore.

, Maps are used to navigate areas by walking around them whilst holding the map. To craft a map, surround a compass with 8 pieces of paper.

Place 4 iron doors around the plate.,
Place a block of Obsidian on top of the doors.,
Lure someone into the trap.",How to Make a Simple Trap in Minecraft2," A player must be able to activate it, so an iron or gold pressure plate will not work.

, If you use wood doors, it is very easy to break and your trap will only last a few seconds. Unless the person trapped has a pickaxe, it could take a while to get out.

, If you are unable to get obsidian, use another hard to break item, bedrock would be ideal if you could get access to it, but obsidian is the easiest.

, Once they step on the plate, the doors will close and they will be stuck inside. Since the only way to press the button again is to step off the block and back on it, since they cannot jump up or go forward, the doors will remain closed indefinitely.

Access your inventory.,
Convert a wooden block to wooden planks.,
Place four of your wood planks in the crafting grid.,
Place your crafting table in the world and start crafting.",How to Make Tools in Minecraft2," The instructions above all assume you already have a crafting table (also referred to as a ""workbench""). If you don't, you'll have to craft this block before proceeding. The crafting ingredients for the crafting table are four wooden planks - any type will suffice. Obtain a block or two of wood from trees in the environment - you won't need much.

, Once you've accumulated a few blocks of wood, access your inventory screen (press ""E""). If you've just started playing, you should get the achievement ""Taking Inventory"".

, In your inventory screen, drag a wooden block to the 2x2 crafting grid in the top right corner. Place the wood anywhere within the grid. Your raw wood should be converted to wooden planks, which will appear in the box to the right of the 2x2 grid. Drag these back into your main inventory. If you wish, you can continue to do this for all of your raw wood.

, When you have four wood planks, place one in each square of the crafting grid. A crafting table (workbench) block should pop up in the space to the right of the grid. Drag this back into your inventory. Your crafting table is complete!

, Now that you have a crafting table, you can begin to craft tools, which in turn will help you gather resources and craft new items. From 4 humble wood planks, you can eventually build amazing, high-quality gear which will allow you to explore and master the world around you!

Cobblestone
Spruce planks/ logs
Oak planks/ logs
Spruce leaves
Fences
Redstone lamps (and a redstone power source)
Carpet
Stone
Iron bars
Hay bales
Trap doors
Stairs (jungle stairs and bricks stairs are good for roofs in the Conquest Resource Pack)
Wool of any color;
, Carpet is easy to craft for survival mode, and it adds color to your house. The best colors of carpet for Medieval houses are:


Dark green
White
Red
Cyan

, Dig a hole in the ground where you want the carpet to be. Place signs in a pattern in the hole. Signs can be tilted and placed on angles, so get creative! Then place the carpet on top of the signs by sneaking and right-clicking on top of the sign. You now have a carpet with a fun design!

, Use cobblestone or similar, and darkish wood (logs) (the wood being diagonal one block out from your cobblestone rectangle unlike the current picture). Try to make the frame an irregular cuboid shape, like a large box with a smaller irregular cuboid on top.

,, Remember, your avatar is 2 blocks high, so try to make most of the windows 1 blocks higher than the floor (unless you want massive feeling windows), so your avatar can see out of the windows. Windows can be made out of just about any transparent block. Stained/normal glass is common, or iron bars can be used if you want to make sure people take longer breaking in and so that you have that little bit more protection.

, Now, you should have a basic house with a few windows. Not medieval enough? Don't worry! The key parts of the medieval building are the tiny details and decorations, which we will go over in a few minutes.

, This may consist of stairs and slabs, but be careful! A wide house means a wide roof, but if you use stairs for every level of the roof, then this will result in an awkward roof. This can be fixed by having only a few levels of stairs, and then slabs.

, Start by adding doors and a walkway made of cobblestone. Start to furnish it with the following:


Stairs on the corners (upside-down stairs can be placed near the roof or anywhere else on the building)
Trapdoors placed on blank areas
A simple redstone lamp (made using fence posts)
Tiny indentations made with stairs (replace blocks in the wall with stairs facing outwards)

, Every Minecrafter needs a garden or a farm, right? Add a small farm with wheat and a few trees to give your house that ""organic"" feeling. Maybe even use some bone meal to grow some plants around your house. For even more of an old, medieval-like feeling of being a farmer, construct a mob farm!

, Most medieval knights have horses! Add a small fenced in area with a horse in armor and some hay bales, and maybe even a cauldron filled with water as a water source for the horse.

, Some rooms to think about are listed below. Obviously, these are all optional. You might not have built a very large house, and that's okay! Just pick a few of these rooms:


Basement (if you want to dig an extra hole)
Kitchen
Dining room
Bedroom
Living room

, Add a sink made of a cauldron filled with water, and any other kitchen furnishings.

, Search Google for ""Minecraft chairs"" and you can find some cool chair ideas too.

, The wall can be nicely decorated with a painting or two.

, The reason you don't want to make a bathroom is because back in the medieval days, people didn't have bathrooms, they had pots. You could put down a flower pot to try to capture that same feeling. Or you can still make a bathroom if you want., You can try using stairs to create indentations in the floor, and carpet wherever it looks best."

Grab a sword of at least iron (preferably diamond).,
Set the difficulty to Easy or above.,

When mobs begin to spawn, ready your weapons and prepare for battle!,
Learn to critical hit.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft1," Get some iron or higher armor, too. A bow with arrows is optional (recommended), and maybe a couple of dogs as a backup. Also, grab some torches.

If possible, get your equipment enchanted. Don't forget to bring a shield. Be careful not to take all of your good items, because if you die, it will be hard to retrieve them unless you have keep inventory on, which is often considered cheating. Also in the 1.9 update, you can dual wield a bow and sword, so you can shoot and use melee attacks almost at the same time.







, Aggressive mobs can't spawn in Peaceful mode (if you want a challenge, set to Hard). Put your weapons, food, and potions in your hotbar, and place some torches around you to add light.

,

It is recommended to sort items. For instance, weapons on one side and potions, food, etc. on the other.

, Jump and swing or sprint and hit. Critical damage comes as you fall. Try to time your swing to hit the mob as you fall after the jump.

, Since it can fly, the arrows are the most effective.

, Get diamond armor and enchant it as best you can with an enchantment table. Get a diamond sword and enchant. Do this with a bow; you will only need one stack of arrows. Get a diamond pickaxe and two stacks of solid blocks. Take a piston and redstone torch. Also take some enchanted golden apples.

, Use your bow to strike the crystals on top of the obsidian poles. You will need to climb the other poles with iron bar cages with a pole of the solid blocks.

, The dragon will swoop down to the pedestal/portal and spit out ender acid. It may fire ender acid balls at you.

, Repeat until it is dead. It will explode and drop a lot of XP. Collect the XP.

Quickly move from the wall with your fully charged bow and fire at the blaze.,
Shoot at the blaze.,
Collect the experience and drops.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft3," If you want a quick fight, this step is almost mandatory. A bow is one of the easier ways to kill a blaze, seeing that they can fly. Also, obtain some snowballs. It is a good choice to store the snowballs as snow blocks, and will save time. If you throw snowballs at them they will weaken and you can easily finish them off with a sword. Finally you can collect their experience points.

, (and lava) Brewing directions can be found here.

, Also build a small 3 block high wall out of cobblestone. It doesn't have to be too long, and should have a small roof.

, Start charging your bow. Do not try to shoot the blaze until your bow is fully charged.

, Be sure that you are close to the end of the wall so you can hide faster. If a blaze is waiting for you on the ""safe"" side, kill it with snowballs.

, Get behind the wall and start charging your bow again. Repeat until the blazes are dead.

, You may have to build your way to the drop, as blazes fly. Set the difficulty to Peaceful.

If possible, snipe the skeleton with your bow.,
Catch up to it and spam.,
Collect the experience and whatever item(s) it may drop, like bones and arrows.

,
Try running in a zigzag motion.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft4," Otherwise, run towards it and do a critical hit. Walking in a straight line towards the skeleton will get you killed, and jumping doesn't make a difference. A zig-zag pattern is recommended.

, Try to block (right mouse) the arrows when you're close, as the chances of dodging now are minuscule (Tiny). If you have a shield, you may also charge at them, letting the shield take damage.Try to determine what time the skeleton will fire based on how fast it was firing before.

Note that there is also a charged creeper.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft6," If you don't have a bow, then hit them with a sword and then quickly move backwards.

, If the creeper starts flashing and getting bigger, get away from it until it either stops or explodes. If you kill it, collect the experience and the item(s) it may drop, like gunpowder.

, When a creeper is hit by lightning, it has a bluish aura surrounding it. When it explodes, it is double the explosion potential compared to normal Creepers. You kill a charged creeper in the same way as a normal creeper.

Spot the enderman.,
Run towards it.,
Step in water and make eye contact.,
Build a 1x1x2 building, and then attack it.,
Collect the experience and if you are lucky, the ender pearl will drop.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft7," Do not make eye contact with it (hovering the cross in any area above the torso). There are three ways to kill the enderman.

, Jump and critical hit it, and keep critical hitting it. If it teleports, look for the trail of particles and it will lead you to the enderman, who is most likely behind you. Repeat and kill.


If you don't have good armor, get some tamed wolves (at least five). Do the first hit as a critical and let the wolves finish it. Feed your wolves after, as they will probably be injured from the enderman's attack.
Attacking the enderman's feet will not make the enderman teleport. If it does teleport, get to a 2 block high space, as the enderman will not be able to attack you. It is also a good idea to get your back against a wall, so it cannot surprise you from behind. Don't use a bow, or any sort of projectile, as the enderman will just teleport away.

, The enderman will try to teleport to you, but will be damaged by the water and teleport away. Repeat until the enderman is dead.

, The enderman cannot reach you, therefore, you will not get damaged. Or you can build a pole 4 blocks high and you will be in the range to attack the enderman but the enderman can't attack you as you are not in the range of the enderman's attacks. Watch out for spiders and skeletons, as they may knock you off the pole., To increase that chance, use a sword with the looting enchantment.

When the wither is spawned, it will recharge strength and explode.,
Shoot arrows or splash potion of healing at the wither's head or body.

,
After the wither's blood has disappeared halfway, it will have a white, shining cover around it.,
After you have killed it, it will drop a nether star, which you can use to craft a beacon with.

",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft8," After that, it will fly high in the air.

Get to one side of the pigman.,
Run and hit any pigmen who are too close.,
Kill the pigmen one by one.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft9," Attack one with a critical hit.Try fighting in third person view.

, Try not to run around, as this will attract more pigmen. Watch your step, as one miss step can send you plummeting into lava. Zombie pigmen are not affected by lava. Do not let them surround you.

, A knockback II enchanted sword is usually better for this, as if you run too far, you will be surrounded. Lead the pigman around in circles, hitting them. Do not wander too far, as you will likely attract other swarms.

, Collect the experience and whatever drops they may leave, like rotten flesh or a gold nugget.

Let the spider come to you.,
Proceed to charge forward and continue left-clicking in the general direction of the spider.,
Look around to make sure there are no other mobs around.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft10," Be warned, as the spider jumps and scales walls (But they cannot climb upside-down, so make sure to put overhangs on your walls). Instead of the regular approach, start with a running hit to knock it back.

, You may take some damage from this. However, you also have the choice of another running hit followed by a critical.

, Collect the experience and whatever item(s) it may drop, like string or spider eyes. You will be able to ferment the spider eye and use it in potion making, or eat it in an emergency. It will poison you for 4 seconds, but it won't make your health go lower than half a heart, and your health will regenerate if your hunger bar is full.

"
"
Beware of gaps.,
Heal poison attacks.,
Suffocate the spiders.,
Destroy the monster spawner.,
Beware of cobwebs.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft11," Cave spiders are much smaller than regular spiders, and can fit through any gap a spider can fit through, however, its height is a half block. This makes them much harder to contain and fight on your own terms. Cave spiders can also track you through solid walls, so they are difficult to ambush.

, Unlike regular spiders, Cave spiders have a poisonous bite. If you are poisoned, your health will deplete until you only have half of a heart left. You can heal poison by drinking milk, but this can take a while. Try to use your milk between battles.

, Cave spiders can hold their breath for 16 seconds, and then die after another 6 seconds. If you can flood or bury the spiders, you should be able to kill them with relative ease.

, Cave spiders are only spawned by monster spawners, so destroying the spawner will prevent more spiders from appearing.

, Monster generators are often surrounded by lots of cobwebs. These will slow you down but do not affect the cave spiders' movement. Use your sword to break the cobwebs.

"
"
Use your fists to hit the block.,
Place some TNT next to the block and blow it up.,
In the event that you are confronted by a swarm, you have four options.,
Go on through the stronghold.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft12," If it seems to break too quickly, stop, because there is a silverfish in the block. If this doesn't happen, you are safe.

, This guarantees that the silverfish will not come out.

, Of course, you can try taking them with your iron/diamond sword, but as they are small and fast, this is not recommended to inexperienced players.


Turn and run. Do not stop until you are a reasonable distance. Block up the way you came with dirt. Return later.
Or, you could pillar stack 2 dirt blocks up, camp there, and fight them off with a bow or sword.
Get on high ground (at least 2 blocks high) and place lava below you. This should take care of the silverfish that are chasing you.
Get on one of the many stairs in the stronghold and pour a water bucket to wash them away. They'll be kept away by the current.
Do not use splash potions. This will cause you to be swarmed.

, Collect the experience, if there is any."
"
Approach the slime and perform several criticals.,
Collect the drops, which are usually slime balls, and experience.

",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft13," Be careful when killing the large ones, as they will split. Once the slime is dead, back up a bit. Note that each one splits into smaller slimes. Consider it as multiplying.


When encountering a small slime, one hit from a sword will kill it, however a fist is advised because they are very weak and are a waste of sword durability. The little ones do no damage. Note that these will drop slime balls.
For a medium slime, it will will split into small slimes. Kill the smaller ones. Medium slimes cause mild damage.
For the large one, it will split into a medium slime, then kill as for medium slime. Large slimes cause moderate damage.

"
Run from them.,
Do a hit or a critical hit if encountered.

,, It's best to look around for more mobs while running.

"
Aim for the tentacles.,
Either dodge the fireball or hit it to deflect it.,
Seeing that ghasts can fly, you will need to build bridges to get to the drop (gunpowder and ghast tears) and experience.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft15," For some reason, arrows shot at the face will simply pass through the body. It has 10 HP, but may be hard to kill as it can attack from 16 blocks away, making it very hard to hit.

, Fireballs are easy to deflect,(be sure to note that you can send backfire charges with your bow too) and can kill a ghast if you hit the ghast with it. Don't count on it though, and still use your bow as your primary weapon.

, Collect them. Also, it is a good choice to build it out of cobblestone, as ghasts' explosions are incapable of destroying it.

"
"
Try staying at least 5 blocks away from it.

,
Hit with a sword.

,
Kill the smaller ones that the large ones turn into when killed.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft16,",, Also the small ones attack you unlike the small slime.

"
"
Walk close to the zombie and let it come to you.,
Repeat this process until the zombie is dead.,
If fighting several zombies at once, run towards them and left click.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft17," Once it is within two blocks, critical hit it (jump and strike). You do not have to retreat after hitting it as it is very slow.

, Look around and make sure there are no more mobs around. Be careful because every time you hit a zombie there is a chance another one will spawn nearby. Proceed to collect the experience and any drops, like rotten flesh. It is advised for you to not eat the rotten flesh (unless you can't get other food) because it may give you poison or hunger depending on what you're playing. If you do get poison or hunger, stay in one place until it goes away to prevent your hunger bar from dropping or drop even more.

, This knocks them back several blocks. Also, when focused on you, a zombie will not attack a tamed wolf that is attacking it.

"
"
Make beams two blocks above the ground in a nether fortress.,
When a wither skeleton comes, it will see you and walk towards you.,
Pick up the drops.",How to Fight Mobs in Minecraft18," Wither Skeletons are three blocks tall, so you can walk under the beams but they can't.

, When it stops at a beam, walk up to the wither skeleton and hit it until it dies. Make sure to be on the opposite side of the beam to the Wither Skeleton.

, These are usually bones or coal, and sometimes a stone sword. Very rarely you will get a wither skeleton skull and it is used to spawn a wither boss.

Do not try to lead it off a cliff; the mob that is being riding takes all the fall damage and chickens just fly down and take no damage.

Get to the corpse in the magma.",How to Get the Chaos Flame Ember in Dark Souls," The Demon Ruins are home to all manner of demonic beasts, and can be found deep within the Dark Souls world. The easiest route to the ruins is the path leading down from the Bell in Queelag's Domain, which you must ring as part of the story progression. In turn, Queelag's Domain can be entered from the swamps at the bottom of Blighttown. There is a staircase leading down almost directly behind where the lever to ring the Bell is located. Follow the stairs to the bottom and you will arrive at the lower level of Queelag's Domain. You will notice an area with broken bricks and a gap in the wall leading to a tunnel; enter this and follow the tunnel to its end. You have just entered the Demon Ruins.;
, The bonfire will make sure you don't start all the way back in Blighttown should you die. It would also be wise to kindle the bonfire as much as you can, as the enemies you are about to face are of a high level.

, There will be several Chaos Egg-burdened enemies around, but only two will actively harm you, and even they are easy to outrun, so there is little reason to be cautious at this stage.

, You will notice a bridge leading across to another path, and eventually, the Ceaseless Discharge boss.

, In order to reach the Chaos Flame Ember, you will need to kill the Ceaseless Discharge; once you kill him the magma will disappear, allowing you to reach the ember.

, He will not attack you until you pillage the corpse on the altar at the far end of the path, after which you need to fight for your life. See the article on killing the Ceaseless Discharge for tips and methods on the fight. After landing the final blow, a cutscene will show the magma hardening and forming walkable paths.

, In front of you, you can see some small pools of magma, a path to the left and a path to the right. The area to the right leads further down towards the Demon Ruin's main area boss, and is riddled with respawning Capra demons. The Chaos Flame Ember is located to the left side of the magma pools., If you get close enough you will see that it is guarded by not one, but seven Taurus demons. Yes, seven! In order to reach the ember, you will need to defeat all seven in combat; luckily they don't respawn so the fight will not be completely hopeless.

, Your best, and probably only, way to survive the Taurus demons is to tackle them each individually. This will require edging slowly forward until you gain someone's attention, after which it will chase you. If you rush into the area too quickly and too far, you will be attacked by several of the demons and have a really tricky situation on your hands. Once you have lured one out, lead it back towards the foot on the slope.

, At the foot of the slope there is a little ridge. If you stand on certain areas of the ridge, the Taurus demons cannot seem to attack you and have to walk around the other side to attack you - this buys you valuable time to drink an estus flask or launch a powerful spell, making the fight a tiny bit easier. As with the original Taurus demon fight in Undeadsburg, blocking the demon's powerful attacks, dodging underneath them and only attacking when you can safely escape a counter, will work here again. However, there is no easy exploit to the fight.

, This will take a little while, but if you die, you will only have to make your way back from the bonfire at the top of the slope., After taking a moment to celebrate your amazing achievement, examine one of the magma pools beyond where the demons were guarding. You will notice a corpse floating in the magma face-down. This is the location of the Chaos Flame ember.

, This is not necessary, but both rings reduce the effects of magma (with the Orange Charred Ring being far more effective) and will allow you to get the ember without dying. The Orange Charred Ring is gained by cutting the arm off the Centipede demon found deeper within the Demon Ruins (by following the right path through the magma pathways), while the Flame Stoneplate Ring can be looted from a chest located within Sen's Fortress.

, If you have either ring equipped, you should be able to run across the magma and pillage the ember from the corpse, before returning to safety. However, if you do not have either ring, you will need to jump to the corpse - and note, using this method, you will die, so recover any lost souls you may have left around before attempting it. Simply walking to it will inevitably kill you before you can reach the corpse, so jumping is the only way without the rings. Stand away from the edge, begin a sprint towards the corpse and before you hit the magma, jump into the magma. With precision, you will land on top of the corpse and just have enough time to retrieve the Chaos Flame ember before dying. Congratulations!

Make a Striped candy.,
Make a Wrapped candy.,
Make a Fish candy.,
Make a Candy Bomb.,
Make a Coloring candy.,
Make special candy combos.",How to Get Special Candies in Candy Crush Soda Saga," A Striped candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row.


When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. The direction is dependent on what direction the stripes are on the candy.;
, A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one’s more challenging and difficult to get as compared to a Striped candy.


When you use a Wrapped candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way.

, A Fish candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a box of 2 by 2. When you use a Fish candy as part of a match, it will swim towards a random candy or obstacle to clear it.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place so you can swap them to form the five-in-a-row.


Candy Bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar-colored candies will be removed from the board. By itself, it doesn’t sound like achieving much, but when combined with another special candy, it will give you more awesome results.

, A Coloring candy is a special candy that results from matching six or more candies. This is a new special candy introduced in Candy Crush Soda Saga.


Coloring candies do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all candies of that color will be changed to the color of the Coloring candy.

, Special candy combos bring more awesome results than using a special candy by itself. Special candy combos are generated when you match two special candies side by side. Each combination brings different results depending on the special candies matched.

It should be: Joe Puddy: blueberries, bananas, and strawberries; DJ Saturday Night: raspberries, strawberries, and bananas; Gamer Guy: blackberries, cranberries, and strawberries; Dr. Romero: raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, and blackberries. You will see that blueberries cause people to turn into zombies in the game. Close the white board. Grab the cup of coffee out of the machine on the left. Then exit the secret bunker by jumping up the fruit crates and jumping up to the left. This exit will take you to Shady Side. Jump left out of the construction pit, through Chinatown, and to the Wharf.

, When you reach the subway gate, use your subway pass. Head right until you see the train. Jump up on the cars and then go up to the secret bunker using the ladder.

, Go to your backpack, use the blueberries, and use your mouse to turn the crank. Keep turning it until you get a medical gun filled with the antidote. Shoot Dr. Romero with the gun to cure him. Jump up the fruit crates to the entrance and click on the wooden board pile. Go to the computer and Dr. Romero, and process the antidote again. Turn the crank quickly so as to get the gun before the zombies break in! You’ll get another medical gun.

, Scroll back and forth and make sure the zombies don’t get near you. When you’ve cured all of the zombies, you will be saved! You will get your island medal as you go back to the blimp.

Go to the Battle.net website and click on “Log In” at the top. Log in with your username and password, and click “Log in” to continue.
After you have logged in, look on the center of your screen for a link called ""Manage My Games - Account Management” and click on it. You must already have an existing World of Warcraft account to create a PTR account.;
, On the center of your Account Management page, there will be a list of all the games you have purchased on Battle.net.


Find your World of Warcraft account. It should say “World of Warcraft” along with the region you are registered in, such as Americas & Oceania (US) or Europe (EU).

, After clicking on your World of Warcraft account, you will open up a page to manage it. On this page you will see information about your WoW account, including your subscription renewal date.


Scroll down until you see the options “Character & Guild Services,” “Additional Services,” and “Referrals & Rewards.”
Click on “Additional Services,” and some links including a link titled “Public Test Realm” will appear.
Click the “Public Test Realm” link to access the PTR Service page.
On the PTR Service page, click the “History/Status” link, and your PTR account will automatically be created.

, Now that you have a PTR account, you will also need to download the PTR client to log onto the PTR.


On the PTR Service page, there is also a link titled “Download PTR Client.”
Click the “Download PTR Client” link then choose whether you are using a Windows PC or a Mac. After making the choice, you will begin to download a file. This file itself isn’t the PTR client; it is a program that will download the actual PTR client for you when you run it. The PTR client is too large to download through a website, so it is done through this file.
Once you finish downloading the file, run it and it will automatically install the PTR client on your computer.
After you have installed the PTR client, you can open it through the Battle.net desktop application that comes with the regular version of World of Warcraft.

, As described earlier, log onto Battle.net, select your WoW account, and then click on “Additional Services.”


On the PTR Service page, you will see some basic info about the current situation with character transfers.
Since the PTR is a test realm, there may be weeks or even months where the character transfer service is unavailable. In these cases your only option will be to create a new character (Part 3). If character transfers are available, it will show on your page something to the effect of “Character Copies Left: 3” along with a list of characters on your WoW account.

, You’ll be taken to a confirmation page.

, After you have confirmed the transfer, it will take you to the History/Status page with a list of all characters you have transferred. It may take some time for the character transfer to complete. You can refresh the History/Status page to check on any pending character transfers.


The transfer will not affect your character on regular WoW servers in any way.
While characters on the PTR can be created at level 90, they will not have the same items or professions that your regular characters may have.
You are limited to transferring a certain number of characters to the PTR for each testing phase. The limit is set by the developers during each testing phase.
Make sure you use your transfers wisely because once you use them all, then you will not be able to transfer any more characters until the next testing phase begins.

, If you don’t want to transfer characters, or if PTR character transfer is unavailable, you can create a new character via the PTR in the Battle.net desktop app.

, On the World of Warcraft section of the Battle.net desktop application, there is a large blue button that says Play. Above the Play button you can select which account you want to log on with. Click the option that says “PTR” then click “Play.” It will open World of Warcraft and connect you to the PTR.


Once you have connected to the PTR, you will be taken to the character selection screen. This screen is almost identical to the standard World of Warcraft character selection screen, except there is an extra section near the bottom left.

,, Click the Name field and enter the name you want for your character. Select its class and race, and when you’re done, click “Done.”


After creating your character, it will automatically be at level 90 before you even log in.
Do not get too attached to your PTR characters because accounts on the PTR are regularly wiped clean and all characters are deleted.

,,

,,

, The first thing you are going to have to do is name your restaurant. Name it whatever you want, but try to name it something that will attract customers such as ""________'s Japanese Eatery"" or whatever.

,, Your first customer should come into the restaurant and order Ikura Maki. To do this, you will need to use the rice and fish egg. To make the dish, click on each of the ingredients to place them on the roller. To roll the ingredients into the dish, click on the roller to roll it. Now the dish should be placed on the conveyor belt and brought out to the waiting customer. If you get the recipe wrong or put the wrong ingredients in, you will see a little blob of brown goo on the plate. This, in the game, is known as a ""foul dish."" The customer will not accept this and you must attempt to make the dish again.

, Later in the game, you probably will have memorized all the recipes, but for now, check your recipe book whenever you cannot remember a recipe. The longer you take to get your customers' food ready, the more unhappy they will get and the less tips they pay you, so don't spend too much time looking at your recipe book or fiddling around with the ingredients.

, In the lower-right corner of the game screen there is a black telephone. If you click the telephone, you can order more rice, toppings, and sake. Use this when you are running low on ingredients, but don't wait until you run out.

, The longer you take to make their dishes, the more unhappy your customers get. Earn time by performing knife tricks or serving them sake. If a customer is extremely unhappy, they will leave your restaurant.

, After your customer has eaten their Ikura Maki, the empty plate will still be on the table. Get this out of the way by clicking on it. You will earn a bonus for picking up three or more empty plates at one time.

, Since this is Japan, you will be earning yen instead of dollars or pounds. Using your yen, you can order more ingredients and buy upgrades for your store. After each ""day"" of working at your restaurant, you can buy many upgrades such as a faster conveyor belt to serve your customers faster, a digital telephone allowing you to order up to three toppings at once, more comfortable chairs for your customers, new curtains, wallpaper, and much more!

, Each ""day"" you work at your restaurant, another ingredient or recipe is added to your recipe book. Make sure to find out what you can make with your new ingredient so you're familiar with it."

Think twice before you have an in-game Relationships.,
Have Fun!",How to Get Started in RP on World of Warcraft," It sounds boring but this is where a lot of new Role-players make mistakes. Reading about the lore of certain events and how they happened can give you a good backbone to creating your character.;
, When you decide to make your character, make sure you pick and appropriate name for your race. A Human Male is less likely to go around with a name like ""Pwnzer"" or ""Leetkilla"" if they are role playing, It is more likely you will see names like ""Harrisone"" or ""Johnstone."" Picking a good name gives you a good impression and make you look like you have done this before.

, Double Brackets are your friend. Double Brackets are used as a form of communicating to people OOC (Out of Character) it is a very useful emote that can help you in situations. Example: Character 1: I have another important matter to attend to. Character 1: ((gtg I need to go to the shops. )) They are a really useful thing to learn straight off.

, If you use Curse Client you should get a few addons specifically made for Roleplaying, A couple of good ones include; Total RP 2, GryphonHeart Items, My RolePlay. These can be used to create or add extra information to your character.

, Even if you are roleplaying, most people are probably more interested in getting Rep or farming gold. Don't pester them to Roleplay with you because it will make you look stupid and needy for attention. Invite people nicely to roleplay and be prepared for them to say no.

, Okay now this subject if tricky. A lot of people who do roleplaying for a while will have (at one point) had an in game relationship with another character. If you feel like you want to have an in game relationship with someone, Ask the OOC first before rushing in, make sure you and and the other person are comfortable with it

, The main point of roleplaying is to have fun with your friends and learn more about the world of warcraft. It's nice for you to make new friends and to have in game relationships with them.

Be aware that the lockout system serves a purpose.,
Monitor your lockouts.",How to Get Started in Molten Core in World of Warcraft," If it's your first time doing Molten Core, or if your character is below level 85, it's recommended to go with a group.


It was not even possible to do Molten Core alone until two expansions after it was released.;
, You can ask your friends to help you if they have some spare time, or if you’re in a guild, ask if one of the guild officers or a guild event coordinator is willing to schedule a guild event to do Molten Core.


If none of your friends are available to help, you can go to a major city and try to form a group by asking in the public chat channels. Some players may also be willing to sell tours of Molten Core (or other raids) via the trade chat channel.

, For the solo adventurer, once you are around level 85 or higher the enemies in Molten Core can become quite trivial. It depends on your gear as well, but your stats will reach a point that enemies are attacking you for minutes and your life will barely drop.


This is a steep difference from going in at level 60 where you will die within 20 seconds without getting healed.

, Once you have either formed your group or decided to take it on alone, you will need to travel to the raid.

, Molten Core is located on the continent of Eastern Kingdoms. It's deep inside Blackrock Mountain, which is on the border of Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes. The walk-in entrance is located in Blackrock Depths, a dungeon in Blackrock Mountain.

, The other way to enter Molten Core is by speaking to Lothos Riftwaker (a non-player character) near the lava in the center of Blackrock Mountain. He can teleport you directly inside.


Originally, you would have had to do a quest before Lothos Riftwaker would teleport you, but now that the quest is several years old, it's been changed and you don't need to do it anymore.

, If you are in a group with a Warlock and he is already inside Molten Core, he can summon you in.


It will take 2 other people with him to create the summoning portal, so in total it takes 3 other people besides yourself.

, When you enter Molten Core, you will be greeted by a pack of level 62 Molten Giants. In total, there are 10 bosses in raid and a whole lot of smaller level 58–63 enemies.


When you move your mouse over an enemy, it will show their level on their nameplate. If you are looking at a boss, his nameplate will read “Level ?? Boss,” and there will be a picture of a skull.

, Before you can spawn the final boss, you must defeat all of the previous bosses (except for Lucifron, who can be skipped). When looking at your map, you can see the location of each boss marked by a skull. The final boss of Molten Core is Ragnaros. Press M to open up your map, and you will see a section right in the middle of the map called Ragnaros’ Lair.

, Most of the enemies in Molten Core, including Ragnaros, are simple: when you get their life to zero, they will stay dead. The Core Hounds in Magmadar Cavern (open up your map and near the top you will see a section titled Magmadar Cavern) are an exception.


These Core Hounds are linked together in packs of 5, and they will revive a few seconds after dying unless all other Core Hounds in their pack are also dead.
It’s suggested to use area-of-effect (AOE) abilities on the Core Hounds.

, Just like every other raid instance, Molten Core operates on the standard lockout system. This means once you kill a boss, you are locked to that instance until the lockouts reset every Tuesday.


If you killed a boss and got locked to an instance, then you will not be able to join another instance of Molten Core in the same week. For example, if your friend killed a boss in a separate instance, you will not be able to join his instance until Tuesday.
This also means you can only kill a boss once per week, since once you kill the boss he is dead in your instance until the reset.

, A weekly lockout is aimed to slow down the speed at which loot can be acquired. Since you are only able to kill each boss in Molten Core once per week, that means you are also only able to receive loot from each boss just once per week.

, If you ever want to check whether you are locked or not, and when your lockout expires, type /raidinfo to bring up a menu. This will bring up a window titled “Raid Information,” and it will tell you the exact number of days,hours and minutes until your lockout resets.


The lockouts always reset on Tuesdays.

"
Choose a race.,
Select a Talent Tree to specialise in:


Arms is generally for PvP, but can also be used for PvE very effectively with the right talent choices and a coupling with fury.,
Keep that rage up!,
...But not too up!,
Get the right gear.,
Always carry a Shield, and a 1h weapon.",How to Play a Warrior in World of Warcraft," Honestly it doesn't matter much in the long run unless you are very serious about PvP/PvE, but there are some few abilities that aid warriors.


Humans are excellent in PvP. They get a 10% to reputation gain they have a 3+ Expertise Rating for Swords and Maces, which helps you keep ahead of the gang, they have a passive ability called Perception that gives you a better chance of seeing hidden targets. It allows you to see the pesky rogues and druids before they can attack you. They also have one of the best racial abilities for PvP, Every Man for Himself. This move is identical to end game trinkets people use to get out of every crowd control move in the game.
Dwarves have Stoneform which grants 8 second immunity to disease, bleed effects, and poison, it also increases armor by 10%. It gives a 10 to frost resistance, (kind of negligible).
Draenei have a very strong raiding racial - a passive aura that increases other party members chance to hit by 1%. This 1% becomes essential in high-end raiding, as most casters factor this hit rating into their gear choices. Also, 1% hit rating is important for a warrior, as it opens up other gem / enchant choices such as stamina or strength. The other main racial they have is a heal over time(HoT). This HoT is pretty nice at low levels for soloing. At higher levels, the healing becomes marginal, but when combined with the heal granted by high-level Herbalism, it can suffice in a pinch or aid with rapid pulls while soloing as a non-healing class, if you haven't specced into Bloodthirst.
Tauren are probably your second best choice, the 5% addition to base health is very useful, and their Warstomp ability (stun targets in an area) can get you out of some sticky situations, a much overlooked ability is the 8 yard (7.3 m) melee range, this can be CLUTCH in PvP.
Trolls are good if you want to be a fury warrior. Trolls receive a health regeneration bonus - at higher levels this regeneration becomes marginal. However, Trolls also receive an attack speed increase which is very useful.
Undead characters start with Will of the Forsaken ability, which is handy in many later boss encounters. Warriors innately get Death Wish, however, which can be used in any stance. Will of the Forsaken has certain advantages, but largely is case-by-case for an Undead Warrior. Cannibalize is pretty useful when questing, because you don't need to bring as much food to recover lost health(though funny when used on other players!), and underwater breathing can be useful on particular quests - where you need to kill mobs underwater - and the +200% time to breathe under water will save you rest time.;
, At the lower levels, characters with heirloom items (BOAs), especially the two-handed weapons, may wish to spec into Arms because of the large number of instant attacks based on weapon damage - Overpower and Rend being your two staple moves. At 15, characters should immediately pick up the ""Overpower"" glyph that allows the use of Overpower if an attack is parried. That, coupled with the Rend talent in arms, will ensure that Overpower is up nearly 100% of the time - other talents will ensure it has a 50% crit chance. Armor Penetration and Strength are tied as the most important stats for this spec, with haste not being quite as important.
Fury is the de facto ""dps"" spec for PvE, but miles worse in PvP. Titan's Grip is a powerful ability that allows the Warrior to dual wield two-handed weapons, at the cost of a 10% damage reduction. However, all of the game's highest top-end weapons are two-handed, making Titan's Grip a powerful ability in combination with abilities like Whirlwind, which hits up to 4 nearby targets with both weapons. In this spec, hit and expertise become important stats to focus on, but strength should still be your primary concern.
Protection warriors are tanks. They take damage in, and protect the party from taking the damage instead. Tanks are needed for every instance. For tanking purposes, Protection is the sole spec. Warrior tanks are still the most solid single target tanks in the game, as they are capable of generating threat quite easily, and can manage incoming damage more easily than most other classes. Where Paladins tend to suffer the longer a fight goes on, Warriors tend to generate more threat as the fight progresses thanks to their ""procs"" and constant Rage generation.

, All a warrior needs is health and he's good-to-go. You build rage by taking Damage, giving damage, and using rage-giving abilities such as Blood rage. You can use all offensive (damage causing) abilities to gain rage, as well as Charge at the beginning of a fight to generate a good amount of rage to start off with.

, While having your rage up is an obvious must, being rage-capped (especially Fury and Arms) isn't really a good thing. Example: If your white melee auto-attack would grant you 30 rage, but you are at 95 rage, you only gain 5 and miss out the other 25. While being rage starved puts your abilities to a halt, being rage capped wastes your potential resources. To dump your rage, there are options: Refresh your shout buff, Cleave, and most commonly, Heroic Strike. Heroic Strike is usually spammed while tanking to keep threat and dump rage (as the constant damage being done to you keeps you rage capped), but in a DPS tree, it can be a good idea to hit Heroic Strike when you see your rage about to cap. Just remember that HS generates a healthy amount of threat, so be careful to not pull mobs from the tank.

, Gear is to a warrior as spells are to a mage. You want to look for gear that gives you + to strength (str) + to Stamina (sta) + to Defense rating (only tanks should really be looking for this at 80), + to Attack power, and + to hit rating, though agility can be very useful as well for +crit, but is not a priority stat. You don't have to worry about, defense, attack power, or hit rating until around lvl 60-80, however. Besides, Strength gives you attack power, attack power gives you more DPS (Damage per second). More stamina gives more health. Health is very important to warriors. Warriors wear mail until lvl 40, then they can wear plate. One piece of advice is to start looking for Plate armour early - plate begins to drop in level 35-40 instances, but can be found on the auction house much earlier. Armor is important to warriors too. More armor gives a higher reduction to physical damage, which prolongs your life. (edit: 14 attack power = 1 dps base white damage. For warrior, 1 strength grants 2 attack power. Therefore, 1 strength ~ 0.14 dps. 7 strength adds 1 dps. Though talent build and crit rate can increase the final dps output, (abilities included) it's nowhere near the values stated above.

, These can come in handy for hard-to-solo quests where you need to stay alive longer than if you had 2 1-handed weapons or a 2-handed weapon

If you want to dish how HIGH amounts of dps at level 70, choose an Undead character for their ""Devouring Plague"" racial ability.,
Use ""Mind Flay"" as much as possible.,
If you have ""Vampiric Touch"", make sure that if you have time to cast it, make it the first spell you use on an enemy then follow it with ""Vampiric Embrace"" then ""Shadow Word: Pain"" and so on.

,
If you are fighting another priest, ""Manna Burn"" them down.,
If you are fighting a class that can dispel debuffs, don't waste manna trying to recast ""Shadow Word:Pain"" over and over again, it will drain your manna.,
Fighting an Undead Rogue with the Insignia of the Horde trinket; don't be afraid to get out of ""Shadow Form"" to heal yourself.,
Make sure to get the ""Silence"" talent.,
Make sure you use ""Psychic Scream"" wisely, it has a pretty big cool-down.,
Priests are great support classes for BGs.,
of manna and won't be much good until you regain it which can take time and risk being jumped by a rogue.",How to Pvp As a Shadow Priest in World of Warcraft," When used with ""Inner Focus"" you can deal LOTS of shadow damage while gaining a reasonable amount of health back for no manna cost.;
, This is one of the most manna-efficient damage spells in the game and does a lot of damage in a short amount of time.

,, This cannot be stressed enough, a priest with no manna = a dead priest. Make sure to try to get the ""Improved Manna Burn"" talent for faster casting.

, Instead, try to fool the enemy by using Rank 1 ""Shadow Word:Pain"" to make him dispel it and waste a small chunk of their mana.

, Works well with other classes if you're nearly dead as well.

, Use this spell on Mages so you have enough time to cast ""Vampiric Embrace"" and other debuffs and maybe even get a ""Mind Blast"" in there.

, For example, a Rogue will usually begin fighting you with a stun-lock. When the stun-lock ends he will most likely use ""Cloak of Shadows"" in an attempt to avoid your psychic scream. Wait a while to see if he uses it and if he doesn't, then go for it.

, Don't try to venture off alone for 1evels. Even if you win, you will lose a lot

, Try to stay with the group and spam ""Vampiric Embrace"" and ""Mind Flay"", it will heal your party members and do a good chunk of damage to anyone it hits, not to mention, slows them down a pretty good deal.

Determine the talent specialization that suits you best.,

Vanish: Vanish allows you to re-stealth at a improved state.,
Blind: Blind allows you to incapacitate your opponent.,
Sprint: Sprint allows you to increase your movement speed by a large amount.,
Evasion: Evasion gives you an extremely high chance to dodge (physical and ranged attacks only, not magical).,

,
best on 30-50ish levels.",How to PvP As a Rogue in World of Warcraft," There are three talent trees for each class.


For rogues there are assassination, combat, and subtlety. Though there are some mainstream specs that you can choose from I will not cover these as this article would be incredibly long. The main question you have to ask yourself when choosing a spec is, Which will be the funnest and most helpful?
If you prefer swords/maces/fist weapons you will want either a shadowstep (sub tree) spec or a combat spec.
If you prefer daggers then you will most likely want to go mutilate (assassin tree), though regardless of debate, shadowstep daggers are quite viable.;
, In the current state of WOW (World of Warcraft), resilience is the most sought after and useful attribute. Resilience is used for damage mitigation.


If you wish to do well in pvp at 70 in arena or battlegrounds you will need a lot of resilience. 150 is a decent area to start, and achievable with the reputation gear released in the latest patch.
While you need resilience you also need to have a lot of health, attack power, and crit. These are not as hard to achieve as they are on most of the pvp gear that supplies resilience.
You will need to consider your spec and what weapons work best for it. Once you have made this decision you will need to acquire the best weapons you can. Weapons can be bought with honor, arena points, gold (from the auction house), and instances.
It is suggested that you try to get the weapons from honor or arena points as they will include resilience.

, Stuns are the single most important part of playing a rogue. All good rogues know that keeping their enemy stunlocking is the key to winning.


As a rogue you have many moves to assist you with stunlock. When attempting to stunlock your opponent timing is very essential.
Cheap shot is the preferred opening move that requires you be in stealth to use it.
You also have Kidney shot which is a move that stuns your opponents for x amount of seconds. The more combo points you have on your opponent the longer kidney shot will last.
You also have gouge, which is an effective stun but will break if you damage them. There are many ways to line up your stuns as a rogue and I will not cover all them as some depend on spec makeup and such but I will cover a brief overview.
Many rogues prefer to use cheap shot over garrote (silence and bleed effect) and ambush (pure damage opener). When cheap shot is about to end many rogues will follow up with a kidney shot to keep their opponent in stunlock.
When necessary you will want to use gouge to keep your opponent from hitting you and allowing for a bit of energy regeneration as well as adding a combo point.
With the release of the burning crusade, rogues have gained a new and very powerful spell called cloak of shadows. This spell allows you to negate all magical spell effects for a small amount of time as well as removing those already placed on you.
You may wish to add this to your stun lock line up if you are fighting a caster as they will not be able to hurt you with magical damage or fear you.

, Cooldowns are also a very important part of being a rogue.


Cooldowns include moves such as vanish, blind, sprint, evasion, and cloak of shadows.
These moves are called cooldowns because you can only use them once every x minutes depending on which move you are talking about.
These cooldowns can help to mitigate damage or give you downtime to heal or re-stealth.

,


One thing you have to keep in mind about vanish is that it does not remove bleed or magical effects on you.
So if you vanish and you have those effects on you, you will be knocked back out of stealth.

,


This is very helpful if you need to re-stealth or heal up.
Blind is no longer called as a disease.
Your opponent may decide to use their insignia trinket to get out of blind so be wary when you use it of this.

,


If you are slowed by your opponent or they are far away you will want to use sprint to reach them.

,


You may want to use this if you have used all your stuns and need to mitigate damage.
You should be cautious about using this against warriors as they have overpower, a move that will not be dodged.
There is much discussion about whether a rogue should use evasion against a warrior.
It is suggested that you still use evasion as the warrior will

Have to switch to battle stance to use overpower and
Overpower has a cooldown of x amount of seconds. So in the long run you will avert the majority of the damage you would have received by not using evasion.



,


This article would be much too long to go into great detail about arena teams, partners, etc.. so I will just include some helpful information for it.
When you arena as a rogue you must keep in mind that your job is to control the situation and opposing team.
Your main task is to stunlock and kill their healer if they have one.
You want to try to time your cooldowns to be as effective as possible.
You also want to assist your partner(s) in the most effective way i.e. slowing his/their attacker, controlling the healer, and attempting to kill someone as fast as possible.
If your partner(s) die your chances of winning will decrease greatly unless your opponents are almost dead.
For arena you will want to use the most effective poisons to control your opponents.
To slow your opponents you want want crippling poison, to reduce healing effects you would want wound poison, to increase their casting time you would want mind numbing poison, and to do damage you would want deadly or instant poison.
Though keep in mind you can only have one type per weapon, which is two types total.
Many rogues prefer wound poison and crippling poison so that killing a healer is easier.

,, an example of a stunlock - stealth-(tell partner not to accidentally break gouge)-cheap shot enemy- wait whole duration(or use hemoglobin because it adds an extra point (you'll probably need a faster energy regeneration))- as soon as he/she/IT turns use gouge (but be careful!)- use kidney shot and the you can start zapping damage into your target. best to use when in line of sight is only 1 target (other is distracted). also good to do by two rouges. first rouge finishes stunlock. starts damaging. after kidney shot ends second rouge starts doing the same BUT BE CAREFUL on the gouge part! after finishing first opponent try vanishing and then doing same to the other.

",How to Make a World of Warcraft Machinima3,","
"
Keep your WoW CDs and CD key safe.,
Have a Strong Password.,
Don't share accounts.,
Don't click strange links in websites.,
Keep your antivirus and firewall up to date.,
Watch out for phishing.,
Never log onto World of Warcraft from a computer that isn't your own, or one you know is 100% free of virus, keyloggers and evil software.,
Guild leaders, don't let any guild members have access to your guild bank unless they have an authenticator.,
Get an authenticator.,
Be careful which addons you download.,
Keep your operating system up to date.,
Don't use powerleveling “services”.,
And in case you're still dead set on giving your email account and password to a random foreign company whose business is based on violating Blizz's terms of use:


“Through our normal support processes and the assistance of players, we also find that many accounts that have been shared with powerleveling services are then hacked into months later, and all of the items on the account are stripped and sold off.,
Ouch.

",How to Protect Your World of Warcraft Gold,"  You might need these if you have to contact Blizzard to get your account reinstated.;
, Avoid commonly used words, names, personal data such as birthdays, and use a combination of letters and numbers. The passwords “qwerty” and “abc123” are going to get you hacked.

, Don't give your password to anyone else, not even family. Has anyone else heard other players in their guild saying “but I only let my brother use it once” from players who then discover that their charming younger brother has either deleted stuff, sold gear, bought loads of crap from AH you don't want, or boasted and spread your password all around his school. On a side note, why is it always “my younger brother” who does this? Don't any of you have grannies with a love of vendoring Tier sets?

, This applies especially if you're surfing the dodgier side of the web 'accidentally' waiting for free software to fall off the back of a lorry.

, Zac Johnson's blog tells the story of a nasty virus attack. You can get some great free antivirus if you can't afford the expensive ones.

, Chances are, that email isn't real. There are some easy ways to recognise fake phishing emails. Check for spelling, grammar, and downright bad manners. Never reply with your account and email. Never click a link in an email. Never enter your password at a dodgy website. You might as well just mail them your credit card and a Happy Birthday card!

, Even if you practice perfect Internet security at home, you’ll waste all that effort if you log on from a friend’s machine that has been compromised. If in doubt, miss the raid, and apologise to your guild leader later. You know he likes grovelling anyway.

, You can set this up in the guild ranks options.

, Blizzard sell authenticators which you can link to your account. They are small devices that generate a code which identifies you as the true owner of the World of Warcraft account. They're easy to set up and use, and very cheap. I'm terrible at losing mine, so I threaded a big shiny cord through it, and now it doesn't get lost on my desktop. On a side note,you also get a cute in-game pet, the corehound pup! Authenticators also come in iPhone versions for smart phones.

, Choose a site that you know is safe and stick to it for all your downloads. Try Curse Gaming's World of Warcraft addon section.

, Make sure that any trojans keybloggers, malware and viruses cannot exploit holes in outdated Windows operating systems. Click Windows Update in the Start menu.

, Don't buy gold. End of discussion. Oh, you still need to know why? Let's ask Blizzard:


“Supporting these types of illicit services is not only against the Terms of Use, but it promotes botting, spamming, and other forms of exploitation -- as well as account theft. While the promise of gold stockpiles and effortless level-85s may be tempting, you could end up paying more than just cash for sharing your account information with these companies. (Also, that gold you're interested in buying? We've found that it is most commonly stolen from compromised accounts and turned around to be sold back to other players. Not cool.)”Blizzard

, Basically, players have paid money to these companies, sometimes large amounts, and they're then targeted by these same companies down the road. We come across stories every week of the after-effects of players using these services, and some players now have to deal with long-term repercussions -- in addition to consequences such as possible account suspension or closure, in many cases the companies they paid use their personal information to perpetrate identity theft and credit card fraud. These are long-lasting effects on players' personal lives that can take years to recover from.” Blizzard

Make sure you meet the system requirements for WoW.,
Pick a server.,
Create your character.,
Start the journey.,
Learn movements.,
Familiarize yourself with the user interface.,
Interact with co-players.,
Join a guild.,
Fight effectively.,
Take quests.,
Learn how to be resurrected.,
Keep playing.",How to Play World of Warcraft," Though this game does not really require a high-end system to run, it is still advisable to make sure your PC meets the system requirements that this game demands.


Operating System: Windows XP and up should run WoW smoothly.
Processor: this is the brain of your computer and as such, performance will mostly likely depend on your processor. Make sure it is at least a Pentium D.
Video: A graphics card is the most essential computer part for gaming. The nicer the card, the better your game will look and the smoother it will run.
Memory & Storage: 2GB RAM is the standard but more can help.
Internet: If you are playing an online game, you definitely need to have a fast internet connection to avoid “lag” (lag is a noticeable delay between the action of players and the reaction of the server).;
, Before entering the game, you must pick a realm first. The realms determine how you will play the game, whether it's with other people or not, as well as who you will be fighting against.


Normal: This is a very good option for beginners because it's Player vs Environment. You can have all the focus you need to level up, and less focus on working well with others.
PvP: Player vs Player. Engaging in PvP with the opposing faction usually takes place in the contested zones. If you feel like boosting your level, this is the server for you, as you may go PvP freely in some designated areas (allowing lots of opportunity to gain experience).
RP: This is a role playing version of a PvE realm or normal realm.
RP-PVP: This is a role playing version of a PvP realm. Players here are more antagonistic than the other servers.

, The exciting part of starting a game is when you customize your own character. There are ten race characters and nine character class to choose from. Each class has certain bonuses. Try not to pick from appearance alone but instead carefully examine their benefits and downsides.


Pick a faction. Your faction will partially determine the races you can choose from:

Alliance: This faction is dedicated to nobility and honor. Most members of this faction are humans living in kingdoms that are known for combat, magic and craftsmanship.
Horde: This is the group of rejected creatures who fight for their rights in Azeroth. Appearances can be very interesting, unique and scary. Most of the Horde are adapted to different terrains.



, After putting your own touch on your character, it will lead you to a short cinematic narration of the character’s origin. From there you will find your character in the middle of the story, which will help you understand your quest.

, Movement keys in WoW is not so different with other Role-Playing games. You can use the keyboard or mouse in moving your character.


Mouse: Some players are used to using both hands while playing so they will find this intuitive.

Left Hold: Turns your view without the character moving along.
Right Hold: Turns your view along with the character.
Scroll: Zoom in and out. You can even have a first-person view.


Keyboard: If you are a hardcore player with swift key reflexes, these are the controls for you.

WASD: These are the most common controls for gamers. You can also use Arrow keys as an alternative.
Q and E: For strafing (moving side to side).
Space: Jump.
Swimming: You can use Space bar for rising and X for descending.
Num Lock: Auto run.
/ : Toggle for running and walking.
All this can later be changed in the 'Key Bindings' section of your menu. We, at this stage, do not recommend this.



, WoW interface is not that different from any other role playing game. It is user friendly and straight forward. It shows you the character and pet information on the upper left corner, a mini map on the upper right corner, a chat box on the lower left corner and an action bar at the bottom of your screen.


Character and Pet information: Shows the basic stats of your character, pet info, gear inventory and different reputations you are building.
Mini Map: This is the most helpful tool you can use as a beginner. This will help you locate the Quest givers and Quest turn ins. It also has Tracking ability, Time, Calendar, Mail and a Zoom in – Zoom out button. You can Press “M” to access the main map.
Chat box. The chat box is very flexible. You can unlock it and drag it wherever you want on the screen. You can change its font size to make it more space friendly. You can also create a new window for different players you are talking to.
Action Bar. This is where your Skills and spells are placed. You can also assign a hot key to it so it will be more accessible while playing PvP and Questing. You can add bars and create a side bar as well. This also includes the Menu and Options.

, World of Warcraft is a highly sociable online game. Playing online becomes more exciting if you play it with friends. One part of the user interface is the Friends List pane. This is basically your social tab in game.


Friends tab: This shows a list of people you added or who added you in WoW. It shows the players' names, current location, status, level, class and time since last online.
Ignore tab: This is the list of people you have blocked.
Pending: this is where your pending friend requests are listed.
Add friend: Click this button to search for the players you want to add.
Send Message: This is where you compose a message to a specific player.

, Another way of interacting with players is by joining a guild. A guild is a union of players in WoW. One of the biggest benefits of having a guild is the assistance of your guild mates to you in difficult quests.


First, you have to join the guild recruitment channel in-game.
Look for guilds that are currently recruiting.
Check the background of the guild through the forums to see if it suits your preferences.
If you found your desired guild, ask someone from the guild to send you an invite. Then the guild leader will send you a notice of invitation.

, The Action Bar is the main tool in combat, since it includes your spells and skills. You can also customize your action bar by dragging spell and skill icons into the slots. If you want to test your skills and abilities, engaging with PvP will be a good way to do it.


You must first click your target then right click your skill icon to perform that skill.
You can do an auto attack by pressing “T”.
If you want to stop auto-attacking, go to interface > Combat > and untick the Auto attack box.
Changing skills alternately is possible by right clicking the skill you want to perform. You can also use Hotkeys depending on what slot number your skill is set to.
Remember, attacking a mob causes them to fight back.
A beginner will start with a low level weapon (which does less damage), however if they start to level up and gain more skills, they will also be rewarded with a higher level weapon.
A character can recover damage if they rest or eat.

, Questing results in leveling and leveling results in more skills and abilities. Upon entering the WoW, you will find a Non Player Character (NPC) with an exclamation mark above their head. Click on it and accept the quest. Upon clicking, it will show you the quest details along with the reward and experience to be gained. The mini map will show you a Question Mark icon. This is where you have to go to get get your rewards or show you where your next quest will be. You can also press “L” for your quest logs.


Gathering quests: The NPC will command you to gather materials for your first quest. You will have to look at your mini map for where you must go. If you are in the marked area, try to look for a sparkling item and then click to loot.
Mobbing quests: These are the type of quests wherein you have to kill the mobs to complete the quest. If you’re on such a quest, you can find a tracking list just below the mini map. There are also Mob and Collect quests, which also emphasize looting.
If you noticed that the exclamation mark on the mini map has faded out, understand that the quest will most likely be located inside a building.
After completing your quest, you should always make sure to go back to the NPC from whom you got the quest from in order to receive your reward and experience. Click ""Complete Quest"" and it will lead you to your next quest automatically.

, If you are caught up with a huge number of mobs and fail to defend yourself, your character will die. Your gear will be damaged and you will have to wait for your respawn. The character will come back as a ghost and must come close to its physical body to resurrect.

, This game is really fun and easy to play. All you have to do is never give up, level up your character and you’re good to go! Just keep questing and move your way to the top!

Clear the dungeon and rack up the XP.",How to Power Level in World of Warcraft," This simplest way to get a big head start is to purchase a character that is already level 90. To begin, visit the in-game store by clicking the “Shop” button in your UI.
, In the in-game store, you can purchase a level 90 character boost for around USD$60.00., Once you’ve purchased the boost, select it, and a list of your current characters will be displayed. Choose the character that you’d like to apply the boost to, and confirm your choice., You can open your friend’s list by clicking the social icon near your chat box—this location will vary depending upon how you’ve setup your user interface., “Recruit-A-Friend” (RAF) is a service Blizzard offers to World of Warcraft players. One of the most desirable features of this service is the bonus experience it offers.

RAF offers other notable benefits as well: friend summoning between the linked players allows them to quickly and easily join one another, wherever they may be. Also, the recruit (presumably your friend) is able to grant levels to their recruiter’s characters (one level for each two they earn).

, Your friend can either subscribe to a monthly service, which automatically deducts from their chosen account, or they can purchase game time cards and apply the codes to their account online.

Players linked through the service enjoy 300% XP from quest turn-ins and kills, so long as they are within the required distance of one another.

, Heirloom gear refers to weapons, armor, and jewelry that are unique from other types of gear in several ways:

Heirloom gear is account-bound rather than soulbound. Rather than being bound to a particular character, heirloom gear is bound to an account, so it can be used on any one of your characters (for whom it is suitable in other regards). So, while it can be pricey or time consuming to purchase, you can use it to level other alts in the future.
Heirloom gear grants experience bonuses. Most pieces of heirloom gear you equip will increase your experience gained by a certain percentage.

, For example, a paladin requires Strength as their main stat, and heavy armor (the armor type) will scale as the character scales if they are initially unable to wear heavy armor due to being a lower level. Your optimal heirloom gear set will feature the same main stat as your starting gear., Depending on your budget, you may want to prioritize certain gear pieces first, based on their experience boost and/or stats (e.g., a cape only boosts your experience 5% but costs the same as a chest piece, so if your gold is limited, go with the chest!)., If you want to use Darkmoon prize tickets as currency (they’re obtained by winning games and doing favors at the Faire), visit the Darkmoon Faire vendor first. Then, hit up your guild vendor and faction heirloom curator for the rest of the gear!

Most pieces are around 500 gold each.

, Ghost Pirate Rings can be obtained via Shipyard missions. You can equip one ring from this category. A Dread Pirate Ring can be obtained via placing at least second in the weekly Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza, which on many realms is a very competitive event. Note that to obtain the Ghost Pirate Rings, you will need a max level character with a garrison of at least level 3. You you will also have to develop your Shipyard to the appropriate level to receive the mission. Your other heirloom gear will still give you a big boost if you choose not to go for these., Remember that Heirloom gear scales (i.e., the stats grow along with your levels), so take note the level at which your initial gear stops scaling (typically 85). Once it has stopped scaling, you can upgrade your Heirloom gear.

There are two upgrades available so that the gear will continue to scale to 90 and then to 100. The items required to upgrade your heirlooms are obtained from the same vendors as the heirlooms themselves.

, The Darkmoon Faire is active once a month. Whenever it’s in town, make use of the XP boosts it can help provide. Ride the carousel until your “Whee!” buff (10% XP boost for up to one hour) reaches 60 minutes, and play a few games to buy a Darkmoon Top Hat (increases XP by 10% for one hour) for 10 prize tickets., This potion increases XP by 300% for one hour. It drops from a rare spawn known as Krol the Blade and from rare beasts in Nagrand. You’ll need to have a max (or close to max) level alt to farm for these if you want to use them on low-level characters., This potion increases experience gained from quest completion and killing monster by 20%. Once your leveling character has a garrison, they can purchase these from their innkeeper., Running instanced content is the single most important thing you can do, at least up through level 85. Instead of focusing on questing, focus on dungeons. A quick search for “WoW dungeons by level” or similar will help you find the right instances for your level. Keep in mind too that many instances are faction specific, so make sure to check Horde or Alliance specific lists!, The advantage to running the instance with a max-level friend is speed, but you’ll take a small hit on total XP for the whole instance.

Whether you run an instance solo or with a group, you can still level up quickly.

, You’ll get an XP bonus for successfully clearing the instance objectives, which should be listed in your UI once you enter the instance.

You can run ten instances in an hour, and each level-appropriate dungeon you complete grants a large XP bonus. The best thing about the completion bonus is that it isn’t affected by the presence of a higher level character, so you can have a level 100 friend take the beating for you.

Knowing your class and roles.,
Knowing your opponents and their class.,
Area is a big role on if you win or lose.,
Show no mercy.,
Buffs.,
Using skills that you think are useless are in fact some of the best skills you can rely on.,
Don't be afraid.,
Know your battles that you have won and that you have lost.",How to Play PvP in World of Warcraft in General," You will have to know your class in every way possible. For example, if you are a hunter your attacks are mostly ranged and using your pet is essential to combat. Melee will help a little but use your pet and traps while keeping a distance to avoid damage from casters. Having a melee class means you need to keep yourself on their ass right in their face while keeping them slowed and right by you.;
, This may seem obvious, but knowing your enemy is half the battle. Being able to call out what they are going to do is a big plus in pvp. Know what spells or what kind of attacks you have to deal with will always help you.

, Being able to identify the area you are fighting in will help you know the area where you can hide, get out of the line of sight, or best yet so you know where they will try to hide if they get a chance to run.

, People often like to toy with other players in order to show their superiority, doing this will give them time to call for help from other players that will bring you to your knees hoping that you will be able to spawn without resurrection sickness. So kill them fast because when those reinforcements come you will be prepared to take them down also.

, Having your character buffed will always help you. Even though having life and strength buffed up just a little bit it can help you in the long run. Going on long battles with that little bit of extra life can actually save you from a death that you do not wish to receive.

, Most classes have either some kind of random stun or stop ability like kick where it stops a targets casting. Use it when they are going with one of their big spells that they are focused on. Drain mana in anyway possible because taking away a caster's mana will destroy their focus. Making them have to preserve their mana will make them wish that they had potions on them.

, Never be afraid of your opponent because being scared of them will just make them come after you so that they get an easy kill. When you panic, this causes you to think you can't kill anything, when you start to go into a panic because someone has crazy looking gear that makes them look overpowered, Try your hardest and just do what you do normally when you Pvp. Looks can be deceiving because people are often lazy and just raid to get their gear to get the looks but they can't pvp at all. Also there are people who just refuse to get things on their own so they go out and buy accounts from someone who is already geared and they don't have a clue on how to do anything themselves. Just because they look badass doesn't mean they are.

, Being able to kill is one thing getting strategies after you get killed benefits you more. Just because one class is camping you and they do the same thing over and over, they are not invincible so plan ahead and make traps for them to walk into. Rogues by far one of the hardest class to counter with their stealth when they camp you, but they are easily killed. Devise strategies when you die so the next battle you shall win.

Build Order: 4 of your 5 starting peons send to gold mine while 1 builds an altar of storms.,
First peon builds burrow, second builds barracks, third goes to gold mine, fourth goes to cut lumber.

,
When your altar finishes, queue a Blademaster (WW, Crit, WW, Crit, Crit, Bladestorm skill order) and scout for the opponent with your altar peon.,
At 16/20 food, your barracks will finish and you should have 200 gold.,
Upgrade your Great Hall to Stronghold for tier 2 capabilities.

,
Build a spirit lounge in your base preferably near the back and creep easy camps near your base with the grunts only while your Blade is harassing your opponent.,
When your upgrade to Stronghold finishes, train a Far Seer(wolves, chain, wolves, far sight, chain, earthquake skill order).,
Once your tier 2 buildings are done, build your fourth burrow.,
Once your beastiary finishes, train your first raider, research ensnare, then train another raider, and build 2 catapults to destroy towers easier.,
A word on Upkeep:  Only break upkeep once you have 50/70 or 50/80 food (20 or 30 unused food) AND you have purchased all the items and upgrades you need AND you have 1000 gold or more in the bank.",How to Play Orcs in Warcraft III," Make four more peons.;
,,  Build your second burrow as soon as you have 40 wood (return resources early to get 40 wood faster.)

,  Queue 3 grunts.

,, Build your third burrow around 26 food and keep grunts in production until you have three to five of them depending on how much you spent on items. You want to keep enough gold to produce everything you need at tier 2 which is listed below. Before tier 2 finishes upgrading, build a war mill so you can get upgrades, voodoo beasts, and towers if you need them.

,  Build a Beastiary so you can get raiders. Finally, upgrade berserker strength at your barracks for your grunts.

, When Spirit lodge is finished train Shaman and when he is finished upgrade adept training then get 1 more shaman.

, Build a kodo beast once you have 2 shamans and 2 raiders + grunts. The kodo should put you at or near 50/50 food. Build more burrows and make a few Witch Doctors from Spirit Lounge and Wyverns from Beastiary. Upgrade Pillage at your Stronghold. Than build Tauren Totem and train a Earthshaker.

,  I like to also tech to tier 3 before breaking upkeep.  If you can get an expansion then it's safe to break upkeep before all these conditions are met only if the expansion has paid for itself at the very least. Now, it's time to take the fight to your opponent with all your forces!

Prioritize.,
Determine the Consequences.,
Manage your time.,
Commit to your log out time, and stay disciplined.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Prevent Addiction to World of Warcraft," Stop for a moment and think about your current obligations and prioritize them. Take a piece of paper and write them all down in order of importance, then decide which ones you would give up to play.;
, From the list of things you would give up, decide if there are any that you SHOULD give up. Next to each item, try to think of the consequences of giving it up. If you cannot think of any, try asking friends or relatives for insight. There are consequences to every action whether you can see them or not, so it is important to be able to see if they are damaging or not so damaging. Make an effort to only give up obligations that have insignificant consequences.

, World of Warcraft displays the current time beneath the mini-map. Additionally, there is an alarm feature that you can set that makes a bright orange message pop up at the designated time. Before you begin to play, determine what time you need to stop and either pay attention to the clock, or set yourself a reminder.

, When you determine the time you will stop playing, commit to it and do not adjust it on the fly. If you have told yourself you will log out at 9:00, do it. Even if there is a change in circumstance, for example a cancelled appointment, log out at your designated time. Step away from it for a few minutes and determine if you might need the time for something else. Give it a few minutes of thought and if you still feel you have the time to play, log in again and set a new stop time.

, Feel confident in the knowledge that you will be able to enjoy a community of millions of gamers immersed in a fantasy realm without becoming one of the few, desperate people living only for the game. Be satisfied that you are able to balance a fulfilled life in the real world without sacrificing the marvels of Azeroth (or any other fantasy world.)

You will need to decide your talent spec.,
Learn to use different minions for different situations.,
Manage your soul shards well.,
When in group keep your Soul Stone ready as a combat heal and supply the group with health stones by using your Soulwell spell before bosses.

,
Your rotation varies from spec to spec but in general you want to keep all your DoTs on the target and then continue to nuke.,
When leveling all specs are pretty viable.",How to Play a Warlock on World of Warcraft,"


Affliction improves your damage over time spells by making them faster and hit harder.






Demonology relies on both shadow and fire spells. and relies heavily on pets to improve your buffs






Destruction is your direct fire damage spec. It relies on critical strikes and heavy hitting spells but has still got damage over time spells in the rotation.





;
, An imp (lvl 1+) is usually the best direct damage pet and also has a buff that increases stamina of party/raid members. A voidwalker (lvl 10+) has very good health, and is great at tanking whilst leveling in PvE. A Succubus (lvl 20+) is great at cc, and melee dps. A felhunter (lvl 30+) is good as affliction as it's damage is buffed with the amount of DoTs on target. It has a silence as well which makes it great for PvP. A felguard (demonology spec only) is the best AoE damage pet out there by far. Each spec has its go to pet, Affliction - Felhunter, Demonology - Felguard & Destruction - imp

, Have 3 ready before fights by using your soul shard gathering abilities.

,, Keep your pet attacking at all time and have the highest possible DoT uptime for best damage output. elitistjerks.com/f80/ is a great warlock guide site for how to manage your specs.

, Destruction can be a tad lacking when it comes to speed but offers fun high hitting spells while Demonology got great pet utility that helps you control monsters and Affliction is simply great for survivability with all its self-healing possibilities."

Do quests.,
Grind with friends.,
Level through 'instances'.",How to Play a Priest in World of Warcraft," When leveling, quests can give you a lot of experience, so do a lot of them. Having a melee party member can make things easier. Make sure to buff your party members.;
, If you want to play with friends, go in a group. Quest exp is always worth more than the monster grinding exp.


If your friend is helping you level but not in your group, and he lets you get first shot on enemies, you will still be able to loot them, but the exp you get is reduced to an amount equal to to the amount of damage you inflicted before he comes in to help kill it. If you do 10% of the monster's total HP in damage before your friend kills it, you will only receive 10% of the exp as if you had killed it yourself.
If you are in a group with your friend, you will always get a portion of the exp (50% in a group of 2 or 33% in a group of 3, etc) as though you had killed it yourself. And don't forget, with your friend's help you can kill monsters way faster and therefore complete quests faster, and quest exp is never reduced.

, Another good way of leveling is through instances. Remember that you can not only get great exp this way but good loot and money as well.


Instance grinding is a fairly bad idea for a Priest, seeing as how generally in PvE environments Priests tend to take a bit longer to level. If you decide to instance grind, it is advisable, but not required, to spec Holy, merely for ease of acquiring a group.

At other times the tank or a hunter may pull a group, and the mage will need to sheep their target as it is running toward the tank.",How to Play a Mage in World of Warcraft," This is crucial. Do you want to deal as much damage as possible in the shortest amount of time? Do you want to sustain your damage output long after everyone else has become exhausted? Or do you want to play a suicide-bomber? Do you want to succeed in end-game content? Or would you rather PvP? Or even perhaps, just chill with your friends and explore?

, On the Alliance-side, you can be a Human, Gnome, or Dranei. On the Horde-side, you can be a Troll, Forsaken (undead), or Blood Elf. (See Tips #1 to help decide.)

, This might be more important than you think, along with your appearance, you will have to live with this name for the rest of your Mage's career, so pick one you LOVE.

, Quests are essential to leveling quickly, coordinate them with the area in which you are spending the most time.

, Leveling takes a while, but if you have friends to play with, you won't even care.

, Fire and Arcane pair well, Improved Fireball, Impact, Improved Scorch and Incinerate are very nice in the fire tree. In the arcane tree, Arcane Subtlety, Improved Arcane Missiles, Arcane Concentration, and Improved Mana Shield are also nice. If you are dying a little too often for your liking, play a Frost Mage, not quite as much damage, but you will be able to survive a lot easier with spell such as ice block and ice barrier, not to mention slows, etc.

, Killing more easy monster grants more experience than killing one difficult monster.


As you level, learn to kill monsters by a technique called 'Kiting'(this is also a very good skill to learn for PvP), in which you keep the target's movement hindered, yet still apply damage. Good Hunters can train you with this.
There is a technique called 'AoE Grinding' that has proven itself to be very effective. AoE grinding requires the kiting of many monsters (3 or more), while applying AoE damage.

, You can have two, and you can change them whenever you want. (They will reset to zero when you do though, so be careful.) The most common Mage professions are Tailoring/Enchanting and Herbalism/Alchemy. But pick whatever you like most.

, Don't put loot before your friends! You didn't know loot even existed before you started playing, so don't let it define your game.

, If you want to go and take over a town, do it! If you want to conquer the end-game, do it!

, Be prepared to make sacrifices, but don't join a guild just because they are raiders. Join a guild with people that you like and have similar goals. Don't let your guild push loot onto you that you don't want.

, Most people get lost along the way.

, And don't forget to add to this wiki if you learned anything new.

, (If you plan to use potions to further increase your effectiveness, save them for when you become proficient at AoE grinding. If you die, you'll lose the buffs from the potions!);
,, (And Ice Barrier if you have it.)

, (AoE grinding before level 30 is VERY difficult.)

,, Be sure to hit every mob you pulled.

, Only spend a second or two doing this.

,,,,


If you picked a good place to grind, you just killed three mobs at once!

,, Blizzard, frostbite (imp. or not) are your main tools to dealing damage (not necessarily a lot) and not take damage

, If done correctly, you can kill an enemy before they can even reach you. Turn and Blink if you are taking damage after Cone of colding to slow them.

,,,,,,,,

Each member of a raid or party has a primary role to manage threat levels and aggro in an instance. For a mage this means staying at max range from the mob being tanked and hesitating after casting a critical hit. Frost mages after level 30 have an advantage because they can use Ice Block which, for the duration of the Ice Block, wipes their accumulated threat. As mentioned above, being a great player does not mean doing the most damage, especially in an instance. So the mage may have to resort to their wand at times so that the tank can maintain aggro.
Critical hits tend to come in groups, so it is inevitable that a mage will grab aggro away from the tank. Should the mage get the attention of the boss or mob being attacked it is important to run or blink toward the main tank instead of running away. Do not compound your error of grabbing aggro by making the tank chase you and the mob around the instance.
A mage will be called upon to ""sheep"" a mob when there are multiple targets in a group that your party must kill.

,

There will be times when the leader will call for a sheep pull, which requires the mage to start the fight by casting the sheep spell on the indicated target. After completing this cast, the rest of the mobs in the pull will want to kill you, so it is important that you do nothing further until the tank has gotten the attention of the rest of the mob to keep you safe.
When a rogue is part of your party, the mage will be required to wait until the rogue has performed their crowd control (Known as: Sap) before casting their sheep spell, as Sap can only be done out of combat.

,
Whatever the pull turns out to be, remember that your sheep will probably break (revert to it's true form) before the end of the fight. Your mob will be very angry with you, and will want to kill you as quickly as possible. At this point your number one priority is re-sheeping your target.
If you are in the middle of a cast, hitting the escape key, or space bar will stop your cast.
Re-target on your ex-sheep and cast sheep quickly.
If you are in a good group, the others in your party will leave your mob alone, but it is not unusual for them to try to save you by attacking it. It is a good idea to continue re-sheeping until you know that your group is leaving that mob alone.
A great technique for re-sheeping is to make a ""focus"" macro pair. One macro is to /focus on a target, and the next is /cast polymorph on the focused target. This will allow you to instantly re-sheep without re-targeting. You just have to re-designate your focus target before each pull.
The Mage has the capability to remove curses from their fellow party members. In some instances, bosses will do terrible damage with curses and the mage will be required to spend the majority of their time removing these curses in a particular fight. There are addons and macros that will assist the mage in identifying group members who are cursed. The World of Warcraft community forums are a good place to begin learning about addons and macros for mages.
Finally, a mage will make friends with all mana users if he or she has prepared several stacks of conjured water for the group. Once the mage has Arcane Brilliance, at least one stack of Arcane Powder is essential for short runs, two or more for long runs like MC or Karazhan.

Obtaining the item to transmogrify.,
Make sure it is possible to transmogrify the item you want into your current gear.,
Go to a transmogrification vendor.,
Talk to the vendor to begin the transmogrify process.,
Select the gears.,
Transmogrify your gear.",How to Transmog Gears Into Different Colors and Appearances in World of Warcraft," In order to transmogrify an item to have the appearance of another item, you must own both items. For example, if the shield you have equipped is the Ancient Mogu Tower Shield and you would like to transmogrify it to have the appearance of Shield of the Stockades, you must own both shields.


You don't need to have the item you want to transmogrify in your pack; it's OK if it is in your bank, as long as you have it somewhere.;
, Most items of common (green), rare (blue), and epic (purple) quality can be transmogrified, but there are a few exceptions and conditions that must be met:


Items of a legendary (orange) quality cannot be transmogrified or transmogrified into.
Armor can only be transmogrified into items that are of the same armor type. For example, if you have a cloth belt, you can only transmogrify it into other cloth belts. You will not be able to transmogrify a cloth belt into a mail belt, a plate belt, or a leather belt.
While most weapons can only be transmogrified to other weapons of the same type (e.g., transmogging a dagger into another dagger), there are some exceptions, such as hunter weapons.
Bows, guns, or crossbows can be transmogrified into each other, so it would be possible to transmog Ennadee's Twirling Longbow (a bow) into the Kor'kron Hand Cannon (a gun).
Polearms and staves can also be transmogrified into one another.
One-handed axes, maces, or swords can be transmogrified into other one-handed axes, maces, and swords; two-handed axes, maces, and swords can be transmogrified into other two-handed axes, maces, or swords.
You would be able to transmog a one-handed axe into a one-handed mace, or a two-handed sword into a two-handed axe, but you could never transmogrify something that is one-handed into something two-handed or vice versa.
Daggers, fist weapons, wands, and off-hand weapons cannot be transmogrified into any other weapon type.
Make sure you’re capable of equipping both items to transmogrify. You must be able to equip both items to be able to transmogrify them. You may find some items that have a level requirement to equip. If you are not able to equip the item at your current level, but will be a high enough level in the future, then you may want to save the item so you can transmogrify it later after you are able to equip it.

, Once you are all set, the last step is to go to one of your faction's transmogrification vendors. There are currently 2 transmogrification vendors in the game for each faction.


If you are on the Alliance, one transmogrification vendor is in Stormwind and the other is at the Shrine of Seven Stars in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
If you are on the Horde, one transmogrification vendor is in Orgrimmar and the other is at the Shrine of Two Moons in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
You can talk to a city guard to mark the vendor's location on your map.

, When you click on the vendor, a window that says “Transmogrify” will show up on your screen with an image of your character along with the pieces of gear you have currently equipped.

, Move your mouse over a piece of gear, and an arrow will come up near it. When you click on the arrow, a list of all the items you can transmogrify that piece of gear into will drop down.


You can click on any piece of gear and it will update the image of your character so you can see how it would look if you transmogrified that item.

, Once you have selected the item you want to transmogrify, find a button that says “Apply” on the bottom right of the Transmogrify window.


To the left of the “Apply” button, you will see an amount of gold, silver, and copper. When you click on “Apply,” you will be charged that amount, and your item will be transmogrified.

FOR WARRIORS: Probably the most important thing to mention for warriors is to use a shield, it increases armor by a lot and many defensive stance abilities require it.,
Speaking of defensive stance, it's probably a good idea to use it unless you are very experienced and know a way to make a different stance work.

,
In situations where you're trying to build up tons of threat on something and trying to lower damage taken (maybe there's a weak healer or the healer is low on mana) then the best option is to use shield block and then back it up with revenge.,
If things get too thorny in the way of split threat, then just challenging shout, activate sweeping strikes (If available) and spam thunderclap and cleave like your life depends on it (it probably does!),
Remember battle shout.,Always keep 3 sunders up and remember to use demoralizing shout and thunderclap when they are running low its key to keep all your debuffs on the bosses especially when in heroic modes and end game content

,
Stamina is also a HUGE factor get as much stamina as possible so that you are able to take more hits before you die giving your healer more time to get that heal off!

,When tanking at 70 focus on faction rep with the outland factions they offer some of the best tank gear available before end game raid dungeons at exalted for gold instead of having the headache of getting a drop there a guaranteed items that will truly improve your game

,
Get proper equipment for paladins.,
Seals are your friend.,
Release a seal on the target ( Seal of wisdom or seal of light) this will help you in battle and your party when fighting an opponent.

,
Judge Seal of Righteousness as much as possible since your righteous fury give all holy spells more threat try to build up your aggro by using it.,
Keep your blessings up.,
If steps are followed you will not need to use righteous defense to often, but use it like a taunt, targeting the group member then using it.,
DON'T BUBBLE.",How to Tank in World of Warcraft," And make sure that you're going into protection.;
,, I used to think of this combo as rather useless but it has worked wonders for me in sunken temple. Just shield block and wait for revenge to activate, use revenge and wait for shield block to cool. Not only are you blocking (depending on the attack speed of the boss) 10-30% of the damage he deals overall, you're also skyrocketing yourself into the number one position and way beyond on the threat meter.

,

, It is so useful, yet so many people completely forget about that little button there; ten rage for a lot of attack power. It can mean the difference between 5 kills a minute and 5 minutes a kill.

Shoot for 490 defense for it is when you become UN-CRITABLE by npc's mind you your still critical in pvp but when you doing dungeons and raids 490 defense is a must!







,,,, Get stam. str. or spell damage gear make sure you stack Def as well. Have a shield so that all of your Prot abilities to gain aggro and deal back damage can work.

, Paladins have a move that makes spell damage cause additional threat, this is the backbone of paladin tanking.

,, In between judgment cool-downs have Righteousness up so your attacks gain more threat. If you are alliance, use Seal of Vengeance, not SoR.

, The only advantage you have over a warrior in low level instances as a tank is group buffs. Always make sure to bless your entire group. Bless yourself then your group. When you see your blessing is about to wear off re-bless yourself then your group (there will be almost done as well.

, (Target of target option helps)

, When you bubble the mob your on could potentially kill anyone who has aggro. Since you assumed the role of a tank you have to rely on others for heals in order for you to conserve mana to keep tanking. You should save bubbles for wipe prevention

Change Tidy Plate settings.",How to Tidy Plates in World of Warcraft," Like every other add-on, Tidy Plates does not come with the game. You must download it to your computer before you can install it. Download Tidy Plates from Curse.com through this link: http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tidy-plates;
, On the Tidy Plates page on Curse.com, click on the “Download Now” the button on the right. That should download a zip file with Tidy Plates to your computer.


The exact steps after clicking on the button will depend on your Internet browser, but you should be able to download the Tidy Plates zip file to your computer. Once you have downloaded the file, keep it handy for the next step.

, Before installing any add-on, make sure World of Warcraft is not currently running. If you are logged in, log out and then exit the game.

, Do this by unzipping and moving it into your World of Warcraft directory. #*Find the interface and add-ons folder for World of Warcraft.You can do this by going to the directory that you installed World of Warcraft. This is set when you install the game, but by default it is usually C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft.


Once you’re in the World of Warcraft directory, look for the Interface folder, inside which is the AddOns folder. To install any add-on, move the add-on files into the AddOns folder.

, You will need to extract the files from this zip file, and move them into the AddOns folder in your World of Warcraft directory.


The exact method to extract the files depends on your version of Windows or if you are using a Mac. You can find a specific guide on how to extract files here: https://www.wikihow.com/Extract-Files


, Once you have extracted the folders and files for Tidy Plates, make sure you have moved them into AddOns folder.


If you have installed World of Warcraft into the default directory of C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft, then your AddOns folder will be located at C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns.
Make sure to move the folders/files from the zip file into the AddOns folder. You can move folders and files by highlighting them with your mouse, left-clicking once, and dragging them into the destination folder.

, Now that you have put Tidy Plates in your add-ons folder, you can start the game. Once you log in using your username and password, you will be taken the screen with a list of your characters.


In this screen you would usually select one of your characters, and log in as that character, but this time you need to make sure that you have enabled Tidy Plates before you log in.

, On the bottom left of the character selection screen, you should see three buttons, namely “Shop,” “AddOns,” and “Menu.” Click on the “AddOns” button to see a list of all of the add-ons in your AddOns folder.


On the left of each add-on on the list is a check box. You can check or uncheck any check box by clicking on it. If an add-on has a check mark, it will be enabled when you log in, and if it does not have a check mark it will be disabled.

, Make sure that Tidy Plates and all of the components such as TidyPlatesWidgets and TidyPlatesHub are enabled. After you have done this, click the “Okay” button to save your add-on settings, and then log in on your character as usual by hitting “Enter World.”

, Tidy Plates will be installed now if you have completed the steps above. Run around the world, and see how nameplates show up differently.


Aside from the change in colors, font, and the like, Tidy Plates also shows debuffs on a target’s nameplate.
A debuff is an effect that weakens or damages the target for a period of time until it expires. For example, warriors can apply a sunder armor effect to a target weakening their armor. If you are a warrior, and hit an enemy with sunder armor, you will now see the sunder armor icon on their nameplate with the number of seconds left until it expires.

, To change any settings in Tidy Plates, type /tidyplates to bring up the configuration window. In the configuration window, you can change basic settings like making the members of your guild have their nameplates show in green, while other players in your faction show up as blue. This can be useful in recognizing who is around you at a glance.


There are also more complex settings such as showing debuffs you can dispel on nameplates of friendly players. If you are a class that uses dispels, you may want to enable that setting to help you cleanse your allies. Every person is different and has different needs, so make sure to set whichever configurations you feel are necessary.

Download Cheeky's Spreadsheet.,
Go to the third tab of the workbook called ""Setting and Results"" to change a few things before getting started.,
Under profiles, change one of the existing profiles to a name of your choice.,
Move over to the fifth tab called ""Gear."",
This should now populate all the fields with the gear you were wearing when you logged out last.,
Load your talent spec on the ""Talents"" tab by clicking the ""Read from Armory"" button.,
Move on to the ""Shot Rotation"" tab, which can be one of the most useful tools in the entire spreadsheet.,
You can easily experiment with different rotations to determine what would best maximize your DPS.,
Select your current level of progression on the ""Gear Planner"" tab.,
One of the nice additions that came with the Gear Planner tab is how Cheeky's lists items on the Gear tab.,
Play around with the other tabs.",How to Use Cheeky's Spreadsheet for World of Warcraft," The newest version can always be found online. Bookmark it if you need to.;
,


Under Character, Realm, and Server Set type in the obvious here. Make sure that you type your server name exactly as it is in-game.
Depending on what version of Microsoft Office you are using, you might see a bar near the top of the spreadsheet telling you that some of the content has been disabled. Click this banner and indicate that you want the macros to be able to run. Otherwise Cheeky's won't work.

, It really doesn't matter what the name of it is--it's just to help you identify it. You can change more than one of these profiles, allowing you to create custom gear sets and wish-lists, as well as compare talent specs with different gear. Use these to your best advantage! Sometimes it helps to have 4 or 5 different profiles for various scenarios and ""dream gear"" setups.

, From the ""Profile"" drop-down list, find the one that you defined and then choose the race of your character and then click the button in the top-left that says ""Load Profile.""


In the top-right corner, if the name and server match your character, go ahead and click ""Load Gear from Armory.""
You will notice that if you change Profiles the stats do not change immediately. By either clicking the ""Load Profile"", or clicking ""CalcAttributes"" after loading talents and gear will you see these numbers change.
After you have set-up your profiles, you should click the ""Save Profile"" button so the data is stored for later use.
Then you can just select the profile you want to view and load it up.

, On this screen you could now choose the gear you are looking to upgrade to and see how it would affect your DPS. For example, you could select Pauldrons of Primal Fury as the piece of gear you would like to get and then see what it does to your DPS, hit rating, attack power, etc. You will notice that it will automatically gem them for you with some predefined gems. You can change which gems it will automatically put in different color gem slots back on the ""Settings and Result"" tab. If you have access to epic gems, such as the through the Gem Vendor, you might want to have the Spreadsheet automatically populate red sockets with Spinels rather than Living Rubies.

, Once we define all our variables, we can go through our talents and adjust them, just like we can do to our gear, to see how it would affect our DPS. For example, you could remove the talent points from Ranged Weapon Specialization and put them into Combat Experience and re-calculate your attributes and see what the effect was.


Remember, if you change your spec, ranged weapons, or any number of talents, it is important to have the spreadsheet rebuild your shot rotation so it reflects your current stats. Putting points into Serpent's Swiftness for instance will make a huge difference. Or switching from BM to Survival and still having it calculate a 3:2 rotation will yield unexpected DPS numbers.
The ""Buffs"" tab is pretty self-explanatory. Similar to the character profile, you can define a Buffs profile on the ""Settings and Results"" tab that will allow you to define a preset load-out of buffs to see what it does to your DPS. For example, if you give Khagan Blessing of Kings, you'll gain 8 DPS overall. When he has Blessing of Might, the DPS jump is almost 40. Information like this is great to know when it comes time for those raid buffs.

, This tab does exactly what you would guess. It helps generates the ideal shot rotation for your spec and gear. For example, when you get to that tab and press the ""3:2"" button, it populates that field with a 3:2 shot rotation, as well as updates what the DPS would be, and then states how long it would take to go out of Mana as well as the total damage you would end up doing. Of course, you need to know what shot rotation is ideal for your talent choices.

, Do you feel that you are shooting too fast and think a 3:2 rotation would be better than your current 1:1 rotation? Theorycraft it with the click of a button.

, What kind of gear do you have access to? Are you just starting Karazhan? Leave only that box checked and click the ""Sort"" button. Just choose all the locations in which you can currently go so the spreadsheet knows what gear lists to generate. The second thing we need to decide is how it calculates hit rating for us. We have two options in this case: ""based on current +hit"" and ""based on 0 hit rating."" What exactly does that mean? Well, if you select ""based off 0 +hit"" the spreadsheet will attempt to calculate what kind of DPS increase an item would provide you if you had no additional hit rating. So if two items with the exact same stats except one has 20 hit rating, the one with hit rating will rank much higher because of the DPS increase the hit would provide.

, If you want to put together a wish-list of gear, or are curious on seeing how your DPS will look with the best items, gear in the drop-down lists are now organized by either DPS increase or alphabetically, based off how you choose to sort it on the Gear Planner tab.

,


The IAotH and DST tabs allow you to take into consideration the talents for Improved Aspect of the Hawk and the Dragonspine Trophy proc on. In most cases, when these items proc, a 3:2 rotation is quickly dropped dropped down to a 1:1 rotation due to the speed increase. These tabs will allow you to summarize how you should adjust your shot rotation when you gain these haste effects.
The ""Pet"" tab is also very useful. It let's you define your pet, what skills it has, and see what kind of DPS your pet will theoretically do when you use certain skills. For example, does your cat do more damage only using Claw, or does Bite really provide an increase? Choose your pet class, and use the drop-down lists to define what you have specified your pet into.
The ""Custom Gear"" tab can be used for a variety of things. If you happen to have a piece of gear that's not in the spreadsheet currently or are curious what a bow would do DPS-wise if it was a really wacky speed, you can create an item by inputting the stats you want it to have on the appropriate row and then selecting ""Custom"" on the gear drop-down list on the Gear tab.

Defend.",How to Tank As a Warrior in World of Warcraft (WOTLK)," Such as a 1h (one handed weapon) and a shield to tank anything, period. Also note that you have to be facing a mob in order to block, dodge or parry their attacks. So if your back is turned to a mob, all that defense is useless. Get all the mobs in a group and make them face you however you can.;
, 51-56 is good, remember you're here to take damage, not deal it, although dealing it keeps the aggro on you (mobs attack you instead of someone else), So might as well spend those 8 points in Fury.

, I personally went with the ""devastate"" and ""sunder armor"" glyphs so each ""devastate"" applies two ""sunder armor"", plus a nearby mob gets another ""sunder armor"".

,,


The new Defense cap is 540, so if you have that you should be good, but regardless of what people say, it is not completely necessary to tank heroics.

, Many people think unless you have 30,000 health, you cannot tank anything., You can use them all at once and take basically no damage for about 15-20 secs, or you can spread them out one at a time to span about 40-50 secs of reduced damage in some way. To list a few, ""shield block"", ""last stand"", ""shield wall"", ""enraged regeneration"", and any trinket CDs you might have. When these are used all depends on fight and situation, use your best judgment. If a boss has an enrage effect, you should probably use one of these cooldowns.

, Although there's nothing wrong with dodge and parry by themselves, defense rating increases both of those as well as shield block rating. So if you are below the defence cap you should focus on getting more defense. After the defense cap, dodge, parry and stamina becomes more attractive, because the gain of stats from defense is low after hitting the cap.

",How to Tank As a Paladin in World of Warcraft,"


Get yourself pieces of Plate armor, jewelry, trinkets, a cape and a relic that gives you stats like Dodge, Parry, Hit (if not capped), Expertise (if not capped) and Mastery to gain extra survivability and a bigger chance to hit your enemies. Ignore gear with Haste, Critical Hit and Attack Power stats on them, as they are designed for the DPS spec.
You must of course choose the Protection tree if you want to tank properly, as it have a lot of useful spells and abilities to raise your health, treasure gained, avoidance and group support. If you are not good at building talent trees, check.;
, Basically, as a tank you will try to make all enemies attacking your group members attack you instead by generating Threat towards them.

As a Paladin tank, you generate threat by having your Righteous Fury ability activated and using attacks and spells on the enemies.






If you run low on mana, cast a Judgement spell or use Divine Plea to regain some of your precious magic.







,

When fighting a boss enemy or a single target, use a mix of damage over time spells like Consecration and your trusty Crusader Strike, as well as Shield of the Righteous when you have 3 charges of Holy Power from attacking with Crusader Strike, to gain his aggro and deal damage.






When fighting several enemies though, attacks like Hammer of the Righteous, Holy Wrath and of course Consecration is very useful to help gain aggro (treath) to more than one mob at a time.







,

Your Hand of Reckoning spell, often referred to as the taunt ability, instantly makes the target enemy attack you instead of the person it is currently attacking, so use it if a powerful mob have escaped your Consecration or simply is out of your melee range and/or attacking a teammate.






Righteous Defence is on the other hand is casted on teammates to make up to 3 enemies attack him/her attack you instead. To see who have the aggro in the group, check if they have a red ring around their player portrait. If they do, you should bring some Righteous Defence to them.







, Even though you might manage to gain over 200k health these days, you are still very much mortal, and your healer don't have an unending mana pool to heal you from.

Be sure in the end level dungeons to have your DPS Crowd Control some mobs if they come in a large pack to make your healers burden easier to carry and your job to grab aggro easier. Just be sure to not tank the mobs who are not crowd controlled close to those who are, or you might release the controlled ones from their shackles or sheep form.







, Even if you have the aggro of all mobs/the boss, this doesn't necessary mean your groups is safe. Several mobs and bosses have AoE spells that hurt the whole group or someone else than the one with his aggro. To help out your friends in ugly situations like this, use Divine Guardian to reduce the damage taken by group members for a little while, or Hand of Sacrifice on a member taking extra damage to transfer some of his pain to you instead.

, Grouping with guild members and close friends while training up to be a good tank is probably a good idea, as they usually are more forgiving if you do errors than your average PUGer.

"
Use Defensive Stance - Although all skilled tanks should spec into Tactical Mastery and switch stances when necessary, (like using Mocking Blow or Intercept) it is important that your main and most common stance when tanking is the Defensive Stance.,
Use a shield - Make sure you have a shield and a one-hander.,
Build Some Threat!,
Keep The Threat!",How to Tank As a Warrior in World of Warcraft," Here you will get a +10% damage reduction rate, as well as more threat generated towards you (and not your other fragile party members!).;
, Too many warriors try to tank with a two-handed weapon, or dual wielding, and, except for certain circumstances in low level instances, it generally does not work very well or causes much un-needed work for the healer. Your job is not to deal damage, but to prevent damage from being dealt to others. Besides, there are much needed abilities that can only be used with a shield, as well as the crucial damage reduction and blocking.

, - Now that you've got everything else down, it's time to make the enemies hate you so that they attack you, or build up what some call ""aggro"". To do this, use the abilities you have that create this ""threat"". Abilities like Devastate (if protection), Sunder Armor, Revenge, Heroic Strike, and Shield Block / Shield Bash (if protection) and Thunderclap, among others. Always be spamming heroic strike if you have around 40+ rage; it does not start the global cool down so it can be spammed in between abilities, helping you generate much more threat. If your group is inpatient, you may want to open with Bloodrage to get some initial rage for that opening strike.

, - Good, you've got the threat, but you don't want to lose it! Be persistent! On a single target, make sure to keep using abilities like Sunder Armor/Devastate to hold threat, and of course Revenge when you can. If you're fighting multiple enemies, maybe alternate creatures when you use Sunder Armor, and cast Thunderclap when you can. Try to make sure you are always on top of the global cool down, so every time you can cast an ability make sure you do. Recently warriors have gotten some nice shiny new talents and abilities, like shockwave. Thunderclap now affects all targets in range so don't refrain from spamming it when aoe tanking. Tanking many enemies may take some practice, as it gets tricky, but, when slip ups happen (and they will), you can always taunt the target back to you, mocking blow is now usable in defensive stance so you won't need to switch to battle stance. This ability can be a life saver if taunt is resisted or is on cool down; use Challenging Shout if things really get out of hand.

Must have a shield and 1h(One Hand) weapon.,
If you're going to tank any instance in Outland, you must be in Protection spec unless you have amazing skill and gear and know what you're doing, then you could tank as fury/MS.

Healer must be Holy/Resto Spec.

,, Pretending this is your group, before starting to fight Mobs, assign different Target Icons to people in your group.


Skull = All dps Star = Rogue Stun Square= Hunter Freeze X=Mage Poly

, The one middle distance is the one YOU the tank pulls. The one furthest in the back is always the one hunter pulls and freezes.

, Do not charge, pull its the safest way. Soon as you're guys drop the Skull go for the Square since the Freeze effect wears off faster than the Rogues stun. Then move on to your last target.

, (Remember it is not your job to kill them! Just to make sure they only hit you)

,,


Thunderclap is useless unless it's for countless Mobs, in which case you should allow your mage to do the job.

,, Do not let anyone else pull. If someone keeps doing it, kick them from group and replace them.

,, They will keep inviting you as tanks are extremely needed, congratulations on picking the right class!

, Don't try to save your own butt by running, because 9 out of 10 times they catch up to you and kill you anyway. Protect the healer at all costs, and he will keep healing you regardless of how extreme the situation is.

Now buy 5146 more maples ( for 149,228gp) this should leave you with 10,132gp. Now make those logs into maple longbows(u).

,, Then go and sell them for 612,720 gp. You are now level 70.

, Go buy 875 yew logs and make them into yew longbows. This is the key to not losing money so listen. Buy Bowstrings (or make yourself) and string the bows.This way you make 12 gp each bow and get maximum exp. (sell for max price). When sold you should have around 623,000gp.

, This will get you to level 80! (December 7th,2012)(EOC)(Make Yew ShieldBows Until Level 90, Make 20-45gp Every Bow),"
"
Go straight to the Varrock range shop after Learning The Ropes.,
Get Leather Armor (Hard body, Chaps, Vambraces & Coif), a Short bow, an Oak Short Bow, and Bronze or Iron Arrows to begin.

,
Start by ranging low level creatures (Chickens, Rats, Cows) from behind a fence until reaching level 20 ranged.,
Get Studded Leather Armor (Hard body & Chaps), more Iron Arrows (if needed) and a Willow Short bow to continue.,
Head to either Barbarian Village or Black Knights compound.,
Get more Iron Arrows (which you can buy or if you are a high enough level kill minotaurs in Barbarian Village if needed.,
Purchase More Iron or Steel Arrows (depending on budgetary constraints) and head to Lesser Demons in Karamja’s volcano’s rim.,
Level 1 - 20 Ranged: Cows in the Lumbridge Cowfield should be your target for these novice levels.,
Level 21 - 40 Ranged: Begin fighting chaos druids.,
Level 41-50 Ranged: Train on hill giants in the Edgeville Dungeon southwest of Varrock.,
Level 51-60 Ranged: Train on ogres, located southeast of Castle Wars.,
Level 61-70 Ranged: Train on green dragons in the Wilderness location(s).,
Level 71-80 Ranged: This is really up to you.,
Level 81-99 Ranged: Your choice, basically.",How to Achieve Level 99 Range on RuneScape as a F2P," Get the free bronze arrows and the shortbow.

,, (Switch from regular Short Bow to Oak Short Bow at level 10 ranged). You can also train on goblins until you reach level 25.

, About 500 to 1,000 iron or bronze arrows is enough.

Please note that if you have the financial means, you may now purchase a Willow Composite Bow, however, the slight increase in ranged attack does not sufficiently offset the noticeable decrease in ranged speed.
test







, Take full advantage of the tables in each location to hide behind while ranging. Range until level 40.

, Minotaurs are levels 12&27 and they drop iron arrows and minotaurs drop bronze full helms also which you can sell to Peksa the barbarian helmet salesman), Maple Short Bow, and Green Dragonhide Armour (D’hide Chaps, D’hide Vambraces, Coif and D’hide Body if you have completed Dragon Slayer Quest). Then fight White Knights in Falador until range level 60.

, Taking advantage of the rocks, hide and range Lesser Demons or go to the third story of the wizards tower and range the lesser demons. Range until reaching level 99. See the Tips below for what arrows to use at these high levels.

, An alternative switch is chickens,which are one of the best to level 15, but you would probably get bored after level 15. The cowhides sell for over 100gp each, and the bones provide fairly good prayer experience for your current level. Just bank at Beefy bill's every time you get a full inventory of cowhides. Another alternative to the cowhides are bringing them to Al Kharid's tanner and making hard leather. This is a longer more boring process, but very profitable and easy to obtain.;
, They drop a wide variety of very good herbs, up to torstol, which sells around 10-20k each. You won't be damaged too much if you aren't too low of a level, but if you are low-leveled, bring some food. Tuna is a good and cheap delicacy to bring. Dwarves are also an option, but only work well until level 30. And they do not drop as much of profitable items as Chaos Druids do.

, You need a brass key, which is very easy to obtain. Just ask someone to get one for you in the dungeon if you do not own one. Hill giants drop limpwurt roots very often, sell for 1k gp a piece, and their big bones give good prayer exp. Or if you are not into leveling your prayer you can sell the bones for good gold. You can make a lot of money per trip. Another option is training on white knights until level 50,though they can work until 60, it is not recommended to train on them till level 60, because they do get boring and do not drop good items.

, They drop big bones every time and also drop good seeds occasionally. They are also a reliable charm dropper. As long as you avoid melee distance, you won't take too much damage. Though they don't hit that high, only around 6 or 7 damage.

, These are very good moneymakers, but you will need a rune c'bow + anti-dragon shield equipped plus quite some food and mithril bolts at the very least. Once you are at 65+, train on blue dragons as well so you don't get bored. Plus, they have rare drops more frequently than green dragons, and their hides are worth more. But watch out, though there are safe spots, you still have to run out and grab your loot so be careful, because they are over level 100. Also, you might also want to interfere range with your slayer tasks now. Another option is werewolves, which are good with iron knives or steel darts, and the wolf bones, which are dropped 100% of the time, can be alched or sold in the Grand Exchange for a good profit, or they can be used in summoning.

, You can spend some fun time and kill metal dragons in hope for a visage, but this is not very good exp. Aviansies are a good strategy. They're VERY profitable dropping adamant bars much of the time and are simple to kill with your current range level. Since the Aviansies are in the God Wars dungeon, you might want to bring a piece of Armadyl equipment in order to avoid other monsters from attacking you. The cheapest item to bring is an Armadyl Pendant acquired after the Temple of Ikov quest. Depending on your defense, decide on whether or not you need prayer potions (especially if you are pure range). Fire giants also work pretty well. They have decent drops and can't hit too high if you are good enough to avoid damage if you have low defence. The hill giants in Taverley Dungeon are great exp, too, and can be excellent experience until the mid-90s, since nearly nobody trains there. They have decent hitpoints, low defence, don't hit commonly, and if you use knives/magic shortbow with Ava's attractor, and a full dragonhide set with maybe Ranger boots and a Robin Hood Hat, you can achieve excellent experience in what is basically no time at all. The Tzhaar are also a very profitable enemy to train on since they drop Obsidian Charms and Obsidian weapons, cape, shield, etc. There are a few safe spots in the caves, too, so you don't have to worry about damage.

, You can range almost anything perfectly. You can continue with Aviansies, which will give you a ton of money. Or, you could battle with the other monsters stated earlier in the article. During this stage, you will make a TON of profit if you choose the correct methods. Red chinchompas are likely the best experience, which equal to around 300k exp per hour, but cost amazingly high, too.

"
Decide whether to chop or purchase supplies.,
Consider stringing the bows.,
Consider a Sacred Clay Fletching knife.,
Know where to chop wood.,
Have your supplies ready.,
Train your fletching to level 80.,
Make the last push to level 99.,
Craft bolts and darts if you are very wealthy.",How to Get 99 Fletching on RuneScape," If you're trying to make money or train your wood chopping skills, you can chop your own trees before fletching. This can take an extremely long time, especially near the end when you're gathering yew and magic logs, but it is free apart from your time. For a much faster method, you can purchase the supplies from other players.;
, Fletching a bow from a log gives exactly the same amount of experience as stringing that bow.Stringing a bow is significantly faster than fletching, so this route will save you time if you purchase the strings rather than crafting them yourself. Whether this is worthwhile to you depends on the cost of bow strings and your budget.

, Visit the Gamer's Grotto and play the Stealing Creation minigame. When you have 20 points, you can purchase a Proto-Tool and transform it into a Sacred Clay Fletching knife, which requires 40 Fletching to use. This doubles the rate of your EXP gain, but will fall apart after giving 24,450 bonus experience., Find a location with at least two trees of the desired type, and a nearby bank for stashing your supplies. Here are some good options:Chop normal and oak trees east of Varrock. A grove of normal trees stands right outside the gate, alongside two oak trees.
Chop willow trees southwest of Catherby. These are scattered throughout the grove, not far from the town.
Chop maple trees in Seer's Village. These are conveniently located to the north and south of the bank, so you can easily store the items you gather.
Chop yew trees north of Varrock palace. This will be slow unless you have at least 75 woodcutting.Chop magic trees near Sorcerer's Tower, southwest of Camelot. This will take a very long time, especially if you have less than 85 woodcutting.Elder trees are extremely tedious to chop, as they are stingy with their logs and only allow 5 minutes of chopping every 15 minutes. The trees nearest to a bank are located in Gnome Stronghold (NW of bank) and Draynor Village (S of bank)., It's best to purchase or chop these in advance, or at least completely gather one type of logs before you begin fletching. If you are constantly switching back and forth between chopping and fletching, you'll waste a lot of time. Here's what you need to get all the way from 1 to 99, using the most common method:To get from Fletching 1 to 20, you'll need 564 normal logs or 321 normal logs and 243 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 20 to 35, you'll need 793 oak logs or 397 oak logs and 397 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 35 to 50, you'll need 1,990 willow logs or 995 willow logs and 995 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 50 to 65, you'll need 6,158 maple logs or 3,079 maple logs and 3,079 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 65 to 80, you'll need 20,916 yew logs or 10,458 yew logs and 10,458 bow strings.
To get from Fletching 80 to 90, you'll need 38,103 magic logs or 19,052 magic logs and 19,052 bow strings. See training, below, for cheaper options.
To get from Fletching 90 to 99, you'll need 70,596 elder logs or 35,298 elder logs and 35,298 bow strings. See training, below, for cheaper options.
Whether this is worth it depends on your skill at Stealing Creation and the speed of your fletching setup. If you enjoy the minigame it may be worth it regardless, to avoid burnout from repetitive fletching.

, Craft the following items to reach the listed level. Whenever a bow is listed, you can make them from logs, or string them:


Levels 1–5: Make arrow shafts out of 78 normal logs.
Levels 5–10: Fletch or string 154 shortbows. As with any bow, you can reduce this number by half (to 77) if you both fletch and string the bow. This is faster but more expensive.
Levels 10-20: Craft 332 shieldbows.
Levels 20-25: Create 210 oak shortbows.
Levels 25-35: Build 583 oak shieldbows.
Levels 35-40: Assemble 445 willow shortbows.
Levels 40-50: Form 1,545 willow shieldbows.
Levels 50-55: Construct 1,307 maple shortbows.
Levels 55-65: Fabricate 4,851 maple shieldbows.
Levels 65-70: Produce 4,270 yew shortbows.
Levels 70-80: Obtain 16,646 yew shieldbows. This step alone will take about 10 hours of fletching, 6.5 hours of stringing, or about 8.5 hours of fletching + stringing.

, This is the point where it gets much more expensive and/or time consuming, and can easily take you 60 hours of crafting even if you purchase all the supplies.


Levels 80-85: Collect 15,286 magic shortbows. (Or, as always, half this amount if you both fletch and string them.)

Cheaper, slower alternative: 16,968 yew shieldbows.


Levels 85-90: Secure 22,817 magic shieldbows.

Cheaper, slower alternative: 27,837 yew shieldbows.


Levels 90-95: Glean 33,847 elder shortbows.

Cheaper, slower alternatives: 37,435 magic shieldbows, or 45,670 yew shieldbows.


Levels 95-99: Hoard 36,749 elder shieldbows

Cheaper, slower alternatives: 46,589 magic shieldbows, or 56,839 yew shieldbows.



, Broad arrows (level 55+), ascension bolts (90+), and dragon darts (95+) all grant more experience per minute than bows, but since these are untradable items, this method costs hundreds of millions of gold at typical ingredient prices."

Levels 1-5: Don't buy your own logs on this stage. You need to cut down normal trees.;
, Knives are fairly regular. They can be bought from the Grand Exchange, and they spawn behind the Lumbridge castle.

, A great spot is south of Edgeville by the barbarian village. There are tons of trees there!

, Click ""Make 15 arrow shafts."" Your player will start cutting those logs into arrow shafts. You make 15 at a time.

, 1170 shafts is the same thing as cutting 78 regular logs.


Levels 5-10. You still need your knife and axe. This time, make bows. You may want to buy your logs and stay near a bank if you can afford it. The next steps are if you're cutting them. (Also, you can stay with arrow shafts because they give the same xp.)

, Sadly, bows are not stackable so you probably want to cut logs near a bank.

, It is the same thing as the shafts, but click ""Make Shortbow.""


Get 154 normal logs. This will make 154 unstrung shortbows, or 2310 arrow shafts. To do this, just stand at a bank stall, fletch the inventory of logs into what you want, then put in bank, and repeat until you are done.

NOTE: You do not want to string these. It will give a negative profit, since bowstrings are about 160 ea (As of January 2008) The price can go down, though. Always consider the price of the bowstrings. The price of a bowstring is more than the price of a strung short bow.

,,,
Log Type: Oak
XP Needed: 14564
Level you will reach: 35

, Nice job you're doing well.


Number of logs: 445 (Buy them, even though they are decent xp if you cut)
Log Type: Willow
XP Needed: 14,818
Level you will reach: 40

, This is a milestone. Willows will be going from this point on. No maples, nothing else. You are going straight from 40 to 70.

,, (You will probably need to buy them)
Log Type: Willows
XP Needed: 700403.
Level you will reach: 70!
Estimated cost: Around 260k, or down.
Note: Try to buy at 15 ea so you will make a profit in the sales.

, This is a place where many people train fletching and cooking. You will need to go North of Taverley, then past the heroes guild. You will see a bar eventually, then you will go in the bar and behind the counter where the bartender is.


Go down the trapdoor you see and you will appear in a room. Look for a man named Emerald Benedict where everyone else is, and you can bank your items with him. You will train here, because there are other cool people doing the same thing. Funny conversations start, and it is a good environment. It makes time fly..

, But you can do it. This is just about the hardest part. Once you're past here, you'll be rich!

, If you bought them 15 ea. Shops buy willow longbows (u) 16 ea, no matter what the amount. Sell all you longbows (thank goodness they have the ""Sell 50"" option now). It will take a while but you'll end up with about 270k. You can give up then, or, you can start on the real money making of fletching.

, You're going to have to get about 17k more after the money you made off of selling the bows and you're going to have to buy 500 yew logs, and 500 bowstrings. That will be about a total of 286k.

, Once you're done, (It will seem like no time at all after all those willows).

,


Use the bowstring with the unstrung yew longbow. Now you will make a complete bow. Make them all, and you will sell these for 600 ea. That's about 15k profit, but it will go up once the amount you make goes up. Another option is alching these. High alching will give you about 700 and something per bow. It's good mage xp, and it gives lots of money. But remember it will become a negative profit if you buy your nature runes for too much each.

, It's a great idea. If you want the exact numbers, they're under here.

In most cases, you can make over 200 each per herb you clean, meaning you can make massive amounts of money, and get some experience while doing it.

, Complete the Digsite quest. This quest is a little tedious, but gives you great experience. It also gives you thieving and agility experience, however it requires 25 thieving and 19 agility.

If you do not want to do the quest, you can start the next step at level 13.

, Make strength potions. Strength potions require tarromin and limpwurt roots. The roots cost 1k each, so if you want to kill hill giants to get them and train your account, you could do that. You could also collect them in the Hill Giant resource dungeon at level 20 dungeoneering., Make prayer potions. You require a grimy ranarr and snape grass to make these.

Starting at 45, you can make super attack potions using irit and eye of newt. These cost more to make, but give you 15.5 more experience per potion.

, Make super energy potions. These require mort myre fungus and avantoe to create.

There is no real way to get crushed nests in bulk, the best way would to be killing the Giant Mole, exchanging it's skin and claws for bird's nests from Wyden and then crushing the nests., Make adrenaline potions. These require super restores and papaya to make. Note this is the cheapest way to get 99 from this point on, as the rest of the of the method require more gold. If you are trying to save money, this is the way to go, but if you are after the fastest way possible, continue reading., Make extreme attacks. You are going to need super strength and a dwarf weed.

Leaping Sturgeon/Salmon/Trout.",How to Achieve 99 Fishing in RuneScape," You'll only need to catch about 100 of them (15-20 minutes). You can drop them for faster experience, or if you need GP for more bait/feathers at higher fishing levels, bank them in Lumbridge.;
, It will require that you buy about 360 fish bait, which you can find at the Port Sarim or at Grand Exchange for bait and fishing rod.

, Head over to the barbarian village and lure fish. You can lure fish at most spots and lure fish, such as on the lumbridge river, which is the easiest spot since it is near logs for cooking and a bank chest for storing.

, Since there is no bank around, dropping the fish is the most efficient method, however loses you money. This will get boring quick, so if you want to, you can go onto the next method. You will obtain a 12.8m profit doing this if you bank them.

, That is one of the easiest strand, and it gives 120 XP per catch. Before fishing monkfish you must have completed Swan Song. After the quest start fishing them at around level 75 up until level 99. This is also one of the best ways to make money.

, You can fish them at level 90 for good money at about 38k XP per hour, and they fish at about the speed of sharks. World 84 is suggested to fish these as it is the unofficial world for rocktails. You can also fish cavefish at level 85 for about 25 - 30k XP per hour and decent money.

, Known to be the best fishing experience, this requires Barbarian training, which can be started at Otto's Grotto. At level 80 (which is the recommended level to fish this at), each full inventory takes about 2 minutes, each giving about 1500 XP. However, to fish all of these, you need at least level 45 Agility & level 45 Strength.

, It can take some time to change hobby habits. Not being patient will drive you and of course him crazy, leading to pointless arguments.

, Read a book, draw something, try a new video game out, or go out with your friends. Do whatever pleases you so that you're not waiting around for him and so that you don't resent his playing as much.

, Watch your partner play, and ask him to teach you how to play, too. Who knows, maybe you'll like it. You may able to develop a shared hobby through World of Warcraft, but even if not, being willing to try it shows him you care.

, For example, he may agree to setting a limit on his playing hours each day, or he may be willing to set aside a certain amount of time with you each day before he goes back to the game. Find a plan you can both agree on.

, Have some fun, go out, and remind him that the real world can be just as engaging as a video game.

Psychological testing has shown that it takes about 21 days to develop a new habit or break an old one. Cessation is often a lot more effective than going 'cold turkey.'
A lot of gamers choose to sell their accounts when they feel they no longer have time for them.

You can describe a sports car to someone that has never seen one.. they won't go ""Ooh!"" until they see a picture. The easiest way to take a picture of your warcraft, wow account is to get a character profile. I do not recommend using an armory profile.

, This is important for forum selling. Some shoppers get discouraged if they have to ask and they simply will not ask nor make an offer. Consider your last trip to the grocery store, if you wanted something and the price wasn't right there, you might have just skipped buying that item. Convenience is key!

This will track bidding for you and allow you a better presentation than forums allow.

, Read forum rules on bumping. This will increase visibility when new posts cause yours to become ""buried.""

, You need to price your account AT the amount that it will sell for, and then use the 'buy now' option. Use automatically re-listing auctions with 1 day durations. It is easy to adjust your prices at any time. Start at high prices, and slowly reduce until you have a buyer.

To start with your priest, you need to find a common goal.,
You need to concentrate on leveling and questing for you first ten to twenty levels as the priest is easily killed at low levels.

,
When you get to level ten, you must now start to work on your weapons and armor.,
At 40, you may want to change your talent tree.

,
Once you reach to 60+ join a raiding guild and do some raiding.,
Not everyone wants to group for instances with a shadow priest because of their specialization in DPS over healing abilities.",How to Successfully Be a Priest in World of Warcraft," Are you working for the dark side, holy side or disciplined side? This choice will depend on a lot of what you can and can not accomplish in the future.;
,, The priest has naturally low armor but as you get further in the game, no one will want to approach you. AT 10, you also make your decision, holy, shadow or disciplined? Where do you spend your talent points, to become what?

,, With the addition of group-wide mana regen, both holy and shadow spec priests have usability in raids and instances. Discipline, for the most part, is still for pvp.

, So, being a shadow priest at the lower levels (10-40) is recommended for leveling, unless playing a healer is your passion. While playing the higher levels (40-70) It comes down to what you what role you wish your priest to play. If you enjoy running instances/raiding, Shadow and Holy make great choices for their respective DPS and healing abilities, while if PvP is what you enjoy then Discipline is great for survivability (arguably making the best flag-bearers in the game), while Shadow can take down targets quickly by dealing large amounts of damage in a short period of time. Holy is also viable, however their role in PvP tends to fall to sticking a short distance from main battles and using low cast time spells such as flash heal, renew and PW:S.

Know who can enter your instance and their roles.,
Enter the instanced dungeon with your group.,
Select your role.,
Make sure you are specialized according to your role.,
Know each role’s class specialization.,
Be prepared in case things end up going wrong.",How to Survive in an Instanced Dungeon in World of Warcraft," Nobody else will be able to enter your instance unless they are a part of your group. For example, if you are in the Stormwind Stockades instance and somebody who is not in your group enters the Stormwind Stockades, they will be taken to their own instance of the Stockades.


Damage dealers focus on dealing damage to enemies.
Healers focus on healing other players in the group and also removing harmful effects such as curses.
Tanks protect damage dealers and healers by taking as damage from enemies so damage dealers and healers don’t have to worry about being attacked.
In an instanced dungeon group, one player must tank, one player must heal, and the remaining three players are damage dealers.;
, To enter an instanced dungeon, you can either go to the dungeon entrance or you can queue to enter a dungeon through the Dungeon Finder.


If someone else in your group has already entered the dungeon through its entrance, they may be able to summon you with a Summoning Portal.
If you do queue through the Dungeon Finder, then once it is your turn to enter you will be teleported directly to the dungeon.
Even if you do not have a group, you can queue alone with the Dungeon Finder, and it will match you to a group with four other people who have queued.
To open the Dungeon Finder, you can press “I” on your keyboard or you can click on the Dungeon Finder icon on your menu bar. The menu bar is located on the bottom of your screen, to the right of your action bar (the bar with your abilities and spells) and to the left of your bags.
On the menu bar, look for the icon of a green eye. Click on the green eye, and it will bring up the Dungeon Finder window.

, In the Dungeon Finder window, you will see three icons: a Shield (the tank icon), a Green Leaf (the healer icon), and a Claw (the damage dealer icon). These icons represent different roles to play in a dungeon. If you move your mouse over an icon, it will give you more information about the role.


The Shield icon is for tanks. Choosing it indicates you are willing to protect allies from harm by ensuring that enemies are attacking you instead of them.
The Green Leaf icon is for healers. Choosing it indicates you are willing to heal your allies when they are taking damage.
The Claw icon is for damage dealers. Choosing it indicates you are willing to take on the role of dealing damage to enemies.
You can select your role as either a tank, healer or damage dealer by clicking on the relevant icon. Once you have clicked on the icon, a checkmark should appear near it. If you want to change roles, you can click the icon again to remove the checkmark, and then click on a different icon.

, The key to being successful in an instanced dungeon is to work with other people your group effectively and perform according to your designated role.


There are 11 classes in World of Warcraft, and each class has three specializations except for druid which has four.
Choosing a specialization will give you additional abilities and attributes. Each specialization is suited to one of the three roles: tanking, healing or damage dealing.
To use an example, have a look at paladins. Paladins can be specialized as either Holy (designed for healing), Retribution (designed for damage dealing) or Protection (designed for tanking).
Holy Paladins have extra healing spells and abilities that Retribution and Protection Paladins do not have. Likewise, Retribution Paladins have extra damage dealing abilities that Protection and Holy Paladins do not have. Finally, Protection Paladins have extra damage reduction abilities that the other Holy or Retribution Paladins do not have.
Of the 34 specializations in the game, 23 are designed for damage dealing, five are designed for tanking, and six are designed for healing.

, For you to fulfill your role optimally, play a class specialized to that role.


If you are playing as a Restoration Shaman, and your role is damage dealer, you will have a much harder time dealing damage than if you were specialized as an Elemental Shaman because Restoration Shamans have more healing abilities and fewer damaging abilities, while Elemental Shamans have more damaging abilities and fewer healing abilities.
Here is a quick list of which class specialization belongs to each role: Tanks – Protection Warrior, Protection Paladin, Brewmaster Monk, Blood Death Knight, Guardian Druid; Healers – Holy Paladin, Holy Priest, Discipline Priest, Mistweaver Monk, Restoration Shaman, Restoration Druid; and Damage Dealing – every other specialization in the game is designed for damage dealing.

, If you ever do end up dying, do not panic.


Once you are dead, you will see a button in the middle of your screen called “Release Spirit.” You may not need to click the button if other players in your group are still alive, since they may be able to resurrect you with a spell to bring you back to life.
However, if your entire group is dead, you can click on the Release Spirit button. It will teleport you to the nearest graveyard outside the instance and you will be a ghost. As a ghost, you won’t be able to use any abilities or interact with the world, but you can still move. You will have to run from the graveyard to the instance entrance. Once you have entered the instance as a ghost, you will be immediately resurrected.
After you have resurrected, give your group some time to get ready again before you start fighting more enemies. You may need to wait for other people in your group to resurrect if they are still dead.

Look at the following signs for quality:


The Store History: Use the ""time machine"" archive.org to check how long the website has existed.",How to Safely Buy Gold in World of Warcraft," However, it's very easy for the site owner to reject the archive.org bot, keeping it from retrieving any data by blocking ia_archiver bot. In that case, you should try to look at the history of the domain registration. On the other hand, you can try to click some history pages to see if the website has always been in the same business. Their link with an asterisk means the webpage has been changed at some point in their history.
The Domain's Age: This step is similar to the first step. The difference is that you should use the Domain Tools(http://www.domaintools.com/"") to check for the domain age of the World of Warcraft gold store. So why do you need another step that is so similar to the previous step? Remember, I mentioned that some sites may block archive.org's bot very easily using robots.txt.
WoW Merchant Privacy Policy: Read the sites' privacy policy or user terms carefully, you will find out how serious the owners are about their consumers. In a general way, the retailers are good enough if their privacy policy has been reviewed by eTrust(http://www.etrust.org/). I guess the privacy policy is important for each site, so each WoW gold site should have one. It even effects the Ad's quality at Google Adwords. When you think you are ready to buy from a site, make sure to read everything carefully, including the user terms.
If possible, talk with them: Feel them out. See how friendly they are, as well as how professional. It's important! Luckily, most of the WoW gold sellers have a toll-free number, and LIVE cam chat. Chat with them online, or call them.
Secure Sockets Layer: Pay attention to the address bar of your browser during purchase and registration. Try to find the SSL there! It will protect your information filled into the form. By the way, there should always be a certificate seal in the site.
Wow Gold Payment: Most of World of Warcraft stores use the third party merchant gateway such as PayPal, Google Checkout, 2Checkout or Moneybookers. So you should never share the sensitive information(credit cards and CVV numbers)with them. It's much safer. Even if you find the WoW gold store supports credit cards directly, it is much better to use PayPal or Google Checkout.
If you are on the realm Darkspear, add a character named Slavelady and give them a mount and they will ask you for lots of gold.
If you're in serious need of gold, go out and do quests; its not hard and it's less likely to get you banned or hacked.;

, First, choose what faction you want your character to roleplay on. Then, choose the characters race and class. Finally, create a name for your character. It would not be a good idea to name your character names such as ""Shammypwnz"" or ""Twinklelight"", instead you should give your character a more realistic name like ""Chloe"" or ""Sebastian"".

, Some examples of a characters back-story could be ""XXXXX used to live on a farm with his/her parents. One year later, his/her family got wiped out by the Scourge."" or maybe ""XXXXX used to be a commander of the Horde, then lost his/her position because he/she disobeyed an order from the Warchief.""

, Your character can't just be dull. Try giving your character personalities. Is your character caring? Is he/she cruel? Personalities will make your character seem more interesting.

, Some roles include: Soldier, Archer, Cook, Commander, Engineer, Trader, archmage. You should also have a reason for how your character earned this role.

, It would be quite boring to roleplay all by yourself. Other players are going to think you are strange. A great place to find a roleplaying buddy is an Inn/Tavern in a capital city (Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc). Inns are a pretty popular RP spot, so you'll find a lot of friendly buddies to Roleplay with.

, Use more of a more ""Advanced"" vocabulary instead of a ""Simple"" vocabulary. Have good grammar also.

, Roleplay can get pretty boring if it's just a simple conversation between two people. Throw in some action! Examples include: ""XXXX pushed his/her ale to the edge of the small wooden table."" or ""XXXX kicked XXXXXX in the ribs.""

Visit Battle.net.Each World of Warcraft server (also referred to as “realms”) is designated as being a PvP (player versus player), PvE (player versus environment), or RP (roleplaying) server.,
Consider location and time zone when selecting a server.,
Consider also the server population.,
Enter your realm.,
Select a class.,
Choose a gender.,
Create a unique name.,
Consider your Blood Elf’s appearance.,
Consider your backstory.,
Join a roleplaying guild.",How to Roleplay a Blood Elf in World of Warcraft," While you may find roleplaying guilds on PvP or PvE servers, they will be fewer and farther between. Furthermore, the overall culture of a roleplaying server, as well as certain rules specific to each server type, will have an effect on your ability to immerse yourself in your adventures. A list of WoW’s servers, along with their locations, types, and popularity, can be found at battle.net on the Realm Status page.
, Consider when your primetime for playing will be, and choose a server accordingly. You’ll want to choose a server where the bulk of the population will be on and playing at the same time you are, for the most enjoyable experience., While cross-realm grouping has eliminated many of the issues associated with low population servers, a busier realm will have more guilds and more opportunities for adventuring with others. Low population servers can be great for farming rare mobs, but the cons (difficulties in downing world bosses, finding a guild that suits your style, etc.) tend to outweigh these., Once you’ve chosen your realm, just select it from the server list upon entering the game, and prior to creating your character., When roleplaying, creating the role itself is one of the more enjoyable aspects. However, before you jump to the character creation U/I, it’s important to understand just what a blood elf is and certain aspects of their culture—Class, Gender, Name, and Appearance. The first aspect, Class, will affect your gameplay experience and influence, to some extent, the appearance of your character. However, it will also play an important part in determining your character’s backstory and influence their future adventures. Here’s a breakdown:


Death Knight. When Arthas invaded the elven city of Quel’Thalas, he raised the fallen as death knights—undead warriors whom he planned to command as his own minions. Playable death knights, however, have escaped his control. You have not, however, escaped the unalterable fact that you must inflict suffering upon others or end up in agony yourself, so expect to spend a lot of time seeking adventures where doing so suits you. One thing (other than being undead, of course) sets DKs apart from other blood elves: they are no longer addicted to arcane magic.

Mage. If you’re looking to live a high profile life in Silvermoon City or another blood-elf dense enclave, being a mage is the obvious path for the ambitious. Mages are the most socially revered blood elves in a general sense, and the highest ranging mages constitute a large portion of the ruling class. It’s a natural reflection on the society’s addiction to and proclivity for all things arcane.

Paladin. Most blood elf paladins are associated with a faction known as Blood Knights. Unlike other paladins, Blood Knights draw their power from the Sunwell, the source of arcane magic upon which all blood elves are dependent. This means your character is much less obligated to be an ethical beacon, as it were.

Monk. Blood elves have a rather short history when it comes to the martial arts styles favored by Pandaren. If you become a blood elf monk, you will be part of one of the first generations to embrace this novel path.

Hunter. Hunters, often referred to as rangers in blood elf society, are renowned for their agility and prowess, even by other races. The existence of the Farstrider faction, composed of rangers, has helped to further their good reputation—Farstriders seek to destroy evil whether they find it. They have a contentious relationship with Blood Knights, due to their differing views.

Priest. A blood elf priest may be a practicing member of the Church of Holy Light, but as with paladins, their ability to draw power from the Sunwell negates the obligation of devotion.

Rogue. Rogues have a wide variety of roleplay choices. They may associate with the more benevolent worldview of the Farstriders, and simply consider themselves gifted melee fighters. They may also find work as couriers, spies, or assassins if they are so inclined.

Warlock. Because blood elves are already magic-addicted and, some would say, tainted by fel magic, this career path is not as shunned amongst blood elves as it is among many other races. There is little, however, lore on the topic of blood elf warlocks. Given the high status accorded to mages, however, these demon-oriented magic users are a good fit for a blood elf roleplay that seeks to focus on the darker sides of their nature.

Warrior. Blood elf warriors are ferocious melee fighters who rely upon their agility and grace to wield swords, axes, maces, and shields. Unlike death knights and paladins, their skills are primarily physical rather than magical in nature.

, While gender has no effect on gameplay mechanics, it is useful to note that certain aspects of blood elf society are more skewed toward males or females. For example, there are notably more male mages in power than female, though some have risen in the ranks. On the other hand, some of the most legendary rangers are blood elf women., Blood elf first names vary quite a bit, with many having names with a bit of a Roman influence, while others have something of a Celtic feel. Almost all blood elf names flow appealingly. One good way to get a good handle on appropriate first names is to take a look at lists of blood elf NPCs online. Surnames are almost always a combination of two standard words: Sunsworn, Dawnblade, Brightstar, etc., Appearance is important to blood elves, so take this into account when deciding what your character will look like. Most blood elves are pale with light colored hair, however, their consumption of fel magic can darken their complexion. Other hair colors are available as well, and some blood elves also dye their hair to further distinguish themselves from their high elf relatives., In just the past few decades, elven society has seen incredible upheaval, devastation, and experienced what many consider unforgivable betrayal by their allies and even their own leaders. Reading up on blood elf history and lore online is a good idea even if you’re not looking to create a complex backstory right from the get-go. While allowing your ideas for your character’s backstory to develop is a good plan, having at least an idea about how these huge events affected their life will definitely help. This will help when you encounter characters of other races, as this history will certainly affect your character’s perspectives. Even though blood elves are aligned with the Horde, they are arguably the black sheep of the family, and there is a great deal of distrust and suspicion on both sides., While this isn’t strictly necessary, it’s highly recommended. A guild is a group of players who have committed to some common goal, share common interests, or simply enjoy playing together. On WoW’s official forums (which can be found at battle.net), each realm has its own subforum. Roleplaying realms will typically have a stickied list at the top of their forums with a guild directory. Just as PvE guilds might focus on social activities or raiding, roleplaying guilds have varied focuses. Some are military in nature—a fighting force. Some are race specific (blood elves only, for example), or class specific (paladins only, hunters only). Still others might focus on more niche activities: treasure hunting, or furthering certain racial or faction goals. The guild directory will usually have a link to the guild’s website or their specific recruitment threads.

Joining a guild varies according to the guild’s processes. However, typically you can expect to fill out an application on the guild’s website. These applications will usually address the type of roleplay you’re interested in, some basic facts about your character, your most active gaming times during the day, and so on. If your application is accepted, you’ll receive an in-game guild invitation which you simply accept in order to become part of the guild.

Pick a suitable destruction spec that fits you.,
Obtain a suitable rotation.,
Glyph correctly.,
Gear and gem correctly.",How to Play a Destruction Warlock in World of Warcraft," The general spec is 3/13/54+1. The 3 in affliction is for hit rating and is not necessary if your gear provides enough hit rating for you. The 13 points is up to ""Demonic Aegis"". The +1 point is usually invested in completing Fel Synergy for pet survivability. The key difference between this and deep destruction is that deep destruction includes ""Soul Leech"" and ""Improved Soul Leech"" for added survivability.;
, At the moment the main one being used is Immolate-Chaos bolt+Confla-Incin spam. Of course a curse should be used but depending on the circumstances will decide which one. If you are the only warlock in the group/raid then you will want to caste Curse of Elements due to the boost it will give to other classes. If there are multiple warlocks then you can decide who is casting Curse of Elements and if that warlock is not you then you should use Curse of Doom. How many times you cast Incinerate depends on what your haste level and current buffs are. Note that Corruption is also used by some warlocks but is usually only seen used by warlocks with the 2 piece T7/7.5 set bonus. Corruption can also be cast on a target if you are moving for a slight DPS boost.

, Conflagration glyph is a must due to the fact it will not eat your Immolate on the target and makes the Incin spam part of your rotation so much better. Glyph of Immolate should also be used. Finally the Life tap glyph should be used so you gain a 40 second spirit-spellpower increase.

, Without a doubt Spell Power is the best stat to look for. This should always be the highest on your list to look out for. The use of crit/haste can be argued either way but from what I have seen, as long as crit sticks around 22-24% (without calculating talents into it), the warlock should then start stacking haste. Although this is debatable. This of course can be applied to gems. This means that +23 Spell power is the main gem you want to use and in most scenario's, socket colour should be broken. For a meta you should use Chaotic skyflare diamond (+20 crit rating and increased crit damage by 3%). You should socket the 2 gems that make this valid in the areas where they lower your DPS the least as opposed to a better gem that would break socket colour. The main time you should socket for yellow is when the socket bonus is something very valuable such as spell power which will make the yellow gem a better choice than the red +23 Spell Power Gem. Other than these rules you should be looking to socket +23 Spell Power.

Choose a role to play in parties/raids.Tank - These characters support parties by being largely defensive, holding large health totals and wearing heavy armor (Mail pre-level 40, Plate after, or for Ferals a ""form"" which is equivalent), mitigating Aggro (terminology used within the game to denote the ""threat"" levels of a given NPC) and in general keeping the rest of the party from taking too much direct damage.,
Choose Your Faction.,
Choose your Class.,
Stick With Your Decision.",How to Pick Your Class in World of Warcraft," This role is often difficult due to the large number of things a Tank must watch out for. These include: Sudden health drops of other party members, your healer's mana bar, potential hazards (damaging zones on the ground, other mobs to avoid accidentally pulling), their threat levels with each mob they are tanking, their own health levels, the cool-downs on their own abilities, their Rage quantities and etc. However, Tanking can be a truly rewarding experience as well. Good Tanks are always in high demand, never experiencing a hard time finding a group willing to run with them. They often have first crack at the best loot, and in general will find themselves in the leadership role of most parties, as they must direct the flow of the game-play in party style play.The drawbacks of a Tank are: Most tanks don't do a great deal of single-target damage, and only moderate Area of Effect (AoE) damage. They usually can't do much to heal for themselves, whether due to lack of healing spells/abilities or needing to utilize their mana for other ends. They must keep track of many things but have a limited resource to work with, and often times they must make up for other party members' mistakes, such as Over-Aggroing (yes, you Warlocks and Mages know you do it...)Healer These characters embody the true essence of a Support Class. Healer-classes have a large number of things to keep track of, most of which will generally revolve around the maintenance of the general health/condition of their Party. While the name ""Healer"" is rather obvious, Healers do more than simply raise the health totals of their party members. Some healers are skilled at mitigating damage with protective spells. All healers are capable of buffing their allies. Healers must monitor the status/condition of their party, being ready to remove whatever illnesses befall them (Poisons, Diseases, Curses, Magical Afflictions) all while attempting to avoid drawing the aggro off of the rest of the party (And yes, Healer Aggro can be vicious.) The role of the healer is integral to the party/group dynamic in World of Warcraft, and a good healer can make up for a crappy Tank.While Healers have many positives, they likewise have drawbacks to include: Healers are generally ""squishy"" meaning they wear light armor or are otherwise not capable of taking many hits before dying, and even the hardiest healers (arguably Holy Paladins) fall to burst damage long before their tank would have felt a scratch on their armor. Healers are not capable of much in the way of DPS. While it could be argued that they can DPS depending on the class, they aren't talented well for it and their mana pools must be reserved for, well, healing. Cloth and Leather-based healers will often find themselves rolling against Cloth/Leather casters for decent gear on dungeon drops, which can prove annoying. Unless the healer is skilled enough, it is likely it will run out of mana eventually, thus they must carry water supplies to restock.Damage/DPS These characters are the rock-stars of the number smashing world. They are responsible for what veteran players of the game like to call ""Melting Faces."" As the name would suggest, The DPS' main role is to cause great deals of damage. There are a number of classes that all work toward this end in a number of fashions, but the most general categories of DPS are: Ranged and Melee. There is also a bit of a differentiation between Ranged Caster/Ranged Physical, but it's not really that important. Often times DPS classes are capable of debuffing their targets, increasing their vulnerability to the rest of their attacks. Some DPS classes even enhance the abilities of other DPSers in their group/category, thus bringing more utility to a raid/group environment. Further still, many DPSers are also capable of buffing their allies, increasing the party's efficiency overall.There are some benefits to being a DPS class, but there are a number of drawbacks as well: While equally as necessary in a group as the Tanks and Healers, DPS classes suffer in that they seem to be ""a dime a dozen."" DPS classes are generally not as squishy as Healers (though some are equally-so such as Mages and Warlocks) but they can't take too much punishment before they go down. Poor DPSers will do less overall damage in a group setting than a good Tank, and single-target DPS classes may suffer on Recount charts when AoE DPS is necessary. If you're playing a DPSer that isn't good on mana conservation, you may well have to stop for water fairly often, which can be annoying. Finally, you're not on the healer's Priority Target list, (which includes the Tank and them-self) so you are more likely to die when things go awry.;
,
While at first glance this may not seem to affect the class you play, it might well determine how you play said class since different Races have different Racial Abilities that compliment some classes better than others, and in the case of some Race/Class combinations you are very limited in choices (as is the case with Druids.)Alliance - The Races of the Alliance include many ""Noble"" minded creatures, and the abilities of the Alliance Races often are more well-suited for the PvE (Player versus Environment) setting.Horde - The Races of the Horde include the more ""Gritty"" races, and their Racial Abilities are often more useful in the PvP (Player versus Player) setting.

,
So you know what role you want to play. The following is a list of classes/specs based on their Role.Tanks - Protection Warriors, Brewmaster Monks, Vengeance Demon-hunters, Protection Paladins, Feral (Bear) Druids, Blood Death Knights.Healers - Holy/Discipline Priests, Restoration Druids, Restoration Shamans, Holy Paladins, Mistweaver Monks.Melee DPS - Armsman/Fury Warriors, Retribution Paladins, Mistweaver Moks, Feral (Cat) Druids, Enhancement Shamans, Assassination/Combat/Subtlety Rogues, Windwalker Monks, Havoc Demon-hunters, Unholy/Frost Death Knights.Ranged DPS - Balance Druids, Elemental Shamans, Shadow Priests, Arcane/Fire/Frost Mages, Affliction/Destruction/Demonology Warlocks, Marksman/Survival/Beast Mastery Hunters.

,
At first each class may seem to be underpowered or lack options for styles of play, but this changes drastically the higher the level your character gets. You will never experience the greater powers and more impressive spells/abilities unless you stick it out and make it to the top. Don't like your choice after that? Well, there's always the option of Re-Rolling a new toon!

Decide what you want to do.,
Learn how to use your auras effectively.,
Educate yourself on all your Seal and Judgment spells.",How to Make Your Paladin Powerful," If your guild needs you to specialize in healing, then start procuring plate spellcaster gear. It is completely up to you on how you want to spend your talent points, but it would be a good idea to look up profiles of experienced Paladins in wowhead.com's profiler tool. Here are the talent builds and what they can do:

Holy (Healing) The paladin is best known for being manna efficient when healing and they make great single-target healers. There is a talent that when your healing spells critically strike, you get 60% of the mana you just used back. So paladins should focus on + crit gear if planning to heal, besides the + intellect and + spell power that all casters need. On the down side, they have no healing over time spells. Even without, they are very good healers. Paladins can wear any armor type, so if you are planning on healing and won't be getting hit much, it is OK to use cloth/leather/mail armor as long as its' stats are suitable. Paladins cannot equip staffs so you are going to have to use a 1 handed sword/mace and a shield. Another reason Paladins are good healers is because they can't be one hit by bosses since they are wearing plate armour have a shield equipped.



 


Protection (Tank) You are wearing plate remember? Paladins are also great tanks and specialize in holding aggro with several enemies at once with their Consecration. Although their Holy Shield spell is not guaranteed to block all attacks like the Warrior's Shield Block, it has a shorter cool down to be used more often. The Paladin's threat is based on Holy damage done, so it helps to get some + spell damage gear along with your + defense. Also one of the great talents a Paladin gets as protection is when they are below 35% health, they will take 30% less damage. To open up on a pull, use Avengers Shield and as soon as the enemies get close enough,Consecrate. Aggro should be on you from now on and all you have to do is not die. And make sure your Righteous Fury is activated






Retribution (DPS) Paladin's damage is physical and spell based, but don't be confused. The stats you want to stack are Attack Power (AP) and Crit Chance. AP is seen as spell power when spells are used. Almost all of your damage abilities are instant cast and based on weapon damage. You will want to pick a two-handed weapon (2H) that has a slow attack speed because the slower the attack speed, the harder it hits for each hit. Don't waste time on +Haste gear because haste doesn't affect instant casts in any way. Paladins also specialize in damaging Undead and Demons and they have a few spells that damage only those types of enemies. Always judge the target you are trying to kill. If specified into Retribution, your judgments will increase the crit chance on that target for everyone.





;
, Paladins have a variety of auras that effect all group members such as Devotion aura, which increases armor by about 1200 or so at level 80. They also have some great buffs called ""Blessings"" such as Blessing of Kings which increases all stats by 10%. That's really beneficial to tanks because it will increase there hit points by about 2000 depending on their gear level.

, Seals are something every Paladin has the ability to use. In fact almost everything a Paladin does is based on the Seals used. Read each one and decide what you want to use, keep in mind there is another side to seals: Judgments. Whatever seal you are using at the time has a judgment effect that applies when you use the Judgment ability. Judgments are a major source of your DPS and always help the group in some way. For example Judgment of Light has a chance to heal anyone who attacks that enemy for a small amount. There are three different Judgement spells: Judgement of Light, Judgement of Wisdom, which can restore 2% of the attackers mana, and Judgement of Justice which limits an enemies movement speed.

Choose what race you're going to play as.,
Choose Which Talent Tree You're Going To Use


Marksmanship: A master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar.,
Choose the right pet for your needs.,
Learn to command your pet effectively.",How to Play a Hunter in World of Warcraft," The following Alliance races can play as hunters: Dwarves, Night Elves, and Draenei. Among Horde races, orcs, Trolls, Tauren and Blood Elves can play as hunters. For more detailed information on the advantages of the various races, see the ""Tips"" section.;
, The Marksmanship specification diminishes the importance of the hunter's pet, instead focusing on powerful ranged abilities to destroy enemies. Like the greatest snipers, Marksmanship hunters gain additional damage when they fire shots while standing still. You may want to check out this page for more information on the Marksmanship specification.







Beast Mastery: A master of the wild who can tame a wide variety of beasts to assist her in combat. This talent tree focuses primarily on increasing the damage output and the tanking ability of your pet, while also unlocking the ability to tame powerful exotic beasts. This is one of the more popular talent trees for use when the hunter is leveling because it allows you pet to hold aggro well, tank, and deliver lethal damage. You may want to check out this page for more information on the Beast Mastery specification.







Survival: A rugged tracker who favors using animal venom, explosives and traps as deadly weapons. Of all the specifications, Survival hunters utilize traps, DoTs (Damage over time effects), and other magical abilities the most. You may want to check out this page for more information on the Survival specification.







, Your success at playing a Hunter in World of Warcraft also depends on the type of pet you choose. A good hunter will know the difference between the three types of pets, and when to use each one. A great hunter will not only know which pet to use, but how to use it. There are three different specifications of pets: Cunning, Ferocity, and Tenacity. When tamed, a pet will have a natural combat specification based on its family, but this can be changed at any time in the pet talent interface, provided that you and the pet are out of combat.


Tenacity pets are mostly used for solo grinding and questing, or, if you've gone down the beast mastery tree, these pets can also be viable as backup tanks, or even main tanks in lower level instances.







Ferocity pets are generally used for instances, raids, or PvP. Offensive or 'DPS' type pets deal the most raw damage of the three combat specifications.







Cunning pets are a balance between the two, as a ""jack of all trades"" pet, and are often used in PvP (Player vs. Player) situations for their utility.







, Whenever one of your pets is out a ""pet bar"" will appear above your normal action bar. This is your main interface for interacting with your pet. When you train your very first pet, there probably won't be very much on there besides the basic commands; Attack, Follow, Stop, and Aggressive, Defensive, and Passive. The first three commands are pretty self explanatory, so let's move on to the latter three.



Aggressive

Your pet will attack any hostile enemy within range.
Mainly used for solo questing, or grinding, or when soloing instances.



Defensive

Your pet will attack anything that attacks you, or it first.
This is the pet stance that you'll be using the most often



Passive

Your pet won't attack anything unless you target something and press the attack button.
Mainly used when running instances or raids, to prevent accidents.


Some pets have extra skills once you've tamed them; examples of these skills are prowl, dash, swoop, thunder stomp, and charge. These skills may also be added to the pet bar, and be be used manually by left clicking on them, or they can be set to auto-cast by right clicking the skill so that there is a bright dotted line surrounding it.

A straightforward playthrough
A demonstration of specific abilities, gear, or achievements
Providing a guide/instructions for other players
Telling an entertaining story through characters within the game
Creating a music video featuring your character;
, The style of video you create should be appropriate for your audience. The player base for World of Warcraft includes both children and adults. This means that there is a wide range of people who may come across your video.


An instructional video, for instance, should not use advanced language or concepts because the viewer may become confused, which defeats the purpose of an instructional video.

, Sound is an important part of video production. The sound you choose to incorporate into your video should fit the purpose. A demonstration video with music rather than vocalized instructions could turn away potential viewers.


If you are recording your own audio, be sure to minimize background noise as much as possible. A few ways to do this without a professional noise-reducing microphone include closing doors, informing others when you will be recording, and shutting off any appliances that make noticeable background noise.

, A video will not become popular if it contains false information. Whether it be lore, ability statistics, or important dates, it is always important to ensure the validity of your content before publishing a video.

, To create a video, you must have the proper recording software. Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is one such software, designed to record and stream games for free.


To get this software, open an Internet browser and head to www.obsproject.com.

, Right-click the “Download” button in the bottom-right corner of the scrolling banner, and select “Open in new tab” from the drop-down menu. Do not left-click as it may produce an error message instead of downloading the EXE file.

, Once you’ve finished downloading the installer, go to your Downloads folder and double-click on the file named “OBS_0_625b_Installer.”

, Click “Next” in the bottom-right corner of the introduction screen, and after reviewing the license agreement, select “I agree,” also located in the bottom-right corner. This will begin the installation.


After the software is installed, select the “Finish” button in the bottom of the window. The program will automatically open once it has finished installing.

, Go to Settings in menu bar at the top of the screen and choose the Broadcast Settings tab. Change the mode drop-down option to “File output only,” and then set the directory box that will appear under it to the location you want to save the video.


This is where your recorded files will be saved each time you end a recording.

, Head back to the main screen of OBS, right-click the “Sources” list box at the bottom of the screen, scroll over “Add,” and select what source you would like to record from. To record World of Warcraft, there are a few options available:


Window Capture—This is useful if you are playing the game in windowed mode.
Monitor Capture—This mode will capture everything happening on your screen whilst recording.
Video Capture Device—A common component of gameplay videos involving a picture-in-picture display showing the player’s actions and expressions alongside the game they are playing. This mode will not record the game itself but will record the player using a webcam, which can add a personalized touch to a video. If you choose to use this option, you will have to add another source to simultaneously record the game.
Game Capture—This will record only what happens in the game, even if the game is minimized on your computer.

, Depending on which source you chose, a menu will come up containing a few settings specific to that source. These can be left at default unless you want to hide your mouse by clicking the check box at the top of the menu or change the brightness in the video using the slider in the center of the menu.


Click “OK” in the bottom right after reviewing these settings.

, Recording video is a memory-consuming task for a computer. If you do not have a machine capable of recording and processing graphics at the same time, then it is recommended to turn your game settings down to accommodate the memory being used to record video.


If your computer is capable of recording and processing graphics at the same time, you may skip this as well as the next step; however, skipping these two steps is not recommended.

, Be sure to shut down any unnecessary programs to free up as much memory as possible. This will ensure that the game will run smoothly and produce a high-quality video.

, To begin recording, click “Start Recording” at the bottom-right corner of the OBS menu.


It may take a while for the recording to actually begin and appear in the preview window.

, Once the recording has begun, open the World of Warcraft window and start playing.

, To end the recording, click the “Stop Recording” button that replaces “Start Recording.”

, Many videos contain content that is unnecessary, such as the character standing around waiting while the player is setting things up. These segments can be edited out to condense the file and make the video more interesting. This can be done using video-editing software that is included with the Windows OS, such as Windows Movie Maker.


Open Windows Movie Maker and select the box that reads “Click here to browse videos and photos.”
Select the footage you would like to edit, and click “Open” in the bottom-right corner.
Play the video, and when you see the beginning of the part you would like to cut, select the “Split” button on the bottom right of the video preview. This will split the video into sections.
Continue playing the video until the end of the part you wish to remove. Then select “Split” again.
Select the section in the middle that was just created, then hit Backspace on your keyboard to delete it.

Determine which of the Death Knight's damaging abilities require 1 or more runes.,
Arrange those abilities into a rotation or priority system so you can use the most abilities in the shortest amount of time.

,
Identify those abilities that use runic power and select the 2 or 3 best abilities for your spec.,
Finalize your rotation with abilities that use runes, followed by those that consume the runic power generated.,
Use abilities that provide a useful effect other than damage.,
Set up key-binds or macros for your most frequently-used abilities.,
Find gear upgrades while questing and grouping up with other players for dungeons.",How to Play a Death Knight,"


Death Knights begin with 2 of each type of rune: Blood, Frost and Unholy.
After a rune has been used, it will be unavailable, or on ""cooldown,"" for 10 seconds.
Nearly all abilities that require runes also build runic power, the second resource for Death Knights.;
,,


For instance, a Death Knight with most of his talent points in the Unholy tree may choose to use Death Coil as his primary runic power ability, since that tree offers a boost to that particular ability.
Death Knights specialized in player-vs-player (PvP) combat will probably prefer to save their runic power for an ability like Hungering Cold.

,


You can, and should, test your ability rotation on a training dummy, located in most major cities.
Look for holes in the rotation where no runes are available and your runic power is insufficient to power any other ability.

,


For instance, the Chains of Ice ability slows down a target for a short period, which can be helpful for a Death Knight in PvP.
The Death Grip ability pulls an enemy to you, allowing you to save less-armored players or control an enemy that is otherwise difficult to position.
Practice these abilities while questing and in battlegrounds to become proficient.

, The time it takes to find an ability on your hot bar, or to move your hand to the mouse so that you can click an ability, can be the difference between failure and success, especially for a Death Knight in PvP.

,


Your primary stats are Strength and Stamina and you should never be wearing any armor type other than plate.
The typical Death Knight spec will benefit most from a two-handed weapon such as an axe, mace or sword. Rarely will you encounter a problem  with the appropriate stats for your class.

Choose gathering professions.,
Go to the Outlands/Northrend.,
Get better gear.,
Get the add-on ""Auctioneer."",
Play the Auction House.,
Do Level mining.,
Sell high level gear.",How to Make Gold in World of Warcraft," These allow you to collect the materials (""mats"") that other players use to make items. The best professions to harvest these mats are skinning, herbalism, mining and enchanting (for disenchanting). Make sure to also pick up fishing and cooking which do not count against your two-profession limit. Maybe once you level up your skills, drop a profession and take up blacksmithing, leatherworking, or jewel crafting and create some stuff! However, gathering professions rule all, although a lot of money can be made through trade professions, gathering profs. still remain the key to many of the rich players' success.;
, Because of the enormous costs for flying mounts, Blizzard designed this Burning Crusade world to make you a lot more gold than you can get from Azeroth. However, at this point it may be better to simply stay in Azeroth until you hit level 60 because Blizzard recently upgraded quest money and exp rewards in Azeroth. Once in the Outlands, make sure to begin farming elemental motes. These are used to create primal which are required for Burning Crusade crafting and people pay enormous sums for them on the auction house. The same applies for Northrend, where Eternals will go for a higher price due to people's laziness.


Rather than spending your money on new items at the AH (auction house), go run an instance, you will get new gear, complete quests, and save plenty of gold.

, Instead of completing every quest you can while in Outlands/Northrend/Cataclysm/Pandaria leveling up, run instances to get better gear, a decent amount of money and save the quests for when you are at level 90 when most quests instead of giving a 2 gold reward will give as much as 23 gold per quest. This is very profitable if you have not completed quests in the higher level zones as you can make close to 3000 gold per zone.


At level 80, a good way of making money is getting a character to go to Wintergrasp and farm 2x eternal earth eternal fire and eternal shadow. Then buy some Saronite bars off the auction house and get an alchemist to transmute them into titanium bars, now you have the mats for 2x titan steel bars, these sell for 150g up. So go to Dalaran and /2 ""want to buy titan steel CD for mats + 20g"" there you have it. Also if you can, take a miner to farm the eternals in wintergrasp because you can find some nice deposits there.

, This can automatically tell you the best price to sell anything at the Auction House. Then run instances, collecting greed loot and sell them at the auction house. You will find that things like shadow gem and malachite can sell for up to 3 gold each for rich characters who need items quickly.

, One of the greatest ways to make gold is to simply work the Auction House. Generally, you always go by the principle ""buy low, sell high,"" but it sometimes takes a bit more than that. You'll need to research what items sell well, what time of day/week they sell the highest, and just how much of an item your server has in stock. Generally, you'll want to invest in trade items. Alternatively, some of the best items to flip for profit on the Auction House are TCG mounts. There are addons that can assist you in your endeavors, such as Tycoon and Tradeskillmaster.

, Then jewel crafting. Then fishing. JC isn't that profitable at first, but once you have a ton of JC cuts from doing JC dailies or prospecting titanium ore the money just rolls in, cutting for tips in trade or buying uncut gems from excess triumphs or since 4.0.1 justice points, the cash just rolls in. Fishing- once you have leveled fishing to 450, find a secluded spot in wintergrasp, and just fish away, all the fish you get, is used for Fish Feast. Sometimes sculpin, and salmon sell for up to 70g a stack at times. Another great way to make dough off fish is dragonfin, those almost always sell at 50g a stack too depending on your server.

, Max level players are always in the market to improve their item level through the use of crafted gear, which is sometimes easier to get, and has better stats than those of raid gear (especially LFR). Advertising in trade can give you quick money.

, You can do this by right clicking the magnifying glass icon on the map in your upper right-hand corner and choosing ""Find Herbs"". This will allow you to see where all the herbs near you are located.

, It sounds simple, but this activity does take some diligence. It is easy to get focused on questing and leveling, but make sure that you take your time to pick your herbs as well.

, There are bags that can be purchased in game that will only hold herbs. While they will only hold herbs, they are going to have many slots available to do so. It is far better to have enough slots for herbs than to have to destroy them when you start accumulating drops, things you want to sell and quest items.

, If you are a journeyman herbalist, you are not going to be able to gather herbs once you have topped out your skill until you go to see a trainer. Going to see a trainer means that you will not have to pass up great herbs that you see.

You can boost any character that is currently level 1–89. Boosted characters receive bags, a small amount of gold, and basic armor and weapons.
If the character you boost is level 60 or higher, you will also get 600 skill in two primary professions.

“Bark” in Trade Chat.",How to Make Money with Enchanting in World of Warcraft," Each expansion has its own max level enchantments (enchants, for short). You’ll want to concentrate on these and on cosmetic enchants. Max level enchants are those which max level characters use to enhance their gear. Cosmetic enchants change the appearance of gear. It’s best to concentrate on these two types because they are in the most demand. To find out the current max level enchants, open your Professions tab, click on “Enchanting,” and sort by “Level, descending.” The top listed recipes will be max level enchantments.
, You’ll note that the max level enchants for each expansion use similar materials—that’s because new materials will be introduced during the expansion as well. Make a list of the materials used to create this expansion’s max level enchantments. The materials you’ll need are listed in the recipes in your Professions tab, which can be opened by hitting “K.”, Most materials for creating enchantments will be obtainable through disenchanting pieces of gear and weapons that you obtain from questing or drops. However, some may require purchase from special vendors or from other crafters. The easiest way to determine the source of a material is to look it up on the official Blizzard website., In order to maximize your profits, you’ll want to get your materials as cheaply as possible. The easiest and cheapest way to gather materials is to disenchant the gear and weapons you don’t need. These may come from quest rewards, gear you’ve replaced with higher level gear, and items you gather from monsters that doesn’t outlevel your current gear. Open your Professions tab, select the item, and then select “Disenchant.” You’ll receive enchanting materials in exchange for destroying the item., You may find that you don’t have enough materials from disenchanting the gear you’ve gathered. That’s okay. Many players list gear and weapons they don’t need on the Auction House for very low prices. Head to a major city and visit an Auction House. There, browse current expansion armor and weapons by price. By now, you should have a good idea of what to expect from different types of gear, so you can purchase gear at low prices that will provide you with the materials you need., If there are additional materials you require, whether from vendors or other crafters, now is the time to purchase them. Take a look at the materials you’ve already gathered and cross reference them with the recipes in your Professions tab. That way, you’ll be able to purchase just enough of what you need to complete some items to sell., You’ll only want to make a couple of each enchantment to begin, because you want to see which sell the fastest and for the best prices, since they use similar materials to create. For example, you may find a particular enchantment is popular with tank characters and is priced more highly as a result—but they don’t sell as quickly, because there aren’t as many players choosing to tank versus DPS., Go to a major city and visit the Auction House. Click the auctioneer to open the Auction House menu. Before placing your items for sale, use the search function in the menu to search each enchantment and sort by lowest price. As long as the lowest price still nets you a profit, post your items for 1 copper lower than that price. Do this by opening the Sell tab in the Auction House user interface and right-clicking the item you wish to sell. Enter the desired sell price and the amount of time you want the auction to be active (12–48 hours).

If you’re going to be checking frequently, 12 hours is best because you can adjust prices accordingly if the item doesn’t sell. If you’re about to log off, set the time longer so the item stays up for the maximum amount of time.
If someone purchases your item, you’ll receive mail containing your gold.

, In addition to placing items on the Auction House, use your time in major cities (for example, if you’re waiting for a group to form for a raid or other activity) to sell your wares in trade chat. Click in the chat pane entry field at the bottom and type “/trade” with a space after. Any text you enter after this point will be displayed for those watching trade chat. You can then list the items you have for sale, along with (if you can afford it) a discount price lower than items on the Auction House. You can also offer to make other enchantments for which you have the materials. If a player takes you up on it, join a group with them and choose a place to meet. Create the enchantment they’ve requested, and right-click on the player to open a trade window. They’ll add gold and you can add your enchantment."

Make sure you acquire all of your portal spells as soon as you're the appropriate level.,

Use this macro as SOON as you enter ANY major city.,
When you get a message for a port, find out where the person is located and determine what you want to do.,
As often as you can, just let the person tip.,
Use your macro as soon as you enter a new zone.",How to Make Money as a Mage in World of Warcraft," The major portals are going to be (Stormwind/Orgrimmar, Ironforge/Thunderbluff, Shattrath and Dalaran) The other portals aren't going to be needed much by others, but they'll still benefit you.;
, An example of this would be: ""WTS ports to any of the major cities. SW,IF,Darn,Exodar,Shatt,Dal. I only charge if I have to come to you. PST if interested.""

, Use it in trade chat. Chances are, over the course of your errands, you'll get at least 1 message asking for a port.

, Invite him to your party right away in case he finds someone else. When you invite him, it sort of seals the deal so to speak because they'd have to leave your party in order to join someone else.

Even if you have to travel to the person, you have an epic mount (hopefully) and the reagents for 1 teleport rune and 1 portal (a rune to teleport to his city if he's not in your own, and a portal) are only going to cost you 30 silver, depending on your reputation with the faction you purchase from. So, this being said you should charge him no more than 2 gold because you're still going to make a 1 G 70 S profit off of the port.







, If the person is over level 70 there is a good chance that they'll fork over a whopping 5 g. That might not seem like a lot, but considering the fact that you're doing very little and getting handed money, makes it worth it.

, Use it again every 10 minutes or so, so that you're not annoying the other people that are playing. (5 minutes is too often) This will keep reminding people who are questing, that they have ports available as long as you're there.


This is not to offend anyone, but most people who play WoW are either lazy or they are wanting to save time. Ports are an easy way for them to do that. People won't know that you're offering unless you put your name out there. USE YOUR MACRO!
There will unfortunately come a time where you will be tempted ruin someone's day because they're either being rude to you; referring to you as ""Mage"", demanding food and/or water, or not tipping, or worse...tipping you 1 copper. (which I have had happen) You'll be tempted to either, teleport to their city of choice, leaving them stranded there, OR send them to an entirely different city altogether. (Exodar instead of Stormwind) DON'T do this. This is funny overall, and would seem like justice served. But it could come back to bite you. It would be very easy for that person to sully your name over trade chat, which could in turn neuter your business. Reputation is everything.

Know your dots.,
Use your map.,
Sell your stuff.,
Know your specialty shops.,
Check prices.,
Get higher levels to get more money.,
Beware of the wilderness.,
Know about death.,
Use your bank at all times.",How to Understand RuneScape as a Beginner," The circle map in the right hand corner of your screen will give you a bird's eye view of what is happening around you.


Yellow dots are NPCs (non-player characters) or monsters.
Red dots are items on the ground. They could be anything from bones to things dropped from players & monsters. Many items, such as bowls and runes, have re-spawn places; meaning that if they are taken by someone, they come back at the same point after a certain amount of time.
White dots are players. The white square represents your own character, while white circles are other players in the game.
Green dots are players in your friend's list.;
, As a new player, you will be unfamiliar with your surroundings. That's what maps are for! Use the one you are given during the tutorial until you can easily find your way around. You'll be surprised at how helpful a good map can be!

, Just like the real world, money makes the RuneScape world go around. You can sell just about anything you catch or make to stores, other players, or at the Grand Exchange. A good way to practice is killing chickens in Lumbridge.

, The general store will buy just about anything, but if you try to sell a cooked chicken to ""Bob's Brilliant Axes"", you'll be out of luck. If you get an item a specialty shop will buy, you might be able to get a better price for it there than at the general store.

, You can sell or trade items to other players in the game, but always be sure you do not get ripped off. A good way to check is to swiftly double check the official RuneScape Grand Exchange webpage, located through here. Know that prices do change every day, especially on items that are in demand. You may also find that for certain items, higher-level players will pay even more than the normal prices. It's definitely worth looking out for opportunities like this.

, The more skilled you are at a craft, the more money you can make by selling the things you create by cooking, crafting, mining, or other skills.

, North of Varrock is the wilderness, where players can attack the other. If you're new, some players might lure you into the wilderness so they can attack you. Don't go unless you are prepared and it's good advice to leave any equipment that you don't want to lose in the bank.

, Death occurs when a player loses all of their life points. Respawn points are typically Lumbridge, Edgeville, or other cities if you have completed quests. At any time, a player can choose up to 3 items that they are carrying at the moment to keep with them after they respawn. All other items, worn or in the inventory, will be dropped on the ground and can be available to any player that is present.

, If you do not need something you have, bank it. It's wise to keep majority or all of your money in your bank if you are not buying or selling items.

Log in to both accounts.,
Meet and trade.,
Know the non-member limit.,
Bypass the limit with overpriced item sales.,
Avoid other sneaky methods.",How to Transfer Items in RuneScape1," You'll need to use one of these three methods to log onto both accounts at once:


Use two computers, logging on to one account on each. This is the recommended method.
Use two browsers on the same computer (such as Firefox and Chrome). This may or may not work.
Have a friend log in to your account. Do this at your own risk. Even a short session is technically against the rules, and could result in a ban on both accounts.;
, Have both avatars meet in the same location, anywhere you like. While controlling one account, right-click the other person and click ""Trade."" Switch to the other computer or browser and accept the trade. Arrange whichever item transfer you like.


This does not have to be a two-way trade. You can give a gift from one account to another.

, Ever since February 2011, the RuneScape terms of service have allowed players to transfer items between accounts.However, there is still a trade limit for certain accounts. If your account has never had a paid membership activated and was created after November 2011, it cannot transfer more than 25K worth of items or gold at once.Activating the membership once will permanently remove the trade limit, even if you let membership expire. There is no way to remove the limit without paying real money.

, Try this if you are transferring a large amount of money from an account with a trade limit. While you cannot trade items directly, you can sell the items on one account, transfer the gold with this method, then buy the items on the second account. Be aware that you do risk losing the money if you are careless or unlucky. Follow these steps carefully:Log on to the account that wants to get the gold.
Check for a worthless item in the Grand Exchange. There must be zero of these items for sale. If there are only a few cheap ones for sale, buy them all.
List one of those items for sale in the Grand Exchange. Demand a price equal to the amount you want to transfer from your other account.
Log out, then log in to the account that wants to give the gold.
Place a buy order for the same item and the exact same amount. The Exchange should automatically connect the two of you and make the trade..
There's a small chance that someone figures out what you're doing and places his own sell order, causing him to get your money. Place your orders quickly to reduce the chance of this happening.

, Do not try to use other methods of bypassing the trade limit. Most of these have been blocked as a way to fight gold farming. Dropping the items (or gold) or killing the ""player"" holding them may permanently destroy the loot. This includes the ""table"" exploit, which no longer works.Coordinating between multiple accounts to rig a minigame is against game rules. It may result in a ban.

Click the Combat Settings tab and select Revolution combat mode. Now your character will choose combat abilities automatically. You'll probably be killing thousands of enemies. Making it automatic will save a ton of time.;
, In the same menu, look for the Melee Combat Experience section. Choose one of the following:Choose ""Balance"" to split between XP between Strength, Attack, and Defence. This is the easiest approach.
Choose ""Strength"" to train Strength three times faster, while ignoring Attack and Defence. This will make combat more difficult.
Note that no matter what you choose, ¼ of your combat XP will go toward Constitution. There is no way to change this.

, The faster you can kill enemies, the faster you gain XP. Strength and Attack potions are excellent, cheap options to speed up your training. Defence potions and plenty of food will save time as well, since you'll need to go back to town less often.


Swordfish and anchovy pizza are two excellent, cheap options for free-to-play players who need healing.

, There are several skills that can help you take on tougher enemies. If you're training Strength past level 60 or 70, these can make training much faster and more survivable:


Train Prayer to get access to powerful abilities. You can do this by burying monster bones or scattering demon ashes. Members can train faster through several other methods, notably the Bonecrusher and Ectofuntus., If you're a member and can afford familiar pouches, train your Summoning skill as you fight by summoning familiars. Certain familiars give Strength XP as they fight. The amount of XP depends on how you chose to divide your Melee Combat Experience, and the level of the monster. Here are the best lower-level options that focus on Strength:Desert wyrm (Summoning level 18)
Compost mound (level 28)
Honey badger (level 32)
Pyrelord (level 46)

, Head northwest of Falador to reach Burthorpe, and north of Burthorpe to reach the Abandoned Mines. These are filled with Trolls that are easy to kill and respawn quickly. After a little training, you should be able to kill these in one hit each. This is easily the best spot to train until level 20, and remains a great, easy option for many characters until level 40.


Players with other good combat-relevant skills may want to move on to more difficult enemies after level 20 or 30, such as Minotaurs or Barbarians.

, Visit the Stronghold of Security to kill Flesh Crawlers and Giant Spiders. After level 45 or 50, move on to Moss Giants in the Varrock Sewers., These enemies are the best XP-farming monsters available to free players. Hellhounds in Forinthry Dungeon are weak to slashing weapons, while deadly red spiders are weak to crushing weapons.You can continue to train with these enemies up to level 99 and beyond, but it will get extremely slow at higher levels.


For more variety, fight in the Clan Wars free for all in World 3.This requires high Combat stats and moderate skill to make it a more effective training method, but it's certainly more fun than your ten thousandth hellhound.

, Members can talk to Slayer Masters and accept requests to kill certain monsters, earning Slayer XP in addition to Combat XP. This is less efficient at raising your Strength, but at high levels (especially Combat and Slayer 80+), you'll have access to Slayer-only monsters with very profitable drops.To double Slayer points, complete the Smoking Kills quest. This is the sixth quest in the Desert series, which you can begin by talking to Ozan in Draynor Village.
Get quick, easy assignments from Mazchna in northeast Canifis.Every 10th and 50th Slayer task gets you bonus points. Maximize this by accepting harder tasks from higher-level Slayers, like Duradel in Shilo Village.
If you get assigned a monster that's too hard or resistant to melee (and therefore bad for Strength training), talk to Turael in Taverly to replace it with an easy assignment. This assignment will not award any points, and will reset your tasks completed back to zero.

, Members and free-to-play players alike love the sights of the Burthorpe mines. One hit kills, constantly respawning enemies, and plentiful experience: what's not to love?

, Visit Rellekka and talk to Brundt the Chieftain in his longhall. This will start the Fremennik Trials quest. This can take a while, but you'll be rewarded with 2,800 Strength XP, and will unlock a new area perfect for the next round of training.


This should be doable with Combat level 40+. If your Attack and Defence are much lower than your Strength, you may need to buff them with potions for portions of this quest.

, Walk to the west pier of Rellekka and talk to Jorvald. Ask to visit Waterbirth Island. There are many rock crabs in this area. They do not show up on the minimap and look like ordinary rocks, but they will attack once you approach.


The nearest banks are a ways away, in Camelot or Keldagrim.Bring plenty of food, and supplement it with the edible seaweed found in the area., This is a good, risk-free training method for anyone with a Combat level 50 or higher. On world 53 or 69 (or anywhere if you can find other players), visit Port Sarim, south of Falador, and go to the second boat from the south. Talk to the Squire, and agree to visit the Void Knight's Outpost. Once the minigame starts, try to destroy all enemy portals, or keep your Void Knight alive for twenty minutes.


While you only get half XP from enemies in this game, each success grants commendations which can be traded in for additional XP. Trade in 100 at a time for a 10% bonus.
You do not lose any items for dying in this minigame. You'll still want to protect yourself with the best armor you can wear, since you'll be under constant assault.
Intermediate and Advanced versions of the minigame open up at Combat level 100 and 150, allowing you to train more quickly.

, Paid members have many high-level options available, and often choose to train past level 80 and 90 by completing other, combat-based goals. For example, complete Slayer challenges, fight through dungeons, or kill Dust Devils and Frost Dragons to make money."

Learn the limitations.,
Log on to both accounts.,
Trade as usual.",How to Transfer Items in RuneScape2," There are few restrictions on transferring items in the 2007 version of Runescape. Be aware of the following:


Accounts cannot give away any items or gold until the account is 24 hours old, or until the account becomes a paid member. Any items dropped will only be visible to that account. If the avatar is killed, only one of each item in the inventory will drop, including just one coin.Bots or accounts that use automated software may be banned. Anyone trading with them may be banned.

, You'll probably have to use two different computers to do this. You may be able to get away with using two browsers, such as Firefox and Chrome, but this will not always work.


You could get a friend to log on to one of your accounts. This is against the terms of service, and there are no protections to stop your friend stealing the account or items on it.

You could also head to East Ardougne and steal from the cake stall. Keep the cakes so when a guard attacks you, you can heal hp. This should take slightly longer due to the guards.

, From level 25 to 40 you should pickpocket warrior women. Walk just left of the market in East Ardougne to find these guys (girls).

Now you'll be running pretty low on arrows, no matter all the hide and feathers you collected sells instantly on G.E and you will have a good 30k to spend on arrows.,
Now it's barbarians till 40; now you may be thinking minotaurs all the way, however minotaurs are dead boring to train on and really slow so I recommend barbarians all the way!

,
You'll now be thinking that Hill Giants are the best and you should train on them; however you are once again wrong ; instead, you should train on flesh crawlers standing in the safe spot (look at pic) until you reach 50 range.,
Next comes the most boring part of training; however you have two options.,
Now its either Ice giants or Moss giants.","How to Make, Train, and Pk on a Runescape Mage Pure",";

,, Remember to get the fire runes as they come in near 50s at a time. Also get green leather chaps/vambraces.

, White knights or Hill giants. It really comes down to whether you are in need of cash or not because quick exp is White knights since most people are already Hill giants but for cash its Hill giants all the way because of their big bones. So train on them till 60-65 range.

, Again, it depends if you want cash or exp since moss giants are good for cash and Ice giants for exp.


Congratulations on 75 range!!! Now it's the most frustrating/satisfying part of your journey since it takes FOR EVER to get 99 range; however every time you level you think oof!! 5 more levels to go. So its off to lesser demons for you making sure you have food and mith arrows for the best profit/exp.
99 range- CONGRATULATIONS!! You can now go murder anyone & everyone in PVP!!

Choose rare items.,
Buy new items.,
Merchant speculative items.",How to Merchant in RuneScape1," Rare items such as party hats, Halloween masks and Santa hats have appeal because they are only available in a finite quantity. These items disappear every day as more players lose them and retire from playing.;
, New items are good for short-term trades because finding a true price on the Grand Exchange (GE) takes a while. Also, merchants can easily sell new items at a premium to players who want to have the latest thing.

, If merchants are working together to drive up the price of an item, don't buy in unless the items has skilling value or value as a weapon or armor. Only trade speculative items for the short term, because many people will jump in and drive up profits, but the price fall when everyone sells will be precipitous.

"
"
Choose items with multiple uses.,
Consider supply and demand.,
Pick an item that allows you to invest a significant amount of capital.,
Balance your patience with the item's volatility.",How to Merchant in RuneScape2," For instance, a yew log can yield experience points for buyers who want to stretch bows, or it can be used to make fires. Items with more flexible uses will always be in demand.

, You want to trade items that people cannot access as easily, but you also want to avoid low supplies of rare items. Also, you want items that everyone needs, not just items for a niche of highly-skilled players.

, Because buy limits will only allow you to purchase a certain number of items per day, buy something that is more expensive as opposed to a cheaper item. A 5 percent return on 1,000GP is not as high as a 5% return on 10,000 GP. Just be sure not to spend all of your assets on 1 item.

, If you want to buy and hold, pick items that rise gradually in price. If you want to take a risk, buy an item that fluctuates rapidly in price. Just remember that more volatility means both more chance for wealth and more risk for loss.

"
"
Use price averaging.,
Buy high-value items below price.,
Sell high-value items above price.,
Buy single commodities to test prices.,
Use odd pricing.,
Set a price floor.,
Specialize in a few items.,
Set a hedge.,
Flip.",How to Merchant in RuneScape3," Order some of an item at 99GP, some at 97GP and some at 95GP. If the price goes up and you flip the item, you'll make a bigger profit overall.

, Set orders starting at 5 percent below the GE price. Slowly increase your offer until someone bites. You'll find out the floor price for which others will sell the item, and you'll save GP.

, Set your price at 5 to 10 percent percent above the GE price. Then, drop it gradually until someone makes the buy.

, For example, buy 1 lobster and test the price instead of buying 100 lobsters before you know the direction that prices will go.

, Most people will set prices on even numbers, like 20,000GP. If you set your price at 19,997GP, you'll beat their offer. If you're lowering your offer on an item that you want to sell, always lower it in odd increments.

, If you have enough extra GP and one of your items starts to free-fall in price, then make a huge order for the item to stop the price from decreasing. Then, when you've cornered the market, sell your items gradually to avoid causing the price to drop dramatically again.

, Don't always try to guess what the hottest item will be. Get to know 2 or 3 items and become familiar with their price ranges. For those items, you'll be able to spot a good deal quickly.

, When you invest in a certain item at 150GP, keep buy orders in the exchange at 140GP and sell offers at 180GP. When your buy or sell offer hits, you'll be able to predict the path that prices are headed, and you can decide whether to sell out quickly or whether to keep buying.

, Choose an item that will go higher in price on the GE site. Buy it between -5% en the GP price. Now wait a little bit. When the items are loaded, you can put it on your bank for 2 or more days. Sell it at GP between the GP price and the +5% price. Wait and take your profit. Good luck!

Get the Skillcape of Cooking while making RuneScape Gold!,
Take certain things into consideration:


Time is money: The more a hurry you are to get the cape, the less time you have.,
Do not burn fish.",How to Make Money on RuneScape Powerleveling Cooking,"


In the old days of RuneScape, cooking was a skill that was not often taken into consideration by players marketing raw and cooked fish. Not to mention back then autoers and bots were rampant so there was a glut in the raw fish market. With the introduction of the Grand Exchange and banning of bots, raw fish increased in price.
Should a RuneScape player seek to power level cooking, he can expect to lose between 15-60 RuneScape gold per fish. However, with a little RuneScape game knowledge and merchanting skills, it is still possible to get a cooking skillcape without losing RuneScape gold.;
, Time can be turned to your advantage both in acquiring food and timing your buying and selling of food.
Being wealthy helps: Being wealthy allows you flexibility in that you can afford to hold on to large amounts of cooked fish until the best time for selling.
Know your limits: Know how much of each type of fish you need to cook and how much you can cook on a given day. That way you can adjust your buying to minimize risk. (Please refer to Table 2 at the end of this article.)
Fishing helps. Fishing can take time to train, but the way to make the most money en route to level 99 cooking and the cooking skillcape is to catch the fish.

, Know what levels you can safely cook fish at. Cooking Gauntlets decrease your chance of burning fish, allow you to reach no-burn at a lower level, and allow for no burn of shark. Cooking Gauntlets are a reward from the Family Crest quest. (See Table 1.)

Know the requirements: Rune Hatchet.",How to Make Money in RuneScape as a Member11," As you progress your Woodcutting level, it is highly recommended that you upgrade your hatchet as well. Depending on what you choose to do, it's best to make money while doing this to get better hatchets.

Level 1-15: Cut regular Logs. This will take a while because you have just started. Don't buy an iron hatchet as it is a waste of money and will not make much of a difference
Level 15-30: Cut Oak Logs. You earn around 1,000 gold from Oak Logs. Use a Mithril Hatchet when you get to level 21 in Woodcutting. Get ready to use the Adamant Hatchet at level 31.
Level 30-60: Cut Willow logs. Willow logs are fast exp, but their locations aren't normally quiet. You won't make much money with these trees, but enough to buy a Rune Hatchet (requires 41 Woodcutting). You can get magic seeds worth up to 150,000gp from birds nests here. Skip cutting down maples. These become available at level 45, but they are slow to cut down and not as good money per hour as willows.
Levels 60-99: You can start cutting down Yews. But it will be rather slow to get a full inventory. Instead, you should stick with Willows until 75 woodcutting, as they have fast experience.
Level 68-75: You are now at the level to chop Choking Ivy. It's not very slow; this is the best way to get experience, but not money. You can start on this at any level (68 or above). (This is a very good strategy for those that would like to get a few levels in one night).
Level 60-75: At 61 Woodcutting, you are able to use a Dragon Hatchet which costs around quite a bit of money. Begin cutting Yew Logs. The recommended place to cut being Seers' Village just south of the Flax field.
Levels 75-90: Cut Magic Logs between these levels. It is highly recommended that you use a dragon hatchet. If you can't afford it, then stick with the Rune Hatchet. Magic Logs can be very slow to cut at the required level. If you want to, stay with the yew trees until around 85-90. Magic logs have a profit of 1.3k each, and the best way for making money for members with Woodcutting. As of the 27/5/10 (DD/MM/YY), magic logs are roughly 1500 gp each on the Grand Exchange, but can increase or decrease depending on the time.
Levels 90-99: Cut Elder Logs. Not only are they a decent source of 500k+ gp per hour, but they are also extremely AFK. Just start cutting an elder tree and you will not have to pay attention to your screen for 5 minutes. Elder Logs sell for around 4000 gp each.

, If you have not completed Love Song, and don't have access to this teleport, use the Trollheim teleport. If you don't have access to this either, use the Burthrope home teleport and climb the mountain.





, This is done by killing the followers of each god. These are automatically aggressive unless you are wearing a piece of equipment specific to that god. You need to kill 40 minions of the desired boss to continue, along with 70 agility, constitution, strength, an attack for Armadyl, Zamorak, Bandos, and Saradomin respectively.

, The most profitable is Armadyl, with the Armadyl hilt and crossbow being very expensive, but also very hard. Bandos is the easiest boss, and gives you the least valuable drops. Pick whatever suits you best."

Study the Grand Exchange prices every day.,
Use supercompost on every single patch you have.,
Learn about the farmer payments and use them as much as you can.,
Do herb runs as much as possible.,
Time your farming and adjust your runs according to your real life schedule.",How to Make Money Farming in RuneScape," This will give you the most efficient method on what profit or loss you will make on each farming run depending on if you purchase your seeds from the Grand Exchange, a seed shop, or a monster drop.;
, Supercompost decreases the chance of a diseased patch, as well a chance of more harvest. Supercompost is more expensive than regular compost, but well worth it.

, Farmer payments are items and foods that you give a nearby farmer to watch over your patch. This way, you don't have to run back and forth every 20 or so minutes to check up and water your patch, as they do it for you. However, there is still a chance of a patch getting diseased.

, Herb runs are the most profitable method in the farming skill. Know that if you do not have the herblore level to clean them, sell them on the Grand Exchange as the grimy version. A lot of herbs sell for more as grimy than clean.

, It may sound confusing, but every time you log out of the game, the growing time will be extended more. Waiting for patches that takes a short time, such as allotments, herbs, and flowers can be successful if you're doing another skill, such as crafting, combat, woodcutting, etc. Patches that take a prolong time, such as trees can be planted in the morning and harvested late at night. You can even leave your farm runs there overnight, provided that a farmer is watching over them.


If you're planning to stay logged in for the time being, a countdown timer program is always helpful. Set the timers according to the patch timing until it can be harvested (80 minutes for herbs, etc).

, The bones will eventually replace your food slots, this is when you use one of the tablets to get peaches. This allows you to stay for long periods of time.

, These can sell for up to 3k each! After a couple of hours you can pay off all your equipment and then some.

"
Train your woodcutting.,
Go to world 1.,
Pick your spot.,
Store them in a bank.,
Sell them in the Grand Exchange - not anywhere else.",How to Make Money in RuneScape with Yew Logs," In order to cut yew logs, you have to get your woodcutting to at least 63 because it takes lot of time to cut yew logs if try when your woodcutting level is only 60.

To get your woodcutting from 1-20, cut down normal trees south of the Grand Exchange, bank them, and sell them after you reach 20 woodcutting. Normal logs sell at a very fast rate.



 


To get your woodcutting from 20-40, cut down oak trees west of the general store in Lumbridge. They sell a bit slower and are priced lower, but it is worth it to sell them and make decent money.






To get your woodcutting from 40-60 (other methods are 40-65, 40-80, and 40-99), cut willows south of Draynor, and bank them. Once you get to level 80 woodcutting, sell every willow log you have in the Grand Exchange. You can also cut them east of the Lumbridge general store and when you get a full inventory, sell them at the general store. Because the nearest bank is far away, it is not worth the time to rush to the bank and come back to the spot here.






As you improve your woodcutting level, buy better hatchets to increase your rate of speed. The profit you make from woodcutting level 1 to 60 can buy you a steel, mithril, adamant, and rune hatchets all at once.





;
, The yews respawn the fastest in that world (60 seconds) But there is a disadvantage if you go world 1 there will be a lot of people who are cutting yews too. Other good worlds to go to are worlds 3 and 4.

, The best places to go are east of the Grand Exchange (there are three yews there), near the church in Varrock, and south of Falador. The one west of Lumbridge is good too but there are no banks nearby. The best for members is south of seers village. Bank in catherby bank. This is usually really crowded but there is a way you can get past that. Go to the runescape homepage and at the top click a German flag. Then the site will be German. Click the play button and when you get to the login screen go to the world select. Click the members world with the least amount of people. When I play runescape on these worlds there are usually 10-20 people on a server. VERY good. Click that and there will most likely be no one there.

, It wouldn't be wise to sell it directly in the Grand Exchange. Wait until you have a certain amount that you want. Good choices are 500 (235.5k), 1k (507k), 2k (1.014m), 3k (1.521m), 5k (2.535m), 10k (5.07m), 25k (12.675m), 50k (25.35m), 100k (50.7m), 500k (253.5m), and 1m (507m).

, The general store rips you off by a ton (you can only sell it for about 100gp when there is none), and there is no woodcutting shop in F2P.

Then go to the bank in east Varrock and bank all your redberries. Keep doing that until you have 100-1000 redberries.

Mining: Get your mining level to 40 and your crafting level to 40.,
Smithing: If you want to make your own armor and sell the extras for profit, then this step is the one for you.,

Woodcutting: This, by far, is one of the best ways to make money if you are a newbie.,
Combat: This is the hardest to explain.,
Air Rune Running: Complete Rune Mysteries Quest.,
Crafting: Get your mining (mine lots of iron), smithing (smelt and smith the iron), and crafting (get cow hides in the field by Lumbridge, put it in the bank and when you get around 500, tan them and make them into the best leather item you can) up to level 40.",How to Make Money in RuneScape Using Skills," Get an Addy pick unless your mining is 50+ {then use rune}. Grab a Brown Apron and go to the crafting guild and mine the gold rocks there. Make sure that you are on a world with not many people on it. When you have mined the rocks and your inventory is full, store your gold ore to the Eastern Falador Bank. When you have reached 1K gold ore, go to the Grand Exchange and sell the Gold Ore for 500ea. If you have done this correctly, you should now have 500K. Repeat this has many times as desired, though it might take some time to do this.;
, Start by mining tin and copper like the other people do it. Smelt it into bronze and smith the bar into the best item that you can make. When your mining and smithing level is 15, start SMELTING iron, but don't smith it until that you can make iron scimitars. Keep smithing bronze because you will get more xp from bronze platebodies than from iron daggers, axes, swords, med helms, and maces. I usually just drop the bronze stuff rather than try to sell it because so few people want bronze. Keep this pattern until you get to the steel bars. By this time you should start to sell the items that you made because more people will buy steel than iron or bronze. Keep THIS pattern until you get to the adamant bars. When your mining and smithing level reaches 70, you should always smelt the adamant ore and the coal into bars because when you smith an adamant item, it will be worth more than the adamant ore itself. Keep smelting and smithing the best items and selling it for profit. By now, you should have at least 100K-300K. Now, when your mining and smithing level reaches 85, stop. Keep mining ADAMANT ore and coal because there are many revenants and level 70-100s monsters in the Wilderness Runite Mine. Just keep smithing adamant platebodies until you are really tough enough to take on the wild monsters that appear out of nowhere in the wilderness. By now, you should have at least 1M. Then your friends will be jealous of your wealthiness!

, Cook all of it, drop the burnt ones, and keep the cooked ones for future use if you are going into combat. Keep doing this, fish the best fish you can, cook and drop the burnt ones, and if you just don't feel like keeping the cooked ones, you can try to sell it at the Grand Exchange for Min or Market price. When you can fish and cook for lobsters, people will really want them in the Grand Exchange so be sure that when you have the cooked ones, sell them in the Grand Exchange. Then you should now have some money. One of the best ways to make money is getting your fishing up to 15 then getting your cooking up to 55. You will need about 20 to start off, but then go and buy as many plain pizzas as you can, and then go and fish and cook that many anchovies. Put the anchovies on the pizza and sell it at the grand exchange. You can just keep getting more and more plain pizzas and repeat the process. But this is only for members.

, Start cutting basic logs and sell then in the Grand Exchange (now G.E.) People will really want logs, so cut them until your woodcutting level reaches 15. Then start cutting oaks and sell then in the G.E. for the MIN price. Then when your woodcutting level reaches 30 , keep cutting oaks. Do NOT cut willows because no one will want them in the G.E., so keep cutting oaks until your woodcutting level reaches 60. Then, you should cut yews no matter how hard it is to get the logs from the trees. You should have a lot of money after 4 or 5 months of woodcutting, probably more than 1 or 2M.

, If you are at least level 50, you can try Fist of Guthix a minigames, found in the Wilderness. For levels 56+ try Fist of Guthix and win the tokens there and eventually you could buy a valuable item in the Reward Shop. If you are level 90-100 I prefer Bounty Hunter. for levels 100+ you can do both Fist of Guthix . If you are a level 3 newbie start by asking for free armor in Lumbridge. Pretty soon you will get it. Then train on level 2 goblins near the general store, followed by level 6 muggers, level 16 thieves, level 21 guards, level 26 jail guards, level 33 black knights, level 36 white knights, level 28 hill giants, and level 42 or 43 moss giants.

, Then grab the air talisman and start mining rune ess (25). Then get the 25 rune ess (un-noted) and go to the air temple south of Falador. Trade with a guy who says ""Open... ..."" He will trade you the amount of $ he says in the Open thing and with 25 noted rune ess. Run back to the Eastern Falador Bank and switch it to un-note rune ess. Repeat this as many times as desired and you will get a lot of money.

, Then, go to the Crafting Guild (north of Remington) at a time when there are not many people playing. You will need a Brown Apron and bring a Pick (Adamanite or Rune recommended).Mine the gold ores then deposit them at the Eastern Falador bank. Then, go back and mine. When you have 200 to 250 ores, smelt them and make them into necklaces. If you have gems, you can make an amulet out of it. Sell the necklaces ten at a time at the G.E. for 1195 GP or market price. Plain amulets are only worth about 800 GP for ten, unless it is a gem amulet. If you had 250 gold ores, you will now have about 240K. Repeat this as many times as desired. Note that you will get mining, smithing, and crafting.

, Only allow food and potions if everyone in your clan has plenty of both, which usually won't happen.

, Wait awhile to see how many players the other team has. If they have more, stay by your portal because it's a 1v1 area and they can't pile there. If your clan has more, go meet them at the middle.

, They should not have full mage clothing because the melee's will just kill them. In a multi combat area the mage should hide and when the opponent is using protect from melee prayer, attack with mage.

Complete Priest in Peril.,

Get to Barrows.,
Fight the brothers.,
Go into the crypt.,
Find your way into the Barrows chest.,
Fight the final brother.",How to Do RuneScape Barrows," This gives you access to Morytania, which is where Barrows is located. You may also want to complete In Aid of Myreque for a quicker way to get to barrows as well as a bank nearby. If you have the levels, completing Branches of Darkmeyer gives you the Draken Medallion, which after having Vanescula Draken fully unlock, can teleport you directly to barrows.


If you are playing Old-school Runescape, you will need to bring a shovel.;
, Barrows is a difficult mini-game, as it involved facing 6 level 100+ enemies in rapid succession. Have at least level 70 in your preferred combat stat along with 43 prayer. For melee, an abyssal whip with Barrows armor would be the best. For magic, full light mystic, a charged Iban's staff with fire wave would be the best. For range, a black salamander with Karil's outfit would be the best, however variations can be made. You are going to want to have a fury amulet, and ring of wealth as well for the extra loot.

, Have an emergency teleport, and two 4 dose prayer potions, the rest filled with food. You may want to include a super or extreme set to speed up kills. You are going to need to use prayer as Dharok can hit well over maximum health, as his damage is relative to his health.

, As mentioned previously, if you have Draken's Medallion fully upgraded, you can use it to teleport directly to barrows. If you have completed In Aid of Myreque, you can use the shortcut behind the bar in Canfis. Otherwise you will have to go through Mort Myre swamp and through the kelp maze, then go west through Mor'ton to get to barrows


There are ghasts that can turn your food into inedible rotten food if they attack you if you are going through the shortcut or the swamp, so be aware of them.

, The order you should fight them is Dharok, Verac, Torag, Guthans, Karil, Ahrim. This is set up to use your prayer points the most on the brother's that need them the most urgently. The order of the mounds are Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, South, then directly in the middle

, When trying to fight the brothers, one of the tombs will not have a brother and instead ask you if you would like to go into the crypt. Do not go into the crypt without killing brothers, otherwise you will lose loot.

, There will be one door that can lead to the chest in the center of the square, and it will be the only door leading to the chest with the open option. Once clicking on it, it will present you with a short puzzle that varies every time. Failing the puzzle means the maze will shift, meaning you will have to find your way around again.

, Once you click on the chest once, the final brother will appear, defeat him and loot the chest. If you thing you have enough supplies, you can retrace your steps and repeat the process, or use your teleport to get out of the crypt. Note that the longer you stay in the crypt, you will start to take damage until you leave


Occasionally the final brother will spawn before you get to the chest, however it does not spawn again when you click on the chest, so you are free to loot it.

Understand the concept of Kill Rate Often Known as KR.,
You must understand what makes a clan more likely to successful.,
Every clan should have a leader who calls piles.,
When two clans meet and clash, this often determines which clan will win or lose the fight.,
Your clan must fight as a unit to be successful.,
Make sure your clan has plenty of mages.,
Another tactic to use is DDing or standing on the turrets in the turrets map.,
Tell your clan to bring food and pots in a food-allowed battle.",How to Utilize Your Clan in Clan Wars in RuneScape," Kill Rate is the number of players on the opposing team that you kill in an amount of time. The clan with a higher kill rate than the opposing team usually wins the battle because they have wiped out more enemies in a shorter amount of time. If you want to win fights, the trick is to kill more enemies than you lose allies. In other words, get a higher kill rate than your enemy. Below I will explain how to improve KR and be more more successful at Clan Wars.;
, There are three things that the best clans have. The first is having many high levels who are experienced fighters. Who is more likely to die, a low level or high level? Having too many low levels is detrimental as it increases the opposing clan's KR. The same can be said true about inexperienced fighters who tend to die early in fights without contributing to their clan. A clan with more high levels has the potential to achieve a higher KR. The second and third most important things that every clan should have is size and superior leadership and organization. If your clan is a lot bigger than the opposing team, it lets you overwhelm your enemy which gives the enemy a very low KR since they will be piled by many people. Size is very important especially in casual purple portal fights. Superior leadership and organization is also very important for winning battles and this can be a make it or break it for your team. Below I will list some of the ways your clan have better leadership or organization.

, If you have ever been to a clan wars playoffs before, there is often someone at the start of the battle who says ""fall in"" and everybody follows that person. There should be at least 2-3 of these kind of people on your team. They should be high level, have clan wars knowledge, and be able to tank attacks from multiple people. A leaders job is to keep everybody together and call who to pile. A leader must choose wisely what to do and who to attack. That is why they have to be intelligent. The first person the leader calls to pile is very important and can even determine if your team wins or loses. Try to target someone who is by themselves and not in a giant cluster of white dots so players will clearly know who to attack. Binders also need to make sure they are constantly binding the people the leader chooses who to pile so they won't run into a cluster of white dots. Remember that piling is very important and if your teams knows how to pile well, you will win plenty of battles. You can also go for the leader first which is riskier but possibly better. More of that will be written below.

, Your clan is sure to lose if your leader is piled and killed early and your teammates scatter. This allows the enemy clan to pick players off and not lose very many people. On the other hand, this is what you want to try to do to the enemy clan. If you can get them to scatter and not work as a team, then your clan will most likely win. There are various ways to do this. One way is to get several mages to bind the enemy leader before he can call who to attack, then quickly pile the leader before he can do anything. After that swarm the place where the leader died and form a giant purple cloud. If done correctly, the enemies should scatter and give you a strong head start to winning the war. You must also make sure that your leader is not piled and this isn't done to you.

, This is a very hard thing to do and can always be improved upon. But the most important thing to learn is that your clan must stay together during the fight and do everything together. As mentioned earlier, when your clan spend the majority of a fight scattering, this will lower your KR and make it much easier for the opposing clan to kill you off. Piling is also very important and something that most F2P clans utilize. If your clan is piling someone, you pile them as well. If your clan runs north, run north as well. Do everything as a clan together. As I like to say, form a purple cloud on the mini-map. Enemy units are less likely to attack a cloud than a single dot and if they do attack, they will quickly be piled. Only run away if it is clear that the enemy clan has broken up the group. At this point, you should retreat and attempt to find other purple dots to group up with.

, Every F2P Clan Wars clan should have mages who are capable of binding. This is important because if an enemy player is trying to get away, mages can bind them and this allows them to be piled easier. Also mages can hit through rune armor fairly easily which is also very important for piling. Mages can also cast curse spells at opponents which can increase the amount of damage an enemy receives by 5% which is quite useful. A good ratio to have is 1 binder for every 6 or 7 teammates. That means for a 30 person team, there should be at least 5 binders.

, DD is when players stand on one spot. The advantages of using this method is that your players will stay together much more easier. The disadvantages is that it is more difficult to call who to pile so your team may attack random people. This method can work well if your clan doesn't have a good leader, has plenty of high levels, and if the enemy team attacks in small numbers at a time. First of all, to be successful with this method, you must make boundaries and tell each of your players not to cross those boundaries ever. This is because the whole point of DDing is to stick together and if a bunch of players start crossing the boundary, then they are going to be killed. For instance, on the turrets map tell your players not to get off of the turrets. Second of all, wipe out enemies who are near the DD spot or in the turrets. You will also need plenty of mages and rangers; especially if you're going with the turrets method. Another downside to the DD tactic is that if the enemies rush and overrun your team, your clan will scatter and without a specific person to pile, your clan will have a hard time recovering unless you regroup somewhere else.

, The recommended food for f2p clan wars in order of usefulness is swordfish, anchovies pizza, lobsters, or salmon. With food, players are less likely to be killed earlier in a fight which is essential. If many of your members do not bring food, this increases the enemies kill rate while decreasing yours. Another item that clan members should bring is the expensive spices necklace obtained from completing the easy quest, Let Them Eat Pie. This useful item allows food to restore an extra 50 lifepoints. Also clan members should bring stat boosting potions. Bring at least one defense potion and another that corresponds to your combat class. For instance, if you're maging bring a magic potion and defense potion.

If your enemies escape to a portal chamber, prepare to run to where they teleported.",How to Play Fist of Guthix in RuneScape," If you want to know how to actually play the minigame, you have to get to its location first. The cave can be accessed north of Falador. Once inside, take a right and enter the portal.

, Fiara is a huge creature. Once you enter, she will be at the end of the cave. Talk to her. She will tell you all about playing Fist of Guthix, but not telling you any strategies.

, The key to winning is to use strategies. If you do this, you can win either being ""The Hunted"" or ""The Hunter."" Here are most of the strategies.

, Use the picture above as a sample (note the graphics are outdated). Group things together so you can easily find and click things.

,, You know your opponent is on the other side of the arena, so he/she will most likely go to the center. He/she will go to the other side, where you started, and you will end up on their side.


After you get about 60-100 charges, go to the center where you will get the most charges. 60 charges is the ideal number of charges until the hunter gets bored and starts looking for you. (Keep in mind that this is not a concrete number - different people get impatient at different times. Just rely on your instincts.) Also, you can stay 3 steps away from a door in the house, and it gives you 15 charges. If they see you, you can just run around the house, or if you want, go inside the house and repeat.

, You will get 15 charges every 3 or 4 seconds, and when your opponent sees you, you can simply go inside a house. Chances are that 1/8th of the time, you will end up somewhere inside the arena again, but the other 7/8ths: You will end up somewhere in another house. If you see a flashing arrow on your mini-map, keep doing it, but don't do it for too long or else you will have a chance of going back inside the arena.

, You simply stand near the edge and when your opponent sees you, run or you can use the tele-orb. Use the tele-orb after you run until your opponent can't see you anymore.

, This is useful if your opponent is a melee guy and has to go around the rocks (which is not realistic) to hit you. If you master this, and he tries to use magic on you, you can put that protection prayer on and you should get at least 1,000 charges unless you are below level 30.


Using this same method, hiding behind houses also works.

, Make sure that first you run for a about 15 seconds so that when your opponent runs straight past, he can't see you. After that, walk on the edges and try to gain your advantage by walking on the boundary between getting 6 charges and 10 charges, while getting 10 charges at a time. This is not useful if you have used your tele-orb.

, The Fist of Guthix teleport is particularly strategic.

, This method, if your opponent is a mage and training, is beneficiary to both.

, When the hunter starts attacking you, activate the appropriate protection prayer. Don't go into the houses, they are a waste of charges, and damage will be dealt when you enter them. Plus, there is a chance that you end up in the center when you use the portal. Besides hiding behind rocks (next step), hope for the best!


If the hunter is a melee, then hide behind a rock that is closest to the center. The rock will block the hunter and prevent him from attacking you by melee until he clicks and attacks you again. Keep doing this as the additional time adds up to a significant number of charges.

If the person is of a low level, and instead switches to magic, then activate your mage protection prayer. This way, you are protected against magic, while using the rock to your advantage.
Beware that there are some people that have trained specifically to counter this by aggressively clicking and attacking you. If this happens, keep your melee prayer on.


If the hunter is a mage, simply stand at the center and activate the mage protection prayer until you use all of your medications and die. If the hunter is a ranger, then activate the range prayer.
The most dangerous hunter of all is one that is able to use all three combat methods efficiently. You will have to watch your opponent very closely and select the appropriate protection prayer. Sometimes, they will switch so fast, the prayers may not have much of an effect if you simply react to their attacks. You will have to anticipate their attacks.

Hide behind the rocks to counter their melee. As for the range and magic, you have to switch between prayers. Keep in mind that micromanaging prayer may cause you to forget about your HP and meds. Keep using meds as you approach orange health (or, safer yet, yellow). After all this, there are several things you need to do for these types of hunters:

Hide behind the rocks.
Switch between protection prayers.
Use the meds - don't forget about them.





, Your target spawns right across you (or 1 orb to the side), so if you are fast you can find them close.;
, If they use a protection prayer make sure that you have at least 2 different types of attacks (3 would be the best in this case). Unless you are at least 65 ranged, try to limit the amount of arrows you consume, preferably adamant and rune (members) arrows and use a scimitar or magic.

, It is recommended that you get a staff to help you accomplish this. If your opponent is a runner, cast the binding spell so you may catch up. Use your Explorer's Ring 3 if you end up running out of run energy.

, If he is not coming out, start circling around the houses. If you are lucky, the mini-map should show all of the houses clearly with ease, and if you are unlucky then you can only monitor 2 to 3 houses at once.

, Melee is required for this ironically, because if you master this being the hunted and attacking them simultaneously, your time of killing them will shrink.

, They may play a trick by entering the portal chamber but not actually teleporting; watch out for that ruse."
