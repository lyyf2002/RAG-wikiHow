Create a log on a program and keep track of prices.",How to Invest Using the Grand Exchange in Runescape1," This will help you in the long run.


Find some items that you would be interested in investing in and write them down
Everyday check the RuneScape Grand Exchange Database and copy down the current prices for the items you are thinking of investing in.

The more info. you have on an item the more likely you are gonna make a wise and profitable investment.
In your portfolio you should have a wide variety of items such as seeds, armours, weapons, and so forth.

"
Know when to invest.",How to Invest Using the Grand Exchange in Runescape2," Good ways to know is to look at up-coming updates. If you see something that make create a demand for something you should invest in it. For example the pvp update made a lot of things skyrocket.


The time to buy will usually be the difference in a couple gp profit to a huge profit. Always look at the front page and read all the up-coming updates.
Some guides might tell you to invest when and item is already going up, This is not always a good idea. The simple reason why is because if an item has already started rising you will most likely have to buy it at a higher price and you won't make as much profit. Instead, if you have made a portfolio, you should pay attention to rises and falls in the items you are looking at.
Here is a good example: One day an item falls 20k, the next 15k, the next 10k, 5k, then drops 2k, rises 2k, rises 15k, rises 30k and so on. The best time to buy this item would be at drop 5k. This is because you will be able to get it for under the medium price and it gives you much more profit.
When to sell your investment is another critical thing that must not be overlooked.
The time to sell is when an item has reached its peak. This can easily be figured out by checking the graphs on the Grand Exchange Database or your portfolio. Here is another example to help you know when the time to sell is. The item you invested in has a chart like this: +2k, +5k, +7k, +10k, +15k, +9k, +5k, +3k, -2k. The time to sell would be at +15k or even +10k. Even though the item continued to rise its daily rises were decreasing which is a sure fire sign that it will drop soon. If you sell it at its peak you will make most profit and its less risky. If you couldn't tell by looking at your graphs that the daily rises have decreased then don't panic, just sell your item at the first sign of decrease in rising.

Access the options menu.,

The Buttons.",How to Use the RuneScape Options Menu," This is done by pressing the button. This is found at the bottom of the interface on the right hand side of the screen. Clicking it will take you to the options menu.;
, Once in the options menu, there are a series of slidebars that you can use to adjust lighting and volume.


The bar is used to control screen brightness. This is only there to compensate for screen-brightness on your computer in general. Sliding the bar to the right will make the in-game screen brighter, going to the left will do the opposite. You can use this to simulate night and day.
The bar is used to control the volume of the in-game music. Setting the bar to the far right will completely mute the music. This is useful if you are listening to your own music through another application. Sliding the bar to the right will increase music volume.
The button will change the volume of sound effects. These include the sound made when you correctly enter your bank pin, wood-chopping sound, mining sound, etc. If you don't want to hear these then slide the bar to the left. Otherwise slide it to the right.
The button is used to change the volume of ambient noise. (Birds twittering, signs creaking, etc). If you don't want to hear them, slide the bar to the left, otherwise to the right.

, Below the slidebars are button which can also be used to control in-game features. These are:


The button controls whether or not you need two buttons on your computer mouse. By having it on, it means that a left-click automatically does the first thing on the options list, while the right-click brings up a list. Turning it off means that every time you click it brings up the list of options. This is very useful if you are using an iMac, as the Mice don't always have two buttons.
The button is used to toggle Chat-Effects on or off. Chat-Effects are when people use a code to make their speech more unique. (For instance text animation, colors, flashing text, etc). This button doesn't seem to have much of a purpose, as all it does is either allow you to see Chat-Effects or not. If you toggle it off, and type in a code, you can still read the writing as if the toggle was on, its just the effect doesn't appear.
The is used to split private chat from normal chat. If this is toggled off, private chat appears in purple under the normal chat box. If on, it appears in blue at the bottom left-hand corner of the game screen. It is recommended you toggle it on, as it makes it easier to see what your friends are saying, especially in crowded areas where lots of people are talking.
The button is used to toggle whether or not you can accept help from other players. ('Help' covers Teleother spells, Health Paks in Castle Wars and most of the Lunar Spells). If this is toggles off, the spells will not work, or the other person's efforts to cure you will not work. If it is on, you will be able to benefit from other player's generosity. It is recommended you keep this on, as there are only positive benefits to accepting help.
The button is used to toggle Run on or off. When Run is on, you will move quicker until your Run Energy is used up. The Run Energy is shown as a percentage on the button. Your run energy will decrease as you run. The rate at which it decreases is determined by your Agility level and how much weight you are carrying. This button is the only reason most users regularly access the Options menu.
The button is used for accessing your House Options menu. When you click on this a whole new menu screen appears, asking you whether you want to Kick Guests Out of your House, Go into Building Mode or Leave Your House. It will also tell you how many rooms are in your house. This is only any use when you are actually in your House, which is a Members-Only feature.

, Entering the chat means to watch the chat. You can choose who has the ability to enter the chat. This is helpful because it can stop rival clans from seeing the clan talking.

, Now you get to control who can talk in the chat. So this can help if you only want people observing your clan chat if you don't want them talking in it.

, Kicking people from chat is basically throwing them out of chat so that person can't talk. It's normally a good idea not to let untrusted people kick because they could kick people you're trying to have a discussion with or yourself! This is good for annoying people coming in chatting.

, The person who hosts the chat is automatically the Channel Owner. The other ranks which can be given out are from highest to lowest rank: General, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Corporal , Recruit, and Friend. You can only give ranks to people on your friends list.

Challenges in general are a list amongst the 25 different skills in the game. You can browse through the drop down menu on the left. By clicking on the different materials or activities within that skill, you can learn how much you would need to accomplish for that specific challenge.






Daily challenges are at least 5 random regular challenges. Certain activities, for example quests, it will allow you a few days to complete the task.







, He will then take the items you have made/done, if it's in your inventory or bank. You can only receive rewards when fully completing daily challenges. Rewards can include a helpful amount of experience in the specific skill, as well as a chance to receive a mystery bag. Mystery bags are surprise items that calculate up to the amount of materials you have may used for the challenge. For example, if you buried 10 dragon bones, you may receive a few pieces of runite ore.

, This is the best method to save money and get experience as well. Prepare your bank by mining your own ore for a future smelting/smithing challenge. Cut your own logs for any fletching or firemaking challenges. Kill Chaos Druids for herbs and save them. You will save thousands or millions of coins by doing this when you hit an expensive skill, such as herblore, fletching, crafting, or construction.

, Completing holiday events will unlock you every emote pertaining to that holiday, even those of years past.


Recent and future holiday events may require paid membership to obtain emotes.

, These can be obtained in a number of ways - some can be purchased from Diango in Draynor Village, some can be bought off the Grand Exchange, and some are discontinued. Still others are obtained as a result of members' activities.


Some items also modify existing emotes when worn.

, Many emotes are members-only, and require completion of pay-to-play quests or activities.

, It's P2P, of course, but the longer your membership subscription is, the more emotes you can buy with your reward points. Some of these emotes are downright awesome.


Also, try purchasing emotes and items from Solomon's General Store. This requires an in-game currency that, for the most part, requires real world currency to obtain - RuneCoins.

",How to Post in RuneScape Forums," Have something in mind you want to post. Many of the posts on the Forums are for buying, selling, and trading items.;
, There are forums for trading, selling, Clans Recruitment, Off Topic, Tech Support, and Forum Games where you may not make threads for In-Game transactions. Posting in the correct area will ensure the people you want to have read your post, will actually see it.

, The title of your post is the first, and sometimes only, part of your post that people will look at. Make sure it is accurate and specific. Don't post all in caps, it's annoying and demanding sounding. It is okay to sometimes put one word in caps so it stands out and attracts attention though.

, Always keep the content direct, on topic and specific. For example, if you are selling an item, stating that you are selling it, for what price, and whether the price is firm or negotiable. Also include any perks, such as rounding up, or whether you will go to a location near them to trade. Include how you wish to be contacted. Spell check your typing before posting, and use proper English with no abbreviations. Professional sounding posts will get more responses.

You may also want to stop in Lumbridge and help new users by offering them some money to help them on their journey. You can even drop your items allowing them to disappear from the game completely, or disperse your items among your friends. Whichever you choose to do, let it be a way that satisfies you and could potentially benefit the community.;
, This is an obvious one, cancelling your subscription only allows you to play the free to play version of the RuneScape. Even if you keep logging in to play RuneScape you will not have as much fun as you would in members and could end up bored of the game more easily.

, Jagex stores a cache on your computer to allow the masses of information in the game to load much faster. Deleting it will not only save you a bit of hard disk space but also make RuneScape more laggy and unresponsive the first time you log in if you can't resist going back.

, Do you play for thrill? Boredom? Whatever it might be there is often a different healthier way to satisfy you. Picking up a hobby is a great way to relieve addiction. To play RuneScape effectively, you should be thinking of it as just a game, not a life necessity. Think about how the game affects you. Look at how it affects others.

, This is quite obvious, but this step can be difficult. Try to catch yourself every time before you get to the login screen.

, You can do this with the Windows HOSTS file, or you may have parental control software you can use or have your parents set.

, That's right. Walk up to someone and give your account away. Not only have you helped someone else, you are no longer that level 100 you were if you ever try to play again. Alternatively, post it online for someone else to use.

, This will keep you from logging in permanently. Should you ever want to play RuneScape again, you would need to create a new account.

, This can include learning to play an instrument, sports, collecting, or travelling. This will take your mind off the game, and more the time you spend away from it, the more free time to concentrate you will have.

, Go to the password change screen, then type a random jumble of letters into the address bar. Copy and paste this into your ""New password"" box. This way you will know your account is gone forever, and there is no way to get it back.

, For example, if you fall in love with mathematics or jogging, you could spend lots of time with it instead of with Runescape. There really isn't much point in just walking away from Runescape or unplugging the internet: you'll come back because your schedule and life is empty. You have to fill it with something useful, something that will take up your time. Of course, if you lack the discipline to do this, you should actively look for help for someone to help discipline you. For example, an awesome example would be if you loved Mathematics and you started preparing for the International Mathematics Olympiad. Then you would find lots of resources online and many instructors to help you. Or you could arrange with your friend to have a special training program so you have a schedule and you train hard for stuff like jogging or studying maths. Once you fill that gap in your life (once you actually have a goal that you want to achieve, that takes up your time and you just love doing it) you shouldn't be addicted to Runescape anymore.

First off you need to train magic.,
Okay, now that you've trained your magic to the level you want, try to get rich.,
Items required:F2p: Wizard hat, Wizard robe, leather chaps, for they give no mage deduction, any staff, but air staff is recommended.,
Picking up the loot: If you're on the regular spellbook use telegrab to collect the items.,
Weakness problems: If you are facing a ranger at low levels, it shouldn't be too much trouble.,
Last of all, you should always make sure your opponent is bound.",How to PvP With a Mage in RuneScape," It is not a good idea to be a ""10 hp mage"" these mages train by casting splashes. They will die quickly in most situations. First make your money, then get lots of mind runes, air runes, water runes, earth runes, and fire runes. This is good training. Later you can use curse. This part of the guide was very brief and almost useless, lol.(as a side note, don't train defense!);
, If you're a member do desert treasure, will take forever by the way.

, Trout for levels 20-25, salmon for levels 25-30, tuna for 30-40, lobsters for 40-. Bring whatever runes you need, and it will be a good idea to risk at least 26000 wealth. This ensures you will get good drops if your opponent is risking this amount too.

P2p: Do desert treasure, and this is tedious, but get 82 magic. The way to pk is continuously casting ice blitz from afar, then use burst to combo the blitz. the hits can stack and do large damage, up to 26-22. This happens because blitz delays from a distance. Suggested: Full ghostly robes, or mage robes if you can't get that. Ancient staff is an almost must, or staff of light if you're super rich for added pwnage. Bring food and don't forget magic pots.






How to pk with an f2p mage: Your main prey will be melee pures, and a good way to pwn them is by bringing around 50-200 binds(yes it's a lot, get 60 wc for yews)Water blasts and anything you have. However, it's always a good idea to bring water blasts because you can almost combo. First send a water blast then a different spell. The hits will almost stack up.







, Try to get as far away from a bank as possible to kill meleers because they will try to run from loss of food while you're barely being hit.

, Past around level 60, f2p mages are useless! combine your magic with something else, like magic or ranged. F2p mages may still be effective if you can bind properly.

, since magic has the range of a longbow, you can still technically fight rangers without them touching you that much. The problem with fighting the meleers is that if you get pawned by a ranger far from the bank you'll have to run a long way, like the meleers. That's why you bring teleports, most often lumby tele.

Do you feel like you need to be more defended?,
Start Questing.,
Your first 100K.,
What to do after you feel comfortable to get out of the chicken pen and cows.,
Never ever trust anyone who asks for your email, if anyone wants you to follow them and get a load of expensive armour and coins.......DON'T they will kill you and then steal your stuff so be warned.

",How to Play RuneScape3,", To start, go to Bob's axes (south of Lumbridge Castle) and take a free bronze hatchet and bronze pickaxe. Find some level 2 goblins north or east of Lumbridge and begin the ""killing process."" The hatchet is recommended, but you can use the pickaxe and still have a good effect. If you set the hatchet to ""Chop"" you level attack. ""Slash"" levels strength and ""Block"" levels defense.

, After fighting for a few minutes, your health begins to drop and drop. If your health is below 15, STOP FIGHTING! Turn on the run button in the top right and run away to a safer place with no enemies. As you level up, you are less prone to taking damage and become slowly stronger. The one way to heal yourself the fastest: food. This is where the next four skills will come into play.

, To start the healing process with food, use your hatchet once again to chop down a tree. You only need one tree, but cut two in case your first fire burns out. Make sure it's a regular tree or a dead tree only. You need a woodcutting level of 15 to cut oak trees, so you can only cut regular trees for a while.

, To fish, first go to the fishing store in Lumbridge and take a free sample for a crayfish cage. Go behind the church to find spots for ""crayfishing."" Catch about 10 crayfish and walk away from the river.

, Fire is a lot less dangerous in RuneScape. It may take a while the first few times. To start, grab a free sample for a tinderbox from the Lumbridge General Store. Come back and click on the tinderbox in your inventory and then click on the logs to light a fire.

, By now, your health may be (almost) full. This is alright, but you are still learning to fish, cut, burn and cook. Click on the raw crayfish and then click on the fire. You will most likely burn at least forty percent of your crayfish.

, Head back to the goblins and train on those until you think you are ready to fight cows or you get 15 or below health if you get 15 or below health then go back and repeat steps 5-7 and train until you are comfortable

, If you are level 5 or lower, you will need to go back for food often so it is not recommended. Train and pick up cowhides as these sell for high prices and bury bones. DO not sell the cowhide until you have about maybe 200-300 of them. After you have 200 cowhide you will have a good solid 20-50k gp. Congratulations! You have reached your first 20-50k gp! Sell your cowhide at the Grand Exchange, which is North-West of Varrock West Bank and North-East of Barbarian Village.

, Walk east from the Lumbridge Lodestone into the desert area. Now walk south into the town and you will see a palace. Enter the palace and fight Al-Kharid warriors. The only bad thing is there are really no fishing spots and going around is just plain boring so lots of GP is recommended just in case.

, Sell your cowhides and get armour according to your defence level (bronze 1, etc). If you were training on cows for a long time, then you might be looking towards into buying feathers or food. Make sure you still have at least 10 gp left to go through the gate. Leather Armor can also be effective-if you have the required crafting level.

, This can get you Xp, Coins or items. A good one to start with is ""Cook's Assistant"". if you get stuck on it just go to a help site or go onto the RuneScape quest help page.

, Note that gaining 100k as a noob AND a f2p can become extremely challenging.

, Go to the Grand Exchange and buy some good armour. For instance, after all of those hours obtaining cowhide go and buy some black or mithril armour depending on your level. Do not buy the helm or shield as that is a total waste of money (maybe not, depending on how much money you have). Buy about 100 trout or pike, as they heal good enough for a noob (beginner). Or, you can fish for your own food, as it can save you lots-I mean lots-of money. If your defence level is only 20, then it is suggested to buy steel armour, because it is a lot cheaper and also you would save more money. Stay in the GE, don't fall for the doubling money scam which is always not legit. Buy 100 bowls of water. With your 30k leftover, buy 100 pots of flour. Make some pizza dough. Withdraw 9 pots of flour and also 9 bowls of water as you will make 9 pizza dough. After you make the 100 pizza doughs, sell them for around 400 -330 gp, each making 200-250gp profit (items may not load right away so wait for 1 day).

The characters can not interact with each other in any way, for example, drop trading, item transferring, or assisting with skills. You also may not share or trade accounts with someone else. People that do accept these offers can also be reported.;
, Don't type anything that may be racist or offensive towards anyone else. If you have the need for it, say it out loud in person instead of taking the time to type it. Any player around to see the conversation can report you for the negative behavior. You will also get reported by others if you ask for a boyfriend or girlfriend.

, Trading in other online games or for real-life money is not allowed. If you sell stuff for real-life you can get permanent ban.

, This is an online role playing game, not a dating service. Do not ask for any personal information or details. As a player, you may give out and share general information, such as your age, country, and first name, but telephone number, home address, and anything else that exploits your whereabouts is not allowed.

, It gives you an unfair advantage over others in the game and you may not circumvent or go around Jagex's mechanisms that log out users automatically after a certain time of inactivity.

, Item and password scamming are the top mistakes that people fall to in Runescape. Password scams include using symbols and saying that your password is blocked from others, but in reality, it will show up as text if someone else did it and also making millions of GP by sending your username and password to an unknown email address. HOWEVER due to an update of mid 2007, passwords CANNOT be said out loud. If you attempt to, the game will alert you of your actions and will refuse to 'say' it. If your password is a commonly used word, then that word will be somewhat blocked in-game. Change your password if this were to occur.

, The codes of conduct are posted at the top of the forums. Free players can read the forums, while members are allowed to read and post. Negative action can result in a ban from the forums and a possible suspension on your account.

, Impersonation of moderators or administrators is not allowed. Jagex staff members have a gold crown next to their names when talking. Moderators will have a silver crown. People are not staff if they do not have one.

, Misusing customer support includes reporting innocent people, supplying or fishing out false information, and twisting the rules towards your favor. Whenever you report someone, a screenshot of the last 60 seconds (one minute) will be provided along with your report.

Wearing full HAM robes increases the odds of you not getting stunned from a pickpocket. You may want to keep the arrows you get from the members as they stack up quite quickly.
, This can technically reward you with any clue throughout elite, but the effort it takes to get these corpses are almost not worth the effort. These are obtained by using the respective keys on their chests. The purple key is statistically the best chances to get clue scrolls., These require the Zogre Flesh Eaters to be completed, and an ogre coffin keys. You will most likely make a profit on the bones you receive from the coffins, so buying keys is a viable option., Men have one of the highest easy clue drop rates, along with the easy ability to be one hit by kills., Guards are located in nearly every city, however the guards in Falador seem to have the best drop and fastest drop rate, however all guards are good options, and varrock guards have decent drops as well., These are best killed in the Asgardian dungeon south of Port Sarim. These are aggressive, so you can leave the computer and come back while still being safe. They also have lots of other drops likes runes and herbs., These can be accessed after the Rockin' Out quest, and to get there you must be arrested in the Rimmington Customs Offices, and steal from the files.

Note, finding a game is extremely rare to find, and getting 5,000 tokes will undoubtedly take many months., They can be found in the Taverly dungeon, just north of the black demons. These have a 1/64 chance to drop a hard clue scroll, and they give incredible experience for kill and drop lots of gold charms, but aren't much good for anything else., These are located in the Canfis slayer tower or in the Chaos Tunnels north of Edgeville. These drop clues surprisingly often, along with many alchables like rune full helms and rune platelegs, along with the coveted granite maul., These can be found the Canfis Slayer tower. These drops lots of noted grimy herbs, lava battlestaves, and ghostly essence to go along with the clue scrolls, so large profits can be made here along with the clues., These can be found in the Fremennik Slayer cave, just before the Turoths. They don't have many other drops, but their hard clue scroll rate is decent, and the exp rate is good considering their level required., These can be obtained in a number of ways, primarily from killing high level slayer monsters and pickpocketing elven clan workers, but once you collect all 3 pieces, you are guaranteed to get an elite clue scroll, along with another reward., After completing the quest ""Do No Evil"", you can dig up one elite clue scroll in the location depicted by the alerter., Mutated Jadinko Males and Eddimus are noted for their relatively high rate of dropping these., Using elder pyre logs with the highest tier of remains, you can almost always get a gold key from burning the remains. These can give you elite clue scrolls at a pretty decent rate if you buy the items on the G.E. They also can give you fine cloth, which is valuable and can negate your investment price., These can rarely be obtained from getting prawn balls while fishing in your POH, and will give you an elite clue once a week, resetting every Wednesday., If you've completed the Odd Man's wishlist, then once a week you can kill the Skeletal Horror, which as a 1/20 drop rate for elite clue scrolls., These can easily be AFKed for great EXP and loots, as well as the uncommon drop of an elite clue."

Bottom line: A main is all about being in balance.",How to Create a Good Main on RuneScape," Let's face it, RuneScape is so much easier and so much more fun when you are a member. It's not that expensive. If you aren't allowed to become one there's only one option left. Beg your parents. Beg like your (virtual) life depended on it!;
, Kill some spiders and goblins at Lumbridge forest and once you reach around 15 combat move on to the cows at Lumbridge. Proceed to level 30 and you can go to the rock crabs at Fremennik Isle.

, Being a main is all about doing everything in the game. Do the quests. Most of the time they'll give crappy rewards but you'll need the crappy quests so you can do the harder crappy quests. These quests will sometimes allow you to access additional content (that makes you powerful).

, Being level 100 combat is cool, right? It sure is, but when you are a level 100 with level 10 mining you will get laughed at. Train up those stats. You'll need them for quests anyway.

, Once you reach those nice 99 levels in you main combat stats (attack, strength, defence, HP), you can stake pretty easily at the duel arena. You can box (fighting without armour or weapon) other maxed players and if you are lucky you can win some quick cash! But be aware: you may lose everything. Especially if you suck. Please don't suck.

, If staking failed you or you failed at staking, try merchanting. There are plenty of (crappy) guides on the internet. Remember: buy low, sell high.

, Slayer will sometimes give you rewards in the form of random armour drops from slain monsters. Sometimes you'll get lucky and get 3 of them in an hour. Sometimes you won't get anything in 3 days. But it's a nice cape anyway, so just do some slayer.

, You can have every skill around 40 and be a main. You can do quests, get all the extra unlockable content, find all music in the game or just do nothing all day long and whine about the crappy updates. In the end, you are a main. And only you decide what you want to do. But if you want to be a good main, you'll have to train hard and long. Become as high as you can possibly be.

Once getting one of the mentioned skills to 35, even 30, you will start to get a good enough cash flow to buy your Armour, such as iron, bronze, and steel to start achieving your combat goals.;
, If you are just starting, do not be a pure. If you aren't, being a pure is a good and fun idea! The most popular pures are Magic, Staker, Rune, No defence, and Skiller.


A Magic pure is a pure that raises Magic and defence or just Magic.
A Staker pure raises Attack and Defence most and keeps strength low. Used for Dueling
A Rune pure is a pure which has 70 attack (For a whip), 99 Strength, and 40 Defence (for rune armor)
A No defence pure is the same as a Rune pure, only generally ends up with 99 attack eventually... but will usually stay at 60 to keep the lowest combat possible :) and 99 strength with 1 Defence.
A skiller is one that does not raise any combat skills and focuses on skills.

For example, ""Zezima405712"". People that see you may portray you as a ""Noob"" or someone without any experience.

, If your character is a fighter, go for more muscles than skinny arms. Get a clothing style that would work with the image you want. For the ladies, there's an option for either dresses, skirts, and trousers as your default clothing. If you want your girl character to look tough, you can give them muscles as well. And everyone eventually gets tired of their customized outfit. So when you do, remember that you will be able to change it later. For free you can do this. (Note that the prices may vary over time, due to outfit updates). Your outfit also includes your hair style too. Same thing goes for this. You get to choose it for when you create and account for free, then on a later date you can change it.

Fake a home teleport.",How to Get Beggars off Your Back in RuneScape," Saying no is the first thing to try because when you say no, you send a direct message that you don't want to give them what they want.;
, If the beggar is ignored, they will realise that you do not wish to speak to them.

, If you have a high enough Magic level, you can teleport somewhere else. Doing so will make it difficult for the beggar to find you.

, If you are far from Lumbridge, start the home teleport. About a second later, click it again. If they are following you, wait until they leave and move away, cancelling the teleport. It solves the problem and is very satisfying.

Build a telescope in your house and use it to look for stars.",How to Chase Stars on RuneScape1," There are two different telescopes you can build: teak and mahogany.

"
"
Look in the telescope to get a time window for the landing.,
Once the stopwatch reaches 2:00, click the telescope.,
Keep checking the telescope every 60 seconds.,
If the timer gets down to 3 or 2 minutes, you can consider running before the star has landed.",How to Chase Stars on RuneScape2," Let's assume it says ""3 to 12 minutes"". Now, keep clicking the telescope until it the timer changes to ""2 to 11"", and then start your stopwatch. (Don't move the mouse down to ""click here to continue"", but keep it in the same spot and click again and again.) Now that the stopwatch is running, you know that the first possible landing is in two minutes exactly. Now prepare to race. Turn on run mode, adjust the camera angle and organize your inventory to make sure you hit the ground running.;
, If you don't see the star, and get a silly remark instead, the star has landed. Run! If the telescope says ""0 to 9 minutes"", relax for another minute. The star will not land until the stopwatch shows 3:00. This is why it's important to identify the exact time when the minutes flip over. Stars do not land in-between minutes, so if it hasn't landed this minute, it won't land until another 60 seconds have passed.

, If you get the same interval as last time, you've clicked too early. Click again. Fast! Note that the telescope timer is slightly slow, so that each minute is more like 60.5 seconds. You won't notice it for the first minutes, but after a while, the drift becomes significant. If you time a landing long in advance, the timer will have drifted so far that you have to restart the stopwatch when the landing gets close.

, This is useful if it takes you a while to get to the first landing spot. (But even a spot as remote as the northern desert clay mine only takes 1:30 minutes to reach.) If you decide to run, the stopwatch will be essential to knowing if the star has landed. Be aware, though, that it takes a few seconds for a star to land. A shadow will come in from the east as the star approaches. This animation starts *after*, and not before, the landing time. So wait for ten seconds or so before running to the next spot.

"
"
With a mahogany telescope, the time window is so short that you can choose to always wait at the first landing spot.,
If you're waiting at a landing spot, you may consider running from the spot one minute before the last possible landing time (or rather 50 seconds, to allow for the landing animation).",How to Chase Stars on RuneScape3," Use a stopwatch to find out when you can give up waiting and run for the next spot. You risk falling behind, though, if the star lands early and you spend another minute or two waiting at the wrong spot. On the other hand, you have the advantage of already being out in the field, while someone running from their house will take some time even getting to the area.

, By then, the chance of it landing where you are is smaller than the chance of it having already landed somewhere else. The downside is that you may have to run back to the first spot, or even the second if you ran past that before final landing time had passed.

Never call anybody a Noob.,
Help people if and when you can.,
Do not scam people!,
Know that if you get in an argument with someone and they get quite aggressive, simply add them to your Ignore List or move to a different world.,
Remember that if you are planning to report somebody for a particular reason, after you've done it, don't shout out ""REPORTED!"",
Be wary with the words you use as a lot can be misinterpreted for swearing and will be blocked out by the star filter.,
Do not brag about your own items, money or quest points or anything else related - this will only make people look down on you, and it might even cause hackers or scammers to want to claim your account.

,
Learn not to laugh at anybody in a criticizing way during the game.,
DO not give out website addresses, MSN details, phone numbers or any other personal information.",How to Be a Good User on RuneScape," This guide will tell you how to be a good player and avoid bans and conflict with other players.;
, This is one of the most important one. If somebody gets on your nerves, simply add them to your ignore list (seen at the bottom right hand side, the red angry face.) If you call somebody a noob, you will lose respect for yourself and people won't like you as you will come across arrogant and big-headed.

, If a new member asks you for help, either help them (this can be done easily through private messages) or politely say no. Your reply should not include ""No, noob."" You should reply, ""Sorry but I'm quite busy right now. Maybe I can help you later? :)"" - and keep to that promise if they do ask you later. If it's something that is quite a basic problem then you can tell them politely to go to the home page for information on the topic they're after.

, Regularly check Runescape help sites (make sure they're legit and not scam sites) for item prices, or simply go to the Grand Exchange for a guide. If you are a long way away from Varrock then just go to any bank or ask a friend if they can give you a price check. Simply trade somebody, put the item in, and look at the text at the bottom of the trade box. This will show you how much the item is worth. Beware though, prices can change rapidly.

, If they follow you, right click the 'Private' tab at the bottom of the game screen, and click ""Friends Private"" (make sure you've removed the person in question from your friends list first!) The 'Friends Private' tab makes sure that only friends can see you online and send you private messages. Move worlds after you've done this so the harasser can't follow you again.

, - this is the mistake that a lot of people make, I've seen it a lot.

If you are going to report someone, do it discreetly and don't say a word to them or it might make the situation worse for the two of you.

, Simple words such as Yes, No, Maybe, ""But I'm going to do this"" are usually innocent, but words such as Rawr, Gawdd, FGS, FFS (fictional words) are usually starred out and this will do you no favors if you are hoping to be a moderator.


If anything annoys you in the game, either stop doing it, teleport away, or go off Runescape altogether. Runescape is not created to be an obsession, it is a game that should be enjoyed moderately. If you get too angry, you might blurt out swear words or do something you'll regret, and then you'd be banned.
If somebody asks you for your level e.g Fishing level, or Smithing level, you don't have to give it them if you don't want to. Nobody is forcing you to, but if you really want to tell them, you can. Usually somebody who asks for levels is somebody who is willing to brag about their own levels and laugh at anybody else's. Stay away from these conversations if at all possible. If you happen to be ridiculed, just say, ""Yeah, it's really low isn't it? I've not done this level for ages, dude"" - this will give an explanation to the person who is making fun out of you. If they don't accept it, just ignore them from then on.. but don't be tempted to make disturbing comments.

,, ""Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.""

, Runescape friends should stay Runescape friends.

Go to one of the rocks made out of rune essence.,
Mine the rune essence.,
Use the exit portal.,
Put the essence in the bank.",How to Mine Rune Essence," You must beat it in order to mine rune essence.;
, It's impossible to mine without a pickaxe. So take one with you. It's best to bring one that you can equip; then you have an extra space in your inventory.

, The Rune Essence Mine is the only place in Runescape where you can mine the essence. However, you can't teleport yourself there. And not just anyone can teleport you there either. Here are the people that can teleport you there:


Aubury - Located in the Varrock Magic Shop.
Wizard Sedridor - Located in the Basement of the Wizard Tower.
Wizard Distentour (members) - Found in the Yanille Magic Guild.
Wizard Cromperty (members) - Located just northeast of the Ardougne Market.
Brimstail Gnome (members) - Found in a cave in the southwest corner of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.

, These are normally easy to find. There is one of the rocks in each of the four corners of the mine. If you weren't teleported near the essence, wander around until you find it.

, Mining the essence is fast if your mining level is high. But you can still mine it even if your mining is level 1! Mine rune essence until you don't need any more.

, Now you need to go out of the Rune Essence Mine. The portal is indicated with a red arrow on the minimap. All you have to do is click on the little portal next to the place where you were mining. It will take you back to the person who teleported you there.

, Unless you were planning to do something with your rune essence, you should place your essence in the bank so you can mine more.

, The population of the world you are in will depend on it - worlds with higher populations will have ores that respawn quicker.


If you are under level 20, use tin or copper. If you are level 20 or higher, use iron ore. If you are a member, use granite ore at level 80+.

,, You can also trade it to a nearby ""ore runner,"" making it a win-win process.

,, Wield a dragon pickaxe (or rune if you can't afford the dragon).;

",How to Mine in RuneScape," You can find a basic pickaxe in the small house in the Barbarian Village. Pickaxes can be bought from Nurmof's Pickaxe Shop, which is found in the Dwarven Mines. There are two entrances to the mine: the first being in a building south of the east Falador bank, and the second being to the south of Ice Mountain (located north of Falador). The shop itself is found to the west of the entrance. You must go around the twisting passage, and the shop is north of the General Store.;
, There are several mining spots around the city of Varrock, and the Scorpion Pit mine near the desert town of Al Kharid.

, Do recognize the different colors of rocks, even though hovering your mouse over a rock gives you what type of mineral it is.


Copper is orange
Tin is dark silver
Blurite is light blue
Iron is mahogany red
Coal is black
(m)Gemrock is fuscia
(m)Sandstone is dark brown
(m)Granite is a light brown
Mithril is dark blue
Admantite is dark green
Runite is teal
When you select mine, your character will keep mining until you obtain the ore.

, After completing the Shilo Village quest, you can mine for gems in Shilo Village. You can also find gems while mining normally. There's a greater chance of mining a gem if you are wearing a charged Amulet of Glory.

,"
"
Complete the quest 'Shilo Village' to do this guide.,
Now that you have access to Shilo Village, take the cart there, because it's FAR easier than walking through monsters and the jungle.,
Go across the bridge near the bank, to northwest of the city/town, and start mining the 'gem rocks.',
Go to the right server.,
Get gems while mining regular rocks: This includes from tin and copper to runite rocks.,
Wear an Amulet of Glory.,
Good luck mining!

",How to Mine for Gems in RuneScape,";
, There is a fine though, so bring about a 100 GP. (The fine is not necessarily 100 gold pieces, just bring a few extra.)

, You need a certain Mining level to mine these rocks, so check in your Mining pull-up directory to see if you have the required level. Don't forget to bring a pickaxe! (Preferably the best you can use.)

, There are few rocks, so make sure to go on a server with very few people, because there are about 5 rocks, and if someone else is there, you'll have trouble! Sometimes you get rubies and emeralds, but mostly you get jades and opals, which break easily when used with a chisel. They are not very profitable in the Grand Exchange though, so try to drop these or bank them for future use in quests, and try to get the more valuable gems.

, (Note that tin and copper rocks probably VERY RARELY if never give gems.)


There is no real way to get only a gem and not the ore you're mining unless you get a gem and click another rock or click elsewhere before you get the ore.

, What is recommended to get gems more commonly while mining is to wear a (CHARGED!) Amulet of Glory. 3 to 4 charges works best, 2 to 1 charge(s) works, but not as well. The Amulet of Glory increases the chance of getting a gem while mining, like a rabbit foot increases the chance of getting a bird's nest while woodcutting.

, You can either make them or just buy them.



If you want to make them, get your 2 pieces of wet clay, go to a pottery wheel (Burthorpe works) and make the mining urns. Then, put it in a furnace, and now you have a mining urn (nr). Add an earth rune to it and now you have a working mining urn. You need a crafting level of 32 to make them.

Go to the southeast Varrock mining site. You should start mining the copper and/or the tin there and keep banking until you have you have level 7 mining.
Remember to keep getting new urn. It's better to have a lot in your bank so you can get them quickly.
Go and get a steel pick, from wherever you would like. You can now mine ore faster.

Go get a Mithril mining pick and keep mining and banking until you have 31 mining.

, Keep mining iron here at the Varrock site until you have 41 mining and then get a runite pick because then you mine ores much faster.


Stock up on urns depending on which level you are going to get to:

100 + urns if your going for 55 mining
350 + urns if your going for 70 mining
750 + urns if your going for 85 mining


Go check around the Falador Dwarven mining site and make sure you have a level 15 dungeoneering so that you can enter the mysterious entrance to bank ore fast.
Also make sure you know that there is a bank close to the exit so you can get urns fairly quickly.

, Keep mining iron at the 3 iron spot strip and using urns at the Dwarven mine, and keep using the deposit box to drop off your iron until you have 55 mining. At level 55 mining, you can get mithril ores.


To use or stay at the Dwarven iron strip for a decent amount of time, it's advisable to world hop on very low populated worlds. Depending on the time of day, at a last resort, you also may see yourself use international worlds. Because of the convenience of how the strip is shaped, people tend to camp at this specific location and power-iron, and thus making it one of the most popular F2P mining locations. If you are feeling brave, and don't mind a competition, in world 3 or other highly populated worlds, the ore regenerates faster, but more people try to get it.

, Keep mining iron and occasionally mine mithril (mithril doesn't fill your urn, and iron still gives better xp per hour) until you have 70 mining.

, This is the homestretch, and also the longest part of the race. Doing challenges. Using urns, and constantly mining iron and this still take a long time.

At the moment it sells for 200gp. So if you get a bag full of iron you get 5.6k. Which is enough for about 11 sets of iron armour. Mine iron just below varrock (to the west) then bank in Varrock's west bank.


Mining is a good way of making money at the moment because of the price of iron. If you get 1000 iron ores you sell for 200k!

On Tutorial Island, get all of your skiller skills up to 3.,
Train your first skill (or only skill).,
Get this skill up to 35.,
Get this skill up to 50.,
Get this skill to 99.",How to Make a Successful RuneScape Pure," This really helps and takes about 3 minutes off of a longer skill to level.;
, Get this skill to 15. Even though you think ""why 15?"" You can make your first 20k off of this depending on the skill.

, Once it gets 35 in any skill you should have about 34k. You can also get good rewards from quests that require 35+ in any skill (if it's a skiller'`s skill).

, By then in any skill you should have at least 45k.

, You should have about 3.5M by the time you get any skill to 99.

"
"
Make an account with an appropriate name.,
Kill the dragon and let's get straight down to business.,
Go to the G.E do the tutorial and then buy your self full leather as well as an oak, willow and maple short bow as well as as many bronze arrows as you can buy.

,
Start training by heading off to Lumbridge to start killing the chickens collecting the feathers.,
Start killing cows when you reach level 15-25.,
Don't worry about your low arrow supply!,
Defeat barbarians until you reach level 40.,
Increase your range.,
Choose who you want to use to train next: White knights or Hill giants.,
Choose either Ice giants or Moss giants.",How to Make a Successful Range Pure on RuneScape,";
, Start off by going to the security of safety and get the lamps in the tunnel behind the poster. (use on ranged exp)

,, Note that you'll already be level 9 ranged from the lamps. Train here till level 15.

, You should still have a lot of arrows left so just move straight to the cows and start killing them - collecting the cowhide as you go; banking when needed.

, It's no matter since all the hide and feathers you collected will sell instantly on G.E and you will have a good 30k to spend on arrows. Buy iron arrows now for max in g.e, also but a coif and studded leather chaps. Also buy a power amulet if you hadn't already done so.

, Now, you may be thinking minotaurs all the way, however minotaurs are dead boring to train on and really slow so barbarians are really the only way to go that isn't as boring.

, You'll now be thinking that hill giants are the best and you should train on them, however you are once again wrong and instead you should train on flesh crawlers standing in the safe spot (look at pic) until you reach 50 range. Remember to get the fire runes as they come in near 50s at a time. Also get green leather chaps/vambraces.

, It really comes down to whether you're in need of cash or not because quick exp is White knights since most people are already Hill giants, but for cash it.s Hill giants all the way because of their big bones. So train on them till 60-65 range.

, Again, it depends if you want cash or exp since moss giants are good for cash and Ice giants are good for exp.


Congrats on 75 range! Now it's the most frustrating/satisfying part of your journey since it takes forever to get 99 range. However, every time you level you think W00t!! 5 more levels to go. So it's off to lesser demons for you making sure you have food and mithril arrows for the best profit/exp.
99 range Congratulations! You can now go murder anyone/everyone in PVP!

Travel back to the Barbarian Outpost.",How to Complete the Bar Crawl Miniquest in RuneScape," It's also best not to participate in combat if you're planning to complete the bar crawl in one sitting, as your skill ability will drop significantly.;
, Using a Games Necklace is the fastest method. You can also walk north from Seer's Village.

, To start the bar crawl, you must get a bar crawl card. Know that if you lose the card at any time, you must start the entire mini-quest all over again.

, You must talk to the bartender and choose the answer option that you are there for the bar crawl. Each bartender will give you a specific drink with a different cost. You will automatically drink them after talking to them. After successfully drinking the drink, it will be crossed off your card.


Blurberry's Bar: Go to the 2nd floor of the Grand Tree. If you have an agility level of 37, take the shortcut to the back of the tree from the outpost. Order a Fire Toad Blast from Blurberry for 10 coins.

Rising Sun: Go to the bar in Falador, which is right next to the west bank. Order a Hand of Death Cocktail for 70 coins. This is the worst drink in the list, as it takes away 200 of your life points, so come prepared with food for low levels.
Blue Moon Inn: Go to the Varrock bar, near the south entrance. Order an Uncle Humphrey's Gutrot for 50 coins.
Jolly Boar Inn: This bar is located in the Northeast corner of Varrock, just East of the Lumberyard. Order a Olde Suspiciouse for 10 coins.

Train your Strength level.,
Train your Range Level.,
Make some Money.,
Gear up.,
Find a fight.,
Go in for the kill.",How to Make a RuneScape Range/2H Pure," The main part of a Range/2h pure is being able to get a KO with your 2h of choice. You are going to want as high strength level as you can, level 99 would be the best, of course, but level up to your choice. While doing this, train attack and defence to level 40 as well, so you can wield your weapon and wear armor.
, With a name like range/2h pure, it makes sense that range levels would be needed to pk with one. The point to training this is to get in intermediary hits doing damage so you are able to get your opponent down low enough to hit him with your 2h and Kill them. Again 99 is recommended but train to your liking., You are going to be buying a lot of supplies, from food to gear, so you are going to need as much money as you can get. Depending on your gear, anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million can be enough to buy your supplies., Buy a Magic shortbow, about 100 rune arrows, full green dragon hide, a rune two-hander, an amulet of strength, super range and strength potions is you are member, range and strength potions if you are not, and finally food. If you are a member, buy sharks, if you are free-to-play, buy swordfish., Preferably someone your level, and even better, a range 2h pure like yourself. When you find the fight, drink your potions and start attacking them with your magic shortbow. You can use your special attack if you wish, as you will not be using it with your 2h., Once you think your opponent is low enough switch to your 2h. Ideally, you want to switch to your 2h immediately after the animation of shooting the arrow from your magic shortbow starts is when you want to switch, as you will get a hit in with the bow and 2h in the same tick. If you did not kill them, switch back to your shortbow. If you did, loot your kill and get out of there."

, Wielding full iron, the best scimitar you can wear, an amulet of fury, any cape you want (hunter skillcape recommended), head over to the monks, where you will train to 30 strength and 40 attack. Now go to rock crabs with that armour and a rune scimitar, and a few food, train to 60 attack, 65 strength. Now for that range, useful for so many quests.

Go to the house slightly north of where you spawn in lumbridge and go downstairs.,
Go to the Stronghold of Security and get 10k and fancy/fighting boots, use this on the next step.,Buy 10k bronze arrows(If you do not have enough money, you should do tanning) leather body, power amulet, leather cowl, normal coif, all bows, green d'hide vamps/chaps, now your ready to start being a pure

,Go to the chicken coop north of Lumbridge and using rapid, range chickens till level 5, then switch to oak shortbow, keep ranging here till level 10

,
at level 10 you can hit a bit higher, go to the goblin house just behind the cows area, range here till 20, Or if you are in a low populated world go to the top of the cows area in lumbridge.

,At 20 range equip normal coif, studded chaps and willow shortbow, go to the stronghold of security and range minotaurs till 30 range

,At 30 range equip maple shortbow and head to the monastery, range the monks here till around 36 - 38 range # since your a pure you probably don't have much money so head to the hill giants and range till 40 range ( you make 30 - 150k )OR you can kill Zombies and Skeletons in the Draynor Sewers which is 600 xp in about 5minutes

,
after wearing the green'd hide chaps and vambs, go to the crafting guild and range the hobgoblins across the stream till 50 range ( you lose all your arrows unless your mems with a device of ava's or you can use a sling it can be bought at the grand exchange it requires no ammo. ),
At 50 now again to hill giants till 55 range ( Collect the big bones for good money and bank on a full inventory. ),At 55 range go to moss giants in Varrock sewer till 65 range ( if your making a range/prayer you can bury the bones and get 31 prayer )

,At 65 range head to lesser demons till 75, at 75 range i strongly recommend becoming members but its up to you

,
From 75 - 99 it's really your choice for where you want to range, if your a range tank a good idea is to go to the 2nd west room on level 2 stronghold of security and leave your person in the flesh crawler room, they have low defense and auto-attack for 25 - 30 minutes.

,at 95 range you max out, your max hit stays the same ( this is a good level to stop at for major PKers as your cb doesn't raise for hp anymore and you stay maxed out )

,
Congratulations your 99 range !,
You've gotten range down now.",How to Make a Range Pure on RuneScape," (Don't worry, hit points are like a side note; they level as you level).

, Also, take a variety of food items (bread is best for lower levels because it has 5 heal and is relatively easy to make) and a range potion is suggested, as this will raise your range stat by 10 levels enabling for quick and fast exp gain.

, These are a great source of exp giving you 192 exp per crab. It may seem to take a while to kill them at this level with your range level so low, so still use the range potion also with rock crabs. Also, take a good source of food.

, Now you're ready to go now head to the the Stronghold of Safety and kill the cockroach soldiers. You should be able to manage your way around, and remember; take a good source of food and range pots for they are level 83 and keep your distance! I recommend you do this until level 60

, They can be found in the Chaos Tunnels in about level 3 wilderness near the split of Edgeville and Varrok were the river system splits. It will be on the right side but if you can't manage to find you way just use Knowledge Base

, This will make you money to buy food and equipment.

, By now you should be experienced enough to make your own decisions.

, Talk to sir vant and get two experience lamps, use them both on range. You can only get down the ladder at combat level 20+.;
, Then go to Barbarian Village and go down in the center and do the maze there and get 10k and safety gloves.

,,,,,, ( note : if you don't want to lose your arrows then you can run around and get your arrows + various drops including Limpwurt roots and jewels

,

,,,,, you can now buy your cape and look cool

, You combat level is as high as it will go for a pure.

Have Fun with Range!",How to Make a Range Tank in RuneScape," Create the account you are going to use. I would suggest making a name that doesn't use any l33t speak. So avoid words like Pur3 R4ng3r, try making an original and amusing name. Ex: ""On My Own Now"";
, Finish the Tutorial and you will get either level 4 Mining or Woodcutting. These are both very good for making money for arrows and supplies.

, Before heading off to get supplies, do the ""Myths of the White Land"" and ""Rune Mysteries"", For the 500xp lamp, and access to the Runecrafting skill. Use the experience lamp on either Defence or Range. So head up to Edgeville and bank all of your items. Then head over to Barbarian Village by the fishing spots, ask for free cooked food. Once you have some go do the ""Stronghold of Security"" and the ""Stronghold of Player Safety"", you should have 20k some boots, gloves, and two experience lamps. Use one lamp on the skill you used the 500xp lamp on and the other one on the opposite skill ( Defence and Range ).

, Okay, now that you have some money, its time to get some supplies. Head over to the Grand Exchange and buy the following: Shortbow, Oak Shortbow, Willow Shortbow, Maple Shortbow, Leather Boots, Leather Chaps, Leather Cowl, Leather Vambraces, Leather Body, Studded Chaps, Studded Body, Full Iron, Iron Scimitar, about 600 Bronze or Iron Arrows (Steel if you have enough money) and about 20 Trout or Salmon.

, Okay, Grab your Chaps, Cowl, Vambs, Body, Boots, Arrows, Food, Full Iron, Iron Scimitar, and your Shortbow ( Oak Shortbow if you have level 5 Range). Head over to the Monks at the monastery just west of Edgeville. Only eat when you have 20 health left, and after every kill talk to a Monk to heal you. Train here until level 15 Defence, and 20 Range.

, Okay now head to the bank and grab your Studded Chaps and Body, and your Willow Bow. Head to the Minotaurs (level 12) in the first floor of the ""Stronghold of Security"". Train here until you have level 40 Range and 35 Defence. If you run out of arrows, I would suggest Mining to level 15 and mine Iron. Mine about 500 Iron then sell them in the GE. You should get about 50k or so. Then buy some arrows and get back to training.

, Now you will be able to hit High enough to Pwn Hill Giants. Go to the GE and buy some more food, and a Brass Key. Now head to the little house west of the Cooking Guild. Have your brass key, equipment, and food in your inventory, and go in the house and down the ladder. Head to the north-west corner and their will be a little area surrounded by some rocks. Hide behind the rocks and range the hillies (Hill Giants). Then just melee them on the defence setting for training def. Train here until you have about 50 Range and 40 or 45 Defence.

, Once you have your membership Train at the Rock Crabs by Relleka til level 60 Range and 50 Defence.

, Okay, now you can either keep training at the rock crabs, or start the ""Creature of Fenkenstrain"" quest and train at experiments til level 70 Range and level 60 Defence. I also suggest farming Herbs while you are training, since each herb patch takes an hour and a half to grow, so train for an hour and a half then go gather your herbs, plant new ones, and train again.

, Okay, so now you could either train member skills, get Void Knight armour, or maybe even get a Crystal Bow from the quest ""Roving Elves"". Also, you could use the money you get from farming herbs to buy a Blessed D'Hide Set, they give very good Defence and Range Bonus. So, Hope the guide helped you, and Good Luck!

The highest axe you can use is a Rune Axe since it is F2P, so as soon as you hit 51 woodcutting it is a highly recommended buy.;
, It is highly recommended to cut the ones around the Grand Exchange.

, The best place to cut these would be West of Varrock East bank. However, this place can get crowded, so if there are too many people you can go to the Draynor manor.

, There are a few good locations to cut these, primarily north of Draynor bank or south of the Grand Exchange, however both locations are often crowded, so take your pick.

, The most popular spot by far to cut these would be directly south of Draynor bank, as it is within a few steps of a deposit box and very easy to bank your logs. This will get crowded, but it's the only real place to cut down willow tress in F2P

, This is a long stretch, however there are no other alternatives in F2P. The best places to do this would be just south of Edgeville, North of Varrock Castle but still within the walls of Varrock, or West of Lumbridge.

After about 70 Firemaking, it takes a lot of money to level up. If you have a bunch of money to waste; go ahead, but it's not recommended. Maple logs cost a lot less and give almost as much experience as yew logs. No one ever said that this was easy and it's not but keep on going.

They give you extra experience you can cash in in bulk after a inventories full of supplies. These don't do much on their own, but the experience adds up over time and helps a lot in the long run.;
, These appear randomly throughout the world, and you can tell there is one nearby when roots start appearing at your feet. You can cut these down and, depending on your level, can receive up to 115k experience per hour chopping these down.

, Once a day, or twice if you decide to reset the limit using vis wax, you can gather resources from divine trees. When possible, you should chop from yew trees. You should not gather from magic trees if you are doing it purely for the experience, as harvesting one magic log counts twice towards your limit.

, If you are in a clan with the Woodcutting skill plot, you can cap your resource limit there for a rate of 95k experience and hour with a tier 7 plot and rank 3 fealty.

, You can get the Lumberjack outfit from completing the Temple Trekking minigame and killing the undead lumberjacks. These offer 1% experience bonus per piece of the set you get, meaning the full set can yield a 5% increase in exp. Summoning the Beaver familiar can invisibly boost your level by 3, letting you chop logs faster, but not chop higher level trees.

, You should always use the highest level hatchet in available to you. An easy way to do this is to buy a dragon hatchet early on and put it in your toolbelt, and until you get the level for it it will act as the highest level hatchet you can use. The crystal hatchet is the highest level hatchet in the game, however it requires access to Prifddinas, so when you can use it, you should.

, Chop normal trees. The best place to do this is the area West of the Varrock east bank. Here are a lot of normal trees, and it is pretty close to a bank. There are also oak trees here, so its easy to move up levels.

, Chop oak trees. You can do this is multiple locations. The best include West of Varrock bank again, however they are spread out pretty far. You can also go to Draynor Village north of the bank, where there are four in a square formation. You could also go to Seers Village where there are 2 directly south of the bank.

, Chop willow logs. The best place to do this is south of the Draynor banks, right by the fishing spot on the ocean. This place can get crowded, however, so if there are too many people there, you can go North of the Seers Village bank and chop there.

, Chop teak logs. You need 100 trading sticks, which you can buy on the GE, to enter. Here are lots of teak and mahogany trees. Banking is not recommended, as it is a long walk to Tzhaar city to bank, and it is quite far from the lodestone. If you have porters, it is great money to teleport them and their special logs to the bank and turn them into planks.


Alternatively, you could keep chopping willow trees to 45, then chop maples until 60, and yew trees until 68.

, Cut chopping Ivy. There are a variety of places to do this again. You could either cut this behind Varrock Castle or on the south wall of the Falador walls. These don't give you any logs, removing the need to bank and making these very AFKable. These do drop bird's nests however, so keeping your sound on and listening to these is a good choice.

, Chop crystal trees. These trees become active and inactive on a 2 hour rotation, meaning joining a friends chat dedicated to chopping this could be a good idea. These also give no logs, meaning again they are very AFK.


If you wish to gain lots of money from this in exchange for slower EXP, at level 95 you could start cutting elder logs. These logs are worth nearly 5k a piece, meaning a full inventory is worth over a hundred thousand.

(Please note after release of Evolution of combat, Prayer and Constitution do not give combat levels);
, Once you learned the basic of the most skills, try to stick with a stick that you get along with. The point of Runescape is to be motivated and always make sure to have a plenty of fun! So head of and start to train your skill, with those raw resources sell them to Grand Exchange, or players nearby who are interested to trade of.

, Once you have enough money, spend on other raw resources that may acquire few gps (gold pieces), go ahead and start training other non-combat skills since they are going to be useful, much later when you start to get more experienced. In addition, if you are a P2P (pay-to-play) skillers, may acquire over millions of gps just to sustain their skills up and therefore it is always nice to make sure always focus on multiples skills, in case you get bored.

, In order to get levels in skills, you need motivation and most of Runescape players may know that Runescape does acquire a lot of motivation. Note since this guide have been recently updated, this are the new ways players get motivated in Runescape:

, This three, are commonly used amongst many players out there to make sure to that they are enjoying the game and also being motivated in order to keep their skills up high.

, Inexperienced skillers are required to make short term goals, such as achieving a level or the amount of resource required. Although experienced skillers are required to make long term goals, since you are going to experience a large amount of experience to gain till level up, make sure to set reliable goals. In addition, experienced skillers it is always great to make goals that relates to amount of experience they gain, instead of levels!

, Always keep in track of your time, and never try to play over the limit! Often, players tender to play Runescape for a long time of period, since they start to get addicted, which is quite bad in a way because they are losing motivation and not concerned with other things! Always keep in track of your time, and what is going on your Physical World and Virtual World!, Always play Runescape with your friends; clans are usually not the best because often leaders decide what each clan member should do, which ruins the fun! I highly recommend having active friends, who are interested on Skilling and Socializing! Remember that now days, the Runescape Community has change a lot, and people always got to adapt with the new environment.

, There is no secret in Runescape, it acquires trial and error and search new ways to enhance your efficiency on training your skills since searching new methods will always help you out to boost your skill up!

Start by selecting a name that suites YOU.,
Now you need to start training your range.,
Now It's time to train Mage.,
Now here comes the attack and strength part!",How to Make a F2P Hybrid Pure in RuneScape," Have a name with no numbers unless the replace a letter such as: hybr1d pk. Then complete the tutorial island without getting attack and strength to 3. Once you are off, you can go to the the knight down the ladder in Lumbridge and obtain the 2 exp lamps. Spend them both on range. Now you can either go to barbarian village and get the other exp lamps or you can just carry on with training your range.;
, Here is a brief range guide 1-80. Please do as it says even if some parts are long. 1-10 chickens, 10-20 cows, 20-30 barbarians (level 7), 30-45 barbarians (level 17), 45-60 Minotaurs (level 27), 60-80 flesh crawlers. The 1-60 won't take long at all but then the 60-80 will take some more time.

, 1-3 wind strike, 3-11 confuse, 11-19 weaken, 19-55 curse (pretty long), 55-60 high alchemy. You will mainly use bind with Mage but you will need 60 Mage to hit constantly, (trust me).

, ALWAYS USE SCIMITARS FOR TRAINING! Now, train on the same NPC's as range. But do this formula: 15str, 10att, 25str, 20att, 35str, 30att, 45str, 40att, and then all the way to 80. Make sure you do that formula.


Now you should have the following stats: 40att, 80str, 60mage, 80range, 70+hp 55-60cb! ^o^
Money making. Woodcutting! 1-15 normal trees, 15-30 oaks and 30-60 willows. once you reach 60 woodcutting you will make money fast! Go woodcut yews behind Lumbridge castle and bank at Draynor. This is truly the best place to woodcut yews! If you don't think so, try it out. there's hardly any people so you get 1/4+ of an inventory of yews in one tree and the banks isn't far away either!

, When you have a choice of either Woodcutting or Mining to get out, it would be better if you picked Woodcutting, since it is more relaxing and easier than Mining. It is your choice however.

, This should give you about 10k gold. From this, you are going to want to buy bird snares, 4 small fishing nets and 4 rope, and 5 box traps. This is used to train hunter, an integral part of being a zerker., You are going to want to hunt Crimson Swifts west of Feldip for a while, then switch to swamp lizards, and finally to red salamanders. As soon as you get the level, you are going to want to hunt red chinchompas until you can hunt black chinchompas in the wild. Keep doing this until 99 hunter, if you have the patience. However, you can get PK'ed a lot, and that is a lot of chimchompas, so you can stop earlier if you like. For some good money, you can sell off the red chimchompas, however you are going to need them later on, however the starting money is hard to argue with. Choose whatever you think is best.

You may want to go to Puro Puro and hunt Dragon, Ninja, and Magpie implings for the loot to help boost your cash stack if you choose not to sell your red chinchompas.

, This quest can be started by talking to the lady Almera north of Ardougne. This quest is simple to complete, and there are many complete guides to be found . This will level you up to about 40 attack and strength. From here, you are going to want to buy some runes for magic spells and start the Fight Arena quest. You can safespot the monster behind the giant skeleton, making this quest very easy. You will gain some attack experience from this, as well as some thieving experience., You are going to need to eventually get to level 99 strength to be a true zerker pure. There are many ways to do so in the ways mentioned, however some of the most popular include rock crabs in Rellekka. Doing slayer is also a good idea, as it gives you great money while also training your account., It can be good to train it higher, as with a higher level your prayer potions restore more and you have to drink them less, however the main purpose of getting this is for 3 reasons. The first, being to get protect from Melee, which let's you complete the next step as well as the Fight Caves, as mentioned later. Second being so you can use Smite, which can be useful in high risk pks. Third, and most importantly, being able to use Piety. Piety gives a 25% boost to defence, a 23.33% boost to strength, and a 20% boost to attack , which of course can make your hits much higher and fights go much quicker., You are going to need at least 43 prayer for this, as mentioned in the above step. You will probably be doing this with melee, unless you already have your range up, so that will make this fight much more difficult. Follow the guide linked above for a comprehensive guide. The point of this is to get the Fire Cape, which gives a strength bonus of 4 and 11 defensive bonuses., Again, 43 prayer is almost necessary to completing this quest, as without it the monkey guards will hit insanely high on you. There are many guides that can be used to complete this quest. The purpose of this quest is to unlock the ability to use the dragon scimitar, a powerful weapon with almost the same stats of the whip, however only about 100k. It is highly used, and is recommended for use in fights.


Very carefully choose your reward for this quest. Doing this wrong will ruin your account. When speaking to Daero again, be sure to click the Strength and Stamina option, it will still give you defence experience, however it isn't enough to bring your level above the desired level.

, In the end, you will be getting 94 magic for use of the spell ""Vengeance"", which is very useful as it returns up to 75% of the damage inflicted to you back to your partner. However you only need 65 magic for the next step. You may want to consider profitably options such as barrows or alching, as money will almost always be a concern for your account, and any bit helps., There are a number of requirements to start this quest, including 60 mining and 61 crafting. However, it allows access to the Lunar Spellbook, which as previously mentioned, gives you access to the Vengeance spell. There are, again, many comprehensive guides for you to follow out there. , Get your range level to about 75 range through conventional means, then start chinning. Grab your black (and red if you have them) chinchompas and head back to Ape Atoll. Bring an emergency teleport, 6 super ranging pots, 18 prayer pots, 2 super antipoison(++ if available) and an emergency piece of food (shark). Head back to the tunnels in which you got your greegrees and start killing the monkey zombies. Have them all aggro you in a 9x9 square, as to maximize your experience. Pray melee from the monsters and you should never be able to get hit as long as you keep your prayer points up. Do this to 99 range if you can, or until you run out of chinchompas., Head to Barbarian assault and start grinding out floors. To get the torso, you are eventually going to need to kill the queen, so you are going to have do all 10 floors before you can get this item. However, it is not lost on death, and if you are quick enough, you should only have to get this once. This offers great offence statistics and you can't lose it., You are going to need to go to the Warriors guild north of Burthrope and start killing cyclopes for a defender. You are going to need lots of tokens, and using the armor reanimator gives you experience and lots of tokens at the same time. You have to get every tier of defender before the next, so expect to spend some time here., With 99 strength this should be a breeze. Raise your attack level to 60 so you can wield your dragon scimitar and your defence to 45, but no higher so you can wear your fighter torso. If you train any higher you will ruin your account, so be very careful here., With your Fighter torso, fire cape, defender, and dragon scimmy, there is not much left to buy. Your big ticket item is the Berserker ring. However, for a helmet, buy a berserker helm (hence the name) and for an amulet, an amulet of glory. If you are very confident/rich, you could try an amulet of fury. You are going to want to buy a Dragon Dagger (p++) as your spec weapon. From here, buy a super set, along with equal numbers of sharks and cooked karambwans. You may want to buy some prayer potions as well., You are going to face all kinds of account builds at this level, so be prepared. From Void Rangers to Dharok Bombers, you are going to face lots of enemies that can hit just as accurately as you can, so be prepared for anything.

When you die, you have to teleport with a glory and pick up your fire cape, torso, and defender from where you die, otherwise you are going to have to do all that work again!

At this point, you should have 20k gp, some cool boots, gloves, and 2 XP lamps giving 500 XP each. Spend these lamps on defense. You may also wish to do the Swept Away Quest for additional XP.






With your newly earned money, you may want to buy some armor and accessories, or use it to make some more money. Remember, the more money you have, the easier it is to make more.

, 13 combat with 400, or 27 combat with 990). If you wish to do this, do not train by killing monsters. You will have to use XP lamps, and other passive means of getting XP.

If you wish to train hitpoints too, you're going to have to find a weapon. Some suggestions include an Iron Dagger, Iron Scimitar, Blurite Sword, Silverlight, or a Runecrafting Talisman Staff.






Some suggestions for enemies to train on are monks (near Edgeville), cows (for their hides, which are worth decent money), chickens, or goblins (the last three can all be found in Lumbridge). Remember that bones are worth a fair sum of money and collecting these could be a good source of income. Do not bury these bones as it will increase your prayer, which does affect your combat level.







,

When you hit 40 defense, you can wear any type of Rune armor, except for the platebody (Dragon Slayer quest required). If you've made a lot of money, you can buy something fancy, like gold trimmed. You may even want a gold trimmed wizard robe for style, as you can't wear a gold trimmed platebody.






If you are still F2P, note that continuing your defense will be extremely slow. If you want to continue your defense, membership will make things a lot easier. However, if you wish to stay at 40, you can always train skills, and earn money, and improve your character.

",How to Make a Hybrid Pure in RuneScape," This isn't hard, look at the directions and calm down. Also remember not to EVER train defence.;
, Begin by ranging these (Mind you, picking up all feathers, and possibly bones.) Once you hit 10 ranged, use your runes to cast as many spells as you can. You should be 4-5 magic. Once you are done with this, begin training strength until you hit level 10.

, Just go to Lumbridge, cross the bridge, and follow the path past the cows. Sell all your feathers and bones. Buy about 100 bronze arrows, an iron scimitar, and as many mind runes as you can and an air staff.

, Cast wind strike with your new air staff until you reach 10 magic. If you have spare runes, get 13. Begin training your ranged as much as you can, and stop at 20. Pick up all cowhides and bones. Train attack to 5 and strength to 20. Continue this process, selling all hides and bones. Get a willow shortbow at 20 ranged, and begin using fire strike at 13 mage. With melee, get 30 strength then 20 attack and use a Mithril scimitar. once you hit 30 range, strength, and magic, you should be able to pk for a bit(if the cowhides and bones offered you enough profit.)

, Check the world map to know how to get there. It is to the west of Varrock. Make sure you have at least 300 bronze arrows, then head to the long hall. Shoot barbarian meleers across the tables until you are 40 ranging. Shoot fire strikes at them

, Melee the barbarians now, right? WRONG.

, Go down the hole in the middle of barbarian village, and begin by training on the goblins. Continue this until you are 30 attack. Begin ranging and maging the nearby minotaurs. pick up all the iron arrows, and use them or sell them.

, Go to the house to the southwest of the G.E. and enter it with the key. Bring ranging/Maging equipment. Go to the end of the Hill Giant cave on the light ground, not the dark ground. Find a spot where you can safely range and mage the hill giants without them hitting you. Pick up all big bones and sell. Do this until you are 60 ranged and magic.

, Kill the goblins in the hole in Barbarian Village until you have 45 strength and 40 attack. Range and mage hill giants until about 65 range/mage.

,, You should bring about 40 fire blasts, a rune 2h, a strength potion, a maple short bow, whatever armour you want, and some lobsters to eat in your inventory. The only armour to really pay attention to is the Strength Amulet. Otherwise, you may want wizard robes, and green d'hide chaps and vambraces.

, You will lose all items upon death no matter what. Find a player to fight, and ask them to fight. If they say yes, drink a dose of strength potion and begin to range them. If they have defence, use fire blast a lot. If they don't, you can use fire blast sometimes just to hit them hard. When they are low health, they will most likely eat. When you see them at relatively low health, right when you pull up your bow to fire, wield the 2h and click on the opponent. The hits will combo, enabling you to possibly kill them. Rewind the bow if this fails, and continue.

, This is fairly simple. Just watch out for the dark wizards to the south of the south entrance - they can kill you in two hits right now!

, This is your first step in gathering money. First, sell everything you got from the tutorial quest to the Grand Exchange. Anything that won't sell, just bank if you want to save time, or sell to the general store. Then, bank everything you have, and complete the Stronghold of Player Safety. If you need help, consult the guide on RuneHQ. You will get two experience lamps/books, 10K, an emote (-.-), and some gloves. The experience should get you to 11 range.

, Again, there is a guide on RuneHQ. You will get 10K, four new emotes, and ownage boots =D. If you're not up to level 4 of the stronghold, don't do it. Although there is only one room full of enemies you are required to pass, and if your running straight to the exit, you will only be hit once.

, Simple enough, and not a problem since you have money now. Head to the Grand Exchange and buy one of each of the following items: Oak shortbow, willow shortbow, maple shortbow, leather calf, coif, leather body (not hard body!), leather chaps, studded chaps, leather vambraces, and about 500 steel arrows.

, This should be fairly simple, as it is only 9 small levels to train. Equip the oak shortbow, all of your arrows, leather calf, leather body and chaps, the boots you selected from the stronghold of security, and the leather vambraces.I recommend you still start at chickens, picking up arrows if you choose. Do pick up the feathers though. Also you may have to buy more arrows if you run out.

, This will be different than killing cows with wind bolt. You have to train magic WITHOUT training hit points. To start it off, do the quests Imp Catcherand Witch's Potion, getting you 9 magic (I think...). Now cast confuse on the Monk of Zamorak in Varrock castle until your can weaken, and weaken until you can curse, This curse until level 20 magic. This is very simple. Also, don't forget to wear full iron with no amulet and a staff of the rune you use most of, to save time and money.

, This is going to take a while. But you will get quite a bit of money. Buy more steel arrows (3-4K if you reuse them) and equip them. Equip the willow shortbow, coif, leather body, studded chaps, leather vambraces, and the same boots from security stronghold. Train range at cows, either north of Lumbridge, or south of Falador. This will take a while. Like hours, but there nowhere else where you can get money and experience at that level for your level. PICK UP AND BANK THE COWHIDES. Bones and meat are optional, but not necessary. Banking just the cowhides, you should have well over 100K.

, Buy what is called a ""pure set"", which is pretty much the dragonhide legs and vambraces. This costs around 5K.

, This does not take as long as 20-40 magic. Continue to cast curse on the Monk of Zamorak. Also, wear the vambraces, as they give you less of a magic bonus, making your spell bounce nearly all the time.

, This is just a basic mage-range hybrid. Most people making serious pures should become members to train and PK. Also, you may want to consider getting a defense level, to wear studded body, or rune and the dragonhide body. If you just want to PK at lower levels (below 40 or so), you should just stick with one defense.

Create new Runescape account and go through Tutorial Island.,
Sell all of the useless junk from Tutorial Island at the bank at GE (Grand Exchange).,
Train your player by using the cows in Lumbridge, but first obtain food at the GE, just in case your health levels become too low.,
Go back to GE after you've reached 20 in strength and sell all of the cow hides you have obtained.,
Go to the duel arena and tell people you are training.,Prepare to battle those who are in the 10-14 strength level, since you can now face them with good results.,

, Train your player on the cows until you have reached about 20 in strength. Collect all cow hides and deposit them in your bank. You will need to make trips back and forth to complete this step.

, Go back to the cow fields. Train strength again until you reach level 40.

, Nice players will usually let you kill them to train. Do this until you've reached about 50 strength.

,, Go for archers with low range and other people with Adamant Scimitar. Since other level 40 players stats are about 30 attack, 30 strength, and 30 defense you can hit way higher numbers than they can. Go for them when looking for your targets! If they have Adamant Armour, make sure you have food because it will take a while to kill them. This is due to the fact that they are defense ""noobs"" and makes it harder for you to hit them. Stay away from those with full Rune Armor until you increase your strength. Also remember you can't wear any decent armor since you haven't trained any experience into defence therefore the best armor for that is to wear some leather or low level mail. Also remember when you are dueling or killing enemies to switch your form of attack to strength as your strength proficiency will certainly help you in any situation, but be careful strength pkers are very common in this era of runescape, not to mention the other form of pure killers such as archers, defence and some magicians. Perhaps it would b a good idea to train your attack level to improve the weapon you can wield.

To create a Pure, first you need a Runescape account or if you already have a new account you can skip this step.,
Make a cool name for your account, don't add any numbers unless it matches our DP(display name), remember, you can only have 12 characters in your Runescape name e.g, if you name your character: 123rangepur << it isn't so 'eye-catching' and other Runescapers won't think your a pker (player killer) at all.,
If you have a Main account, and with good amount of cash e.g 10-100K or more, and a good Fletching level (members only), you can create a Range pure with ease.

,
Go to Catherby (members only) or to Varrock Range shop (Free player) and enter the Arrow shops.,
Not only you'll get arrows, but you'll also get Fletching XP for your Main account.

,
Add up the amount of arrowheads, and buy the same amount of feathers.

Before you even think about being a pker I highly suggest you play RuneScape on your main for a while and get the hang of everything.,
After you've completed the intro for your account, go around the goblin area and collect the respawning bones until you have a full inventory, then go to the G.E.,
If you have a main with lots of money to spend transfer the money from the main onto the pure and buy every single scimitar (dragon included if your a member) and buy a strength amulet, full iron armor and a team cape.,
If you're a non-member then kill chickens till 10 attack and 10 strength, COLLECT THE FEATHERS!,
If you're a member repeat but don't collect the feathers if you like.

,
From levels 10-20 train on cows, and COLLECT THE HIDES!,
Same thing goes for members but you don't have to pick up the hides.

, Then buy 200 lobsters, 100 strength potions and varrock teleports if you're a member.

, The feathers sell for 10gp each on the G.E., you will probably have around 900 feathers by this time which equals to 9k, buy a strength amulet with that and buy some other fancy stuff if you like.

,, They sell for a lot and keep collecting the hides and banking them till you have about 150 hides. Buy a black, mithril, adamant and rune scimitar with that money and also buy as many lobsters (cooked) as you can.

,, But you still have a long way to go if you wanna Player kill well. Train from levels 20-40 on monks in the monastery north of the barbarian village. It's usually crowded with bots so patrol one area of monks where the bots are too late.

If you do want to waste time doing that just repeat step 5 for money.

, It can be started by talking to Pikkupstix in Taverly. Once you've completed the quest, you will get level 4 Summoning and 275 gold charms. Save the gold charms for later.

, Go into the Stronghold of Player Safety (the entrance is the Jail Entrance west of the classroom). If you are over 13, find your way through the dungeon (which can be found behind a ""poster"" in the basement wall) after talking to the guard. If you are under 13, talk to Professor Henry after carefully reading all the plaques and take the test. You will be rewarded two lamps worth 500 XP each. Spend these on Summoning.

, (If you really want, you can skip this step) The quest can be started in eastern Barbarian Village, but you need level 5 Crafting (which can easily be acquired by crafting leather gloves/wool). You will receive a lamp worth 200 XP. Spend this on Summoning.

, Penguin Hide and Seek can be started by talking to Larry in the Ardougne Zoo. There are many clans out there to help find penguins such as ""world60penguins"" ""w60 penguins"" and ""w60pengs"".

, From here, you have two choices: get 1925 spirit shards, 275 pouches, and 275 iron ore (for granite crab pouches) or, get 275 spirit shards, 275 proboscis, and 275 pouches (for spirit mosquito pouches). If you chose the first, you will get approximately level 26 Summoning. If you chose the second, you will get approximately level 31 Summoning. However, the second will cost much more as each proboscis costs more than 3k.

, (Only if you don't already have level 30 Summoning). This is important as the lamps you receive from the next few steps require level 30 in any skill to use. Regardless, Penguin Hide and Seek should be done every week (Cold War and Hunt For Red Raktuber quests help immensely)., Each will reward you with a lamp worth 1,000 XP. Note: Whenever combat is required for a task, for instance killing a Jogre in the Karamja Tasks, you have to hit without damaging it (otherwise combat experience will be gained) and let a Ring Of Recoil do the rest of the damage. Damage can be avoided by drinking a Saradomin brew or by drinking a strength potion, setting the monster as a target, using the kick ability (making sure your strength is 0/1) and clicking somewhere to stop attacking it immediately. If damage is done accidentally, this can be solved by running, logging out and hopping worlds.

, To do this, you need level 72 Hunter. You can start this in the area marked by a hunter icon south of the Tree Gnome Stronghold. This gives about 50-100 charms per hour (depending on your Hunter level) and about 150k Hunter XP per hour. This is one of the best methods of gaining XP, giving up to 90-100k Summoning XP per hour at levels 95-99.

, You need a high level friend to be in a friends chat with you. Turn LootShare on and let your friend do the combat. Eventually, you get charms. The best monsters to loot share for charms are Giant Rock Crabs (located in the Chaos Tunnels) and Rock Lobsters (located in Waterbirth Dungeon). Although it is difficult to make it to Rock Lobsters on a low level account, it is possible with the use of Rocktails, a defence potion, and staying behind three or more people as you travel through the dungeon. (Please note a lot has changed due to the EoC update, this may no longer be a good method).

, Get experience by doing Penguin Hide and Seek, and get charms by hunting Charm Sprites, and doing LootShare. It is a lot of work (and may be costly), but don't give up! Good luck!

Mining and smithing: Can produce and mine high leveled ore, such as adamant and rune. Coal is very much needed as a resource, as it is required to make things out of steel, mithril, adamant, and rune. High smithing levels can produce higher leveled armor.



 


Fishing and cooking: Fish is one of the most used food to replenish life points. High cooking levels also means that you will no longer burn a certain kind of food/fish.






Woodcutting: Logs are used in a variety of things around RuneScape. Construction and firemaking are the two skills that use logs in some way the most.






Hunter: Despite the fact that the person is hunting an animal, they are not fighting them, such as capturing rabbits and butterflies.






Crafting: While F2P has a large disadvantage of leveling crafting, members have an array of possibilities. Magic battle staves can be made, as well as vials by blowing glass for members. Members can also create dragon leather armor, despite both free and members can wear them.

, You will eventually find the skill boring, but little to be known, non-combat skills are the most socialized ones. While you are cooking on a bonfire at the Grand Exchange, engage in conversations.

, There are aggressive scorpions in the Dwarven Mine section of the Mining Guild, so going back and forth from the guild to the bank is your best bet. Always have your ""auto-retaliation"" OFF. This will disable you to fight monsters if they try to fight/hit you.

Use teleportation tablets.",How to Get 99 Runecrafting on RuneScape (F2P and P2P)1,", You will need a certain type of talisman for the type of runes you are making. For example, if you wanted to make air runes, you would need an air talisman. Finding talismans are normally not that hard. Talisman are only useful if you don't know where the altar is, but you can easily search online for it. You can get them by:

Buying them in the Grand Exchange (easiest way, but takes a long time for the transaction to go through).
Finding them off the ground.
Killing Air, Water, Earth, or Fire Wizards, and other monsters who also drop talismans.
Completing the Rune Mysteries quest. (But you can only get an air talisman.)
You can also buy a tiara. This saves one inventory slot and costs much cheaper in the Grand Exchange.

, Get all of the rune essence you will need. You will need some because the rune essence will be made into the runes. You can get some by:

Mining it (Rune Mysteries prerequisite).
Buying it in the Grand Exchange. Rune essence prices fluctuate due to market trends.

, To make your runes, go to the altar that can make the runes you need. For example, if you want to make air runes, go to the Air Altar. If you do not know where it is, right click the talisman you are using and click ""locate."" When you arrive there it will only look like a big rock. The game calls it the ""Mysterious Ruins."", This is how you teleport to the alter when you are rune crafting. If this did not work, you used the wrong talisman or you didn't go to the right temple.

If you have a tiara, you have an added advantage because you can simply left-click on the large rock to enter the ruins.

, To do this, use your essence on the altar, which is near the middle of the area you were teleported to., Just use the portal and you will be back to where the altar was., If you want to go between altars and banks with ease, use the Varrock Teleport, Falador Teleport etc. as well as teleportation tablets.

, There are many bone respawns there and you do not have to kill anything. Also they respawn pretty fast if you go on an average world. And there might not be many people burying bones there. But make sure you do not bring anything that you don't want to lose as there are revenants that might appear and attack you. But if you do ever get attack by a revenant while burying bones there, go pray at an altar which is also in the chaos temple and if you have 37+ prayer you can defend yourself against the rev's attack.

In free-to-play worlds, the best kind of bones to bury are Big Bones, worth 15 experience points each. To obtain these, kill Hill Giants (level 28), Moss Giants (level 42), or Ice Giants and bury their bones until you have 99 prayer. Alternately, you can buy them from other players at the Grand Exchange.



, There are several different bones to bury and, as you would expect, the ones that give the most experience are often the most expensive. The current item that gives the most experience is searing ashes, giving 200 experience each, but costing 20k. These you would not want to bury of course, but use them on either a gilded altar or the Ectofuntus. Due to the ever-changing prices, the most cost efficient bone changes every minute, so you can find out here which is the most cost-efficient right now, World 31 often has many people with gilded altars you can use in Yanille. You can choose to use Dragon Bones if you want the exp fast and don't mind spending lots of money, or you can use infernal ashes if you want to save money but get the exp a bit slower. After all your bones have been used up, most hosts will have a hung amulet of glory so that you can teleport to Edgeville and get more bones.

, When you burn corpses on the pyre logs you can get quite a bit of prayer exp depending on which type of corpse you use. It is not the best exp per hour but it can be used as a break from the monotony of sacrificing bones.

, The Ectofuntus is potentially the best prayer exp in the game, giving 4x the normal exp gained from burying the bones, compared to the 3.5x gained from the gilded altar, however you can't use as many bones per hour as the gilded altar.

To use the Ectofuntus, withdraw 13 bones or ashes, 13 buckets, and your ectophial from completing Ghosts' Ahoy. If you do not have this, simply bring 14 bones and buckets. Go to the Ectofuntus via the Ectophial or walking. Go down and use the buckets on the pool of slime, then go back up and use your bones on the bonecrusher upstairs. If you are using ashes, you can skip this step. Then, go to the Ectophial on the ground floor, and click worship. You will be rewarded with prayer experience and Ecto-Tokens

, These can be competed once a month. If you pick the god that corresponds with the area, you get a nice sum of Prayer and Construction experience, as well as a free altar. This isn't much as it can only be done once a month, but it adds up."

You are going to want to use your best air spell on them, so buying an air staff is recommended. Armor and food are not really needed for this step as goblins do not really hit very often.;
, Take an earth battlestaff, as the cockroaches are weak to earth spells. You can kill the Cockroach Drones or Cockroach Workers. for their drops, as they drop gems often and rune items, you can quite easily make some money here. Kill these until around level 35

, Buy yourself an Air or Fire battle staff, and lots of either fire or air runes respectively. Food is a must for lower levels, wearing mystic robes is also recommended. Cast Fire Bolt on the Ice Warriors. These warriors also can drop some pretty decent items, including medium clue scrolls. Kills these until around level 41, or farther if you are enjoying the drops.

, Look around for a lot of Ogres. Bring an air battle staff and a little bit of food and cast the best air spell available to you. These drop big bones which can be buried for Prayer experience, along with lots of herb seeds. On level 61 you can switch over to the water spell for a little extra damage. Train on these until about level 65.

, These can be found in Kalphite King's lair, and will auto-aggro towards you. These drops two herbs at a time, as well as a high rate of blue charms. They drop elite and hard clues as well. Train on these until 70., If you can find a large amount of enemies in a square of 3x3, then you can very easily AFK with protection prayers on and autocasting blood barrage to regain health. Some places to use are the Bandits west of Bandit camp (providing you have a zamorak item), the mummies in chaos temples, the zombie monkeys in the Ape Atoll caves, and for the best exp you could go to the Abyss and kill the monsters there.

You could also cast Earth Waves on the monkey guards in Ape Atoll. You can protect from melee from the monkeys, and then recharge your prayer at the altar nearby. If you have soulsplit, you could theoretically stay there for quite a while to kill them.
If you've completed Ritual of the Mahjarrat, you can kill glacors with Fire waves for about 175k experience per hour. Do this until level 81.

, These are level 86, are weak to earth spells, and give 852 experience per kill. They can be very easily killed, so you want to find a world with high respawn rates. Kill these until level 95.


You could switch to metal dragons in the Brimhaven dungeon at level 85 but be sure to bring an anti-dragon shield or antifire potions. You can get 100k experience per hour here, but you will also get dragon bones and potentially the dragon visage.

, These can be found on the final floor of the Polypore dungeon. These drop lots of Ganondermic flakes and polypore sticks, as well as lots of seeds that you can do to make your money back, but you need 95 slayer to kill these.

If you do not have 95 slayer, you can fire wave glacors after Ritual of the Majaharrat to get around 300k exp per hour as well as lots of charms.

, Switch to ancient Magicks and use Blood Barrage in the abyss. Pick a corner in the Abyss and turn auto attack on. The healing effect from the barrage should be enough so you don't need food, but bring food anyway just in case. If you have 94 Prayer, soul split can be helpful too. Do this until level 99."

, At level 7 you can enchant sapphire rings into rings of recoil, which are wanted by Player Killers. You are going to need quite a few cosmic runes, and a water staff are recommended. Sell the rings on the G.E for a little money back. Do thing until level 27.

, By using the same process, enchanting emerald rings into rings of Duelling can make you a lot of exp, along with quite a chunk of change, do this until level 33, or 55 if you really need the money.

, This is located northwest of Falador and due west of Taverly. These wines cost several thousand due to their use in Super Ranging potions, however this place is often overrun bots, so it can be hard to find an empty. Do this until level 43.

Alternatively, you can telegrab items below Varrock Bank for some money back, however that ruby ring will be forever out of reach.

, At level 43 you can cast superheat on ores that you could smith at furnaces to turn them into bars.

Steel and gold are good choices if you have a low smithing level, however if you have above 65 smithing, you can actually make money doing adamantite ore or runite, making large profits. Do this until level 55.







, Things like Yew Longbows will almost always net you profit when you alchemy them. You will need a lot of nature runes and a fire staff to do this. Continue this until level 58, or until level 99, as this is one of the few methods that will always net a profit, and it is relatively AFK.

, This spell requires the Watchtower quest to be completed. It takes 2 law runes and 2 earth runes, so having a mystic earth staff can help cut down on costs. You can continuously cast this for about 100k experience an hour.

Alternatively you can make these on tablets to save some money, however this is slower and the tablets are hard to sell. Do this until level 68.

, This is a lunar spell, so you have to complete Lunar Diplomacy to use this. With the use of hotkeys, it is possible to empty and refill a fishbowl in very rapid succession, resulting in huge exp gains, as each casts nets 65 experience. Using a mystic steam staff can help cut down on costs depending on how much it costs. Do this until level 71.

You can also do this to empty vials to make some money back, however you won't break even.

, This is again using Lunar Magicks. Using hotkeys it is possible to do 4 casts in a single animation, filling the inventory quite quickly. If you need the money, you can then open the hunter kits and sell the box traps for a few hundred each. Do this until level 80, Starting at level 77 you can cast this spell. Have 13 buckets of sand and 13 seaweed in your inventory, and then using this Lunar Magic spell. This gives 40k experience an hour, but you can make quite a bit of money as people need this for glassblowing., At level 80, you can use this Lunar Magic spell to make unstrung amulets into strung. This takes quite a bit of time to stock up on unstrung amulets, so you may want to start buying them. This offers both crafting and magic experience, up to 130k an hour total. Do this until level 86., The most cost-effective way to do this is with teak logs, as it offers the lowest Gp/xp. You can combo this with construction, or sell the planks back to get some of your money back. You can continue doing this until 99 Magic!"

You can then use these on rabbits for great exp. This is about 10k experience per hour, however level 20 takes only 5k experience, so it should only take about 30 minutes at max.;
, Catch Tropical Wagtails These are located in the Feldip Hunter Area, just north and east of Oo'glog and north east of the Hunter expert. You can place 2 bird snares to catch these at level 20. A successful catch rewards you with feathers, bones, and raw bird meat.

, Cobalt skillchompas. These can be found north of the Grand Tree, and accessed via a shortcut behind it needing 19 agility. Trapped with a box trap, these are stackable, and are worth several hundred each, so keeping them and selling them is very worth it.

, Swamp Lizards. Located East of Canfis, you are going to need at least 3 ropes and 3 small fishing nets to set traps for these. These are located in the Mort Myre Swamp, so ghasts can be an issue. The lizards are used in Summoning training, and are worth well over 1k, and banking them is worth it.

, Viridian Skillchompas. These are located south of Port Phasmatys. Caught with a box trap, stackable, and worth it to keep as with all the skillchompas.

, Red Salamanders. The are located at the ZMI altar south of West Ardougne, next to the altar. These are caught with rope and small fishing nets, however they are not worth much. Your best bet is just to release them as soon as you get them to save efficiency, as there not any viably banks nearby anyway.

, Azure skillchompas. These are located East of Relleka, in the snowy hunter area. Buying a snowy top and legs is helpful, as it allows a higher catch rate. You need box traps again, and they are again stackable and valuable, so keeping them is recommended.

, Greenwalls. These require Regicide to be completed, and having a bonecrusher and herbicide would be an advantage. These give you 18-21 greenwall spikes, worth 200 each approx. They also give you bones and grimy herbs. These are located north of the Elf Camp.

, Crimson Chinchompas. These are located near the Desert Quarry, and are caught with box traps again. They are worth very high amounts, nearly 2k. You can put 5 traps down at a time here, so you can make massive amounts of profit and experience if you want to.

, You can do this minigame once a day every day. Simply go to Tree Gnome Stronghold and find Nyriki's Portal near the Agility course and climb in the portal. Catch butterflies and give them to the Big Chinchompa. You receive large amounts of experience, along with different tickets that allow you to hunt in personal hunting area, free from other people.

Summer Pies. These increase your agility level by 5 levels, making it much less likely to fail the obstacles.
Weight-reducing items. There are multiple items like this, the most notably helpful being the boots of lightness from the ""Temple of Ikov"" quest and the spottier cape, requiring 66 hunter and costing 1k, can help you not use energy as quickly when running these courses.
Sure-footed Auras. These cost loyalty points that you get from having consecutive months of membership. They make you not able to fail obstacles for 20 minutes, and upgrading it can make this boost last up to 40 minutes, with an hour cooldown.;
, This is located near the entrance to the Gnome Stronghold, and gives a rate of 6,800 exp per hour. Doing this to level 18 will take approximately 31 minutes.

, Travel to Yanille and go just outside the Watchtower. There should be a trellis you can climb to get into the tower. Go back down the ladder and repeat the process. You can expect around 9,000 exp hour with this method.

, After completing the ""Cold War"" quest, you are granted access to make clockwork suits. Make at least 4 of them, and using the EoC combat bar, put the ""wind"" action and a wound and unwound suit to your action bar. Wind the suits up using a button, and click on them at the same time. It's best done in a confined area such as the ledge area of the Barbarian Outpost course. You get around 30,000 experience per hour with good efficiency.


Alternate Method. Do the Barbarian outpost agility course just East of Barbarian Assault. You will need to complete the Bar Crawl Miniquest to gain access to this area. This method gives between 13 and 14.5 thousand experience per hour.

, Use the portals to get to 51 wilderness, and run to the far western side of the wilderness. Walk up the balancing bar and do this course. You will fail a lot with this course, so bring a lot of food, preferably summer pies. This course gives about 40k experience per hour.


Alternate method Ape Atoll Course. This course requires the Monkey Madness course to be completed, as well as you to have your monkey Greegree on you. This course gives about 25,000 experience per hour.
Alternate method: Werewolf course. Complete the Brain of Frankenstein quest to get the Ring of Charos. Go west of Canfis and go down the trapdoor. Here, you go through the course, pick up a stick, and give it to the trainer. Be sure to give it to the trainer at the end of the course, or you can't pick another one up. This gives about 30,000 experience per hour.

, At 75, you can no longer fail the Atoll course, making its exp better than the wilderness course. You must've completed chapter 2 of Monkey Madness and be holding a ninja greegree to use this course.

, You gain access to this area after completing the quest Plague's End. You gain around 80k experience per hour on this course, or 100k if the voice of Seren is active.

Alternate method Advanced Gnome Course. This is just like the normal gnome course, except for a few extra obstacles. It's recomended to do at least 75 laps of this to get the agile top for the defense bonus.
Alternate method Barbarian Assault Advanced course. Similar to the advanced gnome course, this has a few extra obstacles as well. It's again recommended to do 75 laps of this to get agile legs.

Not every MMORPG character wants to spend all of his time killing monsters, or have it be the exclusive focus of his characters.,
A player cannot have his Runescape character engage in the fine art of thieving unless he is a Runescape member, but if a player has overcome this irritating barrier, his character is now free to steal from stalls, chest, or to pick the pockets of certain non-player characters.

,Starting a Thieving Career in Runescape

,
Thieving differs from many of the other members-only skills in that a character does not see a trainer to star it.,
When a Runescape character needs to improve his thieving skills, or a player gets tired of the poor loot achieved from pickpocketing, he has other options that a character can pursue.,
A player who wants his character to use his thieving stall on one of the many stalls in the world has to click on the skill, but he always should be wary of being caught.,
Total Runescape Thieving: Lockpicking and Stealing from Chests

,
While chests in most other fantasy MMORPGS use a lockpick to open them, these are two separate sub-categories of the lockpicking skill in Runescape.,
Lockpicking is not the best way to get treasure though, for a Runescape character with the thieving skill must attempt to open the locked chests of the world.,
Opening a trapped chest can ruin a Runescape character's day, so a player who knows what he is doing and cares about the health of his avatar should right-click on the lock and check for traps first using the thieving skill.

,Runescape Thieving Leveling Up

,
Thieving does not work differently than any other skill in Jagex's popular MMORPG.",How to Do Thieving in Runescape," In most games, there is a rogue class that lets players experience the thrills of being a thief in a pseudo-medieval world, but because Runescape is skill-based, a player must learn the thieving skill in order to detect traps and open locked doors.;
,,, The easiest way to start out is find a man or a woman who roam the streets of the many of the cities of Runescape and pick their pockets. Pickpocketing carries the lowest risk of all the Runescape thieving methods, but if a character fails he suffers some damage and is stunned for a few seconds. Pickpocketing farmers yields seeds that can be sold to players with the farming skill.

, Stalls contain better loot than most people's pockets and a slightly higher risk. Stall thieving attempts also yield more experience than pickpocketing attempts of the same level if the robbery is successful.

, If a shopkeeper catches a thief, the attempt is unsuccessful and the character can get yelled at, but being caught by paladins or guards is dangerous to a Runescape character's hit point total.

,, Lockpicking itself is used to gain access to doors that the owner wishes the player not to access, but some of the higher level items require an item appropriately enough called a lockpick that can be purchased from fellow players, or from pickpocketing desert rogues or bandits, according to Global Runescape.

, These chests, much like the ones that killed off the people who first played Dungeons and Dragons under the late E. Gary Gygax ,are trapped.

,,, The more the skill is used, the more experience a character receives and after a character gains a certain amount of experience in a skill, he can move on to more difficult targets. Like woodcutting, thieving can be a good money making skill, but the risk is much higher. If the programmers designed the skill correctly, this should be because the rewards of using the thieving skill in Runescape are much higher.

Cooking food successfully over a bonfire will earn you a little more experience than if you were to cook the same item over a regular fire.;
, Flour is the staple ingredient in making dough, which leads to making pitta, pizza, pie dough, and bread. Pie shells are generally a good money maker for beginners and pure players; this is because pies tend to give more experience than breads for cooking.

, While you will burn a lot of trout, lobsters, and swordfish, increasing your cooking level will increase your chances of making a lot of stuff. Fish, such as rocktails are in high demand for members and lobsters for non-members. Tuna is also used in potato dishes. To achieve a lower burning level or to avoid burning certain fish, complete the Family Crest quest to get the cooking gauntlets.

You can travel via the Daemonheim ferry located west of the Al Kharid bank (the boat ride is free), or you can travel on foot up the east coast of the Wilderness until you get there. Once you receive a Ring of Kinship, you can also use it to teleport there.;
, You will obtain a Ring of Kinship, which allows you to teleport to Daemonheim and form Dungeoneering parties. The tutor can also explain more about Dungeoneering, and even share some information on Daemonheim and its past.

, You need to bank all your items before you can enter Daemonheim, except the Ring of Kinship and an Orb of Oculus, if you have one. Don't worry, weapons and armour will be provided inside the dungeon.

, It is advisable to wear your Ring of Kinship to save inventory space. At this point, you can form a party. There are two ways to raid a dungeon: in a party or solo.


To raid solo:

Right-click the Ring of Kinship.
Click on ""Open party interface"".
Click on ""Form Party"".
Choose a floor (if this is your first time, only floor 1 will be available).
Choose a complexity (if this is your first time, only complexity 1 will be available).


To raid in a party:

Right-click the Ring of Kinship.
Click on ""Open party interface"".
Click on ""Form Party"". Alternatively, you could ask to join someone else's party.
Invite other players to join your party. Try to recruit players that are in your combat level range. It also helps if they can access the same floors as you can.
Choose a floor (you can only choose floors available to all players in your party).
Choose a complexity (you can only choose a complexity available to all players in your party).



, There are two: They are located on the left and right hand sides if you face north and are just beyond the door to the castle. Once you have climbed down, you will find yourself in a room with various decorations and objects, and the Smuggler will be in the center. Items will be scattered on the tables, which are located in one corner of the room. Depending on the complexity you have chosen, there should be various kinds of food and equipment lying around.

, Keep the food close at hand, as it can heal you during combat. If you are on complexity 2 or higher, you can buy or sell items to the Smuggler. Be sure to pick up any coloured keys lying on the floor, as these are used to open certain doors.

, Most monsters in Daemonheim are aggressive and will attack you. Pick up any keys you find lying around, and collect the useful items that the monsters have dropped.

, The number of rooms you will have to work through depends on the size of your party and whether you have chosen to raid a small, medium, or large dungeon. Be sure to fight all the monsters you can, because fighting counts towards your Dungeoneering Prestige. It is advisable not to run away from a battle.

, Remember to turn your camera north first, before opening the map, or else the map will be very confusing. The boss monster room (if you have unlocked it yet) will be indicated with a skull symbol. If you do not raid all the rooms in each dungeon, you will receive less experience at the end.

, Take plenty of food (preferably short-finned eels or giant flatfish) with you. Once you reach complexity 2, you can fish inside Daemonheim. Once you defeat the boss monster, climb up the ladder at the end of the room to finish the raid.

, A pop-up will appear on your screen, tallying up your xp. When it has finished counting, you will be awarded a number of tokens. The number of tokens you receive is equivalent to one tenth of the xp you receive (rounding down). You can exchange these tokens for rewards with the Rewards Trader outside Daemonheim.

In addition to allowing you to use the slayer dungeon and master in Pollniveach, it doubles your points earned from completing slayer tasks permanently.
, Some masters have requirements, such as

Turael/Spria - Located in Burthorpe, this slayer master requires only level 3 combat



 


Mazchna/Achtryn - Located in Canifis, this slayer master requires level 20 combat, and you must have completed the quest ""Priest in Peril.""

Chaeldar - Located in Zanaris, this slayer master requires level 70 combat, and you must have completed the quest ""Lost City.""






Sumona - Located in Pollnivneach, this slayer master requires level 85 combat, level 35 slayer, and you must have completed the quest ""Smoking Kills.""






Duradel/Lapalok - Located in Shilo Village, this slayer master requires level 100 combat, level 50 slayer, and you must have completed the quest ""Shilo Village.""






Kuradal - Located in the Ancient Cavern, this slayer master requires level 110 combat and level 75 slayer.






Morvran. Located in Priffindas, which requires the Plague's End quest (that has it's own high requirements, level 75 is several skills). He requires level 120 combat and 85 slayer to use, and gives the most experience and points in the game.

, Different monsters have different sets of weaknesses, and knowing what to use against them is most of the battle. A black mask or slayer helm boosts damage caused to slayer monsters by up to 15%, and can speed up your tasks very well., Ancient curses, unlocked after completing the Temple of Sennistein, can boost all your combat skills by 20%, bring your efficiency up as well. If you have 95 herblore, use overloads if you can. If you cannot, bringing super or even extreme sets can work very well too., There are some tasks that, in means of raw experience, are not the best to do. These tasks may be good money, however they are not good enough exp to be considered viable, so consider these at your own risk.

TzHaar creatures. Not assigned very easily, but not worth it even with the fight caves.
Vryewatch. These have no drops aside from corpses, and are very bad exp.
Greater demons. Unless you want to kill K'ril T'sust'roth, these are very bad exp.
Desert Strykewyrms. Very spread out, few drops, bad
Mature Grotworms. Slow to kill, but can be worth it if you want to.

, Blocking and skipping tasks should always be top priority. Then, it is up to you whether to buy/upgrade your slayer helmet or to use slayer rings. Slayer rings allow you to teleport to select slaying rooms very quickly, however the slayer helm allows you to kill the creatures quicker. Neither option is definitively better than the other, so it's your call here., This minigame, which requires 85 slayer and access to Priffindas, shows you several slayers monster for you to kill in a row without banking. The first time you complete this, you will get 50k slayer experience, and then after that a reward book giving you an amount of exp based on your level."

, Cook trout. These can be found just dropped on the ground at Gunnarsground, or you can buy them raw in the Grand Exchange.

, Cook Tuna. You can often find these dropped by power fishers at Musa Point on Karamja, so going there can be an option, or buying them on the Grand Exchange is a good option.

, Cook Lobsters. These are commonly used by pkers and pvmers due to their cheap cost, so cooking them in some situations may actually make you a bit of profit.

, You get an unpowered set of gauntlets after completing the Family Crest Quest. You can then bring them Caleb in Gertrude's house just west of Varrock to change them to cooking gauntlets. These lower your chance of burning fish from swordfish on up.

, Cook shrimp. In the beginning, you will burn a lot, however you'll notice you'll burn very few near the end.

, Cook lobsters. At this level, you should burn very few, if any lobsters. These are again sought by pkers as they are very good food in the f2p worlds.

, Cook Monkfish. You stop burning monkfish at level 82, so you will be making pure profit, as they are used by PvMers and early slayer accounts, as they heal 1600 for a cheap price.

, Cook Sharks. If you are wearing your cooking gauntlets, you won't burn these either, and they are used in most pvp situations, as well as several bosses use them for the pvm dungeon.

Melee.,
Train to 67 Ranging and raise your prayer level to help you defend yourself.",How to Pick a RuneScape Combat Type F2P,";
,


As you start, the best combat type is mage, since at low levels you can hit the hardest with it.

, You could also be a hybrid.

, Train to 40 attack, and 60 strength as well as 25/31 prayer.


This is great if you fight in larger teams, or want to train outside of the wilderness. At this level you will find many large teams to fight with.

,


Range is ideal when fighting in small groups at the low level.
Mage.Becoming a mage becomes unimportant once you get to 42 combat. Until you reach 70 combat, there is no need to use mage, so picking another combat style is recommended.
Becoming a Range/2h pure is ideal for true Pkers especially soloers. Raise 40 Attack, 70 Strength and 70 Range for ideal results, with prayer as an optional stat.

Be sure to bury all bones whenever you are raising any combat level, as this accrues to valuable prayer experience.Grand Exchange. Go to the GE and sell the feathers you've collected, and buy a black scimitar(2.5k) if you can afford it. If not, buy a black sword.;
, Be sure to keep collecting feathers to sell at GE and bones to bury.

, Black metal is the best thing you can wield right now, and can be purchased for only five thousand gold, at the very most. Scimitars are the preferred model of weapons, as they are a combination of speed and strength. .

,, Some evil trees might attack you- just keep walking. You will reach a gated in area. Follow along the fence south, then east, till you reach the gate.

, Unlike chickens, cows can injure you. Eat anytime your hp lvl falls below 10.

,, If you have to eat the food you brought, click on a tree to cut it down, then use the tinderbox with the logs in your inventory to make a fire. Cook the beef on the fire. Keep killing cows until you get 20 attack, strength, and defense.

, Sell all your drops and buy adamant armor and scimitar.

, Then buy a rune scimitar. Kill Hobgoblins in the Edgeville Dungeon until you get 40 strength and defense.

, After doing Dragon Slayer do this last (Be around level 54 for this quest and remember to get food like lobsters), buy a rune platebody and train on Ice Giants or Moss Giants until your Attack is 60, Strength is 60, and Defense is 50. Ice giants are located in a cave south of Rimmington and the west of the F2P wilderness, and are the fastest experience possible for F2P players. Bring along two strength potions so you can inflict maximum damage on them and get more experience, faster and also bring food.

,, The following areas are only available to paying members. (Optional: if you want to double your rates, play the Stealing creation mini-game and buy the scimitar)

, Buy yourself a dragon longsword after completing Lost City and go to Port Sarim, whereby you can take a ship to the Pest Control island. This mini-game is the best experience for members. You get experience points for killing monsters, plus a redeemable-for-experience token to redeem with a Void Knight. Also, if you win, you get a sum of money (amount is Your combat level X 10). Go straight for the portals, and kill as many as possible before the game is over. Play Pest Control until your Attack and defense levels are 70 and your strength is 80. Another really fast way for XP is to complete the Creature Of Frankenstein quest and kill the level 25 experiments, they have 100 HP and that means you get 400 XP per kill.

, Should you be unable to harm the portals, switch back to monsters. If the portal you are attacking is destroyed, clean up all lingering monsters and close the gates before moving on. Use this strategy until your levels are as follows: Attack and Defense are both at level 90 and Strength is 99. But remember the Whip cannot train Strength so the Dragon Scimitar/Longsword are both good alternatives.

In the Melee Combat Experience section on the right, choose “Balance” to split XP between Attack, Strength, and Defence. For faster but more challenging leveling, choose “Attack” to focus 100% of your XP there.In the Combat Mode section on the left, select Revolution. You’ll automatically use abilities, greatly speeding up combat.;
, If you are losing to the recommended monsters in the leveling guide, or if you are using a lot of food or consumable items, you probably need better equipment. You may need to take a break from leveling to craft or purchase better weapons and armor.


If you’re still having trouble, look up the monster’s weakness online, or ask other players. Keep a slashing, crushing, and stabbing weapon around so you can switch between them. (Avoid monsters weak to Magic or Ranged, which will take longer to kill in melee.)

, Hunting these down is often not worth the time spent, since they last a limited time and are mostly random drops. That said, if you want a break from the giant-slaying grind, have some fun tracking these down:


Sacred clay scimitars are available from the Stealing Creation minigame.
Fallen stars (attack) are non-tradeable items only available to paid members as a random reward from the Treasure Hunt minigame.Brawling gloves (melee) are a rare drop or boss reward. They are most effective when fighting in the Wilderness, which may not be worth the risk of dying to other players.
Hati paws are only available during the annual January holiday event.

, Once you're training Attack past 60 or 70, combat will be very difficult without Prayer abilities. Bury bones to train your Prayer skill.

, Subscribing members should strongly consider completing Slayer challenges appropriate to their level. This won't always give you the fastest experience gain, but you'll appreciate it at high levels. The member-only Slayer skill allows you to defeat monsters that give great experience and drops at high levels.


If you are just trying to boost your Attack a little, rather than grind to the highest levels, this may not be necessary.

, You have quite a few options at this point. You could go north of Burthrope and kill the trolls in there, however they have few drops. You could head to Lumbridge and kill Chickens north of the castle and collect the feathers for some good cash later on. If you head a little farther north, you could go to Beefy Bill's fields and kill cows. You will make some serious money here, as Beefy Bill will bank the cowhides for you. Finally you could head west across the bridge and kill the goblins near the two huts.

, Get 10 gold to pay the toll, and head into Al-Kharid. Head upstairs into the castle and start killing Al-Kharid Warriors. They drop quite a few herbs, as well as as soon as you attack one the rest will attack you, making this very AFK-able. If you are low on health, pick up a few coins they drop and head to the kebab shop to the west. You can kebabs for 1 coin each here, and they can heal for up to 1000 health.

, Buy a dusty key from the Grand Exchange, only a few hundreds coins, then go south west from the Grand Exchange until you see a house with a locked door. Use the key on the door, and head downstairs. Here you can kill the hill giants. Be sure to pick up the big bones and bury them for easy prayer experience, and the limpwurt roots, which sell for a thousand each.

, Head down to the second level of the Stronghold of Security and head north until you find a room full of flesh crawlers. Kill these, preferably with a stab weapon such as a spear. They drop 42 fire runes and 2 nature runes very frequently, as well as many high level herbs.

, You have two options here. If you want the best exp per hour, head down to the Varrock Sewers and kill the Moss Giants. They don't drop too much, but they are weak to slash, allowing you to use a rune scimitar or a rune 2h sword with the most effectiveness. Alternately you could go to the fourth level of the Stronghold of Security and kill Ankous. They give decent exp per hour, as well as many expensive drops such as yew logs, mithril ore, and battlestaves.

, You again have two options. You could kill deadly red spiders in Edgeville dungeon. They have the highest exp rate in the game for free to player players, however have absolutely no drops as well as being poisoning. You could also go to the Forinthry dungeon or Wilderness crater and kill hellhounds. They give similar exp per hour, however can drop bones and charms more frequently.

, If you plan on maxing out your account, doing slayer alongside your melee stats may be worth it, as it will level up both skills at once. This will also give you access to some of the better monsters in later game that require high stats, such as abyssal demons.

, Your methods here are similar to that of free to play. Kill goblins, mountain trolls, or even consider cockroach drones for their common gem drops.

, Kill cockroach workers. They give decent exp per kill, and have noted ore drops, as well as very rarely dropping the coveted rune scimitar. These are found in the Stronghold of Player Security, accessed by a crevice in the ground south of Edgeville next to the Soul Wars portal.

, Kill Cockroach Soldiers. These are located in the same area as workers, they drop rune items very commonly, and even have a chance of dropping medium clue scrolls. They give surprisingly good exp for how low of level they are, and good drops as previously mentioned.

, Teleport to Caste Wars via a dueling ring and head East. Here you will find a lot of ogres. They drop seeds often, as well as a high rate of gold charms, higher than rock crabs. They don't really drop much else, but their exp is great. Alternatively you could kill moss giants west of Ardougne.

, Kill Hellhounds in the Taverly Dungeon. You will require a dusty key in order to access the area, or you could have 70 agility to use the shortcut to go to blue dragons, or 80 agility to use a shortcut directly to the hellhounds themselves. Using a Guthan's set or Vampirism aura negates the need for food, as well as soul split, but it is unlikely to have that. A charming imp may help, as they have one of the highest gold charm rates in the game.

, Consider getting 85 dungeoneering to access frost dragons. Not only would this give you chaotic weapons for later on, but they would give you access to this amazing money making and exp rate in the game. If you would not like to do this, travel south of the Bandit Camp to the Exiled Kalphite Hive and kill Exiled Kalphite Guardians. They drop blue charms and herbs frequently, as well as hard and elite clues.

, It is highly recommended to have a high slayer at this point, as almost all high exp giving monsters require 80+ slayer. If you have this, kill abyssal demons or Spiritual rangers in the slayer tower and GWD respectively. If you do not, kill waterfiends by teleporting to Barbarian Assault and then running south and jumping into the whirlpool after completing barbarian training.

, Again, a high slayer level is almost necessary. If you can, kill Airut for some of the best prayer and combat experience in the game, as well as dropping razorback gauntlets, bring in a hefty few million per drop. Automan tracers after completing The World Wakes is also very good with 95 slayer, as they drop noted high priced items like magic logs and sharks. If you cannot kill these, kill General Graardor in the God Wars Dungeon with his minions, or continue on waterfiends.

Once you hit 70 defence and attack, you may want to consider buying guthan's set, as it will allow you to stay at hellhounds indefinitely due to its healing factor., Along with their great charm drops for later in the guide, they are great experience along with drops. They drop two high level herbs at a time along with damaged chitin, which you can make into chitin scraps and sell for lots of profit., They drop lots of noted items, along with sharks to make your trips last longer. They also drop crimson charms 88% of the time, so picking them up will be well worth your while., Train Summoning and prayer.With the money you make from these creatures and the charms you picked up from kalphites and waterfiends, you should have enough to get 99 in summoning and prayer, maxing out your combat.

, What I would suggest would be to start training other skills (e.g. Woodcutting, Fishing, Runecrafting) - any skill that you can make money on. Another option is to start those quests! They can hand you a lot of quick experience that would take you a while to get. At this time you should at least have steel or mithril armor, depending on how you decide to make your money. If that be the case, train on Barbarians, OR monsters in the Stronghold of Security until you have 30 Combat.

, I suggest either scorpions, guards, or the elemental mages found next to Malignus Mortifier. They drop a good span of runes and talismans.

, If not, then stop and either work on Fishing, Mining, or Woodcutting. By now you should at least have adamant, or rune armor on you. I also advise you to think about starting the almighty Dragon Slayer, because it awards you a good amount of Defense and Strength experience. Otherwise, train on Hill Giants until you have 60 Combat.

, Yes, it is smart to have rune armor; no it is not too expensive your just lazy.

, You can keep on training, or you can kick back and relax and train other stats. If you wish to continue training, then read on. Train on Cockroach Soldiers until you have 80+ Combat. They can drop rune scimitars and rune square shields.

Go ahead and create your new RuneScape account.,
Now, consider why you want to be a specific combat type.,
If you are still set on becoming a specific type, consider whether or not you want to be a pure.,
Consider not training combat at all.,
Consider your Constitution level.,
Consider your Attack level.,
Consider your Strength level.,
Consider your Defense level.,
Consider your Ranged level.,
Consider your Magic level.,
Consider your Prayer level.,
Consider your Summoning level.,
Make a decision.,
Enjoy your RuneScape account, and remember that you won't get high levels overnight.

",How to Choose a Runescape Combat Type," Choose some generic clothes - you can always change your mind and go to the Clothing Shop in Varrock; however, you should make sure your boots are of a decent color, as you can't easily change them later. Your name shouldn't reflect your combat style anyway, so make it a good one.;
, Most successful RuneScape players train a little bit of everything. Perhaps you should just leave it to chance, and see where quests and moneymaking schemes take you.

, Pures avoid training combat skills they don't need, and only train the ones they do. Pures, when created correctly, are excellent at PKing for their level, but they can get attacked by more NPCs due to their lower combat levels.

, Skillers are known for having high total levels, despite their extremely low combat levels. The ability to harvest resources rather than killing for them can sometimes lead to bigger profits.

, Do you want to have it high or low? While most pures would like a lower Constitution level (it does raise combat), any XP lamps you find may be well invested in this skill. After all, it determines your hitpoints.

, Having a high attack level will allow you to wield better swords and become more accurate with melee attacks. It can be quite valuable, but many pures keep it at 40, 60, or 70 in order to train Strength instead.

, This determines how high your melee attacks will hit. Many melee pures aspire to have an extremely high Strength level.

, If you have high Defense, you can wear better kinds of armor, and attacks will hit you less often. Pures often tend to avoid training this skill.

, A high level in this skill will allow you to wield better bows and wear better light armor, and improve your overall ranged performance. This isn't a very useful skill for PKing until the best weaponry is unlocked.

, With high Magic, you can cast more powerful magic spells. This skill also appeals to some skillers, as it can be used to alchemize items as well.

, Once you get a fairly high Prayer level, you can pray against specific forms of combat to defend yourself. Even pures tend to train this skill.

, This is members only, but summoning familiars can turn the tide in specific battles; however, this skill is very expensive to train, and would be benefited most by a high combat level.

, Which skill sounds the best to you? Do you want to train more than one? Would you prefer to spend more time on non-combat skills?

Find monsters that have low defence, but high hit points.,

, When you attempt to level up attack, strength, and defence all at once, the experience is divided and balanced between the three.


Most players tend to sway with leveling up strength first, then attack, and defence last.

, The combat triangle severely makes a difference with what a person is wearing as defence material.


Magic is better than melee, but worse against ranged.
Ranged is better than magic, but worse against melee.

Consider being a warrior if you don't have much money.,
Try ranging.,
Be a mage.",How to Find the Right RuneScape Combat Type for You," You never waste that many gold pieces, and if you do, it's going to be on food or new armor or weapons. You can also hit mid range damage.;
, Ranging can be a little expensive because you have to buy arrows (unless you're a member and can make them). However, bows aren't too expensive, unless you're talking about the dark bow. (1.75m as of 1/19)

, You can hit very high damage but it is expensive. You have to buy runes; some are not very cheap and you need to buy lots of them. However, like ranging, it can be very easy to train if you fight something that doesn't have ranged attacks itself easily. All you have to do is go to a place where you see it but can't exactly get to it. An example is like in the Varrock sewers, there are zombies on the other side of the river or if you go to the edge of the dwarf mountain, you can see them but they can't get to you.

Consider becoming a member.,
You should train on medium level monsters until you are a decent level, preferably 90-100.,

Train with all your new equipment, and get your stats up!,
Get a good money making source to support your better equipment as you level up.,
Have fun!",How to Create a Good RuneScape Melee Fighter," Assuming you are not a member, you should highly consider this option. For only around $6 a month, you could greatly increase your characters skills and equipment, as well as have more fun!;
, This could take a few months, however.

, 90-100 is a good level for barrows armor. If you have 70 defence, consider saving up to buy a set. The best protection is Torags, while also being the cheapest. However, the other sets offer a special ability. If your one of the wealthier players, you should look more into this.

, Good weapons mean high levels of strength and attack. Try getting these both up to at least 70. Then, you could use the weapon provided with your barrows set, or even get a whip if your richer. Whips are extremely powerful, and even higher-level players use them. Also, carry a DDS(Dragon dagger), preferably with the highest application level of poison. They're special attack is devastating, and the DDS is extremely cheap.

, My favorite place to train at is the Ankous in the highest level of the Stronghold of Security, in Barbarian Village. These are great exp and they also will drop up to a few hundred K gold every hour, if your a high level. Also, if you have guthans you may never have to go bank for a long time. Always pick up the battlestaves, they are 10k each., Woodcutting, fishing, and mining are ideal. Barrows is also a great place to get cash, if you have luck.

, If you enjoy the game you won't give up on the game. Listen to music as you play to spice up your gameplay, as the RuneScape music can be boring as hell. Eventually, through perseverance and determination, (and time), you will be a high level with great equipment, and a huge sum of cash. Don't give up!

Understand the combat triangle.,
Budget your money.,
Make healthy choices.,
Build up your defence.,
Bring food and potions.,
Bury bones and train Prayer.",How to Be a Successful RuneScape Pker," This is just like rock-paper-scissors; mage destroys melee, melee crushes ranged, and ranged pierces mage. Melee fighters usually have metal armor on, which conducts magic very well, and a melee weapon, such as a sword, dagger, or battleaxe, that can easily hack through a ranged fighter's armor. Ranged fighters usually have leather or dragonhide armor on, which is very protective against magic, and used a ranged weapon such as a bow or crossbow, and have arrows to shoot at you, which are good at piercing mage robes. Mages tend to wear mage robes, which boost their magical ability, and fire magic blasts at you, which are conducted by metal armor, and therefore do more damage to characters with metal armor on.;
, Sometime or later, you funds will run out. Do you have an adequate source of income that you can rely on? If not, get on. Rune Essence is a good choice, as it provides a constant thread of money, and people also want to buy it. You can also make fair money by picking up ashes, which is fairly easy. Ashes sell for 43gp each, as of 8/26/2010. Save up. Do you really need that gold-trimmed black armor? How practical is it to buy some regular logs when you can just chop some trees down?

, Meaning, don't fight a player 20 levels above you. It is also not a good idea to fight a player equal to your level when you are carrying a rubber chicken, or have less than 10 health.

, Most players don't train defense, because they think ""What the heck? If I train attack and strength enough, I'll be invincible!"" That is not correct. While a player with high attack may still be able to hit you, if you have a high defence, you may be able to ""block"" most of their hits. Blocking their hit means that they don't hit you, or they hit you with as ""0"".

, If you are a F2P, then you only have access to the strength potion, which temporarily raises your strength. Food is a must! How else would you heal in level 41 Wilderness? Bring foods that restore a lot of health. Training your cooking skill is a good way to get high-energy foods for a ""discount"" price. You will only have to buy the ingredients.

, Prayer is one way that gives you an edge in RuneScape. When you get to higher level Prayers, you will have a huge edge over many players your level that have level 1 Prayer, or some other low level in Prayer. One example of this is if you can use the ""Protect From Magic"" Prayer, you have one less side of the combat triangle to worry about.

However, bots can also be found catching fish in Draynor Village, fishing for lobsters, or mining at the Crafting Guild. Bots can also be found picking flax and spinning it in Seer's Village and cutting down the magic tree's in Seer's village. The green dragons west of Daemonheim or West of Edgeville are also popular spots. The blue dragons in Taverly dungeon are also good spots. Many bots can often be found teleporting burthrope while runecrafting. They can also occasionally be found in the Dwarven Mines.;
, Does it seem computer-generated? Is it just random letters and numbers? Some botting programs change the username, and since it is software, it has little creativity. This step should just raise your suspicion, and you should not take any immediate action until the player is confirmed as a bot.

, Most the time a bot will not respond to your trade request or little ""hi!"" because no one is at the computer. Most Botters will bot during the hours of school/work or during the night 10pm-10am. Some modern bots can talk, however. See if they respond suspiciously, such as responding to the same question twice in the exact same way, or responding immediately.

, If they're mining, ask them their woodcutting level. If they're woodcutting, ask them their smithing level. If they respond with the skill that they are currently working on, they're either bots or are easily-tricked humans.

, Most Botters will bot during the hours of school/work or during the night 10pm-10am.

, Do they have most of their experience in one skill like Woodcutting or Mining? If so, it's probably a bot, since bots do tasks like these over and over.

, Do they do the exact same thing over and over? Do they respond immediately when the tree falls or the rock disappears? Do they acknowledge the fact that you're following them? Do they click on the exact same spots when banking? Plant marker seeds(Faruq in Al Kharid sells them)on the spots where they click to see if it disorients them.

, Almost all bots either allow a player to gain large amounts of money easily, which ruins the economy or gives them an unfair way to achieve levels regular players work for months to get.

, Go west to the bank. Get some money. Now continue west until you see some barbarians. Go to the helmet shop and buy a bronze helmet. Put it on. Now, go back to Varrock's bank and get a pickax. Go to the village and mine copper and tin.

, Then, you will see anvils.

, Make a bronze ax, a bronze square shield and a bronze chainmail. Smelt a bronze sword, too.

, Put the bronze dagger and the wooden shield in your bank.

, Cross the river and go north until you see a gate to the cow pen. Start fighting the cows until your level is 12.

, After you've reached level 17, go down the barbarian village dungeon. The gates will speak and ask you questions. Pick the correct answer to pass. You will see minotaurs, goblins and wolves. Train on the wolves until you are level 23. Now you can train on the guards of Varrock. Do so until you are level 26. Go into the Varrock Palace and fight a woman warrior until you are level 30.

, Train on jail guards you find if you go west (a lot!). They attack you automatically, so watch out! After you are level 35 or so, go to the Barbarian Village dungeon and train on level 27 minotaurs until you are level 39.

, Chop down some trees. Now go east of the palace and north, into the wilderness, the most dangerous part of RuneScape. Go north until you see level 28 hill giants. Fight them until you are level 44. Now go out of the wilderness. You will see black knights. Attack them until you are level 50. Now check the map and go to Falador. Train on level 36 and 38 white knights until you are level 59. Now go to Varrock again and take of your armor and shield. Don't remove your sword, though. Get your wooden shield and ask for a leather body. If you can't get it, just continue. Go south. You will see dark wizards. Go and fight with them until you are level 63. Now train on moss giants in the varrock sewers until level 80. Now go and train on lesser demons until you are level 100! Congrats you are a level 100!

Once you've found your target, or your target has found you, lay a freezing trap on the ground.,
If they don't have you targeted and are busy with someone else, release an aimed shot, then multi-shot, serpent sting, arcane shot, then spam steady shot until cooldowns are up for your main DPS shots.,
If your trap is on cooldown, and your target is advancing toward you, scatter shot him, and get more distance between you and the target, Concussive Shot, then start your cycle of shots.

,
If you find yourself against a healer, Scatter Shot, Aimed shot, Viper Sting, Concussive Shot, save silencing shot for when they're low and trying to get a big heal off.

,
Go for the healers first, because it's harder for someone to run away from ranged DPS, and if there's no one to heal the opposite faction you're PvPing against, they'll fall faster and easier.

,
If you're a Night Elf Hunter, you have a very good position if you decide to defend in a battleground.",How to Kill a Player as a Marksmanship Hunter in World of Warcraft,";
, If they come toward you, let your trap take them, then move back, and start the cycle over.

,,,, Get a cat as a pet, and teach it stealth, then when you go to defend, you (using Shadowmeld, the Night Elf racial stealth) and your pet can be unseen until it's too late for the enemy to react to your stifling shots. =)

Levels 80-90 Exiled Kaplhites.,
Levels 90-99 Waterfiends.",How to Achieve 99 Strength on Runescape," Go northwest of Burthrope and kill Troll Brutes. Giving 40 exp per kill with very low lifepoints, this is the best option for just starting out, as racking up the kills will be easy, making these levels going by in no time.;
, Go into the Chaos tunnel via the entrance north of the Grand Exchange. Maneuver your way around the chaos tunnels until you get to a room with Dag'on Hai monks. Due to a flaw in programming, these have very low life points, but have very high exp drops. Careful though, there are aggressive zamroak warriors here that can level you very quickly

, Teleport to the Relleka lodestone and head northwest. Here there will be an area with lots of rock crabs. These don't have very many exciting drops, but they make for great exp rates per hour, along with being mostly AFK so you can relax while training your stats up.

, Go to the hellhounds in Taverly dungeon. having 60 dungeoneering is a plus here, as you can access a resource dungeon with 19 hellhounds spawns in it. If you have it unlocked, soul split will make food nearly optional. These are also very afk and give great exp even for higher levels.

, Kill Living Rock Creatures in the dwarven mine north of falador. Along with their noted ore drops, every now and then a living rock patriarch will spawn, giving you a guaranteed 120k worth of items every time you kill it. This is great exp and great money if you need it.

, If you have 85 Dungeoneering, kill frost dragons. These give 1 thousand exp per kill, along with their bones being worth well over 10k each. However, if you do not meet this level, kill daggonoths. These are located namely on Waterbirth Island near Relleka. The bones they drop can be buried for considerable EXP and their drops are not bad either.

, These give a ton of blue and crimson charms, lots of herbs, and damaged chitin. This combined with the great exp they give is a perfect training spot from these levels. They even sometimes drop sharks, letting you prolong your trips.

, Located in the Ancient Cavern near Barbarian Assault, these give upwards of 300k experience per hour, and have noted drops like water orbs. Bringing a bunyip here eliminates the need for food, as raw lobster drops are very common. These have been proven to be the fastest xp per hour at this level, so you'll be sticking to these for a while.

Choose the race you want to play.,
Partner up with another player for questing.,

Start doing instances as soon as you can.,
Keep questing.,
Start building your talent tree.,

Start equipping the right gear.,
Use items to give you buffs.,
Get your rotation down.",How to Level a Holy Priest in World of Warcraft," Every race except orcs can be a Priest, and all the starting areas are pretty much the same difficulty. Just choose what you like the most.
, Starting areas are often filled with other new players. Consider reaching out to another player in order to do quests together. This will make it easier on you, and you'll be able to level faster., Getting to this milestone is a little slower playing as a Holy Priest, but it is still not very difficult. Take this time to learn how to play the game and become familiar with your skills, both offensive and defensive., Instances are special dungeons you can run with other players, and it's easy to find a group using the in-game Dungeon Finder. Instances are crucial for a Holy Priest since you can focus on healing while other players focus on tanking and DPS (damage per second). You unlock the first instance at level 13., If you can, do quests with a party to level faster. Make sure you stay in areas that are equivalent to your level. If you go into a questing area that is much higher, you'll quickly find yourself in trouble, especially as a Holy Priest., You will begin earning talents at level 10, and you'll continue earning them with each level. As a Holy Priest, you'll want to work on the Holy tree, but there are some other useful talents as well. If you are not having trouble soloing, you can focus on your healing build right away. Here are some talents to consider as a Holy Priest: Desperate Prayer - an instant-cast self-heal
Angelic Feather - gives the player a speed boost
Surge of Light - gives you the chance to have a free Flash Heal
Twist of Fate - gives the chance for a boost that gives you 15% extra damage and healing

, As you start to reach higher levels, consider joining forces with a guild. Guilds are communities of players, and often times, there will players around your level that you can group up with. As a Holy Priest, this is really going to help you get through some of the tougher questing zones. To find a guild, look in the Guild Recruitment chat channel, or make your own post in chat. You're sure to get some responses!, Glyphs are a specific enhancement that can boost your character stats and change your cosmetic appearance. You start unlocking glyphs at level 25, but the higher your level gets, the more important it is to have your major glyphs in place. Some of the most useful glyphs include:

Glyph of Renew - Renew heals for 25% more, but active time is reduced by 3 seconds
Glyph of Deep Wells - gives you an extra Lightwell charge
Glyph of Circle of Healing - Circle of Healing now heals an additional target
Glyph of Binding Heal - Binding Heal now heals a third target

, There are more ways to get experience in WoW then just through questing. Build your professions, explore the maps, and do dungeons in order to mix it up a little. Your gathering profession, such as herbalism or mining, will give you some experience when you gather materials. Exploring new areas and unlocking the map will also give you some experience boosts. Instances sometimes have quests, but also tend to have harder enemies with great experience rewards. This can keep you from getting too bored or frustrated as you level your Holy Priest., Now that you are approaching max level, you'll need to start worrying about your stats and find equipment with the primary stats you need in order to fight against the toughest enemies. The best equipment can be found through instances or raids, and it will vary depending on the class and style you are playing as. Having good equipment is key to reaching the final level. As a Holy Priest, your most important stats are:

Multistrike
Haste
Intellect
Mastery

, Now that you are getting to the higher levels, you'll be participating in more difficult quests and instances. Use items to give you a boost, otherwise you might find yourself getting frustrated as you encounter some of the harder enemies in leveling dungeons. Food items and flasks should always be on hand. Some good choices for Holy Priests include:

Feast of Blood/Feast of the Waters - +75 in second highest stat
Calamari Crepes - +100 Multistrike
Rylak Crepes/Fiery Calamari - +75 Multistrike
Greater Draenic Intellect Flask - +250 Intellect

, Now that you are getting close to the highest level, you'll want to start preparing for end-level raids and instances. Get used to the skills you'll want to always have your bar, and practice pumping out those heals. As you start doing some of the harder instances to get through the final push to 100, focus on how you can best make battles survivable. The most important skills for Holy Priests are:

Heal
Flash Heal
Renew
Prayer of Mending

Understand the process.,
Gather enough gold.,
Open the Auction House.,
Select the ""Game Time"" category.,
Place a bid or buyout the Token to acquire it.,
Right-click the Token in your inventory.",How to Get World of Warcraft for Free2," On April 6th, 2015 an update to World of Warcraft introduced WoW Tokens. These are items that players can redeem for 30 days of a World of Warcraft subscription. Tokens can be purchased for real money and then sold in the in-game Auction House for Gold. This allows you to effectively purchase your subscription from Gold you earn playing the game.Because Starter Accounts can't access the Auction House, and because WoW tokens are very expensive, this isn't a viable method for free Starter accounts. You'll need to be a paying subscriber in order to access the Auction House and earn enough gold to extend your subscription.

, When the Wow Tokens launched, they were put on the Auction House for 30,000 Gold. The price is now set by the players, and fluctuates based on supply and demand. Regardless, WoW Tokens are still quite expensive, so you'll want to have an ample regular income of Gold to afford it monthly.


If you farm for Gold efficiently, you can earn around 1,000-2,000 Gold per hour. This means you could reasonably expect to be able to afford a WoW token after 15-30 hours of farming.

, You can use your gold to purchase WoW Tokens from the Auction House. You can access the Auction House from most major cities throughout World of Warcraft, and many cities have more than one Auction House location.


Auction House listings are linked for the whole faction, so you'll find the same listings from any Auction House you have access to.

, This will display all of the active listings for WoW Tokens.

, The Token will be delivered to your Inbox. Click the Token in the Inbox message to add it to your inventory.

, Click the ""30 Days of Game Time"" button to confirm that you want to add the time to your account. 30 days of playtime will be added to the end of your current subscription. Your new renewal date will be displayed in the window. Finally, click ""Accept"" to confirm again.

Know your spells and abilities.,
Prioritize the members of your party as a WoW healer.,
Adjust your user interface (UI) to accommodate a healing role.,
Use your healing spells and shields to fit the situation.,
Understand your supporting role and abilities.,
Practice your spells and abilities as you level up in the game, even if you usually solo in a damage-dealing specialization.",How to Heal in World of Warcraft,"


Learn which spells are instant-cast, which are heal-over-time (HoT) spells and which affect more than one target.
Evaluate the mana needed to cast each spell. Those that do the most healing in WoW, or affect more than one target, often require a substantial amount of mana for each cast, making them prohibitive in most situations.
Check to see if you have any damage-mitigating spells. These spells prevent damage from getting through to your target. The priest's Power Word: Shield and the shaman's Earth Shield spells are examples of these.;
,


The tank is the top priority. He should never be the first party member to die.
You are the second priority. The tank will follow shortly if you are removed from combat.
Damage-dealing players who are capable of spot-healing and resurrecting fallen players are next on your priority scale. Paladins, shamans, druids and priests are all capable of switching to a healing role in an emergency.

,


Make sure you have the ""Target of Target"" ability enabled in the options menu for main and focus targets. This will allow you to see which player has the monster's attention.
Enable the option that applies visible numbers to the health bars of your party and raid members.

,


A Hot is far more effective when used just before the pull than when the tank is already at half of his health.
A shield will prevent further incoming damage on a player who has pulled hate from the monster without generating extra hate. This will provide the tank with a window of opportunity to regain the monster's attention.
Save your fast-casting, high-mana-cost heals for emergencies. Use spells with a higher cast and lower mana cost whenever you have plenty of time for the heel to land.

,


Along with healing spells, you will also have the ability to remove 1 or 2 types of harmful effects from other players.
Coordinate with other players who can remove other harmful effects. Make sure they know what you can do and understand their own support role in a party.

,


Using your healing spells as you level will give you the experience you need to learn which are most efficient and effective for various situations.

Get your action bar in order.When you are in a dungeon, most of the time you spend running after other party members so you can heal them, and you won't get a chance to organize during combat.,
Never loot during combat.It is very rude to loot corpses of enemies while other members are fighting and need heals, this will get you kicked out of a group and it can end really bad if someone dies while you collect coppers.

,
Potions, elixirs, scrolls.Before going on a battleground or entering a dungeon, put all your mana potions in one bag and keep it open all the time.,
Don't waste mana.,
Keep an eye on health bars.It is important for you to pay as much attention to your health bar as it is to your allies'.,
Don't pull unless asked to.If you have a group and someone is clearly pulling don't go first and be the hero, you don't have required abilities to defend yourself (it is tank's work).,
Equipment is essential.When you are the shaman healer, you need items with spirit and intellect.,
Use Healing Rain.,
Use Earthshield.,
Use Totems.,
Use a Watershield or Earth living Weapon.,
Use Haste/Spirit.,
Use Chain Heal or Riptide.,
Use Glyphs.,
Use Talents.,
Ask for help.",How to Heal As a Shaman in World of Warcraft," While you're out of the dungeon or queued in the DUNGEON FINDER, put all your healing spells in one line and totems on the other so you can shift between the two fast.;
,, This way, if you run out of mana while in combat double click on the potion and continue healing.

, If all the members' health is maximum you don't need to keep healing them and spend mana on nothing. Also, use smaller healing spells if your targets' health is not bad, but as soon as it is 60% or less use the greater spells. This way, your mana will be high enough to support your greater and lesser healing waves.

, If you die no one can heal them. *duh*

, Also, if you are attacked, run to the tank and stay there until he is in the monster's aggro.

, So when the need/greed stuff is on always pick those items, because they will help you boost your abilities. In other words, if you don't know which items are for healers go to DUNGEON JOURNAL and look up the dungeon and equipment, going on dungeon runs is very useful for healers because of the money and you don't suffer durability damage if you don't get attacked.

, This is your main priority for dungeons. Whenever this is on cooldown, cast it under your tank (or under your dps if you are healing a raid as raid heals, especially if there's constant damage on them). This spell with heal multiple individuals at one time, and when used with cooldowns (Ancestral Guidance, Ascendance, etc.) you will copy those heals onto other individuals in the dungeon/raid.

, Your tank must ALWAYS have this on. It starts with nine charges, and slowly reduces until it is gone. This buff heals the tank when they are hit, then requires a recast. Fortunately, whoever has Earthshield receives more direct heals, making it easier to heal your tank.

, Your Healing Totems are no longer long lasting totems like previous expansions; cooldowns must be balanced for proper healing. Healing Tide Totem has a 3 minute cooldown with large heals for multiple individuals, lasting 10 seconds, while Healing Stream Totem will heal the lowest health individual for 15 seconds with a 30 second cooldown. With the skill Call of the Elements, you can reset the cooldown on Healing Stream Totem immediately.

, These buffs MUST be active at all times. This assists in mana/healing in general.

, Your haste will help for casting spells while spirit helps keep mana regenerating in a fight. With proper gear at high levels, it will become difficult to run out of mana.

, Riptide is generally cast on Tanks as they take damage to assist the Earthshield on damage mitigation, while Chain Heal is used on the party/raid when large amounts of damage is being dished out to multiple individuals. This will be the main source of your mana loss.

, With proper glyphing, you can regain mana easier/heal more targets. For example, whenever healing is a low priority, you can use Glyph of Telluric Currents to cast Lightning Bolt and regain 2% of your mana upon hitting the enemy, while with Glyph of Cleansing Waters you can restore 5% of a targets health when removing a harmful effect with Cleanse Spirit (only helpful if it is a cleanse-heavy fight).

, Here is where decisions are purely up to the player, yet it is always important to factor your play style into your choices. Are you someone who often forgets to use a move? Maybe a passive factor is better for you. Do you think you are good with cooldowns? Consider moves that have longer cooldowns, reserving the skills for desperate measures.

, If you raid/dungeon with a healer doing better than you normally do, ask! Sometimes, the smallest suggestion can change your gameplay style forever.

Take a flight to your faction’s respective stronghold.",How to Get to Outland," To gain access to the Dark Portal, you will need to take the “Outland!” quest from either the Warchief Command Board (Horde) or the Hero’s Call Board (Alliance). These can be found in all the major capital cities in Azeroth.


You will need to be at least level 58 to start the “Outland!” quest.
Horde players can find the boards at Orgrimmar, Undercity, Silvermoon City and Thunder Bluff. Alliance players can find them at Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar and Stormwind City.
You can also use the quest “Through the Dark Portal” to gain access to the Outlands. This quest is available for both Alliance and Horde players on the Blasted Lands side of the Dark Portal.;
, In earlier versions, getting to the Blasted Lands could be fairly difficult. After recent patches, portals have been opened in all major capitals that make getting to the Blasted Lands a snap. You can find these portals next to the Mage Trainers.

Horde players will take a flight to Thrallmar by talking to Vlagga Freyfeather.
Alliance players will head to Honor Hold by talking to Amish Wildhammer.

Pick a spec, arms is probably your best bet with sweeping strikes and blade storm, there are no downsides to it, unlike fury where you would take additional damage and have to stop and heal up more often.,
Get some decent gear.,
Find an area with mobs right at your level or 1-2 levels below.,
Protection.",How to Grind Experience and Gold with a Warrior in World of Warcraft," Don't forget protection though, although the overall damage output is not as high as the other specs, the plus side is you will not take hardly any damage and never have to stop and heal. Ive taken on 4-5 mobs at once and did not take any noticeable damage. It probably would be slower grinding in the long run, but its still an option.;
, Yes you can grind with greens, but its slower killing, so get your self some blues. Better gear increases grinding capacity with faster killing and more health. As a warrior, the stats you want are as follows: Strength, Stamina, + Crit, + Hit, + Attack Power, Expertise, and last and least Agility.

, Its also important they have a fast spawn rate. I found a place in Ice crown where the guys had 5k hp and dropped 25-50 silver a piece. Considering I could almost 1 shot these guys, that's pretty good money.


If you picked arms, repeat this process: charge, rend, victory rush, mortal strike, heroic strike, overpower. This combination should kill any mob at your level if you are decently geared.
If there are 2 mobs close to each other, charge one, rend him, use ranged attack to grab the other, activate sweeping strikes, and beat em down. Every hit will hit them both so this doubles your killing power. And its only a 30 sec cool down.
If there is 3-4 mobs grouped together, pop any attack power cool down you might have (Trinkets, racial) and possibly enraged regeneration if you feel you might take a lot of damage, and use your blade storm. It should take them down to at least 30% health and most likely kill 1 or 2. Then just finish the remaining off.
Don't forget your 5 min cool downs, So use this when there's 3-4 mobs as well and your blade storm is on cool down. These include Retaliation, Recklessness, and Shield wall if your using a shield

Fury, your options are limited. Your abilities are few to choose from. Blood thirst and whirlwind are really all you got. Cleave is an option but it uses a lot of rage and if used every chance you get, you will rage starve. It may or may not cause more damage per second than arms, its hard to tell nowadays, but you take more damage, so all in all, I don't think its the best for soloing. But still fine for groups. Some things to note about fury are +20% to strength, +5% crit for a short time every time you crit, and you can duel wield 2 handed weapons with the final talent, but you deal 10% less damage when using this. It is my opinion that Fury as been what is called ""nerfed"" to the point where it is not good anymore. Meaning it used to be better but has been reduced in certain ways in order to keep the game more balanced.

, In the past it was near impossible to grind or kill anything really in a timely manner. This has changed, and a couple of abilities can deal some good damage now, making it a viable option for soloing. Non elite mobs will barely be able to hit you at all. And every time you block, dodge or parry, you can use revenge which hits for 2-4k. In between revenges, use shield slam to hit for another 2-4k. The best thing about prot grinding is the fact that you can take on several mobs at once. I'm talking 6-10 somewhat easily. Shockwave hits them all, as well as thunderclap. It may take a little bit to kill all 10 mobs, but the overall time per kill is very comparable to a dps spec when using this method.


If using the protection spec, you should in fact find a place that has many mobs bunched together. Protection grinding is only good when fighting several mobs at once. One or two at a time would be very slow compared to a dps spec. It would be like using blade storm on 1 guy, kind of a waste. Take advantage of the fact that some of you abilities hit ALL the enemies. and EVERY TIME someone hits you, they take damage even if you don't (blocks)You can also kill level 80 elite mobs if you choose to. Its not quick, but you will win if you know what you're doing.

Find a suitable clan name.,
Set requirements.,
Create a website.,
Start recruiting.,
Lead from the front.,
Encourage clan members to get better.,
Plan out events.,
Make allies.,
Start rivalries.,
Wage war carefully.,
If you do accept a war (after discussion with High-Ranking officials of your clan), then get planning.,
Celebrate.",How to Run a Clan in RuneScape," Although this may sound simple, it actually is rather difficult to find a good name for your clan. If your clan is going to be a PKing clan, give it a name which sounds deadly and doom bringing. However, a weak-sounding name full of fun and sarcasm will be excellent for higher level clans (100+). During this period, create a set of rules for your clan that all members should follow. Planning out a unique uniform is recommended as well. Preparation builds confidence for you and those already in the clan.;
, Every clan should have a set of requirements, whether they are 60+ in a certain level, or 100+, or even all levels. Think thoughtfully about choosing your clan requirements, do not make them too insanely high or no one will be allowed to join, yet, be careful not to let everyone in, this will make your clan be considerably weaker. Remember to employ skillers, they are very helpful in money making and gathering raw resources for your empire.

, Keeping your clan organized is not an easy task when it begins to grow. You could start out with MSN or IRC at first, but when you eventually have 20 people, it gets very confusing. A good way is to simply set up forums using InvisionFree, although you could do whatever else you want, but keep in mind that the forums are vital to keeping the clan organized. Organization always boosts morale in a variety of ways.

, It is not advised to walk around RuneScape simply spamming about your clan, as this is frowned upon. Instead, when recruiting in game, chat freely with a player you have interest in. After the player gets to know you and you know the player well enough, ask the player about joining your clan. If you feel unready, ask to join your clan chat. Rank the player, then begin to discuss further and express your interest in him/her, and finally invite the player to join your clan.


When recruiting via forums or somewhere not in game, be sure to describe your clan in full detail. Explain how your clan will be different from every other clan, and be sure to include who to contact if they have any inquiries.

, As a leader, you have to sacrifice the most, you are not a dictator although you could be called one as an inside joke. Stand up for your other members, even the weakest one. Pour out your heart and soul, devote your RuneScape time to the clan. Lead by example, the character you set will be the character which your clan will follow. It is okay to poke fun, but be serious when it is time to be serious. Never bark out orders from the back. You charge into battle, and your members will follow suit. Put others first, it is your members that matter.

, Examples:


If the clan requirement is that you must be level forty, offer a reward of ___k if someone reaches level 80.
If non-members are allowed in, give members each 1k!


Doing the above will encourage your members to work harder, thus making your clan that much better!

, Clan events are the backbone of your clan is the reason why there is a clan. Events can vary from going to Clan Wars, Drop Parties, or just hangovers. Think of something that will be enjoyable for everyone. A fun one is cabbage bombing, the act of dropping literally hundreds of cabbages around certain areas. It certain builds attention for your clan and is a morale booster. Drop Parties are also enjoyable, but don't drop so much that everyone on the server comes! Remember to plan out the events carefully, choose a date and time which most (if not all) can show up. Announce this on your website and give them at least more than a week in advance. Anticipating events even longer are excellent as you could set the planned event to a tentative date which more people could show up on. Usually having several smaller events each week and two big events every month is good way to keep your clan in good shape yet not exhaust them.

, Making allies with other clans certainly help. It benefits both clans as they can have joint events once a month, promoting the two of them, allowing them both to grow. They can also turn entire battles in Clan Wars or Bounty Hunter to your side. If you want to merge, do not merge immediately after befriending another clan, merges should slowly take place over a longer period of time, and then an official merge. Allies can also provide resources of weapons, food, and other things. However, don't make too many allies either.

, As a clan, you need a natural competitor. Besides your enemies, there should be some clans which you should war with regularly. This keeps your clan members active and working, preparing for the next war for glory. Do not be too bitter with enemy clans, however. This stirs up hate and may make your clan lose morale and possibly members. Rivalries should be healthy rivalries which help both clans prepare much more and thus gain levels at a rapid pace.

, Waging war with other clans is tough business. War is not pretty at all, and may cost vast amounts of resources. Do not declare war if you are not prepared, and be sure to inform all members of your clan to be on top alert. Turn up security a notch, accept new member requests VERY carefully, they may be spies. Keep your plans for the war secret in which only clan members could see. Do not wage war if nobody in your clan wants to. It's okay to say ""no"", and if the challenger teases that you are scared, simply ignore them and tell them to pick on someone their own size.

, Compile a list of how many members you have (and how many are going to show up), levels, average level, and compile a list with the same template but on the opposition. Discuss your strengths, their strengths, and weaknesses. Make sure everybody knows what to do. Get food early in advance, train levels to counter their strengths and hit their weaknesses. If their clan has many melee based warriors, try to get as many people in your clan to train their magic. It does not need to be trained all the way up, but just enough to be effective yet not neglecting other duties. Strategize on formations and areas to hide in, areas to attack through. Organized flanks are effective as they can easily pile and protect the rangers and mages, yet staggered and spread out by a fair distance is excellent to pick off running enemies and makes the job harder for enemy rangers and mages. Make sure there are no confusions on the day of battle, and that everyone has a part. Everybody should know what they are doing. Be cunning and creative!

, After your glorious victory, have a celebration or a feast with your clan. A party is a fun way to celebrate and boost morale and confidence further. Thank everybody who participated, even those who did not go to the war, but contributed. Have every member feel that they were important. Have fun with it, take it as a personal win and point out any issues encountered during the process of the war, although do this very subtly while everyone is dancing and enjoying the party. If you lost, quickly attempt to regain morale, have a party anyway and make a speech about the accomplishments. Have your clan members feel good and have achieved something.

Combine a Duel ring with Ring of Slaying for instant access to training grounds such as the Slayer tower and dungeon.,
Go to Waterbirth Island.,
Always use up the Spec Bar.,
Know your opponent.",How to Slay in RuneScape," It is like training right outside of the bank! If you can not make Slayer rings yet, use the fairy ring code AJR to access the slayer dungeon and bank in Zanaris. Use house teletabs and the Kharyrll portal for convenient access to the slayer tower.

If you are forced to use a different transportation method, you might want to train somewhere else. These two sites are relatively devoid of people and have some of the best monsters in RS! We never advocate using a cannon as it is the least efficient weapon in the game for a DIYer, and more expensive than even Karil's X-bow if you are buying bolts/balls. However, they are great for fast kills and running through slayer tasks. Ice Trolls on the Fremmy Isles are the only monsters in a multi combat that might be worth it.



 

;
, Waterbirth Island is another Guthans Only training site with great payoffs, both in drops and the Waterbirth armour sets. It is always empty due to the location and the fact you need a friend to go past the first room. Bank with jewelry and Rellekka POH tele or Enchanted Lyre your way back.

If the player you kill is 10 or more levels lower than you, your kill will not be counted as honorable.
Killing players who are under the effect of resurrection sickness or players who have recently entered a new battleground/zone will not grant honorable kills either.
Generally, if you want to obtain honor points through killing other players all you have to do is kill other players that are close to your level.

Travel to Karazhan in Deadwind Pass, where Archmage Alturus gives you two quests, Arcane Disturbances and Restless Activity, which you do in the immediate area.,
At Dalaran, go to the north side of the bubble to speak to Archmage Cedric.,
Go to the center of Shattrath and speak to Khadgar, the one who you started the guided tour at and who asked you to decide which faction you wanted to align with.,
When you return to Shattrath, Khadgar asks that you obtain the second and third key fragments.,
The third key fragment is in Arcatraz in Tempest Keep in Netherstorm, accessible by a flying mount or flying form.,
Return to Shattrath and hand your second and third key fragments to Khadgar.,
Return to Khadgar in Shattrath, and he gives you .",How to Get Attuned for Karazhan in World of Warcraft," Upon completion, Alturus sends you to Dalaran with the quest Contact from Dalaran.;
, He gives you the quest Khadgar, to return to Shattrath.

, He gives you Entry Into Karazhan, which requires a trip to Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun. Your goal is to obtain the first key fragment, located near Murmur, the last boss in Shadow Labyrinth. An elite guard spawns when you open the container; loot the fragment off of its corpse. Return to Shattrath with your fragment. Note that it is possible to sneak by Murmur if you are a rogue, druid, or mage and fight the spawn without fighting Murmur.

, The second key fragment is in The Steamvault in Coilfang Reservoir. The container is in the corner at the bottom of a deep pool of water near the first boss. Note: The second key fragment was originally lootable from the box directly, and could be done solo by mages, druids and rogues. With patch 2.0.7, the key is now looted off of an elite guard that spawns when you open the container. For this reason, you may be more successful if you go with others. (Druids are still ok - he is a beast so hibernate will work when you need a rest)

, Entry into the instance requires a key or a rogue with 350 lockpicking. You need not kill any bosses to get to the key shard, located up the ""glass"" ramp in the first room where you encounter voidwalkers. As you enter, the container is to your immediate right in the corner of the room. Note: As with the second key, this one requires a group to kill the guard. Two rogues can distract the patrolling voidwalker while a druid (feral) and another rogue kills the guard (with the first rogue distracting joins the fight) can make things easier. Still stealthable, just challenging.

, He then sends you to The Black Morass in the Caverns of Time to speak to Medivh, who activates your key. Note: This step requires Opening the Dark Portal, where you protect Medivh from waves of mobs (including elites) while he opens the Dark Portal. From every sixth portal a boss will spawn. After the 18th portal the Dark Portal will open and the task is complete. You can now speak to Medivh and claim your Master Key to Karazhan. Note: If you are not inside of the instance when Aeonus is killed, you will not be able to speak with Medivh.

, He then gives you the quest The Violet Eye. This sends you back to Karazhan, where your Karazhan quests will begin.

This is Hellfire Peninsula.,
Right when you enter Zangarmarsh you will be in Cenarion Refuge.,
In Terokkar Forest you will either go to Stonebreaker hold (Horde) or Allerian Stronghold(Alliance).,
In Nagrand you will either head to Garadar(Horde) or Telaar (Alliance).,
Our next stop on the trip 70 is Shadowmoon valley.,
If Needed, you should go to Netherstorm and complete a few kill quests in Area 52.

,
Congratulations on reaching level 70!

",How to Get from Level 58 to 70 in World of Warcraft," This will be your first stop in Outlands. You will Enter using the Dark Portal on the Eastern side of the zone. From here you should take the flight path from your faction. This flight path with take you to either Thrallmar (Horde) or Honor Hold (Alliance). After you do a few quests in this area you will go to spine breaker post (Horde) or Expedition Point (Alliance), which is on the southern half of the zone. Do quests here until you are asked to go to Falcon Watch (Horde) or Temple of Telhamat. Take quests from here until you are asked to go to Cenarion Post. You will be asked to do a few elite quests here. Do not skip these, try to get a group for these quests at all costs. The rewards from these quests are worth it. Ramparts and Blood furnace are two instances in this zone. You can do Ramparts around 60 when you get the quests for it and Blood Furnace around 62 when you are about to leave. Your next stop on the journey to 70 is in Zangarmarsh. You should be at about level 62 when you leave Hellfire.;
, Grab the quests here and you will want to go grab a some more quests at SwampRat Post (Horde) or Telredor (Alliance). You will be able to get a flight path here as well. You will be asked to perform quests on the eastern side of the zone. As Horde you will be asked to go to the western side of the zone, Zabra’jin is a Horde village on this side of the zone where you can pick up many quests on this side. Sporeaggar is a neutral faction near Zabra’jin. South of here is The Spawning Glen where you can do a few quests to get your reputation up with Sporeaggar. Once you reach a certain reputation with them you can enter their village and receive quests. Once you are 63 you should have a quest or two for Slave Pens. Before you leave you are going to want to do the Underbog around level 64. Throughout your questing in Zangarmarsh you will receive at least two travel quests. One will ask you to go to Blades Edge Mountains and the other to Terokkar Forest. I suggest that you do the Terokkar Forest one. Blades Edge Mountains is very mountainous and hard to get around so it would be a better idea to do it when you are 70 with a flying mount. You should be leaving this zone around level 64.

, The main Outland city Shattrath is in this Zone as well. It is worth heading up there after grabbing the quests from your factions town in this zone. You will be asked to go see a few people throughout the zone. In these places you will receive a few quests. Auchindoun is the waste land type area to the south it has a group of instances. Around 64 you will be able to do Mana Tombs. When you are 65 you will want to complete Auchenai Crypts. After all the questing and instances you do in this zone you should be almost level 66. From here you will want to go to Nagrand.

, Grab the quests in your town and head over to Nesingwary Safari. Here you can grab a few kill quests for the beasts in this zone. After a while up in the northern part you will want to go to Aeris Landing, which is off the road a little ways southeast of Halaa. You should be around 67 now and ready for a few instances. Caverns of Time: Old Hillsbrad is in Tanaris and is a fun instance to complete with a group. Another instance that you may want to engage in is Sethekk Halls. Remember to get some quests for it at the entrance. After finishing up Nagrand and completing these instances you should be around 68.

, Here it is important to have chosen a Shattrath city faction. Al’dor or Scryer are the two choices. It doesn’t really matter what you choose unless you are going to be end game raiding. Scryer seems to be the easiest to get reputation for but it is your choice. If you haven’t chosen a faction yet then go to the centre of Shattrath and talk to the quest guy there. In Shadowmoon there are two main towns. Shadowmoon village (Horde) which is in the northwestern part of the zone right when you enter. Wildhammer Stronghold (Alliance) is in the southwestern part, just follow the main road and you will see dwarves fighting infernals outside of the town. From here you will get a few demon kill quests and one to go find someone at Deathforge tower or The Slag Watch. Here you will get some kill quests that are worth your time. The Alter of Damnation is also a good place to grab a chain quest to kill elementals. You should be around 69 by now. Now you should head over to the Eastern side of the zone and go to the Al’dor town (Alter of Sha’ tar, North Eastern) or Scryer town (Sanctum of the Stars, South Eastern). You should do the quests here and you will most likely reach level 70.

Stop worrying.,
To be able to get a pet, you need to be at least level 10 hunter.,
Accept the Taming the Beast Quest from your local Hunter Trainer.

,
Take the Taming Rod.,
You need to tame each one and then return to the quest giver to get the second task.

,
Find a Barbed Crawler (Alliance) or An Adult Plainstrider (Horde) and use your Taming Rod.

,
Do not attack the animal.,
Take the pet to the trainer and abandon your pet by right clicking on it.

,
Use the taming rod on Greater Timberstrider (Alliance) or a Prairie Stalker (Horde) and wait until it is tamed.

,
Take the pet to the trainer and get the third task.

,
Use the taming rod on a Nightstalker (Alliance) or a Swoop (Horde) and tame the animal.

,
Take the pet back to the trainer and he will ask you to go and talk with Ganaar (Alliance) or Holt Thunderhorn (Horde) so that you will be taught the basics necessary to care and train your pets from now on.

,You can now choose your future pets and train them.,Make sure to check the sources mentioned below for more valuable information.",How to Get a Pet in World of Warcraft," In this short article you will see how to get a pet in World of Warcraft.
, So, if you are not, level yourself until you are. The steps below are for both the Alliance and the Horde sides of the game:

Gather as many quests as you can that can be done in the same area.,
Don't be afraid of grinding!,
Use as many spells and abilities as you can.,
Attack from range if possible.,
Loot all the useless junk you find.",How to Get a Newly Made Character to Level 5 in a Few Minutes on World of Warcraft," This will help you finish off the quests faster. Don't worry; this can be done very easily in starting areas. For example, gather 1 quest that requires you to kill X mobs, 1 quest that requires you to loot Y objects you find on those mobs, and 1 quest that requires you to gather some stuff that can be found in nature (not on mobs). After you complete all of them, go report those quests.;
, Level up to 2 by grinding, since you have to kill a very small number of mobs to level up. Start with mobs of higher level (3 and so).

, This will ensure that you defeat mobs easily. As soon as you can learn a new one, rush to the trainer.

, Avoid melee fights at any cost. Most mobs can't attack from range; that is a huge advantage to you. Enhance your ranged attacks as much as you can (i.e. buy better ranged weapons). Make sure the mob is dead before it comes close enough for them to attack you.

, Although it's not advisable to do this at higher levels, when you are below level 20 you must loot everything you find. Sell the junk to the vendor and gain some extra coppers and maybe even silvers.

She will give you ""Picking up the Pieces"", which is a daily quest.,
You can get another quest line to get reputation points called the Murkblood quest chain.,
After that, the last part is called ""Seeker of Truth"" where you have to kill a Murkblood Overseer, found on the north side of the ledge.,
Once everything is complete, you must find Chief Overseer Mudlump who will give you ""Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices"".,
After that quest, you'll get ""The Booterang: A Cure for the Common Worthless Peon"".,

He'll give you a quest to kill elementals in the area and the essence is a reward.,
Now comes a very much enjoyed part of reputation raising with the Netherwing.,
You're revered with Netherwing now and you only need to get exalted to get your Netherdrake.,
You will now receive the last of the dailies, which is ""The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid"", where you have to defend your Aldor or Scryer base from Dragonmaw Skybreakers.,

, Neltharaku is a Netherwing Dragon flying above the fields. You'll need a flying mount for this part. When you find him and talk to him, you'll get ""Neltharaku's Tale"" which requires listening to him. When completed, you'll get ""Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress"". You'll have to kill Dragonmaw Orcs. One great spot to do this quest is to go to Netherwing Ledge and kill Dragonmaw Peons.

, in which you need to collect Nethervine Crystals. ""The Force of Neltharaku"" is the follow-up quest in which you have to rescue Netherwing Drakes from Dragonmaw Fortress. When you turn this in, you'll get ""Karynaku"", in which you need to speak to Karynaku inside Dragonmaw Fortress. Karynaku will give you ""Zuluhed the Whacked.""

, His Rain of Fire spell does lots of damage to anybody in the group, including the demon who appears from the portal. You can move Zuluhed to another room to avoid this. There are 6 archers who appear when Zuluhed does. It is recommended that you have either a tank or a healer, possibly both. Once you complete ""Zuluhed the Whacked"", you acquire ""Ally of the Netherwing"". You go back to Mordenai to turn this in and the reward will get you to neutral with the Netherwing.

, He gives three quests, two that are dailies, and one that is not. The first quest is called ""A Slow Death"", which is one of the dailies. For this quest, you need to gather Fel Glands that will be used with Yarzill's Mutton.

, Sometimes the peons you try to poison with the glands will not take it so it's smart to get more than the original number so you can do it all at once.

, The last quest that he gives is ""The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt"" which is not a daily quest. The eggs have a very low drop rate so this quests takes a long time to do and repeat. These quests get you to friendly with the Netherwing.

, You turn this in to the mistress.

, You need to bring him 10 Knothide Leathers and 1 Hardened Hide of Tyrantus. If you aren't a skinner, you can buy leathers from the Auction House and find Tyrantus in Netherstorm. He is at the furthest northern point, so go to Stormspire before heading north.

, Most players enjoy this quest because you need to hit peons to make then go back to work. After completing all of these quests, getting to honored reputation with the Netherwing should be easy.

, This will send you to Overlord Mor'ghor to get ""Captain's Badge"". This is a trinket that you can use to summon your combat pet that was mentioned in Step 10. You'll also receive ""Disrupting the Twilight Portal"" which is also a daily in which you need to kill 20 Deathshadow Agents.

Envision what you want your guild to be like.,
Decide on a name for your guild.,
Decide on some basic rules and punishment if people break those rules.,
Think of the ranks and their names.,
Obtain a guild charter from a guild master in any major city.,
Don't try to recruit level 70s or 80s, start low.,
Now is the harder part.,
Start this step if you have plenty of level 80 players.If you get up to this step then you guild should be on the road to victory.",How to Form a Successful Guild in World of Warcraft,"

Size Do you want your guild to be very large with players of all different levels or do you want it to be a small guild with only friends? Or somewhere between?



 


Type The main types are PvP, PvE, RP, Leveling or laid-back. PvP focuses on the player vs. player aspect of the game, PvE is instances and raiding and leveling is a balance of the two, designed for people who aren't the highest level in the game. RP stands for roleplaying, and is most often found on RP and RPPVP servers. Laid-back is just where people goof off, maybe do an instance run here and there, but aren't focused on a particular aspect. You don't have to have a type, but it helps bring like-minded people together.





;
, Have a few variations ready because your name might be taken.

, Make sure they're reasonable or people won't want to be in the guild!

, Try to have the ranks make some relation with the name. If you're a chilled, relaxed guild then maybe make 1 or 2 rank names 'funny'. But don't overdo the funniness, you want to look organized after all.

, You need 10 signatures to form your guild. Try going to starting zones, only recruit people level 10+ that way there is more of a chance they won't leave. DO NOT, under any circumstances, offer cash for someones signature, because that person is after money, not staying in the guild, and will most likely leave after the guild is formed. After you get your 10 signatures, turn it in to the guild master.

, If you start low it will be easier to find more members, hence your guild will be bigger and people will stay. Every now and then try push the top level boundary in your guild. Or maybe have a system - Every 10 people you recruit 5 levels higher. Unless you want a small guild then just aim small. Recruit some low levels and help them level up.

, Start organizing your guild maybe make a website, webs.com, Myspace and piczo can be used unless you know html / php. You will want to start instance runs now. Find a time that fits as many people as you can in and say that you will do 'X' instance at that time.

, Now is the time you might want to start thinking about end-game. You might have a lot of new members now so arrange new raiding times to suit your newer members, but don't forget about the old members. You will either need ventrilo/teamspeak or an in-game guild voice channel for this for voice communication and you will need some people with raiding experience. Good luck!

Keep learning.",How to Make a Private RuneScape Server," RuneScape runs in Java, so you will need the latest version before you create your server. You can download Java for free from the Java website. This guide has more details on installing Java.;
, In order to create the server, you will need to compile some Java code (it's simpler than it sounds!). To do this, you will need the latest JDK, also available for free. Visit the Oracle website and navigate to the Java SE section. Select ""Java For Developers"" and then download the most recent version of the JDK. This guide has more details and links for downloading the JDK.

, There are a bunch of different places online that you can download custom server and client files from. For first-time server operators, it is highly recommended that you download the Starter Pack from RuneLocus. This contains a basic server and client that you can have up and running in a few minutes.


You can find the Starter Pack on the RuneLocus website.

, When you unzip the Starter Pack, you will find two folders: ""Server"" and ""Client"". Open the ""Server"" folder to get your RuneScape server up and running.


Open the ""run.bat"" (Windows) or ""run.sh"" (Mac and Linux) program.
Wait for the Starter Pack Panel to appear. This may take a few moments. If you receive errors, you most likely have not installed the JDK.
Enter a port. Typical ports for RuneScape private servers are 43594, 43595, and 5555.
Click Save & Compile.
Click Run Server. Your RuneScape private server is now up and running.

, In order for others to connect to your server, you will need to open the port that you specified in the previous step. In order to do this, you will need access to your router's configuration page. For details on forwarding ports, check out this article.


In order to forward the port, you will need to know the internal IP address of the computer running the server.
Once you have forwarded the correct port, you can connect to it from anywhere using the proper client software.
If you are only planning on using the server on your private network, you do not need to forward any ports. This is only for those that want anyone to be able to connect.

, In order to connect to your private server, you will need to configure the custom RuneScape client. The client is the program that connects to the server and allows you to play. Each private server requires its own special client. Open the ""Client"" folder in the Starter Pack.


Open the ""run.bat"" (Windows) or ""run.sh"" (Mac and Linux) program in the Client folder.
Enter in a name for your server in the Set Title field.
In the Set Host field, enter in the IP address of your server (most likely the computer you are using right now). If you are connecting over the internet, it will need to be the public IP address. If you are connecting over a home network, then it will need to be the private IP address.
In the Set Port field, enter in the port you specified when setting up the server.
Click Save & Compile.

, As you get more familiar with running a RuneScape server, you may decide to make modifications and changes. Each time you make a change on your server, you will need to recompile it. To do this with the Starter Pack, run the ""Comile.bat"" program in the Server folder whenever a change has been made.


Simply running a copied version of another RuneScape private server will not gain you many players. Players like to play on unique servers, so if they come across a copied or ""leeched"" server, they will most likely skip it and not play. To make your server stand out, you will need to make a lot of changes to the base game.
If you want to get serious about making changes to your server, you will need to learn some basic Java. This is the language that RuneScape is built in, and making any changes to the server requires coding those changes in Java. There are a large number of tutorials and community forums that can help you gets started writing custom RuneScape code.

, Once your RuneScape private server is online, submit it to multiple major toplists. The somewhat bigger and better toplists to start out with are RuneLocus, Xtremetop100 and Top100Arena.

, Your advertisement ranking on these lists depends on the amount of votes. You'll need to get your players to vote. You can make voting interesting by rewarding your players after voting. A couple of RuneScape-related toplists like RuneLocus support a so-called 'callback' feature. This will inform you when someone has voted, so you can (automatically) reward your player.

, Create a website and/or forum to stay in contact with your players. Your players are the most important users you'll see, so ask them what they like and what they don't like. Many people have failed by thinking they know better, but honestly, nobody knows better than the customers.

, There is a whole lot you can do with your private RuneScape server. There are loads of custom tools and creations that you can add to your own server, and there is a large community of developers always creating new content. The key to making a successful private server is to have fun and make it just how you want it.

Download A screen recorder If you haven't already you can download HyperCam2 at hyperonics .,
Find a song you want to sing.,
Practice.,
Start little.,
Think of a plot equal to the song's meaning.,
Go for it!",How to Make a RuneScape Music Video Using Hypercam," This is one of the major things you are going to need.;
, Thinking of a song will help you learn the song more and more.

, Nothing works better than practicing the song you feel like doing. But make sure that the song is appropriate and doesn't violate the rules and conduct on Runescape.

, Start little by practicing little parts of the song until you think you have it memorized. You can listen to the song at www.Youtube.com .

, Say you had the song, I'm Just a Kid by Simple Plan. The plot would probably be like. You wake up in the morning, 4 walls staring at you and you staring at them. Later on your friends have somewhere to be and they run off leaving you behind.

, Now that you have practiced and figured out the plot, now is the time for you to go for it and finally get to make your very first runescape music video.

Get your account to at least level 55.,
Make sure you have at least 11,00000 GP.,
Think about what kind of clan you want to have and the requirements.,
Recruit members.,
These are the most important things in Runescape.,
Make a wide variety of events.,
Remember you can also throw in a style of your own.,
You could make rules like this:


Normal members wear full rune with scimitar.",How to Make a Good Clan on RuneScape," No one would want to join if you're a low level.;
, Its important to be financially safe so make sure you have a surplus of money.

, For example say you want to have a mage only clan. Your requirements might be to have at least level 60 combat and at least level 94 mage or something like that. Of course only mages can join though. If you are going to pk (player kill) often then you might want to have a pking clan. You're the leader so you make all the rules, but the ranked people can do the same as you

, Don't tell them about the clan just ask to be friends. Then make sure whether they are trustworthy enough for them to join. Also remember to ask some of your friends to join. Once you get enough members start to think of a system such as specific jobs and positions. Decide who can do what. This will make the clan more organized. Try to make money at first. Remember the letters CMF.


C: Combat Level
M: Money
F: Friends
E: Expert on at least the free to play area of Runescape.

, You would want to start with money and then attract higher level friends.

, This will make it fun and better. Mix events up and throw in meetings once every week to talk about topics going on in the clan. Try these events: Pking, skill training, combat training, Pest Control, Barbarian Assault, Barrows, and much more. There's tons to do!

, Make up badges that are given to members, have clan wars, make allies and enemies, and pick out a specific god in the game. It makes the clan that much better.

,
Advanced members wear full rune (t).
Elite members wear full rune (g).
Leaders/Commanders wear full rune saradomin trimmed.

Figure out what your vision for the clan is.",How to Make a Clan in RuneScape1," Take time to answer these questions:


What sort of players would you like in your clan (e.g. mature, obsessed with Runescape, laid-back, funny)?



 



What do you want your clan to do? (e.g. train skills or one particular skill, fight boss monsters, play activities, go player killing)?






Do you want all of your members to be in the same or similar timezones for organization's sake?







How big do you want your clan to be? Remember that while great big clans may be more powerful and make citadel-building easier, smaller clans feel more like a family, and if you are going for a community-focused clan, you might be better off with a low player-count. Small clans may not have a lot of power, but they can still fight.

Find four friends to help you start the clan.,
Head to the clan camp just south of Falador.,
Use the charter on each of your friends to get their signatures.,
Once you've given the charter to the scribe, you will be asked to enter the name of your clan.,
You'll then need to customize your clan, which involves choosing your clan's motif, picking the colors and setting the clan's motto, as well as adding some useful information.

,
After you've done all of this, go to the Captain of the Guard who will give you a cloak and a vexillum with the motif and colors you chose.

,
Next, if you're a member, you'll want to create a citadel.",How to Make a Clan in RuneScape2," You'll need to have these people with you when you officially start your clan. Remember: it is a huge advantage for these people to be good examples of the type of people you'd like in your clan.

, Once here, meet up with your friends and speak to the Scribe and ask for a clan charter.

, Once this is done, go back to the scribe and give him the charter.

, Make sure that all of your friends agree on the name. It could lead to conflicts later. It should be catchy and not too long.

,,, Go over to the portal in the west part of the clan camp, and ask your four friends to each stand on one of the 5 special tiles located around the portal. You will need to stand on one of the tiles, too. A citadel will automatically be created.

"
"
Remember this: Your clan isn't really a clan unless it can grow and develop.,
Make a clan forum at the Runescape Forums This should describe what your clan is about.,
Get recruiting!,
Rank people up.,
Effectively assign people jobs.,
Host regular events!,
Encourage people to talk in the clan chat.,
Pat yourself on the back.",How to Make a Clan in RuneScape3," This will take patience and work, but it is worth it.

, In general, use good grammar and spelling when making this forum, as it will make you sound more professional. First impressions are everything! You'll need to include the following posts in your forum:


Introduction. This should catch the reader's eye, and tell a little bit about the clan such as how old the clan is, what it's focus is (PKing clan, Skiller clan, Dungeoneering clan, PvM clan, free-for-all clan), what timezone it is in, how strict (or relaxed) it is, and other basic clan information.







Table of contents. (optional) This step is optional, but very helpful. It is a list of your first posts on the forum, and it makes it much easier for people to find pages such as your members list, introduction, rules, etc.







Rules.' Rules might include something like, ""You must attend at least 2 events a week."" ""Treat everyone with respect."" ""No vulgar language."" or ""No multi-clanning."" (recommended). One rule that you absolutely MUST add in is ""No breaking Jagex rules."" If you do not have this rule, your clan may fill with botters, scammers. What do you want your clan to be like? Some clans go as far as to require all skills be maxed, while some clans have no requirements at all. If your clan is a dungeoneering clan, you might require 60+ dungeoneering, while if you are a PvM clan you might require 115+ combat. Whatever you do, remember that you must meet the requirements for your own clan. Note: If you are a members-only clan, it's a very good idea to require people to collect the maximum number of resources in the citadel each week.""

Leaders/Positions of Power list. You should post this even if you are the only leader so far. As your clan grows, you will probably want have an event coordinator, a deputy leader, a citadel overseer, a master skiller for people who want to ask skilling questions, a master skiller, etc. Make sure to list open positions of power.







An ""Allies and Enemies"" list. Once your clan gets bigger, you will post any ally clans or enemy clans you might have.

A list of events your clan enjoys. Example events might be skilling, god wars, pking, boss-killing, castle wars, fishing trawler, etc. If you have an event coordinator, let them make this post.







Goals. (optional, but recommended) This will tell future recruits what goals your clan has. A goal might be something like ""100 members by January 2012."" ""100,000,000 total clan xp by September 1st."" or ""Create and run a tier 7 citadel."" An organized list of goals will let people see your ambition and the potential of the clan.

An application. A good application will look like the picture below. Remember to also add any clan-specific questions you might have, especially if you have requirements. If you require 4 99s, ask people what their 99s are.







A recruitment letter, for people to copy and paste to peoples ""looking for a clan"" posts. This should be well written, eye-catching, and inviting. Writing a good recruitment letter is up to you, as what kind of letter you will need completely depends on the clan type.

Any other clan-specific posts you might have.







Reserved posts. You never know what your clan might end up doing, and what sort of post you might need to make. Putting these posts at the beginning make it much easier for people to see -- you will be able to edit them later. You should make at least one page of these posts.

A ""You may now post"" post. Otherwise, people will be hesitant to reply to your thread because they won't know if you're still reserving posts!

, There is more than one way to recruit.

Many people find that the ""Looking for a clan"" page is the best way to recruit. All you have to do is find someone looking for a clan who meets your requirements, is interested in your kind of clan, and is generally the type of person who you'd like to have around in your clan. Then, just post your recruitment letter to their looking for a clan (LFC for short) page! This is why your recruitment letter is especially important. Not all of your clan members will have the time, patience, or skill to write a convincing recruitment letter, so it's great to have something that they can just copy and paste to recruit people. The person looking for a clan may or may not apply, but if you post this message enough, you will definitely get some recruits.






Another way to recruit is to put up vexillums in game so that random people can check them out, and hopefully join your clan. A good place to put them up is right outside the grand exchange, as this is a popular place for all sorts of players to visit.






The next way to recruit is to simply yell about your clan (""Join ! Great clan! Fun people! Level 115+!""), or talk to select people about your clan (""Hello, are you interested in joining a clan?""). It is always a good plan to make them post an application to the forums before they join to weed out people that might not be a good fit for your clan, or who are rude, disgusting, or otherwise do not meet your standards. If you don't require them to post an application, you should at least have them visit your clan for a while before letting them officially join.






You could also try recruiting your friends, but this will probably only work while you're getting your clan up and running.







, If you don't upgrade peoples' ranks, they might get upset -- after all, they've been being perfectly good members, and you haven't given them anything for it! Ranking people up 1 rank at a time is usually a good idea, unless they've applied for and gotten a leadership position. Don't just hand out the higher ranks -- make people prove themselves and really work for them. If a member breaks rules, demote them.

, A lot of the jobs such as ""lady"" and ""expert"" are too vague to help the clan, but if you have an organized PvM clan, things like ""Ancienter,"" ""Tank,"" and ""Ranger"" may help a lot. Also, if your clan is very large, you may want to have experts for different skills and a wide variety of governing positions. Make sure that people know about the jobs that you give them. Otherwise, they won't do them, and they'll be confused if people ask them questions about their job.

, Host a daily event if possible (not all members are always required to come to every event). On some days, allow people that are not in your clan to join in to see if they like your clan. You'll want to hold meetings and resource collecting events for your citadel, and possibly recruiting events, as well as your other events.

, This will help build friendships within the clan, and overall make it a happier place.

, You now have a fully functional clan in Runescape. Whether you become big and powerful depends on your dedication and hard work!

Work as a team.,
However, in Warsong Gulch PVP, these types are:

Aggro Magnet: Any class that can heal and is healing.,
Know your enemy.,
Talk and listen.,
Generally speaking, only attack those you can handle.",How to Do Well in Warsong Gulch in World of Warcraft," When out on the field or back at home base, sticking together is best. That way, the different types of players can all mesh together. In PvE, these types are:

Tank: Holds the aggro with the baddies. Warriors, protection paladins and bear-form druids fit this.
DPS Dealer: Deals a ton of damage fast and effectively. Rogues and mages are common examples.
Healer: Heals and resurrects other allies. Priests, paladins, druids, and shaman are all classes that can heal.
Pet class: Has a pet to hold the aggro for them while they cast from afar. Hunters and warlocks are good examples.
Hybrid: A class that doesn't specialize in any one thing. Paladins, druids, and shamans are examples.;
, Healing is the number 1 way you can help your team win WSG most of the time, if you can do it, and doing it will also guarantee your quick demise. Paladins can actually make themselves into excellent aggro magnets by using a condescending emote (/rude, /spit, /pity, /shoo, /insult), and then casting Divine Shield. At least two members of the opposing team will futilely attack them until they become vulnerable.
CCer: A class that can take enemies out of combat via Crowd Control. Since BG action, especially at 70, is so fast, any CC is just as effective as killing them and you have to be a damned fool to release a CC'd enemy. CC's include polymorph (Mages), sap (Rogues), trapping (hunters) and fear (warlocks). If you see an enemy inside a giant block of ice they're either cc'd or invulnerable. Don't hit them. If they have purple spirals over their head, if they are on fire, or have a trail of ice following them, or if they're a sheep, turtle, or pig, don't hit them. Wait until all their friends are dead, then gang up on them.
CrowdBreaker: Anyone who can effectively disperse a crowd, usually through AOE fear, though sometimes through potent AOE damage (causing self-motivated dispersal). Priests can do this most easily, then Warriors (Intimidating Shout) and warlocks (Howl of Terror); finally, a well-geared (read: tier-4 (and up) damage epics) mage can scare enemies out of an area effectively. Used to break up a crowd defending a flag, or escorting a flag-carrier.
Carrier: Anyone grabbing the enemy flag. You should have at least one of two qualities to attempt this: durability or speed. Durability does not mean 6k hp, it means 10k+ hp; if you're a squishy (Mages , Warlocks, Priests, etc.) don't try this. If you're a warrior/prot paladin/feral druid, wear all your best hp tanking gear and grab a friend; if you're a druid, rogue, or hunter, get ready to put on the afterburners. note that a feral druid has lots of hp, swift in cat form for for the tunnel and travel form out of it. this means that even when you are a higher level, if he isn't very low you should let him take it to base and give it to you there if needed.
Escort: Someone helping the carrier make it across the field alive. Paladins are uniquely well suited to do this because they a) can heal, b) can dispel nearly everything, c) can make the carrier immune to slowing effects, and d) can make themselves completely invulnerable at the same time, freeing them to concentrate on a-c. Basically, though, you should either be able to heal, speed up the flag carrier, or heal him, or some combination thereof if you wish to escort him. Crowdbreakers can also make good escorts, but preferably they will be priests or mages.
Flag Room Defender: This is someone who camps the flag room and who's goal is to kill intrepid flag carriers. Rogues and excel at this role as they can get the jump on attackers. druids are also good here do to their tracking ability in cat form, and being able to sneak and jump on attackers (they can do so more effectively if they have the feral charge talent). Shamans do well here too with earthbind to slow enemies. Hunters are also good for their trapping, tracking, and slowing abilities.
Ramp and Tunnel Defender: Someone who's main goal is to disrupt an oncoming offensive and try to take out flag carrier support. Coordinating this role with flag room defense is very effective. A good Ramp and Tunnel Defender can string out and wear down an offensive such that they are easily picked off by the Flag Room Defenders. This role is also responsible for ensuring that a captured flag doesn't make it to midfield. Warlocks and Shadow Priests excel at this role because of their DoTs and silencing abilities against healers. Hunters and mages do well because of their cc and slowing abilities. A key tactic for Ramp and Tunnel Defense is to stay mobile and don't get tied down, this tactic is distinctly different from the ""run in the middle and farm HKs"" tactic. A good Ramp and Tunnel Defender is also able to notify Flag Room Defenders of incoming numbers and classes, paying special note to potential flag carriers.

, You can't read their minds, but you can guess what they will do. If you think you know, suggest your idea to the group. If they don't believe it, ask them why. You'll likely learn something!

Learn where the other team likes to hide with the flag, so you can take in a team to sneak around their base and rescue the flag.

, Talk when you know what you are talking about, or when you have questions. Yelling things like, ""I AM SO COOL!"" in chat is generally not accepted. You shouldn't be too serious, but don't be all crazy. Also don't criticize other people's ideas. If you do not like it, tell them why and be ready to suggest a good alternative. Communicating enemy positions, *especially* their flag carrier, is extremely critical. It is also helpful to report what classes are there- ""3 war 2 rogue 1 priest EAST FLAG"" is an excellent example of a concise message that can be quickly typed out that tells everyone on your team exactly where your flag is going and what will be needed to retrieve it. If you've just grabbed the enemy flag, everyone on your team will know it so ""I HAVE FLAG"" is not useful. However, ""going their ramp then center NEED ESCORT"" or ""TUNNEL"" are both good examples of concise message. Judicious use of CAPS will help draw attention to your message, but ALL CAPS MESSAGES will be more likely to be ignored, so try to capitalize important highlights of your battlefield communiques.
, Do things you know you can do. If you are running on the field with two other guys and encounter all the players on the other team running towards you, don't respond by attacking! Call for help and try crowd control attacks or abilities if you can. However, if you have the option of distracting the bulk of the enemy team with an ""easy kill"" just long enough to ensure that your flag carrier succeeds or at least gets to a healer, your sacrifice will more likely be worthwhile.

Learn your profession.",How to Choose Your Primary Professions in World of Warcraft," Alchemy is mostly used to create potions, flasks, and elixirs, which can be used to provide a temporary increase in power to whoever consumes them. These items support every class equally.


Herbs gathered from the Herbalism profession are the main material used by Alchemists. If you have Alchemy as a profession but not Herbalism, you will need to purchase or obtain your herbs from other sources.;
, Blacksmithing is mostly used to create Plate armor for Paladins, Warriors, and Death Knights. If your character is a different class, you can still create Plate armor to sell, but you will not be able to equip it.


The primary material used by Blacksmiths is ore obtained from Mining. If you have Blacksmithing as a profession but not Mining, you will need to purchase or obtain your ore from other sources.

, Enchanting is mostly used for enhancing pieces of gear to provide extra attributes. For example, if you use an intellect enchant on your gloves, you may gain an extra 10 intellect while you have the gloves equipped.


Enchanting is a profession that supports every class equally; enchanters are also able to disenchant most pieces of gear.
Disenchanting a piece of gear will destroy it and give you shards or dust. Shards and dust are the main material used by Enchanters to enchant items.

, Engineering is a profession that can create random items such as portable mailboxes, portable repair bots, and teleportation devices. Engineers are also able to enhance items to provide various effects such as speed boosts and invisibility; these benefits support all classes equally.


The primary materials used by Engineers are ore and stones obtained from Mining. If you have Engineering as a profession but not Mining, you will need to purchase or obtain your ore and stones from other sources.

, Inscription is the profession used to create glyphs. Glyphs provide players with extra abilities, or enhancements, to existing abilities.


Anybody can use glyphs, but only those who have learned Inscription are able to create glyphs.
The primary materials used by Inscription are herbs obtained from Herbalism. If you have Inscription as a profession but not Herbalism, you will need to purchase or obtain your herbs from other sources.

, Jewelcrafting is mostly used for creating gems, necklaces, and rings. Some weapons or pieces of armor have what is called a gem socket. Gems created by a Jewel crafter can be inserted into the gem sockets to provide increased power.


The primary materials used by Jewel crafters are ore and stones obtained from Mining. If you have Jewelcrafting as a profession but not Mining, you will need to purchase or obtain your ore and stones from other sources.

, Leatherworking is mostly used to create leather and mail armor used by Druids, Monks, Rogues, Shamans, and Hunters. If your character is a different class, you can still create the armor to sell or trade.


The primary material used by Leatherworkers is leather obtained from Skinning. If you have Leatherworking as a profession but not Skinning, you will need to purchase or obtain your leather from other sources.

, Tailoring is mostly used to create cloth armor for Mages, Warlocks, and Priests. If your character is a different class, you can still create the armor to sell or trade.


The primary material used by Tailors is cloth. Cloth can be found from looting most types of enemy monsters.

, Herbalism is a gathering profession used to obtain herbs. If you have learned Herbalism, you will be able to pick up herbs from various places all over the world.


The main purpose of most herbs is to be used by people who have taken up Alchemy or Inscription as a profession.

, Mining is a gathering profession used to obtain ore and stone. If you have learned Mining, you will be able to mine ore and stone in various places all over the world.


The main purpose of most materials gathered through mining is to be used by people who have taken up Blacksmithing, Engineering ,or Jewelcrafting as a profession.

, Skinning is a gathering profession used to skin enemy corpses and obtain leather.


Leather is most commonly used to create items with the Leatherworking profession, but it can also be used to create a few items for other professions including Tailoring and Engineering.

, If you are on a character whose race grants a profession bonus, you can see it in your spellbook. To open your spellbook, press P, and you will see a list of abilities on your screen. For example, if you are a Draenei, you will see an ability called Gemcutting with the description “Jewelcrafting skill increased by 10.”


You will not need to do anything to activate the bonus—all eligible races automatically have it.
These are the races that have profession bonuses:

Draenei – Jewelcrafting
Gnome – Engineering
Worgen – Skinning
Blood Elf – Enchanting
Goblin – Alchemy
Tauren – Herbalism
Pandaren – Cooking


Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls, and Undead do not have any racial profession bonuses.
All the racial bonuses are for primary professions, except for Pandaren. The Pandaren bonus is for Cooking, which is a secondary profession.
Racial bonuses are only one of many factors to consider when choosing your primary professions.

, Most of the professions produce items or gather materials that support all classes equally. For example, Alchemists create potions and elixirs that offer comparable benefits to all classes. However, when it comes to armor that can be equipped, the situation is slightly different.


There are 4 types of armor in the game—Cloth, Leather, Mail, and Plate. Each class in the game has a preferred type of armor. If you are leveling a profession to create gears for yourself, you may want to choose the profession that supports your character’s class.


Tailoring is used to create powerful Cloth armor, used by Mages, Warlocks, and Priests.

Leatherworking is used to create powerful Leather and Mail armor used by Druids, Monks, Rogues, Shamans, and Hunters.

Blacksmithing is used to create powerful Plate armor used by Death Knights, Paladins, and Warriors.


While being able to create armor through professions may be convenient at times, it is not the only way to acquire armor. Choosing a profession that creates the armor type used by your class is just one of many options.

, Once you have decided on the 2 professions you want to choose, the next step is to actually learn them on your character. To learn a profession, you must speak to a profession trainer. Profession trainers are located in all major cities, including Stormwind for the Alliance and Orgrimmar for the Horde.

, Once you are in Stormwind or Orgrimmar, click on a town guard. A dialogue window will pop up asking what type of directions you are looking for.


Look for the “Profession Trainer” option and click on it. You will see a list of professions (e.g., Alchemy. Blacksmithing, Enchanting, etc).
Click on the profession you want to learn, and a flag will be placed on your map indicating the location of the trainer for that profession.

, A window will show up with a list of what you can learn from the trainer.


For example, if you are looking at an Engineering trainer, you will see an option called “Apprentice Engineer,” or if you are looking at a Blacksmithing trainer, there will be an option called “Apprentice Blacksmith.”

, Select on the appropriate option, then at the bottom of the window, click on the button that says “Train.” You have now learned the profession.

Once you've gotten into the swing of the game, let your character become an extension of you.",How to Create a Character for an RPG Realm in World of Warcraft," You'd also need to own the latest expansion (currently Warlords of Draenor) to be able to play the maximum-level content, but this is not required for roleplaying. You could get the Starter Edition instead, but then you will be locked out of the majority of the game content and some important functions (such as joining guilds and using in-game mail), which can greatly restrict your roleplaying experience.;
, When you log in, choose a realm marked ""RP"" or ""RP-PvP"". There are competing schools of thought on whether the normal RP realms or the RP-PvP ones are the best for roleplaying. Some say that being in danger of getting killed by another player on RP-PvP realms makes for a more realistic and immersive experience, others point out that very few of the people engaging in PvP actually roleplay themselves, and that most of them are your typical ""griefers"" you'd find on a regular PvP realm, who would actually go out of their way to break the roleplayers' immersion. Population-wise ""Medium"" populated realms are best for beginners, as they are neither deserted nor overcrowded.

, Pick Horde or Alliance, and then your specific race. Then, choose your class. Don't just pick a class or race ""because they look cool"". Read the info about them on the side (Wowpedia is a great source on Warcraft lore), and follow your instincts. Have a reason for your choice! Note that on an RP realm you are expected to have a more immersive name for your character, one that a character of your chosen race and gender can realistically have. While the languages spoken by Warcraft's races have not been fleshed out enough to permit constructing a realistic name based on the language's vocabulary and grammar, each race's names tend to have a number of specific phonetic qualities (orcish names tend to sound harsh and guttural, draenei names often have long vowels, etc.)

, Make sure that the backstory fits the Warcraft setting and timeline (don't create outlandish backgrounds that have no basis whatsoever in Warcraft lore or are impossible chronologically – one common mistake is to have a night elf character born in Darnassus). Make your character realistic and well-rounded. Everyone hates overpowered ""Mary Sues"", and one-note characters centered around a single idea are also boring.

, It's interesting, and you might learn something! (though if you did your research on your race's background, you should already know most of the facts given there)

, You wouldn't call somebody a runner at the duel arena, because there isn't much room to run away. You also wouldn't call somebody an eater at Fist of Guthix, because there is no food allowed in the arena.

, Their noob label should be based off of what they are doing that gives them an advantage. Find their strategy, and label it.

, While ""noob"" normally means a new player, it means something completely different in combat. Calling somebody a noob in combat means that their strategy is superior to yours, although arguably less honorable. adding ""noob"" to the end of your label is unnecessary, because you wouldn't be labeling them if they weren't a noob.

Coordinate with your friends who are already playing World of Warcraft.,
Make sure that your character is of the same faction as your friends.,
Analyze realm population and Alliance/Horde distribution.,
Determine which faction you want to play.,
Choose the race you want to play.,
Choose which class you want to play.,
Make the choice between a Male or Female character.,
Customize your character’s appearance.,
Pick a name.",How to Create Characters in World of Warcraft," If you already know people playing the game, the first thing you’re going to want to do is ask them what realm they’re playing on.


It is wise to choose the realm that your buddies are playing on because you will be limited in the interactions you can have with your friends if you’re not, such as being in the same guild and using the same auction house.
Blizzard (World of Warcraft’s creator) has done a lot recently to link realms together. This means that you can do a lot with your friends even if you’re not on the same realm. You can now link up with players who are of the same faction, but are on another realm through “cross-realm.” This will allow you to “instance” (go into the group leader’s server) so that you can level together by questing, doing Battlegrounds and Dungeons.;
, To be able to do anything cooperative with someone you know, you’re going to have to be on the same faction as them. World of Warcraft has two factions: the Alliance and the Horde. Things you won’t be able to do together if you’re not on the same faction will include:


Leveling
Questing
Battlegrounds (except for as opponents)
Dungeons
Raids

, If you’re starting the game by yourself or if you and your friends are starting characters on a new realm it is important to know the population of that realm. It is also important to understand how many players on that realm are Alliance characters and how many are Horde players. If you join a realm that has very few Alliance guilds, your game experience may be less fun than if you were on a more populated realm. This information can be viewed at warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php.

, The first major step in character creation is going to be what faction you want to play. Depending on which faction you pick you will be limited in what race your character can be and your quest storylines will be different. Race limitations are as follows:


The Alliance: Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, Night Elves and Pandaren.
The Horde: Orcs, Trolls, Goblins, Blood Elves, Tauren, Forsaken (Undead), and Pandaren.
You play a Pandaren to level 10 and then you choose which faction you want to join through a special quest.

, The second major step to character creation is deciding what race you want to play. Which race you play as offers little in the way of attribute differences, but they do offer some ability differences and much in the way of cosmetic differences. Each race can only be a specific set of classes.


A Pandaren can be a Monk, Mage, Rogue, Warrior, Hunter, Priest or Shaman. Pandarens will gain extra rest bonus when offline (allowing you to level faster).
A Worgen can be a Death Knight, Hunter, Priest, Warlock, Druid, Mage, Rogue or Warrior. Worgens can use “Dark Flight,” which is a racial sprint ability allowing you to run fast for a short period of time.
A Goblin can be a Death Knight, Mage, Rogue, Warlock, Hunter, Priest, Shaman or Warrior. Goblins loves gadgets and have a rocket belt which allows you to blast up into the air launching them a short distance.
A Draenei can be a Monk, Hunter, Paladin, Shaman, Death Knight, Mage, Priest or Warrior. The Draenei are natural healers and can give the “Gift of the Naaru” to themselves and their allies healing them a small amount.
A Blood Elf can be a Demon Hunter, Death Knight, Mage, Priest, Warlock, Monk, Hunter, Paladin, Rogue or Warrior. A Blood Elf is able to tap into arcane forces around them and use this energy to stop the spellcasting of an enemy for a short period of time.
A Dwarf can be a Monk, Hunter, Paladin, Rogue, Warlock, Death Knight, Mage, Priest, Shaman, or Warrior. Dwarves are one with the mountain and can take on a form of stone instantly nullifying bleeds, diseases or poisons and adding natural armor making them more difficult to hurt with physical attacks.
An Orc can be a Monk, Hunter, Rogue, Warlock, Death Knight, Mage, Shaman, or Warrior. Orcs can enter into a “Blood Fury” which increases their attack power for a short period of time.
A Gnome can be a Monk, Mage, Rogue, Warrior, Death Knight, Priest or Warlock. Gnomes are small and sneaky and can use their escape artist skill to remove any effect that would bind them in place.
A Tauren can be a Monk, Druid, Paladin, Shaman, Death Knight, Hunter, Priest or Warrior. Taurens can use their size and strength to smash the ground stunning all opponents for a short time.
A Human can be a Monk, Hunter, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Death Knight, Mage, Priest or Warlock. Humans are great diplomats, able to increase their reputation gained from different factions within the game much faster than other races.
A Troll can be a Monk, Druid, Mage, Rogue, Warlock, Death Knight, Hunter, Priest, Shaman, or Warrior. Trolls can go berzerk, increasing their attack speed and casting speed for a short period of time.
A Night Elf can be a Demon Hunter, Death Knight, Hunter, Priest, Warrior, Monk, Druid, Mage, or Rogue. Night Elves can camouflage into their surroundings disappearing from sight as long as they don’t move.
An Undead can be a Monk, Hunter, Priest, Warlock, Death Knight, Mage, Rogue, or Warrior. The Undead are able to eat the corpses of the fallen to gain health., How your game will play out relies heavily on which class you select to play as.

Demon Hunters (NEW) are Tanks and Melee Damage Dealers. They are proficient in the use of Warglaives, Daggers, Fist Weapons, One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Maces, and One-Handed Swords. Demon Hunters also use Leather Armour., This choice is purely cosmetic as there are no statistical differences between male and female characters in World of Warcraft.

, You’re able to customize your character’s features and this is arguably the most fun part.


You can choose the skin color that you want. The shades you can choose from depend on what race you are. If you’re an Orc for example you can be blue or green. If you’re a Human you can choose pale white through dark brown. If you’re a Tauren you can customize your fur colour.
You can pick a hairstyle for your character, but this isn’t permanent as you can go to a barber shop in a major city to change it anytime you want. For a fee of course!
Each race will also have some special feature you can change. Draenei and Tauren have horns. Humans can have piercings and the Undead have different styles of rotting… just to name a few!

It makes them feel bad, and then they will annoy you. So being nice is very important! They will normally appreciate that you were willing to listen to them. After all, wouldn't you rather get help from someone that be called a noob?;
, Noobs hate it when other players aren't patient with them because they may need help badly. That's why you should be patient. Sometimes it just takes a while for them to go away. When they're new, they don't know better than just to beg or ask people for help with everything.

, Getting upset makes the noobs upset too, which will also make them angry and annoy you. Noobs think that you are not listening when you are upset. Try to seem like you understand what they are saying when you talk.

, Noobs will sometimes try to make you do something you don't want to do. Do not give in to this! If they get angry at you for not doing it, try to calm them down. Only do steps 5 and 6 if they don't stop annoying you when you asked them to stop.

, Don't just imagine they're not following you, but add them to your ignore list! Now they can't talk or trade you in any possible way! The noob will mindlessly be chatting when you can't hear them!

, Don't use Home Teleport because they'll know where you're going (Lumbridge). Even if you are a non-member, there are still ways you can teleport for free- for example, the explorer's ring to teleport you to the cabbage patch etc, and it is generally better to use this than to use the money you would have done on teleport runes.

, Yes, just log out. From here, you can either go to another world, or wait a while, so you can go back to your world. If you go to another world, noobs probably won't know where you are. If you wait, and go back in your world, the noob will have probably left the area. Also if you're a member and were on a f2p world go to a members world, that way even if they put you on they're friend list, unless they're a member, they can't get you!

Once you are in the wilderness, head due east until you hit the end; an ocean.,
Head more north, you will eventually reach the gates of a member's-only area.,
Know that after a couple of yards, you will encounter some Giant Spiders that can be as weak as level two or as strong as level 40.,
Now you may be entering the land of the ice beasts!,
If you have the will to live, try to bypass this area by heading southwest until you can't go any further, blocked by mountains.,
Enter level 20 or so, you will come across the remnants of a ruined village.,
Keep heading south and you will pass a Chaos Altar which you may stop by if you were using any prayers.,
Reach the wilderness ditch!",How to Have a Treasure Hunt in RuneScape's Wilderness,"


The only items in your inventory should be some food (Cooked fish, such as sharks, lobsters, and if you're a lower level, trout) and a decent sword and armor set. Full iron doesn't cost too much, even to lower levels.;
,, Skimming along the ocean edge, enjoy the solitude as you head north. Make sure you avoid any yellow dots on your mini-map. Somewhere before level 40 you will probably see a pair of knights guarding a steel dagger.Toggle ""run"" on and ""auto retaliate"" off and swiftly nab the dagger, hoping the knights don't kill you. You have just found your first treasure, which could be sold at Varrock's sword shop for about 70 coins. Which, even in the lower levels, in a trivial useless amount of money, so carry on.

, Inside are vicious monsters in excess of level 100 and the Mage Arena. If you are a member and under level 30, don't even bother. What you should be worrying about are the level 80+ Greater Demons that can hit at least 120! That shouldn't be much unless you're lower than level 20. To avoid these, follow the same procedure as before when nabbing the dagger. After you've reached the gates, skim along the eerie fence toward the west.

, If you can, using ""the procedure"", try to climb up their mound. At the top you may find some rare minerals(emerald, sapphire, diamond, etc.)which can be sold at Falador's gem shop for over 100 coins! Note these still spawn very slowly, and this is still a very trivial amount of money.


Understand that, if you survived the barrage of genetically modified spiders, so far be around level 45 in the wilderness and have passed demons, knights, and spiders as you head west along the fence.

, Some of these monsters can grow in excess of level 50 and have low to moderate strength.

, Once you hit the mountains,head south along the foothills and, once again, enjoy the serene feeling of loneliness.


You are now completing your u-shaped treasure hunt across the wilderness...

, The monsters here mean you no harm, even the level 20+ bears so don't break a limb. You may find some everyday items amongst the ruins, as well as a coin or two(or 15).

, More southward, and you will find a graveyard with some aggressive ghosts around level 20. The ""procedure"" here you must use.

, You are now somewhere around Goblin Village. You can either trek about half a kingdom or you can use the 'Home Teleport' spell.

, You may want to easily be able to access others so you can PK. This is good. Places near crossroads are good, like Draynor Manor or the top floor of the farm across from the Lumbridge potato field.

, Sometimes an irresponsible member of your clan may lead an enemy of the clan to your meeting place. When this happens, change your meeting spot.

, Ava's Attractor is a reward from the quest Animal Magnetism. It can further be upgraded to Ava's Accumulator. This gives the highest ranged bonus in the cape strength in the game, barring the Max and Completionist's cape., Prayers like Eagle Eye give you a 15% accuracy bonus to your hits, which can increase your efficiency by the same amount. Super Ranging potions boost your range levels proportionate to your base level, which increases your damage output and accuracy exponentially., Several options here. You could go the traditional route, training on cows and chickens, picking up the cowhides to give to beefy Bill, or the feathers from chickens. You could also train on goblins or men for the herb drops and the clue scrolls. You could also go to cockroach drones for the gems., Kill chaos druids.

Pick up the dragon bones and green dragonhide to help offset the cost of your ammunition., Kill black demons. These can be found in a number of places, notably the Edgeville dungeon being easiest to access. If you have 70 agility, the Taverly dungeon can be a good option as well. They drop infernal ashes, Wines of Zamorak, and grapes, all which can be sold for a tidy profit., Kill Waterfiends. These offer 1 thousand experience per kill, as well as an 80% drop rate for crimson charms. This can boost your account in summoning as well, however they don't have very many other drops, aside from noted water orbs and raw lobsters. You can get here by using a games necklace and teleporting to Barbarian Assault and then diving into the whirlpool., Kill Rorarius. You are going to need 81 slayer for these, but it is well worth the cost. These are found just north of the Oog'log lodestone, and down the chapel stairs. These are agressive for a very long time, so if you have Vampirism aura or Soul Split, you can stay here indefinitely. They also drop the keystones, which vary in price from 250k to 500k depending on the type of key you have.

If you do not have 81 slayer, you can start chinning. You are going to want a ton of red chinchompas, and the best range bonus you can get, preferably full void. Get an inventory with 16 prayer potions, 8 Super/extreme range potions, 2 pieces of food, and an emergency teleport. Go to either the zombie monkey caves in Ape Atoll or the abyss. Simply stand and attack one monster.

Attempt some betrayals.,
Communicate with sponsors.",How to Succeed at Roblox Hunger Games," Perhaps you think you would be bad with teams, perhaps you are afraid of being betrayed, perhaps you just want to go solo. Doesn't matter. In numbers, you have a greater chance. No solo player would attack you, and even other groups would be cautious. Remember, Teamwork=GG, Team=Win, Solo=Death.

, An example, though this could put you in danger when you are attempting it, is for a short code to be typed; team members will respond the same. For example, 111. Another way to recognize teammates is to remember the hats they wore. Be careful with the code or movements, for if someone else sees it, they may try to impersonate a team member.

, Too early and you die. Too late and the other players are way ahead of you, fighting it out.;
,, A mistake many players make is holding Shift to sprint while standing still; this wastes precious stamina. Then it comes too hard to control swimming mechanics.

,, You WILL need a weapon and the only other way to get one is to be sponsored. And the only weapons on the map are in the cornucopia. You only need to grab a single weapon, but never stick with the knife; if you are given one, it is, simply put, a death sentence.

,, Most likely you will be grouped up on.

, You got your weapon, now what? Do you fight to the death? Of course not, this is a game of survival. Meaning that you have lost a lot of stamina trying to be the first one to get the weapons; now you need to escape with them.

,,, Simply run. The problem with getting in water, however, is that the land is uneven; it can take several minutes to find a spot where you can jump back up.

,, If it's away from the Cornucopia tail end, good for you; if not, then things get dangerous. Water, however, is limited; you need to be near these areas for easy access. If it is near the Cornucopia tail end, things get dangerous.

,, Disasters are different for each clock section; but they are almost always fatal. You need to predict how they will come. The Cornucopia tail end will always point to 12 o'clock. However, the Gamemakers can spin it whenever they choose. Disasters happen clockwise; if you see one, you can judge where the next one will occur. But what if there is something you need in a zone about to get hit? Then follow the next step.

, Disasters move from one zone to the next slower than you walk, so you can always escape them if you see them coming. However, what if there is something you need in a disaster zone? For example, water. In that case, try to get to a spot counter-clockwise to the zone you want to get into. This is simple enough, wait out the disaster. But if you are clockwise to it, great timing is required; you need to move from one zone to the next the moment that disaster is finished and right before the one in your zone begins.

, It will always happen; near the end of the game, you trying to figure out whether you and your teammate are the last players, and he tries to put a knife in your ribs. This can easily be avoided. One, always keep a safe distance, of, for example, three feet. Two, make him reliant on you. If you take the initiative at every piece of food, he will be forced to ask you each time he needs food. And three, always know what weapons he has. Just a knife? You can handle him. A sword? You will escape. Anything greater, however, and he will kill you. Either way, one of you will murder the other. Better him dead than you, however.

, First of all, realize that while this can damage friendships, it is necessary to win. In the Hunger Games, like the actual one, there may only be one winner. Some players inform the other that the alliance is broken, and challenge them to a fight. This, however, is throwing the advantage of surprise into the lake. First of all, find a piece of food likely to be poisoned. Offer it to them, telling them you already sampled it. After they take a bite, attack. And try to time your betrayals; if your ally is severely wounded from a fight, finish the job.

, Sponsors will only give you anything with two reasons. They think you are likely to win (for example, if you already have a high win or kill count), or they pity you (for example, if you are starving or poisoned). However, they can be asked questions. For example, a group that thinks it may be the last will ask sponsors to friend request them to confirm it. You can, however, ask them to track opponents, friend requesting you when you are in the right direction or when they are nearby, and similar. Make sure they do not put it in the chat. The victim will then attempt to escape,or go(possibly stay)in hiding.

, If you die, be a good sport about it. Don't stalk the person who killed you and actively hunt them. If you want to continue using the character that died, just use the flesh wound excuse.


If they killed you for no reason, and continue to do so, then it's fine to give them a taste of their own medicine.

Choose a faction.",How to Choose the Best Class and Race for Yourself in World of Warcraft1," If you have friends that play World of Warcraft, consult with them so you will all belong to the same faction. Especially when you're on a PvP server, playing against your friends would be kind of weird. You have two choices:



The Alliance: Considered the calm, peaceful and ""civilized"" faction.

The Horde: Consists of mostly monsters and violent characters, excluding the Pandaren and the Tauren.
It's usually better to decide first on a faction, then on a class, and last on a race; but it's not necessary. Be aware, however, that not all classes are available for each race. An example of this is the Druid class. Only Night Elves and Worgen (Alliance faction) and Tauren and Troll (Horde faction) are able to be Druid class. If you have already decided to play for the Horde as a Druid, you have no other options but to play a Tauren. Draenei. Dwarf and Pandaren are the only Alliance race's that can play as Shamans, and Blood Elves and Taurens are the only Horde race that can play as Paladins. If you are to play a Paladin, a Tauren is recommended. If you decide on a race before you decide on a class, understand that your options may be limited.;

There is a riding trainer for each race. He can be found near the starting zone and usually just outside the nearest capital city.
The Night Elf riding trainer is an exception. He is within the city of Darnassus, near the druid class trainers.
The Orc riding trainer is also an exception. He is inside Orgrimmar near the hunter class trainers.;
,


Mount prices have been reduced considerably so you can buy more than one if you would like a variety of colors.

"
Consider who you want to be within a party.",How to Choose the Best Class and Race for Yourself in World of Warcraft2," The class you choose will depend on what function you want to perform within the group. There are several classes specific to each role:



Tank: Tanks are the players with a lot of armor and hit points that take all the damage on them when fighting several mobs at once or a very powerful mob (bosses or elites). Choose:

Protection Warrior
Blood Death Knight
Protection Paladin
Guardian Druid.



DPS (damage per second): DPSes are the players that wield a lot of damage and do the main killing in dungeons or battlegrounds. Choose:

Arms/Fury Warrior
Feral/Balance Druid
Beast Mastery/Marksmanship/Survival Hunter
Arcane/Fire/Frost Mage
Affliction/Demonology/Destruction Warlock
Frost/Unholy Death Knight
Retribution Paladin
Shadow Priest
Assassination/Combat/Subtelty Rogue
Elemental/Enhancement Shaman



Healer: Healers are those who heal other players (especially tanks) in dungeons and battlegrounds. They're the players you really need to count on during battle. Choose:

Discipline/Holy Priest
Restoration Druid
Holy Paladin
Restoration Shaman



Jack of all trades: These are the versatile classes that can play all 3 roles.

Druid (switch between animal forms and talent trees)
Paladin (switch between talent trees)



Pet Classes: These players not only have many versatile abilities for controlling and damaging the enemy, but who have a summonable ally for use in off-tanking and aggro mitigation as well as additional DPS. While the individual characters may not be extraordinary themselves, their pets and minions often wield considerable damage and may well have more armor than themselves. Learning how to control a Pet and not have it cause problems in groups may be a fun and exciting challenge, but when soloing these classes are never truly solo. Choose:

Hunter
Warlock
Unholy Death Knight.



"
"
Choose a race.",How to Choose the Best Class and Race for Yourself in World of Warcraft3," Before choosing, consider how would you feel playing a certain race. Remember that you will spend months and maybe years watching your character from his or her back, so keep that in mind when picking a race. For example, you may find Gnomes' movements and voice a little annoying, Undead characters' bones poking though their armor a little disturbing, or Orcs' roughness a little unpleasant. The possible races are:



Human (Alliance): Start in Northshire Valley. Extra points to Spirit.

Dwarf (Alliance): Start in Coldridge Valley. Extra points to Strength and Stamina.

Night Elf (Alliance): Start in Shadowglen. Extra points to Agility.

Gnome (Alliance): Start in Gnomeregan, the city of the Gnomes. (Originally started in Coldridge Valley with the Dwarves). Extra points to Agility, Intellect and Spirit.

Draenei (Alliance): Start in Ammen Vale. Extra points to Strength, Intellect and Spirit.

Worgen (Alliance): Start in Gilneas City. Extra points to Strength and Agility.

Pandaren (both): Start in Wandering Isle. Extra points to Stamina and Spirit.

Orc (Horde): Start in Valley of Trials. Extra points to Strength, Stamina and Spirit.

Undead (Horde): Start in Deathknell. Extra points to Stamina and Spirit.

Tauren (Horde): Start in Red Cloud Mesa. Extra points to Strength, Stamina and Spirit.

Troll (Horde): Start in Valley of Trials (except in Cataclysm, where they start in Echo Isles). Extra points to Strength, Agility, Stamina and Spirit.

Blood Elf (Horde): Start in Sunstrider Isle. Extra points to Agility and Intellect.

Goblin (Horde): Start in Kezan. Extra points to Agility and Intellect.

Before you select the game you want to buy gold for, I would suggest to maybe take a mental note of the Top 10 Sellers on the right hand side.,
Now scroll on the left hand side column and you will see a list of all the MMORPG games where you can buy gold from.,
After selecting the game, read the general info.,Choose your SERVER, FACTION, amount of GOLD you wish to purchase and CURRENCY
,Now here comes the interesting part.,
You will get a short/long table (depending on the amount of servers) displaying all the shops selling the gold you want to buy.,
As this site is a site for gamers, they provide a relatively neutral view on the shops as the ratings come from the gold buying gamers experiences.,
The information will be divided into 2 tables, TRUSTED SELLERS and ALL SELLERS.,
Review the ratings and don't make your decision yet.
,
Look at the price columns and you will notice the prices vary quite a lot between the shops.
,
Another feature that MMOBUX is great about is price comparisons between each shop.,
Now scroll down and you will notice a list of all the games KoalaCredits sells gold for.

,
The 2nd column is the 'Price Level' - this is an awesome feature that shows you how KoalaCredits pricing strategy for each game is doing in the economy.,
Once you've done deciding, go ahead and click on 'Buy Now!'",How to Buy World of Warcraft Gold from MMOBux,", These ratings are based solely on customer reviews and usually rated highly due to the shops reliability and how trustworthy they are. Price compared to quality of service more or less.
, (in this how to guide, we'll use World of Warcraft US as an example because it is generally the most played game)
, Knowing a little bit about the background of the in-game gold economy couldn't hurt.

,,, The listed shops are all those who can provide you the amount of gold in the game server and faction you want.

, Generally higher rated sites are not because they are the cheapest or most expensive, but usually because of their service quality compared with their prices.

, Usually the trusted sellers section's shops either have been in the industry for a while or have received high customer ratings in the past.

,,, Try click on the shops profile (in this case we will use Koala Credits shop as is it not too expensive and not the cheapest). Try clicking on KoalaCredits to view its profile.

,,
MMOBUX provides all these features for you to view prices and customer ratings in the hopes that customers will make their own decisions without anyone forcing them into buying or limiting their options to only 1 or 2 gold sellers.

, and it will direct you to the gold shops main page where you can process your order.

Begin by installing all of the packages required for compilation.,
Accept the yes/no prompt.,
Navigate to your home folder, cd /home/yourusername.,
Now you must download the source code for the Trinity server.,
Go to the new directory named ""trinitycore"" with cd trinitycore and create a new folder named ""build"" with mkdir build.,
Configure the build process with the cmake command.,
Begin the build process with the make command.,
When the process is done, it should look like the image on the right.

,
Type the command make install.,
Now that you have built the server program, you must retrieve the game data from World of Warcraft itself.,
Go to the ""extractor"" directory and find ""ad.exe"".,
Go to the ""vmap_extract_assembler_bin"" directory and copy all the present files to the WoW root directory.,
Now that you have the server and the data, you need a database to store the players and creatures.,
Go to the /home/yourusername/db/trunk directory.,
Create three new databases, ""world"", ""characters"" and ""realmd"".,Extract the ""full_database/TDB0.0.2.rar(TC1) or TDB0.0.3(TC2)"" and execute the ""TDBlatestversion.sql"" to the world database.,
Go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore/sql/updates directory.,
Add a new row to the table ""realmlist"" in the realmd database.,
Go to the /home/yourusername/bin/etc directory.,
Scroll down a bit until you find the ""RealmID"" option.,
Find the ""DatabaseInfo"" options, a few rows down.,
Find, under ""Performance Settings"" the ""vmap.enableLOS"" and ""vmap.enableHeight"" options.,
Open the ""trinityrealm.conf"" file.,Explore the different options in the files, and set them to your liking.,
When you are done, open a terminal window to /home/yourusername/bin/bin and type the command ./trinity-core.,
You now have a working Trinity server!,Now that your server is up and running, you will want to learn how to properly update it.,Shut down the server by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal windows.,
Open a terminal, and go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore directory.,Repeat steps 5-9.,
Go to the /home/yourusername/src/trinitycore/sql/updates directory, and apply all new sql files to their corresponding databases.,
Go to the /home/yourusername/db/trunk/updates directory.,
Now your server and database are updated.",How to Build and Maintain a Private World of Warcraft Server on Linux," These are easily installed with this command: sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libace-dev libmysql++-dev subversion mercurial openssl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libmysqlclient15-dev libtool mysql-client unrar.;
, This will install the packages to your computer.

, Make three folders, named bin, src and db. The commands are mkdir bin, mkdir src and mkdir db.

, Go to the ""src"" directory with CD src and type the command hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore/ For TC1 (2.4.3) or hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore2/ for TC2 (3.0.9).

, Go to the build directory with cd build.

, There are several ways to configure the process, but this guide will assume that you are using MySQL for the server's database needs and that you want the default configuration. Type the command cmake ../ -DPREFIX=/home/yourusername/bin.

, If you want the build process to go faster, you can first type make genrev and then make -j3 or make -j5. This works best on dual-core processors and quad-core processors respectively.

,, This will copy the necessary executable files to the /home/yourusername/bin directory.

, There are a number of tools in the ""src/trinitycore/contrib/"" directory that serve this purpose.

, copy it to the WoW root directory (example: C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\) and run it. Copy the two new directories, ""dbc"" and ""maps"" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Check your hard drive space before running ad.exe, however. The program requires at least 1.5GB of space before running., Run the file ""makevmaps_SIMPLE.bat"" and copy the new directory ""vmaps"" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Remove the ""buildings"" directory. Remember, makevmaps takes even more hard drive space than ad.exe, it requires at least 2GB., Go to your home directory with cd /home/yourusername and type the command svn checkout http://svn.assembla.com/svn/trinitydatabase/ db.

, This directory contains SQL dumps that must be inserted into the MySQL database. This guide will not provide any examples of inserting SQL queries. You may, of course, use whatever MySQL interface you prefer.

, Execute the script ""characters.sql"" in the characters database and execute the script ""realmd.sql"" in the realmd database. Both of these can be obtained from the src/trinitycore/sql directory.,, These files are called core updates. They must be applied to their corresponding databases in the correct order from number 1098 and up(TC1) or 1733 and up(TC2).

, Make the id 1, name servername, address externalipaddress, port 8085, icon 0, color 0, timezone 8, allowedSecurityLevel 0, population 0., The two files in here act as configuration files for the server. They must be renamed to work, so remove the trailing "".dist"" at the end of the filename.(If they don't have the .dist extension, you need to turn off the ""hide extensions for known filetypes"" option (google it) Now open the file ""trinitycore.conf""., Make sure it is the same as you just put in the database.

, These must be set to the username and password of your MySQL database. Replace the "";trinity;trinity;"" with "";username;password;""., These must be changed from 0 to 1., Fix the ""DatabaseInfo"" options as you did in the previous file.,, Do the same again except type ./trinity-realm., To connect with your WoW client, simply access the file ""realmlist.wtf"" in the WoW root directory (2.4.3) or World of Warcraft\Data\{locale} (enUS or enGB for example)(3.0.9) and change it's contents to ""set realmlist computeripaddress"". When you connect with your client, it should connect to the Trinity server!,,, Type the command hg pull and then hg update.(This can also be done in one step by using hg pull -u) This will download the latest source code.

,, If you were previously on revision 1312, and a file that begins with 1313 is present, apply it and everything above. It is advisable to keep note of the latest file before doing step 31., Apply the new files named ""updatepack"" in ascending numerical order to the world database. Ignore the ""corepatch"" files.

Choose a faction.,
Decide on a class.,

Consider the lore of the gaming world.",How to Choose a Race in World of Warcraft,"


The Horde races include Undead, Troll, Orc and Tauren. You can also choose the Blood Elf race if you have the Burning Crusade faction. You can choose the Goblin race after purchasing the Cataclysm expansion pack. You may also choose to be a Pandaren and side with the horde.
The races aligned with the Alliance faction are Human, Night Elf, Dwarf and Gnome. You can be a Draenei if you have Burning Crusade or pick the Worgen race after purchasing the Cataclysm expansion. You may also choose to be a Pandaren and side with the Alliance.;
,


Once chosen, your character's class is the only aspect you cannot change, with or without a fee. All classes are available to at least 2 or 3 races in each faction and you have a much greater selection of races for your chosen class as you add expansion packs to the game.
Every race can choose to be a warrior or death knight, while shaman, druids and paladins have fewer races from which they can pick.

,


Some racial bonuses are especially good for player-versus-player (PvP) combat, like the Undead's ""Will of the Forsaken,"" while others benefit player-versus-environment (PvE) play, like the Human's reputation gain from the ""Diplomacy"" racial bonus.
Passive racial bonuses may include extra skills with certain weapons or professions, while active bonuses provide a special ability that is useful in combat.

,


Many players gravitate toward a certain type of role-playing (RP) character. For instance, Night Elves are an Alliance race and are reclusive and slightly xenophobic, while Orcs are an honorable and brutal Horde race.
Race may be more important to you than class if you will be role-playing your character on an RP server.

Select a server because of its name.",How to Choose the Perfect Server/Realm for World of Warcraft Using Realm Pop," World of Warcraft has dedicated servers for different play styles so that players can be surrounded by others with similar interests:


Player vs. Environment (PvE)—The player’s main objective is to explore the world and defeat non-player enemies. Dungeons and raids are an example of PvE content where players work together to kill enemies.
Player vs. Player (PvP)—Players try to defeat each other in combat when they encounter one another in the world.
Role Playing (RP)—Players become their characters and act out scenarios through chat and actions, creating unique stories.
RP/PvP—For those who enjoy role playing as well as killing other players, there are RP/PvP servers where both are common.
Note that the type of server does not restrict you from accessing any content of the game; for example, there are still PvP battles on PvE servers; however, they are infrequent.;
, Both highly populated and nearly vacant realms have pros and cons associated with them:


In highly populated servers, you see people everywhere you go. It makes the game feel more like a living world. There are also a ton of guilds to join where you can make friends and socialize. A high population can make cities a problem for some computers because of how many characters the machine has to render at once. Also, there may be a queue to access the server. If this happens, it means there are currently too many people on the server. You are then put onto a wait list until enough people log off to let you in.
Medium population servers are a common choice because there is never a queue to access the game, but there are enough people to become immersed in the game.
Low population servers run much smoother in places where there are usually a lot of people, and there is never a wait list to start playing. When players are exploring the world, there could be hours where they do not see another player at all. Fewer guilds exist on these servers, and it is more difficult to start one.

, World of Warcraft lore is based around two rival factions, the Horde, and the Alliance. Many servers are one-sided, either overwhelmed with horde players or vice versa. This is very important to consider if you plan on playing on a PVP server; if your faction is highly outnumbered, it may be difficult to win battles in the open world.


Finding groups for raids and dungeons (without using the dungeon finder tool) is also more difficult if there are fewer people in your faction.

, Open an Internet browser by clicking its icon on your desktop. In the address bar, type in wow.realmpop.com. Here, you can select the region you wish to find servers for.


Realm Pop is an external website that finds details on each server. Using it will help begin the process of elimination.

, On Realm Pop's home page, you have to first select the region of the servers you want to check out.


US Region—This will list down all known WOW servers in the US region.
EU Region—This will display all known WOW servers in the EU region.

, On the top right of the table, click “Total” to sort the servers by total population.

, Low population has less than 100,000 characters, medium population is approximately between 100,000 and 160,000, and high population has more than 160,000 people.

, The fourth column in the table lists the region of the server and the second column lists the type of server.

, The fifth column in the table contains the primary time zone for that server.


Joining a server that correlates to your time zone is useful because other players will have similar schedules, and making friends online who you can play with often will be easier.

, The 8th column of the table contains an A/H ratio that represents the number of Alliance players compared to Horde players. A ratio below 1.0 favors the Horde, and a ratio above 1.0 favors the Alliance.


If you believe you will play on both factions, then choose a server with A/H ratio as close to 1.0 as possible.
It is usually better to join a server where your faction is the most popular so you can find groups to do dungeon raids with. It is also a key factor on PvP servers because there is strength in numbers.

, If you currently have friends on a particular server, then joining them could make the game much more fun.


Alternatively, if you have a friend who plays the game but would be open to creating a character on a new server, ask them which of your last server options they would like best.

, If you’re still undecided, you can opt to pick a server with an appealing name. For instance, some players may prefer being on “Thrall” over “Khaz’gorath” because of the simplicity of it.


If you are familiar with World of Warcraft lore, you may choose the name of a character or place you are fond of.

Set your mind that being a game master is a REAL job.,
Meet the basic requirements.,
Create your résumé.,
Go to Blizzard’s career site.,
Wait for Blizzard to contact you.",How to Be a GM in World of Warcraft," First, you need to know that a game master is an actual job. As fun as it sounds, becoming a GM is a full-time desk job. Not everyone can instantly become a GM just because they've played the game for months on ends. Becoming a GM is not simply all about playing games.;
, You need to know if you meet the basic requirements:


Since it’s an office work, you need to be at least 18 years old before you can apply or be hired by Blizzard Entertainment.
Because you’d be dealing with online players, you need to have excellent customer services skills. Some of the job requirements require you to have a degree or, at least, a certification, but having the knowledge about the game’s concept, rules, and mechanics is much more important.
World of Warcraft is open to international players, so having the ability to speak a second language can prove to be very helpful, especially if the job description requires it.
Note that requirements for a GM post vary depending on what the company needs, so make sure to read the job description first before you apply.

, Write a resumé that highlights your skills, knowledge, and interest with the game. If you have any previous customer service experience, then you include it too.


The application form should be written in English, but if the job requires the use of another language apart from English, then it would be great to create resumés in both languages.

, Head to Blizzard Entertainment’s website’s career section (http://sea.blizzard.com/en-sg/company/careers/). When a new game master position is available, Blizzard will post it here together with the job description and all the requirements needed.


Once you see a GM job posting, click on “Apply Online” to send in your résumé.

, If you’re shortlisted for the position, Blizzard will contact you to ask more about you and probably setup a scheduled interview.


If you pass all the assessment, you can now become a full-time WoW game master.

Save disengage for the charge.,
Use traps.,
Use Master's call from your pet.,
Try to outrange the warrior.,
Use deterrence effectively.,
Try to use deterrence when you know the warrior will use charge.,
Concussive shot should always remain on the warrior.,
Burst the warrior down.,
In the end it's all about practice.,
Don't give up!",How to Beat Warriors As a Hunter in World of Warcraft 4.3," Charge is the warrior's main gap-closer. So save your main get-away-ability for the charge. Good warriors will wait for you to disengage but you will also wait for them to charge. Sometimes you have to disengage but I will show you a very good trick later how you can make the warrior's charge useless.;
, Traps can root the warrior in place if you chose the talent in the survival-tree. When you're running away, lay some snake or frost traps on the ground so they will root the warrior in place. If he can't move, you will get more distance.

, If you know that the warrior's charge is on cooldown and he used hamstring on you, remove the Debuff with master's call. You will gain much distance! If you can lay traps down too, the warrior won't have a chance to close the gap for a moment.

, If you can outrange the warrior, he has like no chance to catch up. He has to use heroic leap and charge to close the gap. You're range is about 40 meters (131.2 ft), his charge range only 30 so try to use this advantage. It's practice to outplay the warrior that he can't catch up anymore. But with the practice it will get easier. In a duel, you can't run away forever because it's a limited area (witch is good, because it would get annoying if there wouldn't be a limit). But on a battleground, there isn't really a limit. Every battleground has enough space to outrange someone.

, In a duel, where there is a limited area you can't kite the warrior till he is dead because you will ""give up"" when you leave the duel area. So how can you counter the next charge when you have to run towards the warrior? Deterrence is the solution. Run back towards the warrior and immediately use deterrence. Mostly all warriors will spam charge so they can close the gap immediately after the kiting. They will charge into your deterrence. You can run away from him again because his charge is useless against deterrence and you can start kiting again.

, Sometimes they won't use charge and you waste the deterrence but you will get the feeling for it. You can also use deterrence when the warrior closed the gap and is starting to use his cooldowns. With deterrence you can waste those cooldowns and counter them.

, A slow warrior won't catch up as good as a not slowed warrior. Use concussive shot and try to always refresh it on the warrior.

, When the warrior used all his gap-closing-abilities and you have some good distance, then it's the time to blow you damage cooldowns. Activate Rapid Fire and your damage trinket (works best with a macro). Then use your main damage shots like arcane shot, cobra shot / steady shot and deadly shot.

, You have to learn how to react on the warriors abilities and how you can gain distance. I only can beat warriors now because I lost to so many. I practiced and with the time you know when you can lay a trap, use deterrence and pump out some damage.

, That's very important.

Get to Level 70, or whatever level you want to play at!,
Get good Gear.,
Next, find a mix of fire talents that matches your play style.,
Move with a group and support your team.

,
Know your job, be it defense or offense.,
Use AoE spells on groups of enemies and to defend flags.,
Focus fire on a single target, but be aware of your surroundings.,
Remain hidden or in the back of your group if possible.,
The 'Bolt' type spells offer good damage at long range, but point back to you as a high-damage but soft target.",How to Be a Better Fire Mage in World of Warcraft1," (for you Warsong Gulches out there);
, Note: I did not say ""the best gear"" you don't need it to be a good fire mage. You can do this 3 ways: the Auction House (worst way); Raiding (might be good, but if that's not your cup o' tea, then don't bother); and PvP ranks.

, There a few talents that you *MUST* have to be a good fire mage. Be sure to get impact, as it provides a nice stun. Select Ignite to do extra damage on critical hits. Flame-throwing is very handy, as it allows you to strike from a longer range.

,, Protect your healers, counter-spell and/or sheep enemy healers.

, Flamestrike, Arcane explosion and Blast wave will stop a flag capture, Blizzard will NOT!

, Watch for healers that are hidden to the sides, a well placed polymorph can turn the tide of battle.

, Mages are a high value target since you can bring very high damage to battle. Expect Hunters and Rogues to target you.

, Consider using scorch when you want to keep a low profile. It is fast casting, has an increased crit rate(with talents) and can generate a stacking damage-increase debuff (with talents).

First off, gem and enchant your Holy paladin's gear with the best gems and enchant available (this will affect your paladin's gear performance a lot).,
Gem your paladin after your playstyle, usually gem for SP if you wanna spam powerful FoL's and HS's (a ~ 27k mana pool only ends you up with ~ 10k mana left on a boss encounter, more SP more HPS) You can ofc also socket for int if you like, its all about your playstyle.,
Get a talent build like 51-5-15, 51-0-20 for some extra crit or 51-2-18 for a mix of both.

,
Get addons like Grid (raid frame), oRA2, Pallypower, Classtimer, Instant Health and Recount.

,
A holy paladin's most important spells in raid are FoL and HL, also throw some Holy Shocks on raid members that are low on hp, a holy shock that crits gives you a free instant FoL.

,Also in raid use Beacon of Light and Sacred Shield on tank (Beacon of Light can be a very good AoE healing spell)

,
And last but not least, try different play styles and find the one that suits you most :-)

",How to Be a Good Holy Paladin," Search in the Elitist Jerks forum for a list of ""the"" best enchants available.;
, Every 10-int you socket gives a small amount of crit and SP. A 27k mana pool is also never wrong on a hard mode in Ulduar ;)

In most cases you will want to have and keep range against melee targets.,
Sheeping a melee target will allow you to take a moment to cast your larger damage spells.

,
Move away and begin to cast Fireball or Pyroblast.

,
When the spell is almost done casting, start hitting the button to cast a fireball.,
Melee targets will move toward you, so it is best to keep moving and use Scorch and Fireblast to finish them off.

,
Save your Blink to escape from stuns and intercept.

,
If you have the talent, Presence of Mind and Fireball or Pyroblast can be a good finishing move.

,
Remember that you have Frostnova, Cone of Cold, and Blastwave (if you take the talent) to root or slow your enemy.

,
While they are not mana-efficient, a few Arcane Explosions can end a close battle.",How to Be a Better Fire Mage in World of Warcraft2," Warriors will charge and rogues will sneak up and ambush you. Frost nova will lock them in place and allow you to move away.

,,, The second spell should be nearly done casting as the first one hits.

,,,,, They are instant spells, so you can use them on the run and can be a good finishing blow if an opponent is almost dead.

The raiding mage brings solid damage and utility to battle, but faces some unique challenges.

,
The biggest challenges you will face as a fire mage are fire immunity/resistance (in Molten Core) and the agro generated from spike damage.

,
Fire mages must be conscious of the agro they are generating in battle, as rolling ignites can cause very large damage output.,
Mana can be a concern in long battles.,
Frost will be the best talent specialization for PvP.",How to Be a Better Fire Mage in World of Warcraft3,",, Consider selecting Burning Soul to ameliorate some of this agro.

, Fire mages tend to focus more on burst damage and less on mana efficiency. Consider using scorch, with talents, to build up a large damage bonus. Master of Elements provides a good mana bonus for every critical hit.

, When acquired the correct level in the frost tree, it will allow you to summon a water elemental pet that can hold the attention of the player (and annoy them :D). You can then blast them with all your power! Frost can also slow the player down (which is especially good for melee players)."

Don't anger the Vampire.,
Don't wander around alone.,
Step away from people who come too close.,
Don't follow people unless you're in a group.,
If you're a Detective, don't go around waving your gun or announce that you're the detective; you may be the first target since the Vampire would want to get rid of the only person able to kill them.,
Be aware of the signs that someone is a turned vampire.",How to Win ZacAttackk's Vampire Hunters on ROBLOX1," If you repeatedly say the Vampire's name, there's a chance that they'll be annoyed and try to hunt you down. Instead, just state it once in capital letters and then again if someone asks.


If you think that there's a chance that they would target you because of your user, don't say what your username is.;
, Try to stay in a group. This works with being a Survivor, Detective - you'll be less likely to be targeted and will be able to quickly run or shoot the Vampire. It also works with being a Vampire; you'll have less presence (since you haven't talked much in the chat) so you can easily slip into a deserted space and devour your victim.

, This tells other players that you're probably not a Vampire since you want to keep some distance between you and potential Vampires.


Don't go ramming into other players. They could get scared and scatter around and you may end up getting shot or being falsely accused because you're behaving suspiciously.

, As mentioned in Step 2, it is a good idea to stay with a group. If you're a Vampire, then try to put some distance between you and your next victim before you dive in to kill or turn them to make sure you don't give your intentions away.

,


Survivors may try to trick you into thinking that someone is a vampire so that you'll die and drop your gun and they can snatch it.

, Look out for one of the three different 'scared' faces on a character that isn't bleeding - this usually means that they have been turned into a vampire, although it occasionally happens to people who have escaped.

GetAsync.,
SetAsync.,
Use UpdateAsync to return the value of the key, and updates it with a new value.,
Use IncrementAsync to increment the value for a key, and returns the incremented value.",How to Work with Data Stores on ROBLOX2," Use GetAsync to return the value of the entry in the data store with the given key. Make sure to give each player a unique set of keys, as setting two players the same key will override their own in-game data, causing chaos between the two parties. If you want to know how to set a unique key, read on.


The following code will output nil, because the server couldn't find any value linking to the key; it is important to show the server exactly what we are trying to output, so that the server will know what needs to be displayed.






local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
 
    datastore:GetAsync(key)
end)





, Use SetAsync to set the value of the key, and overrides all existing data stored for the unique key.


If the previous set of information is important, consider using UpdateAsync, which will be taught below.
The following code shows you how to implement both, the "":GetAsync()"", and the "":SetAsync()"", methods.






local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
 
    datastore:SetAsync(key, 90) -- sets the key to the value, 90
    local data_stored = datastore:GetAsync(key) -- is able to detect the value change
    print(data_stored) -- prints the output
end)





Note: This will not work, unless you have the API access enabled. To do this, read the first instruction of this guide.

, This validates data, and must therefore wait until the server can find the time to update it. For this to work, you will need to pass two parameters; the first is a string that takes the unique key you have set up: ""'user_' .. player.userId"", and the second is a function that will take in the old value.






local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
 
    datastore:UpdateAsync(key, function(old)
        -- do stuff
    end)
end)




In this case, we called the old value ""old"". Inside this function, we will need to make a variable that will account for our updated score, and then return that so it can display our new score.




local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
 
    datastore:UpdateAsync(key, function(old)
        local new = old or 0 -- could be nil
        new = new + 1 -- add 1 to the old value
        return new -- returns it with the new value
    end)
end)





Note that the server will return nil if the key does not exist or is not assigned correctly.
If the function does not exist, the update will be cancelled.

, This method only works on integers.

"
"
Set a unique key.,
Update the data.,
Congratulations!",How to Work with Data Stores on ROBLOX3," It is extremely vital that every player has a key that is unique to them. They will hold onto that key, which will store all of their data. In order to do this, we use the player's ID. Once you have set the data store, simply call on a function to load the player, and then find the player's ID. The code should look as follows:







local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
end)





This will automatically create a key that is unique to that player only, for every player will have one unique ID. The ""user_"" will not matter.

, Now that you've got a unique key to each player, you're set to making the data store update and retrieve data. Underneath your key, you will want to add a method that is most suitable to your needs. In this case, we'll use ""UpdateAsync"".


Start with a function to help the server understand what you are intending to do.






local datastore = game:GetService(""DataStoreService""):GetDataStore(""name"")
 
game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player)
    local key = ""user_"" .. player.userId
 
    datastore:UpdateAsync(key, function(old)
        local newValue = old or 0 -- could be nil
        newValue = newValue + 50
        return newValue
   end)
end)






In this function, we set up another function, old. ""old"" was our previously saved data. In this scenario, every time a player entered the server, the server would locate its key, which is their userId, and it would update the data by 50 points, returning and displaying that new value.

, You've successfully stored and updated a player's data.

If you are playing with friends or are in a team with a group of players, either party them on the website to let them know you're either a Vampire, Detective or Survivor.,
Don't say ""Lets go hide"" or ""Follow me"" if you're the Vampire.,
Try and socialise with other players.",How to Win ZacAttackk's Vampire Hunters on ROBLOX2," If unable to do this, then you can come up with emoticons like ':D' to signify that you're a certain role in the game, e.g. 'o:' to mean that you're the Vampire. It's useful but dangerous if someone figures out the code.

, This a bit obvious, seeing as you probably want to turn your friend first into a Vampire and then go hunt the whole server. Don't do this. Act normal, talk normally and when the perfect time comes to slip away and turn them, do so, but discreetly. Also make sure to kill the ones who say ""Bite me first!"" or ""i'll help!!1! pls bite me vamp!"" They're annoying.

, Let them know what your ROBLOX character is a bit into the game. You'll gain their trust more easily and they won't suspect you to be the Vampire."

Open up ROBLOX Studio.,
Script the function.,
What this means in this function is that whenever this object is touched, the computer will do something.,
Specifically describe, in a script, a step to the computer.,
If you want the baseplate to disappear, you simply create a directory to the baseplate: game.Workspace.Baseplate:Destroy().,
Game is the overall ROBLOX Studio, and without it, the computer will print out an error because, if you start with Workspace, the computer will argue that, and state that Workspace isn't the first directory.,The Destroy() command states that the part being affected by the command will be removed, or will no longer be visible/working.,
Wrap up the command.,
Please note, this piece of code should be placed under your previous line of code and above the command, end, so that the script works before it gets destroyed.,
Call your function.,
After the end command, start off with the script, followed by its Parent.,
Test out your code.",How to Trigger an Event OnTouch on ROBLOX," If you don't have ROBLOX Studio, feel free to install it. This will be the main engine you're going to be using for your scripts and parts. When opening ROBLOX Studio, you'll be greeted to an empty baseplate.






Insert a part. A part is any sort of brick or block on a said game. To the right, on the explorer, you'll see a brick named ""Part"".















If you don't have explorer opened, head over to the ""View"" tab on ROBLOX Studio, and enable Explorer, as this is a key component in making the trigger. While you're at it, if you don't have Properties opened, feel free to enable Properties. It can be found next to the Explorer tab.














When inserting a part into the game, click on the Part in the Explorer itself. The Part should be selected, if not already, and right-click on it. Scroll over to ""Insert Object"", and pick ""Script"".






Upon clicking on Script, you will be greeted with a code-like sheet, with the command ""print(""Hello, World!"")"". This is the most basic and widely world known command. It allows the computer to print the words, ""Hello, World!"". Delete the command, and here, you will start scripting the function.;
, Because function is already defined in the ROBLOX database, you don't need to redefine it. Start off by simply printing out the function you will be using: function onTouched(). The end command should show up. This should be ignored for now, and you want to start working directly underneath function onTouched()., However, if you test the game out (F5), the computer won't do anything. This is because you haven't told the computer what to do. You just simply defined that something WILL happen when we touch this object., In this instance, what you want to do, is to create a directory to the part you want happen., The script should automatically have the ""end"" code after it., Workspace follows that, because that's what you can see in the Explorer as the first line of directory. Because Baseplate is seen inside Workspace, you only need to then direct it onto script.,, You want it so that once the Baseplate is destroyed, the script no longer works. This is similar to before, except for the directory. Like how we destroyed the baseplate, the Destroy() command will be used in this. The directory is pretty easy, and doesn't take long at all. Because you only want the script to malfunction upon usage, you can simply insert: script: Destroy()., If you place it above our previous line of code, the script will just destroy itself without doing anything to the baseplate., So, that's our main body of code done. But, when you test the game out, it doesn't do anything. Why is that? With any script, you haven't called our function. This is the key piece of code, otherwise everything wouldn't work, and it's the CallOut code. Coding is similar to an essay, you've done all of the introduction (functions), and the main body, but you're left with the conclusion. In this piece of coding, you need to redefine what we meant with onTouched., In this case, the Parent would be the Part, so that now the Part will be selected. To make something happen on touch, we want to use the special code, ""Touched"", and just connect it as whatever we called our function (onTouched). The conclusion should appear something as script.Parent.Touched:connect (onTouched), To recap, your script should appear something like this:"

This can all be found under ""Inventory"". If you click on the button next to ""Inventory"" which is titled ""Search"" you can search for anything on Roblox.

Be kind and support your teammates if they are in need, but don't give them everything you have, for this means it is much more beneficial to them than it is to you.",How to Win Ozzypig's Hunger Games on ROBLOX," Do not select a server with a whole group of Level 12 players when you are only a Level 2. Unless you are amazing at sword fighting and can win against almost anyone, even five players, all with more than +120 health than you, going against too high a level will spell your doom. Anyway, scroll down, look through the servers and make sure to steer clear of any really overpowered players you recognize.;
, When you have chosen the server with the easiest players possible, start introducing yourself to everyone - especially to the higher levels (if there are any). The higher levels will target the lower levels. There is a better chance they won't come after you if you introduce yourselves to them. Of course, this is a strange, almost dumb skill to use when playing Ozzypig's Hunger Games, but politeness works, so try it.

, Your team members should be around the same level as you are - well, it doesn't really matter, but it is likely they will accept the request if you have the same skills as they do. Most importantly, your enemies should never be from the higher levels, because they are more powerful than you are (although, your perspective might change, depending on how you play the game). Instead, find the lower levels to target. In the Games, you will know who to flee from and who to fight.

, When the Games begin, position yourself so that you are facing the Cornucopia, and go to the very edge of your plate. Look for any items that may come in good use later. Also, make sure to look to your left and right, to scan the tributes. If all is hopeless and you know you won't be able to get anything good from the Cornucopia, target the cave.

, Get weapons and collect as many food supplies as you can; you don't want any other tribute stealing them before you do. Flee from the tributes you know you cannot beat and stand your ground when encountering a tribute whose skills are not as great as yours.

, If you have no weapons at all versus someone with a trident or you are dying from reduced health versus someone with full health, don't run away. It will make you seem like a fool. You will die anyway. It's mostly about reputation on Roblox. Talk to them, be generous, and allow them to win, unless you can find a way to win yourself.


You can also die from wolf mutts, health, shrink map, etc., but this is not talking about disasters.

, It is like they are using you as a life source. If you and your team are the last ones in the Games, either finish it off with a fight or let the other win.

To do so, you will have to pay a monthly or a one-time fee, which can range from $5.95 to over $100.You can find information about the Builders Club at the Roblox homepage at www.roblox.com.;
, By accumulating rare or limited edition items, you will increase your trading potential. You can also sweeten the deal when trading by adding Robux to your offer, putting items worth more than what's in your inventory within your reach.

, In-game, you can modify whether or not you are open to trade through a drop down menu in the account settings of your Roblox account profile. There, you should find the Trade Accessibility drop-down menu, where you can choose if you are open to trade or not.

, On the Roblox homepage (www.roblox.com), you can use the search bar to find friends by typing their username into the search bar at the top of the page. Once you've found your trading partner, access their profile page with the search bar and initiate a trade by selecting the ""Trade Items"" option.


You can also make use of profile pages to scope out someone's inventory to see if they have items you're interested in.

, Now that you're a member of the Builders Club and have prepared to join the trading frenzy, access Roblox as you would normally. Make sure you have enabled trading by going to your Roblox account, looking underneath your personal blurb, and verifying you are open to trade in the ""Trade Accessibility"" drop-down menu.

, You can only trade with members of the Builders Club who are both open to trade and have also set trade-parameters to include you. You may initiate a trade with any person who meets these criteria.

, If you know the username of someone you would like to trade with, you can access that person's profile by searing the user name in the search box at the top of the Roblox homepage. Next to the ""Send Message"" option should be a drop-down menu entitled ""More."" In this menu, ""Trade Items"" should be available, and selecting this will open the Trade Browser Window.

, Maybe you have a surplus of Robux and want to use these instead of trading a rare item, or maybe it's the other way around. You can adjust your trade offer until you find a good exchange.


Be warned that the market fee for trading R$ is 30%. The total R$ calculated will include this 30% reduction., Now that you're in the trade window, all of your limited items and all of the limited items of the user you are trading to should be displayed. These can be added to a trade with a click. You can remove mis-queued items for trade by hovering your cursor over that item in the current offer window and clicking the ""Remove"" button that should appear there.You can also initiate a trade from a user's inventory list, where you should find a button towards the bottom that reads: ""Trade Items"".
The amount of Robux you use cannot go over 50% the current offer, which is calculated in-game. As an example, if your current trade is rated at R$300, you cannot add more than R$150.
Submitting a trade will notify the user with whom you are trading with a private message including your offer.
Most traders like to receive higher Recent Average Price (RAP) when trading. For instance, the person will most likely accept when they gain a couple hundred more RAP when completing the trade. It's very risky to send a trade with the person losing RAP.

, Return to your profile and find your trade page, which you can access through the ""Trade Type"" drop-down menu on your Trade page. Here you will be able to see outstanding offers which you can accept or decline. You also have the option to ask more for your trade by clicking the ""Counter"" button.

, Your trade will be valid for up to four days, and at any point during this time the other player can accept, decline, or counter the trade.

For now, you will want to practice with Lito's Preset Classes. However, if you're an experienced player (or maybe a very ambitious newbie) looking for a guide to custom classes, check below at part four.


Good guns for the beginner. If you have absolutely no experience with the game, it's recommended to pick a class like Rifleman, Light Gunner, Heavy Gunner, Submachine Gunner, Machine Gunner, or Shot gunner. These are classes with very good weapons that automatically fire (except Rifleman and Shotgunner, where you have to repeatedly click to fire the rifle). Since each map is different, each of these four classes are better on different maps (although they're all really good at close range). Decide which class you'd like for the current map, and click it to select it (you can always change it later when another map appears).;
, Now that you've picked your weapon, you will need to know the basic controls. CoR has many controls that might not be obvious to the newbie player. You use WASD and space to move and jump like in any other ROBLOX game. However, there are many other keys beside that, which will be discussed in the next few steps.

, One of the first things you want to learn is how to sprint. Sprinting is a very useful method to get across maps quickly and to avoid enemy fire. To sprint, hold down your left SHIFT (the one you usually use, right below caps lock), or double-tap W. Although sprinting only happens for a limited amount of time, there's no cooldown on it, so you can just sprint again right after you stop. It is advisable to sprint in zigzags when you know your enemy is in front or behind you, and that he has a long range weapon that can kill you in one hit.

, Another very useful thing that many players don't realize until they've played for a long time (but that you're learning right now because you're reading this guide) is how to knife or bayonet someone. Knifing can save your life in close encounters and hand-to-hand combat. To knife, press F right before you run into an enemy (you have to be touching the enemy for the knife to do damage). Knifing is an instant-kill if it hits. Bayoneting does the same thing, only that you press E (snipers and pistols don't have bayonets). Some people recommend zooming out to third person while knifing, but it's not required.

, One of the most important things you should learn is how to aim down sights. Most guns will fire very inaccurately if you're not aiming down sights while shooting them. To aim down sights on your gun, press Q. This will allow it to shoot much farther without losing too much accuracy.

, While trying to be a sniper is not recommended when you're still a newbie at the game, you can press Z to zoom in with a sniper rifle (you can then adjust your zoom with E). Alternatively, you can also press Q to get a non-zoomed-in scope. This is very useful for quickscoping.

, Killstreaks are one of THE MOST important things in the game. You can get a killstreak by killing multiple enemies before you die. Killstreaks gain you rewards; the higher the killstreak, the more rewards you get (up to a 25 killstreak). To use these rewards, press G. Some of these rewards include throwing knives, ammunition drops, landmines (called bouncing betties), bazookas, and several different kinds of artillery.

,


Grenades are very useful explosives that are thrown. Some grenades weigh less than others, and can be thrown farther. Most grenades explode several seconds after they're thrown. If you want to make them explode faster, simply click and hold one second before you throw them. But watch out: your own grenades can hurt you, so make sure to get away from them if you're throwing them at an enemy close to you. If you want to see a guide on where and when to use different grenades, check out part two below.
Satchel charges. Later on in the game, you might encounter satchel charges, which are a special type of explosive that you can throw and then detonate whenever you want. Satchel charges are usually found as either a perk, or as a killstreak reward. To use a satchel charge, first throw it, and then press R to detonate it. Make sure to get away from it first, though, as your own explosives can hurt you (but not your allies).
Bazookas. A bazooka is a very useful weapon that can be used to attack snipers or difficult-to-get-at enemies. You can get a bazooka as a perk from one of your classes, or as a killstreak reward. To use a bazooka, you MUST aim down sights (press Q). You can use a bazooka to deal with enemies that are charging at you, or to blow up a sniper. But remember to fire a bit above a faraway enemy, since the rocket arcs.
Throwing knives. Throwing knives are a very effective tool when used correctly. You can get throwing knives from killstreak rewards (they are the very first reward, for killing one person). Throwing knives come in sets of three, and are thrown at nearby enemies. A throwing knife will deal 30-50 damage when it hits someone in the arms or legs, 75 damage in the torso, and it will instantly kill if it hits someone in the head. A skilled player can easily kill with these, so it's a good idea to experiment with them and train yourself to use them.

, In the menu you can go to game settings and switch to mouse-lock. In Cor5, this allows you to hip-fire with ease because a small circle replaces your standard cross-hairs. This can be a fun and useful thing to learn early in the game, but please note for this to be effective the weapon must be able to hip-fire with some accuracy, so no snipers, and be a weapon that would benefit from a smaller cross-hair. (so no shotguns) This can be used well for most weapons, but is most useful with dual pistols and the steady aim perk, making you a mid-range machine in battle. This method can also be a loophole of the 3rd person patch that prevented players from zooming too far out in battle, showing the player an almost GTA like shooting mechanism on their screen. However, this will not allow you to shoot people from behind walls like you could before the 3rd person patch.

, A good gun and a bunch of grenades aren't the only things you need to win in Call of Robloxia. You also need to know how to fight. There are several basic tactics that will be discussed below, such as strafing, flanking, leading, concealing yourself, and landmining or satchel charging.

, Strafing is a basic tactic that can help you avoid enemy shots. To strafe, simply press your WASD keys in a random pattern, while jumping repeatedly. Try to make sure your pattern is random enough that enemies can't predict it and shoot where you're moving next. But don't be so focused on making your pattern random that you forget to shoot: the sooner the enemy is dead (especially if they're a sniper), the better. Strafing can be very useful when going akimbo (dual pistol) so it is smart to use this in that class.

, Say you round a corner on a building and see an enemy. You start shooting, and they disappear behind the other corner. You could try to charge to where they were and shoot them, but they will most likely be already gone. Most people will try to go around the other side of the building and hit you from behind. This tactic is called flanking, and you can do it as well. However, be prepared for the enemy to realize you're flanking, and try to flank you as well. Then it becomes a fight at the back of the building. If this happens, you can either use your pistol to shoot them, or if you're close enough, knife 'em.

, Camping is a tactic favored by snipers and occasionally people with a shotgun, but anyone can do it. When you camp, make good use of landmines (discussed below). To camp, you need to find a good place, usually a choke point like right behind the entrance of a building, or right behind an opening where enemies are likely to go through. Make sure to landmine any other entrances so enemies can't get you from behind. Then you can stay there and wait for enemies to come so you can shoot them.

, There are many different ways to snipe, but this step will talk about long-range sniping. There are two different kinds of long-range sniping: stationary, and mobile.


Stationary is where snipers attempt to hide themselves somewhere so they don't need to move to avoid being shot. Remember, you can climb and hide in some trees (especially on winter passage).
Mobile snipers don't necessarily have to hide, and rely on strafing to avoid being killed.
In either case, it's good to find a nice, high vantage point so you can see enemy players and shoot them. However, make sure not to get shot by another sniper (try to kill anyone that notices you). A good tactic is to get landmines and place them on ladders and entrances near your sniping spot, so anyone that comes to kill you is blown up.

, If you want to snipe but don't feel like camping somewhere and picking off enemies from a distance, quickscoping is a very useful way to get kills. Quickscoping does take practice to learn, but once you are good at it, you become an almost unstoppable killing machine in both long and close range combat. Quickscoping is highly recommended, as it will rack up more kills once mastered than camping. Quickscoping requires you to have a sense of where the center of the crosshairs are even without zooming in. When you approach an enemy, simple zoom in for a split second, kill them, and zoom out. Most players don't realize that a sniper has two modes of scoping: Z, for zooming in, and Q, for a non-zoomed scope. It's recommended to use Q to quickscope.

, When you equip your sidearm, you can move faster. Plus, your sidearm is designed for surprise close encounters that often happen when you're moving in an area full of enemies. If you're not fighting someone, switch to your sidearm to sprint. However, if an enemy appears too far away to use your pistol (like at the other end of an alley), use your main weapon.

, Some players become obsessed with knifing, and try to do it at every opportunity. This isn't a good idea, since if you're not careful, you can get shot to death while trying to knife an enemy. If you bump into an enemy in an alley or are about to ambush them, knifing them is a great idea since they won't have time to react. But if you miss and they're backing away and shooting you, it's better to get out your pistol and quickly shoot them. In first-person mode, knifing causes the player to look up by a slight degree when he knives.

, By now, you should know the different kinds of grenades and what they do. Not all grenades can be used in every situation. Knowing when and where to use them can get you many kills.

, Frags and stickies can be used to kill people who are hiding behind corners waiting to ambush you, or who are charging at you. They can be thrown very long distances, so if you train yourself to throw them well, you can use them to blow up snipers from far away. Stickies are even more versatile, as they can be used to stick to an enemy (who will explode and die instantly after a few seconds). If you get hit by a sticky and know you are doomed, don't just stand there and wait to explode. Find your nearest enemy and try to get as close as possible to him or her so that when you explode, you have a chance of blowing your enemy up too.

, The molotov cocktails don't explode, but they create a burning patch of fire where they land. A one hit kill is possible with the molotov, but it is not recommended to go for this as if the enemy isn't in the exact right place at the right time molotov will not prevail. While the fire doesn't kill instantly, it slowly saps the health of your enemies, making them very easy to kill. Use molotov cocktails to ""block"" hallways, building entrances, and other choke points where enemies are likely to come through.

, Smoke grenades explode creating a cloud of smoke around them. They can be used defensively, as most enemies won't go through them fearing that when they come out an enemy will be waiting for them. They can also be used strategically, as throwing one into a heated battle area will halt enemy fire long enough for you to reload most weapons. If paired with the reconnaissance perk, they can be used as a cheap but effective way to take down enemies.

, Special grenades, called ""signal flares"", are a very unique kind of grenade that doesn't explode or splatter flames everywhere. Instead, they emit bright light, which blinds anyone who gets too close to them. They are useful to force snipers to move out of their hiding spots, or to blind enemies at close range. But make sure not to get too close to them, since they affect you and your allies as well.

, Landmines, known as bouncing betties, are extremely useful and also very fun. Bouncing betties are found as a perk for some classes (like Sniper from Lito's Preset Classes), and as a killstreak reward (for killing 3 people). Strategic uses for bouncing betties include placing them at choke points (like the top of a ladder or right around the corner of a hallway) where enemies are likely to pass by. If you plan on sniping, it's a good idea to place betties at the entrance to your hideout, so any enemy that comes in will blow up instantly. However, some players leave one betty unused when camping so that when an enemy blows up, they can quickly place another one down for ""prolonged safety"". Another good use for bouncing betties is to place them in wide-open spaces where enemies often walk by. It is also advisable to place more of them in enemy spawn-points and strongholds and placing less within your area, although not zero if you are planning on defence against ""intruders"".

, Bouncy betties are not invisible - a very small yellow dot can be seen on the ground (for this reason, try to hide bouncy betties right around corners or wherever enemies aren't likely to look as they pass by). However, if not placed well, the bottom part, which is either blue or red depending on your team, may be revealed, but the betty does not lose its function. The ""exposed betty"" scenario can also occur when a betty is carelessly kicked around. Friendly bouncy betties have a green label above them, just like teammates do, while enemy ones aren't revealed. Try to check the ground in front of you ever so often for yellow dots, especially if you're in enemy territory or climbing ladders/stairs. When you find an enemy betty, you can shoot it to get rid of it (although this is very hard to do and requires aiming down sights for many players). If you've triggered a bouncy betty, you have about half a second to back off or jump to avoid being killed. Practice this - it could save your life. Even professional players don't usually avoid getting obliterated as betties deal splash damage.

, Artillery strikes are very useful killstreak rewards (for killing 5 people) that can be used to blanket a whole area with continuously falling bombs for a limited, but fairly long time. Good places to use artillery include enemy spawn-points and strongholds. You can also use artillery to flush out snipers from their hiding spots. However, try not to spam artillery, as some players consider covering large portions of the map with artillery to be cheap, annoying, and distracting.

, If you're a newbie, try to play on as many different maps as possible to learn their styles and hidden secrets. Different maps are tailored to different fighting styles (some are sniping maps, others are maps where everyone hides around corners and shotgun each other, and others are just ""explosive action"" maps). While you don't necessarily have to use the guns the map is designed for, newbies are encouraged to do so. If you're having trouble on a map, stop and consider what kind of weapons the map is made for, and adapt to the map by using those weapons.

, As you play the game and increase your skills, knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each type will really help you master the game.


Bolt action rifles. This is the first of the many custom classes. Bolt-action rifles lack a scope, and in order to be accurate at a distance, you must aim down sights to shoot faraway enemies. But if you're fighting in close combat, you can just shoot them without needing to aim down sights, as bolt actions are very accurate at close range. You can also bayonet of knife them out. Bolt-action rifles are extremely effective when used well, and can be very versatile. They do relatively high damage, at 50-70 per shot, but that can be increased to a one-hit kill with the Stopping Power perk. Good bolt-actions include the Lee-Enfield, Kar98k, and Springfield, but they all do the same damage (although their reload times are different). Most Bolt-Action rifles have a sniper variant, thus the absence of a scope.
Rifles. Regular rifles are the second class in the list of classes. These are similar to bolt-action rifles in that you don't have a scope and must aim down sights. However, regular rifles fire quicker than bolt-actions and are used just like pistols, meaning that with some mad mouse skills, one can use a rifle in the way he uses a machine gun. The damage for regular rifles varies, but Stopping Power can make them do more damage.
Sniper Rifles. Sniper rifles are different from the above two classes in that they have a scope. All snipers deal 70-90 damage and are one-hit kills if the enemy is shot in the head. However, with Stopping Power, they can become one-hit kills when an enemy is shot anywhere. Sniper rifles have two modes of scoping: Q, to get a scope without zoom, and Z, to get a scope with zoom. Alternatively, the up and down keys can adjust the level of zoom in a scope. Sniper rifles are some of the most versatile and popular guns, and can be used for many purposes besides long-range sniping, such as quickscoping.
Submachine Guns. Submachine guns are semi-automatic guns that fire when you click and hold. Submachine guns are ideal for people who like to charge. Different submachine guns do different damage, but by far the most overpowered are the PPSh-41 and MP40 with the Double-Tap perk (try not to use these constantly, as they annoy most of the other players). Other good machine guns include the M1 Thompson and the Grease Gun.
Machine Guns. Machine guns are slightly different than submachine guns, but serve the same purpose. Most machine guns fire very slowly, so the Double Tap perk is recommended. Two commonly used machine guns are the M1919 Browning and the Bar Gun.
Shotguns. Shotguns serve one purpose: kill the enemy in one shot, and at point-blank range. While not all players use shotguns for that purpose, they are designed to be extremely powerful, one-hit-kill weapons at point-blank range due to their multiple pellets, while compensating by losing accuracy very quickly due to the multiple pellets spreading out very quickly. It is also used by many as a weapon with high chance of hitting the target at mid-range. There are only two shotguns in Call of Robloxia 5: the DB Shotgun and the Trench Gun. While most players prefer the DB Shotgun for its higher damage, the Trench Gun is also a good choice since it can hold more shells without reloading, and also comes with a bayonet unlike its counterpart. The perk Stopping Power can make shotguns nearly impossible to beat, but some players consider that to be cheap and unskilled.
WWII Guns. This class mostly consists of SMGs like the MonDragon, which are good alternatives to the submachine guns found in the Submachine Gun class.
Dual Pistols. Dual pistols can only be used if you have a mouse (trackpad users find it hard or usually impossible to use them). Both pistols are fired by left and right clicking at the same time. You can also press Q to toggle between Manual and Alternate firing mode. They are very effective when used at close range, similar to shotguns. By far the best dual pistols are the 357 Magnums, although many players consider them to be overpowered and cheap. Other good duals are the Dual TT-33 and the Dual M1911.

, All sidearms are pistols. Below is a comparison.


357 Magnum. This is by far the best pistol, with a huge amount of damage and a very long range. Due to these aspects, however, it's often considered overpowered and an annoyance. It also has a huge recoil that affects accuracy after each shot.
M1911, TT-33, Walther P38, and Nambu. These are very good pistols, and most people use these. They do excellent damage, without the massive recoil of the 357 Magnum.
Luger. The luger is not that good a pistol, but it isn't terrible. Consider trying the Magnum or the ones listed above, however.

, Don't stick around Lito's Preset Classes for long when you get better - there are many better combinations of guns, sidearms, grenades, and perks that you can make yourself, using custom classes. To create one, pick Custom Classes. You will see four slots. Pick any one that you want, and click ""edit"". Pick a main gun, a sidearm, and perks to fit your fighting style. You can have up to four custom classes to outfit for different maps and types of fighting. You can also rename your custom slot, by clicking ""rename"" (or the default custom class name) at the top of the screen after you click ""edit"" (make sure to hit enter after you're done typing in the new name).

, Often, Lito's Preset Classes don't give you the very best of each type of gun. Use custom classes to try out new combinations of perks and guns until you find one that you like.

, Here there will be recommendations for each kind of gun, if you're looking to make a custom class. Remember these are only suggestions. You don't have to follow them, and feel free to change them at will.

It's also a plus that you have the persons number to enter in contact, case anything goes wrong.

, Since you have already chosen to buy an account from a certain seller, then you should be okay with the price, but for your good you can always suggest a little lower price - if the seller says no, just pay the amount you initially knew about. Also, make sure everything listed is included in the price. (Items)

, Pay through a reliable and secure program (PayPal is good), and set a limit of time in which you should receive password and account information for you to log in. Remember to have talked and agreed on everything with the accounts seller before you do this.

, When everything is in place - the payment has been made, and your information has been given to you, you should immediately change the account name and password. If not, you could get either hacked or tricked.

Stay with your teammates.,

Use silencing shot first against a healer and than try to scatter shot him and then launch an ice-trap towards him so he is CC'd for 9 seconds.,
Use flairs and traps.,
When a teammate is carrying the enemy flag and is nearly the home base, lay some traps so enemy players will walk into them and get stopped.

, Even if you are only one player out of ten you can make a huge difference if you play good.

, If you see a rogue near your teammate or you, use a flair so the rogue gets out of stealth and he can't open on your teammate or he can't vanish.

,, If your teammates have to gain distance or have to run away, slow the enemies that are chasing them. It will give your teammates time to heal up.

, If you challenge yourself you will get better, believe me. So use your cooldowns!

, Run away and use the nearly unlimited area to kite melees and also casters. Try to waste their time. If they run after you and not after their flag witch is carried by your teammate, it's perfect. But the most awesome feeling is just when you kill everybody that wants to kill you. If you know how to beat the players, beat them and have fun owning it up. Sometimes you just have to help your teammates in order to win. But why not go and blow enemy players up? That's much fun and a very good training.

, If you see a hill and are kiting an enemy, go up the hill and jump down, you will gain so much distance. Try to run away far enough so you outrange the player and then come back, shoot, run away, shoot etc. It's practice but you can really annoy people. I know those things don't work in arena or even duels, but I am specialized on battlegrounds. So you can become good at battlegrounds and with rated battleground, you can really prove some skill. In battlegrounds you can also prove skill and kill more people in a row. Just play many battlegrounds and you will also defeat players in duels that have a very high arena rating. It's practice after all.

Join a member's world.,
Go into a bank, any bank will do.,
Go into a spot where most people can see you.,Empty most of your inventory into the bank so you have room if someone gives you a lot of items

,
Having done all that, say things like: ""does anyone have any members items I can have?"",
Never say ""plz"" since most people find that incredibly annoying.

,
Beg for a little bit, and if no one responds, then stop.

,
Add spice to your begging.,
If begging doesn't work (or if people respond badly, as they most often do) you should use some easy steps to make money.

,
There are many other ways to make money that are just as easy as begging and won't make you look like begging scum to the rest of the Runescape community.

,
Make sure to always say thanks, even if they give you 5k or something that seems so little.,
Many people on member world house parties like it then you advertise their houses.,
Never go begging in full torva and drygores.,
Remember that begging isn't meant for serious income and remember it is just a game.",How to Beg for Items on RuneScape," Try all the other options except begging like making your own things, trading, etc.;
, No means no, and ""gtfo"" means, ""get the (swear word omitted) out"" .

You can still try it as a free player, but the results are less likely to be successful

, The best ones are in Ardougne, Edgeville, and sometimes the Taverly dungeon bank

Note: the higher level they are the more money you're going to get.

, Dress up accordingly, in this case you probably want something in low gp but not straight up bronze. A person with level 127 combat usually doesn't wear bronze, so something smells a little fishy., Do not get mad because they won't cough up nine gp.

Train non-combat skills and get them to 99.,
Train combat skills using this guide:


Levels 1-30 Kill goblins or chickens and collect their feathers then, sell them on Grand Exchange.,
Go show off!",How to Be Very Powerful in RuneScape," Be sure to sell your items you get from this. You will need lot of money for the next step.


Don't sell your ore and bars, you can use these to save a ton of money.;
, *Levels 30-60 train on hill giants. You will need a brass key to gain entrance to this area.
Levels 60-80 train on hellhounds, deadly red spiders or greater demons. Make sure to bring potions and food.
Levels 80-99 train on waterfiends or the abyssal creatures. These shouldn't be too hard if you have 99 in all non combat stats.

, You didn't just become a legend for nothing!

Become a member.,
Work on maxing out your skills.,
Complete quests regularly.,
Complete daily achievements and tasks.,
Aim for the trimmed completionist cape.,
Participate in minigames.,
Join a clan.",How to Become an Expert in RuneScape," In order to unlock all content areas and make your character the best it can be, you need to have membership. It will be easier if you can pay with real money, but you can also buy bonds off of the Grand Exchange. Bonds are items that were purchased by a real person and put into the game economy by trading it. One bond redeems for 14 days of membership and costs about 10M gp. This means you'll need to earn around 20M per month, which can be easily done if you have a good moneymaking technique. You'll have even more techniques as a member.;
, This means attaining level 99 in all skills except Dungeoneering, which maxes out at 120.


To learn quicker ways of training and more places to train, look for guides on YouTube or RuneScape Wiki

It's impossible to get access to all content in RuneScape without maxing out every skill, so if your account is intended to be a skill pure, be aware that you won't be able to complete all the quests and access many things.

, You should make a goal of completing them all so that you can unlock access to all content areas in RuneScape as well as training areas and moneymaking methods. It's important to stay on top of questing so that you don't lose sight of the story line and don't have to rely on guides as much.

, These achievements give small rewards that will enable you to reach mastery much more quickly and in general make gameplay easier. They also familiarize you with aspects of the game you might not have otherwise looked at.

, The trimmed completionist cape is the best in the game and shows to others that you have finished all major content by maxing out skills, completing all quests, unlocking all the music, and much more. You can access the remaining requirements by opening the Hero interface and clicking the Completionist tab.

, Minigames can be very fun and you will learn a lot by playing them with other players. Minigames such as Fist of Guthix, Clan Wars, Castle Wars, Mobilising Armies, Stealing Creation, Trouble Brewing, Mage Arena, etc. are all fun to play and some of them can give XP in other skills besides combat.

, Most of the time, recruiters will come looking for you if you're the right person for them. However, you can also find potential clans in the official RuneScape forums. Participating in clan events makes the game more fun and enjoyable, and having people around you to give you the motivation to meet your goals can help tremendously.

Pray protection prayers.,
Avoid aggressive monsters.,
Make your own resources.,
Never venture into Wilderness caves.,
If you want to fight other players, let them attack you.",How to Be Prepared for Wilderness Adventures in RuneScape," If you are going camping in the Wilderness, it is advised to value defense over offense. Get a good amulet, like the Amulet of Power for free players, or the Amulet of Glory (4) for members. Don't bring in armor that is too expensive, as PKers may go after you for it.;
, If you are rich, this should be no problem. If you are poor, but don't plan on attacking other players or becoming skulled, you can bring 3 items. If you use the Protect Item prayer whenever you get attacked, you can bring 4. Never bring money or items that you don't need.

, An escape plan that often works in mid- to low-level Wilderness is simply running south. If you are below level 20 Wilderness, you can use any teleport to get away, such as the Cabbage-port on your Explorer's Ring. If you are a member, bring a charged Amulet of Glory, as it can teleport you away from up to level 30 Wilderness.

, Having an inventory full of crayfish may not help you much, but if you bring a few lobsters or swordfish, you might just survive for longer. Bringing potions to increase your defense or prayer can also be beneficial.

, If you have a very high prayer level, and someone is attacking you with a sword, pray Protect from Melee. This will keep you alive for a lot longer, or at least until your prayer runs out.

, They can whittle away your HP even if they are level 2, and can leave you prone to being killed by a passing PKer.

, If you bring a pickaxe and a hammer, you can go on the mithril trail, where you mine mithril and coal (and adamant) at the Hobgoblin mine, smelt the ores at the furnace in the East Ruins, turn the bars into armor or weapons at the anvil in the West Ruins, and return to the Hobgoblin mine. This is a way of making wilderness survival gear out of only two introduced items. (You don't even have to bring the hammer. There is a hammer spawn at the anvil.) There are other ways.

, The Forinthry Dungeon is the most dangerous because it contains revenants. Revenants are powerful fighters for their combat levels, and should not be taken lightly.

, If you lose, at least you will keep 3 of your items.

Know the rules.,
Learn the signs people use.,
Learn these symbols.,
Use quotation marks.,
Learn to use asterisks, or as most people know them, ""stars"".,
Start a roleplay of your own.",How to Roleplay on ROBLOX," These include:


Don't butt into other players' roleplays. This means you should not randomly start roleplaying with someone uninvited, always ask the RP group before joining. People hate it when you enter without asking.
Use decent spelling and grammar. While this doesn't sound as important, but it does help. Using better spelling and grammar usually gives the impression that you're experienced, or mature; therefore making people want to roleplay with you.
Don't god-mod. For those of you that don't know what the term ""god-mod"" means; god-modding is basically making yourself undefeatable, or extremely powerful in a roleplay. The act of god-modding (Or ""GMing"") is looked down upon, and very much hated.

, This part will help you learn this simple language. These signs include, but are not limited to:


Parenthesis ()
Quotation Marks ""
Asterisks *
Hyphens -;
, They are usually referred to as ""Roleplay Language"". This Part will help you understand the simple RP language, starting with OOC.


OOC is the most known part of RP Language; OOC stands for ""Out Of Character"". The situation you should use OOC is if you're saying something as yourself and not as the character you are portraying. In simpler terms, chat outside of roleplay.

Example of OOC: ""Hey, what's up?"" (Lol, that was a bad introduction.) ---- This is how you use OOC.
Another explanation, OOC is what separates the real world from the Roleplay world. OOC is by far the most important of the symbols used IRP (In Roleplay).



, Quotation marks are non-essential parts of a roleplay, mainly used to make it better. For people who use quotation marks, they are the most used symbol of them all. Quotation marks should be used when speaking in the Roleplay, here is an example: ""Hello, my name is Aeric."" You don't need to use this step because it is optional

, This is an asterisk: *. A hyphen is simply a replacement for the asterisk, it can be used in place of it. It's simply for people who want to use - instead of *.


Asterisks are used when performing an action in roleplay. This is why this little star is so important. Without asterisks, some people won't know if you're talking or performing an action.
Despite the asterisk's importance, they are one of the easiest symbols to remember to use, and master.
Here is an example of how to use an asterisk: ""Whoa, what is that?"" *I peek around the corner, looking at the bright light.*

, Again, roleplaying can be extremely addictive and fun. You are almost guaranteed to make tons of friends. To roleplay, you don't have to stick to the specific story and personality of who you're roleplaying! Be creative, make up a new personality; Mario doesn't always have to be the hero, he can be a villain if you want him to. Don't stick to a specific story or personality because you feel you have to. No, that would be no fun. Part of the enjoyment of roleplaying is making your own story.

Meaning, no rune armor or dragon hide, unless you are a particularly aggressive politician. God robes are pretty nice, and a white cape should do it. If you are really poor, a black gown top and bottom should be OK.;
, You should start out as a town crier if you are a low level. If you have a level 50 or higher account (meaning your combat level), You could walk around town square as a law keeper. If you really want to fight, keep order somewhere on a PvP world. Break up fights and such. The Wilderness is also a good spot to help lower-level players from the big bad monsters.

Train hard, here's another quick guide:

Members: The only Rock Crabs in the game are in the Members' Area of Relleka.,Get to know your surroundings.,Get your character to higher levels through training - but remember to have fun!,
If you have a question about an item, or how to get something, ask someone, however, if they would not like to talk, do not annoy them.,Don't think you can get high level stuff that other people have acquired; you have to work for it.,
Get your other things up besides combat.,Play fair, don't break the rules, and don't act in an offensive or insulting manner with other players.,
If you are having trouble finding information from your friends, the Knowledge Base, or the Forums, visit a fansite!",How to Be Good at RuneScape," This will make Runescape less complicated and more easy to navigate.;
,

At some point you will get bored and want someone to talk to.







, Here is a quick guide to making money:

Members: Buy Water-filled vials. You want to buy them from the Ardougne general store. The go onto the forums and sell them for 250 gold each no more, no less






Members: Once you have around 1 million gold, you may want to start merchanting (What people in RuneScape call the practice of buying low and selling high) Rune or Dragon Items, or perhaps something else you believe can be made into profit. It is best to sell items in World 2 for Members.






Free-Players: Kill cows for cow hides, bank and continue until you have 100 (about 3.7 runs). Sell this 100 for 10k at Al-Kharid bank.






Free-Players: Kill chickens and sell the feathers approximately 12 each, or buy feathers 6 each at fishing stores and then sell them approximately 12 gold each at GE.






Free-players and members: Air Run See the Air Running guide on wikiHow here. Once you have 60k from that, buy bronze arrows from the Varrock Archery Shop, they cost 6gp each and sell for 20gp each. Now you have 200k! =)

Kill hill giants for drops containing law runes, death runes, uncut gems, and limpwurt roots. All these sell on the G.E. for a good amount of money. Level 20 dungeoneering is recommended for the resource dungeon which contains 11 hill giants & 4 limpwurt root spawn points







, Remember to be firm with your price when re-selling for 240+.

, They look like boulders but when you approach them they pop up and attack your player. They have 50 hp, they give 200 experience points per kill, and they're only level 13!






Free players: When you start, goblins are best. When you're about level 10, start experimenting up to level 20.






Level 20- Guards at Falador or Varrok until level 30.






Level 30- Hill giants. You will need to buy a Brass Key in order to get into the shack just west/north west of Varrock, or you can walk to Edgeville and go down the ladder, although there are stronger monsters on the way, there is a brass key near the ladder out so you can get in quicker later. Level 20 dungeoneering is recommended for the resource dungeon containing 11 hill giants






Level 40- Anything (Except Lesser Demons, and Elvarg), but you may want to try start your luck killing other players in the Wilderness area (Commonly called PKing, for Player-Killing) attack white knights at falador as well
Level 60- If you haven't already, try your luck killing Elvarg, the Dragon from the Dragon Slayer quest. Of course, be sure to bring food and armor, and the Anti-dragon Shield! Bring strength potions as well






Level 70+ - Kill Lesser Demons, Rock Crabs, Ogres, and any other monster that you feel are safe to kill. Generally, try not too go too overboard and fight things over 60 levels higher than you.

Make your character's description.,
Practice your grammar.,
Improve on roleplaying.,
Join the roleplay.,
Check the group and roleplay a little when you can.,
Have fun roleplaying!

",How to Roleplay in the Seekers on Roblox," Obviously you won't be able to roleplay if no one knows what your character looks like. Give your characters name, and tell a little about what they look like ( describe their hair color, eye color, size, and what they usually wear. ) Decide what powers your character has ( you can have up to 4 powers. ) Try picking simple powers like fire,water,ice,etc. Avoid choosing more "" godlike "" powers, like time,space,balance,or hypnosis, because these powers are unfair and are classified as 'godmodding'. Finally, you can tell what animal you can shift into. Some examples are a bear,rabbit,fox,wolf,etc. If you want to be creative, you can choose an animal that not much chose, or didn't choose at all. Tell what you animal form looks like if you want to as well.;
, Yeah, you're not at school, and you shouldn't really worry about grammar on a website like Roblox, but it is actually very important in roleplaying groups like The Seekers, because people will understand you better, and you can be noticed more. Capitalize the first letter in every sentence, and end sentences with the proper punctuation.

, Think as if you were writing a book, and add detail to what you post. For example, instead of saying, "" Bob walks sadly to the beach, "" say something like "" Bob limps to the beach, sadder than ever, the cold wind blows into his face. "" This will make others understand how you expect them to picture it as they read it. Use the () marks when you are not roleplaying write now ( Like this. ) When your character is talking, use the quotation marks to let people know they are talking.

, Now that your ready, it's time you go into the actual roleplay. Make your character wander around alone for a while, then make him/her go into the scene where most of the other seekers are. Try avoiding barging into the scene right as you roleplay, because this might annoy others if you interrupt quickly.

, Try to roleplay frequently and keep in touch with others. Others that are mostly online may remember you better, and you may form a great bond with them, and maybe even become friends!

, If someone calls you a noob, and you didn't do anything to them, just leave them alone. Some Robloxians enjoy hurting others feelings.

, Sometimes, usually when people are new, hate spending their precious tickets/robux. It makes you look noobish if you're not wearing anything. And most stuff is worth buying!

, Saying ""you're a noob"" to a stranger isn't gonna make you not a noob. It's rude, even if they are a noob.

, Some Robloxians like to scam people for free robux or tickets. Buying a shirt or playing a game that says it will give you free currency, is more likely not.

, Doing so doesn't mean your a noob, but it limits how much fun you have on Roblox and if you like playing games that you have to 'train' in to get further in (such as most of the DBZ games) you can find a good game first and be more experienced than others who only find it later when it gets to the top 3 pages of games.

Look professional.,
Show up on time.,
Use proper grammar.,
Be polite.,
Sit still.",How to Pass an Interview on Roblox," If you look professional, you have a better chance to succeed. They will think if are professional and know what you are doing. For boys, you can buy a suit from Kestrel, or Gucci (Virtual Stores). Girls can go to Kestrel as well, and shop for a nice dress.;
, The last thing you want is to show up late. Set a timer on your computer to remind you to go. Usually, the server will lock as soon as the interview starts. Get there around 5-10 minutes early. If you don't make it on time, don't worry, there will always be another interview.

, Most places want you to use grammar, so use it. Practice beforehand to lock it in your memory. Spelling is also very important. With grammar, make sure to type fast.

, Nobody wants a rude, immature person with them. They want a kind, mature one.

, No one wants a hyperactive maniac!

Form a group outside of your favorite World of Warcraft instance.,
Keep in mind once you have started a party or group for the instance, make the players feel comfortable with your character by throwing a joke or two.,
Remember now that you've built a pact of trust, continue the instance without saying a word.,
Note that depending on the instance, you may encounter several Mini-Bosses.,
Remember when it comes time for the instance boss, your group will form a huddle.,
Note that, as explained above, the strategy will probably not work, but you must adhere to it.,
Remember your group has worked hard, and they may be rejoicing.,
Keep this step in mind, because it is important!,
Know the Ninja Loot: As the group begins to argue and/or discuss your claim, disband from your group, and hold shift as your right click on the downed boss's corpse.","How to ""Ninja Loot"" in World of Warcraft"," If your character is level 60, look for groups interested in Blackrock Depths (BRD), Molten Core (MC), Scholomance (Scholo), or Zul'Gurub (ZG). These instances are great for Ninja Looting. Note: for level 70s go to Karazhan, the black temple, gruul etc..;
, Get the group laughing.

, When it comes time to roll on drop, make sure to Greed roll, because the risk of being spotted increases with a Need roll. So if you are thinking about ""needing"" on that Green item, DON'T. And never EVER roll need on a green item. if you really do need a green item ask the group politely if you could roll need. If other players need the item too then it doesn't matter, it might drop later, or a better item might drop later in the instance.

, These bosses are not to be Ninja Looted because their drops are not worth getting blacklisted over. If you are thinking about Ninja Looting them, simply DON'T.

, In this huddle a guild will call out strategies and tactics for taking down the boss.

, Straying from the plan is a surefire way of getting yourself heat. This is not what a Ninja Looter wants.

, Do not give into the /dance commands or /trains. Make sure that you are focused on the corpse you just downed.

, Spark controversy right before the Ninja Loot. This will serve as your distraction. Ninja Looters most often blame others for Need rolling on Materials right before they go in for the Ninja Loot.

, This will ensure that all contents of the corpse are delivered to you in one click. It is important to IMMEDIATELY use Hearthstone and log afterwards.

, Reach out to friends and family, especially anyone who's drifted away because of your addiction. Ask them to encourage you.

, There are so many ways your life will improve once you are no longer obsessed:


More opportunities to see friends and try new things
A healthier sleep schedule and activity level
Clearer focus at work or school
More money to spend or save
No back aches, wrist pain, or eye strain

, Often, it's the social obligation to your friends and guilds, the sense of control and power, and the constant goals to work toward.Find ways to get these in real life, using the advice below.

, Daily goals and rewards are good motivation in productive activities too, such as exercise, real-life social interactions, and job searches.


Try HabitRPG, the productivity software for gamers.

, Read a book, toss a basketball at some hoops, or ask a real-life friend to teach you his leisure activity. Even another, offline video game can sometimes work as a temporary measure.

, If you feel depressed about your life, change it in ways that are fulfilling, not just distracting. Here are a few ideas:


Take classes online or at a community college.
Volunteer at a soup kitchen, or donate a month of WoW subscription to charity instead.
Offer to listen to a friend's problems.

, Look for a cognitive behavioral therapist, who can help you change your thoughts and feelings toward the game., Leave the guild for a week, and tell your guild mates you won't be available. At the end of the week, consider extending the break, or starting a ""week in, week out"" pattern.


Set your chatty friends to ""ignore"" during these breaks. They'll survive.

, Give these to strangers who won't return them if you come back. This reduces the sense of progress and accomplishment.

, Steel yourself and delete one of your highest-level characters, taking away one more emotional attachment to the game.

, Most operating systems have a parental controls setting that restricts when you can log in or go online. Have a friend choose the password to keep it secret from you.

, Access your router settings and find the firewall or port protocol settings. Block ports 1119 and 3724, and no one on your wireless network can access WoW.If you can't find these settings, search online for instructions specific to your router brand.

, Many former WoW addicts do not find it possible to play the game in moderation. Uninstalling the game and letting your subscription run out is often the safer path.

Go to populated places.,
Identify if a player belongs to a guild.,
Wait for an invitation.,
Accept the invite.,
Participate in your group.",How to Join a Guild in World of Warcraft," Go into towns or any places where there could be a lot players hanging out. Guilds who are looking for members often hang around these areas, like Ironforge and Stormwind City. You can either teleport back to the nearest town or use a mage portal if there’s one near your location.;
, If a player belongs to a guild, the guild name will be displayed below the character’s name enclosed within a greater than and less than symbol (<Guild Name>) so it’s easy for other players to identify if they already belong to another guild. You can also write /who <player name> in the chat and this will show the level, class, race and guild (if he belongs to one)

, When other players notice that you don’t have a guild, they will eventually approach you. They will either send you a message either on the Global Message Box or through a private message, both located at the lower-left corner of the screen.


Some guild members will just automatically send you a Guild Invite.
Relatively, you can proactively talk to players with guilds via the Global Message Box and ask them to send you an invite. If they agree, they’ll send you one.
Keep in mind that not all guild members can send invites. Only members with invite privileges assigned by the guild leader can send invites. So if players tell you that they can’t invite you to their guild, they probably don’t have the privilege to do so.

, An Invite prompt will show up on your screen once you receive an invitation. The prompt will include the guild’s name and its guild level. If you wish to accept the invite, click on “Join Guild”; otherwise, click on “Decline Invitation” to reject it.

, Joining a guild is just like joining any other groups. You need active participation to keep the guild alive. Join item and boss hunts whenever you can, and be friendly with your guild mates.


When you’re active enough, the guild leader will eventually promote you to higher ranks, such as a Guild Officer.

Keep your account secure.,
Understand the rules.,
Be a loyal player in the community.,
Be comprehensible.,
Be nice to everyone.",How to Be a Good RuneScape Moderator," To do this, be sure you have recovery questions, a PIN, and a secure password. Ensure that all security features are taken advantage of and are regularly updated.;
, It would not be reasonable to mute a player who isn't doing anything wrong.

, Jagex can demote you if you are disrupting the community.

, Some players may be new to the game and may not be able to understand you if you are used to ""leet speak"" or specific acronyms and jargon within RuneScape.

, If they keep repeating the same question, keep calm. Not many players can fully understand a complex subject, and many players may not speak the same language as you.

Evaluate your addiction.,
Tell yourself to quit.,
Avoid talking about RuneScape.,
Attempt to play more casually.,
Find something to do.",How to Avoid Being Addicted to RuneScape," Do you feel like you get on RuneScape far more than the average player? Is your 'addiction' to RuneScape messing with your life, or causing you to become a procrastinator or someone that is constantly late? Are you getting tired of RuneScape, but are putting off quitting for a reason you can't understand?;
, Motivate yourself. Repeat, ""I can and will quit RuneScape!"" to yourself whenever possible.


Avoid making new RuneScape accounts. It really isn't worth it. Although starting over is a good thing sometimes, this only tests your addiction.
Prevent yourself from playing RuneScape again. Give away your RuneScape possessions. Change your password to 20 characters of gibberish. Uninstall RuneScape and Java, clear your history, and take all RuneScape-related links out of your favorites. If necessary, disable Internet connectivity. Roughing it without Internet is a small price to pay for getting your life back.

, If your friends are interested in RuneScape, and want to talk about it, either keep them quiet about it or get new friends. Don't bring it up on a date. Avoid conflict regarding RuneScape with those close to you.

, Find other activities outside of the house that may suit your talents, and play RuneScape whenever you get bored with them. Do not time yourself or attempt to set up a schedule for playing unless you are absolutely sure it will work. If you have a weak willpower, you may find yourself getting stressed about passing time, or may even disregard your schedule and play RuneScape like you have before.

, Get involved in social and athletic activities. Convince your parents to get you into an after school sport. Remember how easy it was to play RuneScape, even while being away from the computer/keyboard? People tend to watch TV at the same time or fix up a snack while their character is active. Do more of those ""tasks"" and wean yourself off the game as much as possible.

, It will take some trial and error to discover you character's attack range, jumping height, etc. Once you become familiar with the basics, try to learn more advanced tricks, such as how to dodge a monster that is chasing you by turning around and jumping at the same time.

, You use the mouse and keyboard to navigate MapleStory. While the default keys may be acceptable, you might be able to improve your game by changing them.

, To start a guild you will need a lot of money, and you can go to the nearest . If you create a guild, you become the guild master or leader. Then you may invite others, etc. You can also pick a logo of sorts, and distribute different titles to members. Membership in a guild helps you make friends, who you can then easily find and contact. Friends can help you with questions you may have or can go on quests with you. Plus, hey, it's good to have friends.

,


For Explorers, If you're becoming a Magician, you can do it at level 8. Go to Ellinia and travel to the very top to talk to Grendel the Really Old. He will turn you into a Magician. If you're becoming a Thief, you can do it at level 10. Go to Kerning City and find a door with ""Fusion Jazz Bar"" above it. Go inside there and go down the drain in the toilet on the left. You'll find the Dark Lord there. He will turn you into a Rogue. If you're becoming a Warrior, you can do it at level 10. Go to Perion and go to the Shrine of Warriors which is located at the very top. Talk to ""Dances with Balrog"" . If you're becoming a Bowman, you can do it at level 10. Go to Henesys and go to Mushroom Park. Then travel to the very right until you come to a house next to Game Park. Go inside and talk to Athena Pierce. She will make you a Bowman. If you want to be a Pirate, go to the Nautilus. Go into the building that looks like a whale, go up the stairs, then go to the far left room. Go inside and talk to Kyrin. #*If you're a Cygnus Knight, depending on which type of Knight you would like to be, talk to either Mihile (Dawn Warrior), Oz (Blaze Wizard), Irena (Wind Archer), Eckhart (Night Walker), or Hawkeye (Thunder Breaker)
If you're an Aran, go to Snow Island: Rien, and click on the giant polearm.
If you're an Evan, just finish the Evan Quests.
If you're part of the Resistance, talk to Belle (Wild Hunter), Brighton (Battle Mage), or Cheeky (Mechanic).

, Go to Kerning City and ask to join a party. If it is your first time, tell them so they can brief you and give you tips. Party questing is a great way to gain experience fast and is also very fun. When you get to level 35, you can do the Ludi PQ(LPQ). Find a guide online and get exp fast. You can LPQ when you're level 35. Then, you can Orbis PQ. Although you will find no one who does it legit. Rush pq is much better anyway. Once again, find a guide.(google.com)!

, Each class is different in the advancement, so do some research to find out how to go about it.

, You'll benefit from a good place to train until you reach levels 36 - 38.

, When you reach Orbis, check www.hidden-street.net for the location of Jr. Cellions, Jr. Lioners, and Jr. Grupins. They give you a good amount of experience and drop Solid Horns, which are used in the ""Exchange Quest,"" in which you can get 500 experience and some items for every 100 Solid Horns you acquire.

, Level 35 is very low for that Party Quest, but if you feel up to it, why not? Don't tell the others it is your first time or you won't get in. Simply read a guide, and complete the quest up to the 8th stage. If you feel comfortable fighting the boss and you have Magic Guard upwards of 700hp, tell your cleric.

, If you don't know how, tell your PQ members to brief you.

, Once again, each class is different, so do some research in advance.

, Maplestory has more than one hundred different monsters.

Level up your skills.",How to Avoid Being a Noob in RuneScape," If you don't abide by the rules, you are likely to get muted or banned. However, if you do break a minor rule, don't fret. Just don't repeat your mistake, and you'll be fine.;
, It's helpful to have a short name, preferably without numbers, but make sure your username isn't gibberish. Short names are easier to remember and type.


Examples of good usernames: Alina Kai, Phx Rising, Z
Examples of bad usernames: Bob8795253, Dave88896441, Red8689Dragon8779is6554strong654856

, This is when you use numbers, symbols, or other characters to replace certain letters or symbols, such as spelling ""noob"" as ""|\|008"".

, Mature players are only called noobs by immature players, and would never stoop to calling another player a noob.

, This is when you insult another player just because they said/did something to offend you. If someone says ""noob"", just ignore it, whether or not they are talking to you. Do not follow them and start saying ""Noob, fight my main!"".

, Just accept it or ignore it; it's no big deal what someone else thinks of you. If you react negatively, you could start a ""flame war"" and hurt yourself in the process. Every player is a newbie at some point.

, If you are a friendly player, you'll likely be well-liked in return. However, if you are too friendly, you'll begin to drive people away.

, If anything, this will only make you more of a ""noob"". Furthermore, just because you cannot afford a more expensive item doesn't mean that it should be made cheaper. Other players aren't likely to give up their hard-earned wealth for a random stranger going ""omgplzplzzammy!!!!"".

, RuneScape is an online game, not a dating site. If you are caught asking for a boyfriend/girlfriend, you will likely be muted or banned.

, Avoid making claims that you cannot prove, such as: ""I got a level 138 main. I can't bring it here, it got banned/hacked/it's in a member's world"".

, In some instances, you may be in breach of rule 13 (Asking for personal details). However, if you know the person, you may ask personal information via private messaging.

, Jagex can easily detect third-party software such as bots or auto-typers. Any player that is caught using this software to give themselves an unfair advantage will be permanently banned. Using Macros is a pathetic attempt at looking cooler. To use a bot is to seal your own pitifully pathetic place in history.

, There are three types of moderators in the game; consult the Moderators|RuneScape Knowledge Base article to learn more about each kind.

, Players who are annoying are highly likely to leave negative impressions on others.

, Spamming is the act of repeatedly filling the chat window or forums with nonsense or gibberish. This may result in you being muted/banned.

, Try not to say anything that correlates to your friends such as ""My friend can beat you!"". It's pointless.

,, This is against the rules, and as such you may end up being banned or muted.

, Players don't like it when another player starts following them for no reason. If you don't like it when a random level 3 starts following you, don't follow others.

, It is annoying when you walk up to someone and start saying: ""Noob! **** you! Stupid noob!""

, Players with less combat experience might have a higher total level than you do and/or are leveling up a new (but low level) character. However, be prepared for other people to call you a noob based on your combat levels because they can and will.

, If you're a level 58 in Ranged and you're using a sling, you'll be called a noob. This same rule also applies, to a lesser extent, to other skills

,


Don't trade someone, put your whole inventory on the trade screen and then decline.
Don't trade someone expecting them to give you items for free.
Don't trade someone, click accept when nothing is on the trade screen, then click accept again.

, Do not say ""selling something"" then trade a random person and put your item on the trade screen.

, Do not trade someone who is selling something, and click accept when you have nothing on your trade screen.

, Nobody in the game is entitled to free items if they lose their items from being killed/scammed/hacked, so why should you?

, It is very annoying to trade someone and offer an item they were buying, just to stand there for several minutes without them putting up their end of the offer.

, Do not barge into someone's clan chat and start swearing randomly.

, Players in the duel arena hate cowards. If you challenge someone or accept their challenge, do not hide behind obstacles or forfeit; after all, why did you offer/accept the challenge in the first place? The Duel Arena is a safe minigame, and you have zero risk even if you die (unless you staked).

, Don't try to ""claim"" a rock (mining), a monster, or anything that isn't actually yours. Until the monster's dead or the ores are in your inventory, it's up for grabs. If someone mines the ore you're mining or gets the drop for a monster you were fighting, don't get angry; it's just a few items. If you don't want people ""stealing"" your ""kills"", hop to a less crowded world, or choose not to fight in a multi-combat area.

, You can either use the map or politely ask someone to show you to it (it is considered good etiquette to give some coins as a ""tip"" for the player leading you to your destination). A noob is someone who will just stand there and demand directions repeatedly; eg: ""Where is the Grand Exchange!"".

, Bottom line. When in doubt, this is reference.

, Don't follow random players around saying ""buy your armor"". Chances are, they bought it to wear it. Don't be lazy - visit the Grand Exchange or buy from people who are selling the items.

, If you spell something wrong, correct it with an asterisk (*). However, don't go overboard and correct every single grammatical error you see people make and chastise them about their poor English.

,, A level 50 miner has no right to complain about needing 9K exp to level up in the presence of a level 80 miner, who needs more than 200K exp to level up.

, Spend time learning about the skills you are leveling up; combat may not be the most important. Having a good total level is a good start, seeing as you slowly become more mature attempting to get it.

Pick a job that you admire a lot!,
Perseverance is required!,
Know where to start training!,
Keep training!,
So you're level 51 now, huh?,
Your road is now getting more bumpy!,
It's harder to level up now right?",How to Train Your Maplestory Character to Level 200," Now that you've picked a job and decided to train int it, you'll have to know that it is not easy to reach level 200. Get ready for a bumpy ride.;
, To get to level 200, it requires a lot of effort and that you keep motivating yourself not to switch to another job. If you think training your character is boring, then MapleStory isn't your cup of tea.

, If you're between level 1 to 20 then it is best to start off with some quest that will give you a bunch of EXP. Warning! Don't continue to quest when you hit level 20 and above because by then, the EXP is rather useless. Just go to Henesys and look for a place called golem temple and train there till you hit level 30. The EXP given by the golem is around 1 to 3% each so its pretty high and fast and of course, when you reached level 30 then you'll receive a quest that require you to complete it. Attention! This is a must-do quest since it'll give you new skills with better damage.

, When you reach level 30 and have done the quest then your job instructor will ask you to go to a place called the mushroom kingdom. Just go to the mirror of dimension that can be found in all of the towns and look for an icon entitled monster carnival. This party quest can make you level 5 times faster than completing the mushroom kingdom's quest. You can level up from level 30 to level 51 in just 2-3 hours. Just ask for someone to invite you to join his/her party and let him do all the work. You just have to kill the monster when the carnival starts. You'll notice how much you can level up.

, Way to go! You'll notice that you couldn't enter monster carnival anymore since you're already level 51 but never ever enter monster carnival 2 because it's stupid and worthless. Just go to a place called Sleepywood and train on the monsters over there. Make sure to have enough potion with you so you won't die because dying means -10% exp . 10% exp is a lot ! Train till you hit level 60 or 70 and then there you go! You'll receive the third job advancement quest that enables you to learn more powerful and awesome looking skills! Focus on the skills that gives you the most advantage and neglect the skills that gives you the least advantage.

, And hard of course. After you've finish your quest just keep doing all those new party quests that can be found on the mirror of dimension! Trust me, most of these party quests actually gives you 20 to 30% percent of exp which is really huge and are an easy way to level up! Oh and remember always go to channel 1 when you're looking for a party because channel 1 usually has lots people and your chance of getting invited is higher. Of course, you'll have to ask nicely.

, But self-discipline will always make it easy. Let's say you've reached level 100 by doing all those party quests every day! Your hard work has paid off! Now your level 100! Almost there! Just finish the fourth job advancement quest and get the strongest skills for your class. Start by training in the Evolution World!It gives a lot of EXP! I know! Boring right? That's what you've got to face if you wanted to reach level 200. And you also might notice that some people might ask you to go bossing. If you feel that you're ready, then be my guest, just join them. For your information, bossing is a word used by maplers as a substitute for fighting bosses

Download Cheat Engine from a safe site.
,
Find a tycoon on Roblox with a donate tool.,
Start the game and open up Cheat Engine and select ""Roblox"" from the process list.,
Type in how much cash you CURRENTLY HAVE in the box next to the word ""Hex"" and below the word ""Value"".,
Once you've typed in your current cash value, click ""First Scan"".

,
Wait for Cheat Engine to finish scanning.,
To find which address is yours, change your cash value (either by losing or gaining cash), then type in your NEW cash value (Ex: You had $200, and gained $10, so you would now have $210.,
Once you've typed in your new cash value, click ""NEXT SCAN"".

,
Wait until it finishes.

,
Repeat steps 8-10 until you only see one address to the left.

,
When you've found it, make sure it is the same number as the cash value on the game.,
If the number does match, double-click the address.,
Double-click the NUMBER under ""Value"" on the address on the BOTTOM PANEL.

,
After doing so, a new window will pop up that allows you to change the value.

,
Change the value to however much cash you want.,
Once you've changed the value, it will change the value of your cash on the game too.,
Now here's where the donate tool comes in.,
Once that change occurs, the amount of cash the game says you have is real and you can buy everything!

,
You can also change OTHER people's cash values so you can make them rich or poor (you can even make them in dept by giving them a negative cash value using the dash key before the number (Ex: -999999999) and then donating to them to complete the hack.),
Also, if you happen to meet another hacker in a game who is abusing their powers, click the check box to the left of your cash address on the bottom panel.,
One more thing: If you enter a game that requires you to type in the amount of money you want to donate, don't use cheat engine.,
All you have to do is type in how much money you want into the donate box and put a dash in front of it to make it negative.,
What you are doing is donating a negative number, which because they're the opposite of positive numbers, you will gain cash instead of losing it!

,
If all went well, your cash should have gone up by the amount you typed in the donate box (excluding the negative of course).,
And also be careful about the amount of cash you gain, for if you gain too much, it will result in a negative number.",How to Money Hack on Roblox Tycoons,",


Works easier with donate tool, GUI and collect buttons work, too.

, (Click the button titled ""Process"" at the top of the Cheat Engine window)

, *MAKE SURE ""HEX"" IS UN-CHECKED, ""SCAN TYPE"" IS SET TO ""EXACT VALUE"" AND ""VALUE TYPE"" IS SET TO ""4 BYTES"".

,,


Once it's done, a huge list of addresses should appear on the panel to the left. (One of those addresses is your cash value.)

, So you would type in 210.

,,,, If not, you did something wrong and you'll have to click ""NEW SCAN"" and try again. (Steps 4-11)

, After doing so, the address should appear on a panel at the bottom.

,,, (Ex: 999999999)


NOTE: If you make it too high, it will result in a negative number. (If that happens, just double-click the value again, and type in a smaller number.)

,


Note: Don't do anything with your cash yet; it’s not actually how much cash you have right now, and it only shows up on your screen.

, Donate any amount of cash to any player. When you do that, you should see his/her cash increase, and yours decrease by the amount you chose to donate (Ex: Your cash shows up as $999999999 and jonnyboy27 has $500 and you donate $20. He now has $520 and your cash now shows up as $999999979.)

,, (Just don't abuse your new hacking powers)

, (This will ""freeze"" your cash address making it unable to change until you unfreeze it, therefore making it extremely difficult for them to hack)

, (There is a much easier way to money hack that I will explain in the steps below)

, Then donate to someone.

,, Consequently though, the person you ""donated"" to will lose the amount of cash you typed in, so just be careful who you do it to.

, This is usually irreversible, so you might have to exit the game and try again if that happens.

Use dark SkyBoxes.,
Do not make a haunted house.,
Try thinking of video games that have scary places and model your place after that.,
Add mysterious badges to your place.,
Make your place empty of living creatures.,
Make your servers small and disable Bubble Chat.,
Make obstacles.,
Add pop-ups, they will scare people when they least expect it!

,
Create a scary ad for your place.,
Once you have followed all the steps above, you are ready to go!

",How to Make Your Roblox Place Scary," SkyBoxes are the skies around you when you play Roblox. They can be stormy or even inside a computer. You can search for SkyBoxes in the Roblox free models list when you build your place. Be sure to search for SkyBoxes like ""Nighttime"" or ""Full Moon."";
, Haunted houses are very overdone and end up being just a one day sensation before they start losing visits. Create a place different from a haunted house, like a ""Cave Crypt"" or ""Doomed Temple.""

, Don't model your place after somewhere in ""Fallout"" or ""Left 4 Dead"" because they are overused. Try games like ""Rayman 2: The Great Escape"" which has scary and mysterious places like ""The Tomb of the Ancients"" or ""Beneath the Sanctuary of Rock and Lava."" These offer new ideas to the theme of scary, and you might just end up starting a new trend on Roblox if your scary place gets enough visits.

, This adds the ""adventurous"" theme to your scary place, and make them well hidden. Ideas for badges would be ""You found the Mario reference"" or ""You discovered the secret crack in the wall"" which make people want to find exciting new things.

, Don't even add ghosts to give your place the lonely and scary feeling.

, This will create an even bigger feeling of loneliness as more people contributes to people saying, ""Hey, this isn't that scary with all of us here!"" Disabling Bubble Chat also helps because you won't know where other people are and you will be scouting to see where they are, unless they reveal their locations via Menu Chat.


A way around this is by disabling chat altogether. To do this, simply create a new script in Workspace with the code:

, Put some dark matter on the ground that kills on touch, and add some logs or boulders on top of the dark matter as stepping stones.

,, Add no text, just the face of a scary looking ghost. Most people get thousands of visits bidding amounts of 5000-7000 Tix on ads.

Create your character.,
Train on Maple Island as a newbie.,
Make your job advancement in Henesys at level 10.,
This is so you can equip your armor and weapons, which have stat requirements.

,
Decide how to invest your SP.,
Here are some general guidelines as to where to train:


Levels 10~12 - The second and third platforms in Henesys Hunting Ground, or the Slime Tree.,
Take the second job advancement at level 30.,
New skills galore!,
Here is my recommended second job build:


First point into (Arrow) Bomb/IA (Iron Arrow), because it's considered fun to play around with.,
Again, here are some training guidelines.,
Make the third job advancement at level 70.,
Congratulations for making it this far!",How to Make a Master Bowmen in Maple Story," Due to changes to the character creation system, you no longer need to ""roll"" for your stats. Instead, once you arrive at Maple Island, pump all your AP into strength, as it will help you level faster. Don't worry, these points will get reset once you make the job advancement.;
, Do the initial tutorial quests and then: Todd/Peter's, Maria', Lucas', Rain's, Pio's, and Mai's three quests. That should be enough to get you to level 10. (Don't worry if you accidentally over-top the level; you will regain lost SP) Leave Maple Island via Shanks in Southperry and talk to Olaf in Lith Harbor, choosing bowman as your job of choice.

, Go left in Lith Harbor until you reach Phil, and ask to go to Henesys. Then, go into Mushroom Park and enter the house at the very end. Talk to Athena Pierce and you will become a bowman. Apply your reset AP in the following way:


Hunter: Str 5+ your level, rest into dex
Crossbowman: Str equal to your level, rest into dex.

,, Every time you level up, you will gain 3 SP, or Skill Points. Athena will also give you one SP for making the advancement. Here's what I suggest:


First point into arrow blow, so you have an attack.
Three points into Blessing of the Amazon, because it's the prerequisite to Eye of the Amazon.
Max out Eye of the Amazon, so you can attack farther.
Max out Critical Shot. This is arguably one of the most important passive skills you'll get as an archer, along with Eye of the Amazon and Mastery. When it activates, it doubles your damage, giving you a huge boost in damage.
Max out Double Shot. Why DS and not AB (Arrow Blow)? Well, although in formula they do the same amount of damage, DS has two chances of activating a critical, whilst AB only has one, giving DS a huge advantage over AB. The only pro of AB is that it has a better knock-back rate.
Now I suggest putting your last nine points into Focus. The reason why I prefer Focus over Eye of the Amazon is that although Focus is an active skill, which means you have to cast it to get the benefits, it increases accuracy and avoidance. Plus extra accuracy is virtually useless for a bowman, considering they have a large amount of accuracy already.

,
Levels 12~15 - The uppermost platform in Henesys Hunting Ground. You can also try doing Henesys Party Quest.
Levels 15~20 - Henesys Party Quest remains good experience. An alternative is Pig Beach, which is found in Split Way by pressing up on top of a patch of yellow flowers.
Levels 20~23 - You can stay at Pig Beach, or try Bubblings in the Kerning City subway.
Levels 23~27 - Now you can do Kerning City Party Quest for some good exp and items you can sell for money. Bubblings are still good experience.
Levels 27~30 - Keep on training at KPQ, or try the first or second excavation sites in Perion, killing Ghost Stumps and Wooden Masks.

, Find Athena and talk to her; then find the second job instructor. Be ready with some white and blue pots. Talk to her and you'll be transported to a special dungeon where you'll need to kill monsters and collect the Dark Marbles they drop. You'll need 30 Marbles; the monsters have a drop rate of approximately 1/3. (Note: the monsters here don't give exp) Talk to the instructor again, then go back to Athena and choose either the path of the hunter or that of the crossbowman.

, You can experiment some by yourself, but you need to make one big decision: whether to go FA or FA-less. FA stands for Final Attack, a passive skill that has a chance of activating every time you use DS (or AB, if you chose to max that out), giving you an extra attack that does a high amount of damage. Although this sounds good on paper, some people choose not to go with FA for three main reasons: it doesn't work with third and fourth job skills, making it obsolete after you get a decent level of Strafe and Inferno/Blizzard, you may unintentionally attack monsters, and you get more SP to spend on other skills. However, FA does speed up your training in the second job by quite a bit, so the decision whether to go FA or FA-less is ultimately up to you.

,
Put 19 points into (cross)bow mastery immediately. You'll see a huge increase in your damage overall. (The reason you don't max it is because the last point only gives you +1 accuracy)
Get a few points into both Booster and Soul Arrow. These will help speed up your training and lower arrow costs.
Max out Bomb or IA. It'll greatly speed up your training speed and gives you mobbing capabilities.
Max out Power Knock-back. Now you don't need to worry about hitting monsters with your bow when you get up close.
Max out Booster and Soul Arrow.
Put the remaining SP in whatever you want. I suggest maxing Mastery and Focus.
NOTE: If you still want to go with the FA build, you generally max out FA after you put a few points into Booster and Soul Arrow. Your end result is 19 Mastery, 15 Booster, and 7 Soul Arrow, with everything else maxed.

,


Levels 30~35 - Wild Boars in Perion, or the third excavation site, where you'll now face steel masks in addition to the wooden ones. You can also trade wins in CPQ for quick leveling.
Levels 35~40 - CPQ is your best option here by far. You can either continue trade winning or try playing competitively, but the latter might be a bit difficult with the advent of KoC classes.
Levels 40~45 - CPQ, again. Trade wins will be getting a bit slow, so try regular CPQ or buy wins. Another training option is Iron Mutae in Magatia.
Levels 45~50 - Last stretch in CPQ. You know the deal. Trade wins will be terrible, now. If you have good damage, you may try Straw Target Dummies in Mu Lung.
Levels 50~55 - Straw Target Dummies are your best option. An alternative is truckers, found in Singapore.
Levels 55~60 - Ah, Mysterious Path 3. This map, located in Singapore, has the fastest spawn rate in all of GMS. The exp is godly. If mp3s are crowded, Ghost Ship 2 is also available, although the spawn is slightly worse. If neither of these options appeal to you, you can stay at truckers or STDs, or attempt Ludibrium Maze Party Quest. NPCing the rewards you get will earn you a cool two mil or more an hour, and the exp isn't that shabby either. Try to get a party that can do the PQ in under two minutes.
Levels 60~65 - You can stay at mp3s, or try voodoos in the Haunted Mansion, which give 335 experience each with only 6800 HP. LMPQ is still good, especially if you're looking to make some cash.
Levels 65~70 - You may notice LMPQ getting a bit slow now. There are three options: stay at mp3s, stay at voodoos, or, for those whose damage is high for their level, windraiders, located in Crimsonwood Keep. You'll need to pass two jumpquests to get there, so I suggest searching up YouTube guides or asking friends to show you the way.

, Go to El Nath - Chief Residence, and talk with the instructor of bowmen. Then travel back to Henesys and talk with Athena. She will give you a quest to defeat her doppelganger. Once you do so, collect the Black Charm and return to her. She'll send you back to El Nath, so talk to your third job instructor and get a Dark Crystal. These can be purchased in the FM for 4m. Then go to the Holy Ground (located beyond the door in Sharp Cliff II) and answer the Rock's questions. Be warned, if you answer any of the questions incorrectly, you'll need to offer another Dark Crystal. You'll be given the Necklace of Wisdom. Go back to Nath and talk to your instructor, and you'll have become either a ranger or sniper!

, Unfortunately, you're on your own from now on. If you have any questions, there are many maple forums you can turn to, such as BasilMarket and Sleepywood. Best of luck on your maple adventures.

A few options below.,
Options for above level 80.",How to Make a Good Maplestory Warrior5,"


Level 20-49

Headgear: Andras Hat
Overall: Simply buy an overall with a little bit of strength, and then scroll it for dexterity. This way, you add Accuracy(The Dex gives ACC) and a little bit of attack.
Gloves: Mushroom Kingdom Gloves, Ice Knight Chain Crampons (can do 2% attack on PvP)
Shoes: Squishy shoes are okay, however I believe you can get better shoes.
Accessories: Larson's Challenger Equipment, Free Spirit Piercing
Weapon: Your Choice


Level 50-79

Headgear: Zakum Hat (req: lvl 50), Lord Pirate Hat (req: lvl 55) or New World Bandanas (req: lvl 70, can be earned for a limited time when Nexon opens a new server)
Overall: Same as lvl 20-49
Gloves: Workgloves with 2-10 attack
Shoes: Your Choice
Cape: Pink Adventurer Cape, another nice option is a cape potentialed or containing your main stat.
Accessory:Your choice but you should get: STR ring 1, any Silent Crusade rings,



,


Level 80+

Headgear: Scarlion Hat
Overall: Your Choice
Gloves: Brown workgloves with 12 attack or more
Shoes: Facestompers

These things are great choices to make your warrior great, however they require a lot of funding and mesos. Brown WG's are just 100m+ alone, with attack they are so much more. You must be very rich to do these things. Good luck creating your warrior, and keep in mind what you should buy. Only buy things if you NEED them


Accessories: Your choice, but you should get STR rings 2-7, Warrior Symbols, Angelic Blessing, and any Pendants you can find.

Firstly, build your building.,
When you are happy with the building, select it all by using Roblox Studio, Go to ""Workspace"" and click, hold and drag down or up to select, then right click and press ""Group"".,
Now all you need to do is put the Title, Description and whether or not others can take it.",How to Make Models of Buildings in Roblox," You can do this with bricks from the Insert toolbar from Roblox Studio or use the Stamper Tool.;

Make sure the engine brick and the red seat are both facing the front of the plane, or the direction that you want the plane to fly along.

Test Flight!,
Public Domain.,
Try making more planes.",How to Make Airplanes in Roblox," What kind of airplane do you want to make? How many people will it seat, how big will it be, and what do you envision it will look like?


You may want to draw your design on a sheet of normal or graphing paper before proceeding to the next step.;
, Enter Roblox Studio and gather different types of bricks that you will need to make your plane. For example: normal blocks, wedges, cylinders, and spheres.

, Make sure the bricks are unanchored and welded on ALL sides.

,, Start with the very bottom and work your way up to the ""ceiling"" of your aircraft. Be sure to add windows and doors where appropriate.

, Wedge bricks will work great for the tail section, and when used in a realistic way, will make the aircraft's nose section look great, too.

, Try making them as neat as possible and in a realistic ratio to the rest of the plane.

, Use this time to add more cool stuff to your plane. Do you want landing gear, winglets, antennae, guns and turrets, or anything else? Feel free to add them now!

, Are all your bricks unanchored and welded together? If not, do so now.

, You can read the ROBLOX Wiki page or find a plane kit that can help you with this step. What this step does is make your plane ready to fly.

, The engine brick is the key to the success of your airplane. If you do not include it, the plane will not fly. The red seat should be a normal welded seat, but also should be colored Bright Red; this is where the pilot will be able to fly the plane from. If the seat isn't bright red, the plane won't fly.

,, At this point it is probably a good idea to make a backup model of your aircraft in case something goes wrong. Make sure that the backup model is NOT in the Public Domain.

, Grab a normal plane tool, hop into the red seat and press Y to start flying. If you take off, test how the aircraft handles and behaves. If your plane does not fly, first test other plane tools with your plane. If it STILL does not fly, I recommend going through the contents of the plane to make sure everything is there or increasing the size of the engine brick.

, Congratulations, you have created your first airplane! Now is the time to release your plane into the Public Domain. Name your aircraft and publish it so that others can see what you've made.

, As they say, practice makes perfect. Building the perfect plane will not be easy at first, but once you get the hang of things then you will find that making ROBLOX aircraft is exciting, creative and fun.

This is necessary so that you can save and publish your game onto the Roblox website and maybe even have it become famous.;
, This is where you'll find all your pre-existing games, clothes, etc.

, This will take you to a menu where you fill in the information. Start off with a simple baseplate, the rest is up to you. When you're done click 'Create Place' in 'Advanced Settings'.


Use a name that's likely to be searched up 'Mega Obby' '150 Stage Obby' 'Impossible Obby'. Just make sure the names match up to the actual difficulty, stages, etc. Impossible Obbys should be very difficult, but not entirely impossible.
Do not allow gear, this will allow people to cheat, and if you're selling it you won't make as much profit.
Classic Chat will just post the chat on the top left corner, Bubble Chat will post the chat just above your head, so people near you will only be able to see it, and Both allows both chat types to be in your game.
This will take you back to the 'Develop' page and your game should be there.

, This will prompt you to either download Roblox Studio, update it, or open it.


All of Roblox's programs are safe so if you haven't downloaded Roblox Studio, download it, so you can start working on your obby! Updates are also important so if it prompts you to update, please do so.

, Go to the top menu and select 'View'. Make sure you have Toolbox, Explorer, and Properties selected.

, Go to 'Toolbox' and go to the drop down menu. Select 'Models' if not already selected.

, Choose the second item that pops up.You will now have a sparkling star and a red lava bar in your game.

,,


The star works as a spawn point. The star labelled '1' will be stage number 1 and you will always automatically spawn at where the star is located when you first enter the game or die before you reach star '2'.






You can remove the sparkles by going to the Explorer, clicking arrow next to '1' and removing the objects called 'Sparkles'.
You can change the shape by inserting the script and auto-spin (if wanted) into another object of your choice. Just make sure to delete the star and rename the new object '1'.

, Click copy or simply click and press Ctrl+C.

,, Select 'Rename' which is located under delete and rename it '2'.

, You will see in the leaderboard that your stage is now '2'. This is how your obby will work.





, You can do this by going to Explorer, right click baseplate, and deleting it.

, This is the room where you spawn in and sometimes contains VIP rooms, fun things, etc.

, Scroll down until you see 'Roblox Sets' Select it.

, Click it and select 'Bricks'.

, If you don't want the studs on it. Select the brick and go to properties. Scroll down in properties until you see 'Surface' change all the studs to 'Smooth'.

, Make sure it is the size you would like.


Use the colored orbs to resize it. Green orbs are for scaling height and red and blue orbs are for scaling length and width.

, You can anchor an object by going to the menu and finding 'Anchor' which is located next to 'Color'. When you select anchor it will not fall or move.

, That is where the player will spawn.

,


You could add rolling balls by going to bricks, selecting a ball, and making sure it was unanchored.
Other fun ideas are welcome badges, signs, VIP rooms, advertisements, etc. Just don't make it too crowded!

, Lava jumps are those red lines that can be seen in checkerboard patterns or just simply jumps.


Your Polar Systems came with a Lava Jump. You can add a block and put those lava jumps over the block .That's a simple lava jump system. Place a star at the end and it's done.






For a Checkered Lava Jump Obstacle you can just resize the lava jumps and copy and paste them on a bigger block.







, Disappearing Stairs are a common obstacle that needs some, but not a lot of script work.

First insert a brick and resize to the size of a single stair. Make sure it is anchored.
Right click it and select 'Add Object' and select 'Script'.
Now you must type these words into the script:






Copy and paste the bricks and rotate them so they look like a staircase winding upwards.






Make sure there is a platform at the top and a star!

, If you only put in one pistol your place won't get visited because it will be too boring. Instead put in Rocket launchers and shotguns as well with lots of other weapons. (Anchor your bricks or someone might shoot at the walls and explode them)

, The scarier the better and the more the merrier. Just remember that the more you put in, the larger it will get.

, If you don't people might not be able to move around quickly so they'll leave because they keep getting killed. (Free models may make your place laggy)

, People will visit regularly if they know a big update is coming! Maybe you could put in admin for your friends or an anti-teamkill script so players can't kill one another.

Think about the ""type"" of username you want.,

Think about things you like.,

Consider adding common prefixes or suffixes.,

Add certain letters and numbers to replace some characters in your username.,
Try finding a four-letter username.,
Use capital and lowercase letters wisely.,
Make your username unique.",How to Make a Roblox Username," This means if you want a one-word username, a two-word username, one with numbers, etc.


One-word usernames can be hard to figure out if you want it to make sense and able for people to pronounce it, but it is a great way if you want your username to be simple.
Adding more words increases the chances of getting an available username, but it makes it a bit more complex and long (if you want a short username).
Adding numbers are great to make it more unique, but if you're trying to ""be like the rest"", use numbers wisely, or not add them at all.;
, Whether it's from rabbits, or to popsicles, the things you like an make your username more creative.

If you are going to do this, think about how your going to order it. For example, you have the words Whisperer and Tiger. Are you going to put in WhispererTiger or TigerWhisperer?

, These can add more letters to a one-word username, if it is taken.

Prefixes that are frequently used are ""i"" (as in iMarble), ""ii"" (as in iiCherry), or ""x"" (as in xSecretEdition).
Suffixes that are used frequently are ""ism"" (as in Solidism), ""ize"", (as in Lyricize), or ""XD"" (as in PastelCatsXD).

, These can add style to your username and if used properly, it won't make much of a difference.

The letter ""x"" is commonly used to replace certain letters, mostly vowels to make the person easily read the username. For example, if Legitamite is taken, you could replace the first ""e"" with ""x"", like Lxgitamite.
The letter ""v"" is mostly only used to replace ""u"", like Pvmpkins instead of Pumpkins. It is rarely used to replace other letters.
Numbers can replace letters as well. Since ""3"" looks like a backward ""E"", it is used to replace ""E/e"".

, If you want your username to be rare, four-letter usernames are useful, since now ROBLOX requires a minimum of 3 characters. Adding another letter decreases its rarity but having a four-letter username is still considered very rare.

, If your username consists of 2 or more words, capital usernames are useful.


For instance, if you're thinking of the username, ""MostlyAnna"", capitalizing the first letters of each word organizes it rather than having a username with all lowercase letters, such as ""mostlyanna"".
If you want a one-word name, capitalizing the first letter wouldn't matter, as people won't have trouble reading it.

, Don't copy someone else's username. For instance, if someone has the username, ""Simplex"", don't just add a letter and remove one and say it's your own, especially if you're copying someone who's well known.

, The ""Handle"" is the part that when a player touches it, the player is able to use the gun. The ""Barrel"" is the part where the bullets come out.

, The Tool goes directly to Workspace(in the Explorer). It is one of the most important things and cannot be missed, because the Tool is the one responsible for making your gun/weapon usable.

, A Minimap Script is responsible for making high quality weapons look even better. It also acts as a minimizer, meaning it will make everything in your baseplate, the large bricks, into tiny ones, all except for your avatar.

, After doing so, you will know that the script works when a message on top of your screen appears. After that, you will see the big model of your gun turned into a tiny one. Find the minimap model in your baseplate or workspace.

, Open the Minimap Script which you inserted into the Workspace. After opening it, at the very first line of the script, you will see something like this;


scale = 2/10






That line is the only line that you are allowed to make changes to. For Example, if the original was:


scale = 2/10

then, change it to


scale 2/20






as you can see the /20 makes everything different from /10. You can make everything to even the most tiniest things. But it is recommended to use the /20.


If 1/20, 2/20 or 3/20 does not satisfy the size you want, you can use decimals.
5/20, 0.6/20 or even 0.2/20
It's up to you.

, Then Delete the script and then Paste. Again, a message will appear at the top of your screen.

, Open it and then you might see these names of the parts:


Workspace->Part

,,,,, Remember the Tool thing? Drag the Minimap Model into Tool. And once its inside the Tool, Ungroup it.

, And paste it into the Tool where you dragged in your Minimap Model.

,


If it worked, the gun of yours might be in a weird position when you equipped it. To fix it, don't equip it.

, Then Equip it.

, This acts as the Grip Position for your model. Mess with it so that you can get the right Grip Position.

Pay attention to the scammer.,
Beware of paying half first.,
Buy or earn NX.,
Don't participate in drop games.,
Some scammers tell you that you can copy items by pressing Alt+F4 or Ctrl+W.,
NX scams are risky.",How to Keep from Getting Scammed in Maplestory," Watch his:



Fame. Most scammers have negative fame. But this isn't a really accurate way of predicting. Sometimes players buy defames, get mass defamed from a smear campaign, or just really don't care. Just be wary if someone with -20 fame invites you to the Kerning City equipment store for ""free"" Angelic Blessings.







Level. Would you rather have your level 5 character banned or your level 111 character banned? Most players would choose the first option because they have common sense. Just be careful if a level 10 invites you do a drop game.







Appearance. Most scammers wear the default clothes (the ones that you choose in the new character section) or class specific clothes that are low. Just be suspicious if a person in default or low leveled clothes ask you to be his ""friend"". This is also not accurate because some scammers wear high leveled clothing or NX items.







Name. A scammer would use complicated names such as ""dfsshrtie1"" or ""MageGIIlllrlll1111"". This is because before, you have to type in their name to report them, and if their name is complicated, they can get away easily. Nexon had made it harder by replacing it with a drop-down list with all the players in the map and the last people you talked to.





;
, This is most common with NX scams and boss runs. If your paying for a Zakum run, ask them if you can pay them after the run, and pay full price.

, You can get NX Credit from buying NX online or doing an offer, prepaid from buying NX gift cards, and Maple Points from Cashback days and from events. Sometimes Nexon gives NX during rollbacks, and if they do refund you, they may give you the wrong type of NX.

, Most of them happens in the Kerning City hospital (which has no mini-map), where the scammer is above you and steals your items. If you want to scam the scammer, make some work gloves with the Smithing profession or buy them from people. After the scammer drops something good, drop the work gloves and claim that it has ""10 attack"". Pick up the items and change channels before you can receive a defame from the scammer.

, They don't copy, but they close the game.

, You know those smegas (super megaphones) advertising NX selling? These are risky, as you may not get your NX or even worse, lose your account.

So you like Maplestory?,
Pick a warrior for these attributes.,
Choose bowmen if you like high DEX.,
Catch a thief.,
Whip up a magician.,
Be a pirate.,
Be a Cygnus Knight.,
Ride with an Aran.,
Roar with an Evan.,
Become a Dual Blade.,
Join the Resistance.,
Choose the path of the Cannoneer.,
Shoot with the Mercedes.,
Fly with the Demon Slayers.",How to Know What Job to Pick in Maplestory," Well, if this is your first character, then play for at least a week on your own before reading this. If not, then read on!;
, If you want a character with high HP and good attacks in your early stages, then you want to be a warrior. Warriors are good at training and are often invited to guilds and parties, and they are very expensive characters. Warriors, especially spear man, are natural mobbers, and thus, easy to level during your first and second job advancements.

, If you want a character with high DEX and Good Mob attacks, then choose bowman. They have very quick range attacks and they deal a very good amount of damage. They are one of the cheapest characters to get and they are very good people. 1st Job bowmen can get a skill that gives them up to 160% speed and at 2nd Job, they can summon different familiars.

, If you want a character with high LUK and DEX, then you want a thief. They also produce very good range attacks, and can use knives and daggers whenever they want. Thieves are one of the most popular jobs in Maplestory, and are envied by most people. They are usually very expensive, but if you get past that part, then they aren't so bad.

, If you're looking for a character that has very high MP and does very good damage when using mob attacks, then you want a magician. Magicians do very well in leveling until about level 15, then it's very hard to level for about 5 levels. Magician is thought of as the lamest job for many people. But they are very powerful range attackers and mob attackers. They have very high attack and are used in Party Quests very frequently because of their long range attacks. Note: Magicians are not to be used to kill, or steal from, any other player (especially warriors). Clerics can heal, make portals, and add buffs for their party members, so if you become a Cleric, you may be exploited.

, Pirates use guns and knuckles to attack their way up. They are very fast attackers, have mob attacks in 1st job, their skills are interesting, and have a good dash attack. Like the thief, making a pirate can be expensive, but they have godly skills (Gunslinger)

, The Cygnus Knights are similar to Explorers (Warrior, Mage, Thief, Bowman, and Pirate), but their skills have an element related to them. The classes are: Dawn Warrior, Blaze Wizard, Wind Archer, Night Walker, and Thunder Breaker. Remember, each class has their own advantages and disadvantages. When you reach Level 120, you get the option to make an Ultimate Adventurer (they start at level 70, have a skill related to your Cygnus Knight Skill, start with 500k, and have a unique set of equipment). Because of their skill cap at 120, they cannot access the Henesys Ruins (requires level 160) and join a Cygnus Expedition.

, They are a class which use mobbing skills. Unlike other Warriors and Dawn Warriors, they use pole arms. In their first job, they have a movement skill called Combat Step. Arans have a good knock-back and in their 4th job, they get a skill that can reduce their damage from monsters. However, for most skills, they require a huge combo. They also have wolf mounts starting at level 50, growing in size and awesomeness until level 200.

, Evans are like most Magicians, but they use their dragons to attack. They have advancements every 10 levels and every advancement gives you new skills. They have more HP than regular Magicians, Blaze Wizards, and Battle Mages. Evans can resurrect their party members in their 10th Master. However, they don't have a healing skill, and Magic Guard, Magic Booster, and Critical Magic requires skill books, which requires NX to buy.

, Dual Blades are thieves who uses daggers and katanas to fight. They have fast attack skills and mobbing skills. Dual Blades have a special skill in their 4th job that allows them and their party members to get a higher chance of getting critical attacks. However, like the Evan, you will need to buy mastery books for Slash Storm, Tornado Spin, Mirror Image, Flying Assaulter, Sudden Raid, and Thorns. Sometimes if you buy the mastery books, you get a special skill for mastering it or coupons for katara scrolls. You can still get the books for free, from the Gachapon or Free Market. These books have lower success rates than the Cash Shop books.

, The Resistance are Magicians, Bowmen, and Pirates (Gunslingers) with a twist. Resistance Members have a skill that combines Dark Sight with Nimble Feet. They also have a skill that gives potions up to 30% more HP and MP.


Battle Mages use staffs and use physical attacks with magic to attack monsters. They can teleport in their first jobs and have a skill that increases the attack of their party members. They have a skill similar to the Magician's Genesis, Blizzard, and Meteor called Dark Genesis.
Wild Hunters are bowmen who use crossbows and ride a jaguar while attacking. Wild Hunters have a skill that can capture and summon monsters which can be used to help fight monsters. In their 3rd job, they can blind and trap monsters. They can also remove the need to use bolts in exchange for MP. Wild Hunters obtain a colored Jaguar mount starting at Lv. 10. (Red, Blue, Black, Purple, Beige, etc.)
Mechanics ride a machine and use guns (not shown) to attack monsters. They have mobbing skills in 1st job, which can be useful for leveling up. Unlike Wild Hunters, the Mechanic's machines aren't fast, but they have a skill that is similar to the Aran's Combat Step skill.

, As a beginner, they have 3 exclusive skills. The first one gives them 12 inventory slots at the beginning and 12 more slots at their second job advancement, the second skill allows them to swim faster and not drown, and the final skill gives them +15 of each stat and a bonus 5% HP and MP. They have unique buff skills that can boost up their stats (Ex. Monkey Magic).

, Just like the Cannoneer, they have 3 unique skills (charm and jump boost, go up ladders faster, and be fast). They have a 10% EXP boost, and start at level 10 instead of 1 like every other class. Mercedes don't use arrows, instead they use ""Infinite Magic Arrows"", a special arrow that can have Hidden Potential. However, they can be frowned upon on because they have kill-stealing skill. Mercedes mastery books are hard to find, and even though you found one, they are really expensive.

, Similar to Mercedes, they start at level 10 instead of 1. Just like the Cannoneer and Mercedes, they have a bonus skill that can be transferred to another character (10% more damage to bosses). Demon Slayers use something called ""Demon Force"" which is similar to Mana points.

To get to Ossyria(Orbis), you'll need to go to the 6 path cross way in the center of Victoria Island.,
Once you reach Orbis, get out of the station, and walk to the right of the map.,
You'll be in another map, and there's an NPC and a statue of the goddess with two portals.,
In Orbis tower, there are 20 floors, and through this tower you could head for El Nath and your destination, Aqua Road.,
On your way, you could see monsters ranging from Orbis, El Nath, and Aqua Road (ie Penguins) But don't worry, just jump down and down to avoid them :)

,
As you reach the lowest floor, go for the portal (the map is underwater).",How to Get to Aqua Road in Maplestory," Go up the rope and into the first portal you see. The boat leaves every 15 minutes and the ride takes 10 minutes.;
, You'll see a statue and a portal near it. Get into the portal.

, Head to the right portal.

, Jump from 20th floor to the lowest floor. If you had done Huckle's quest, he will give you 5 Orbis Rock scrolls.

,, just walk to the right of each map, and hey presto! You're at Aqua Road.

"
"
Wait.,
Ask politely for them to Change Channels.,
Ignore them.,
Get rid of them.,
Blacklist them.,
Stay on the map longer.,
If all else fails, accept defeat.",How to Get Rid of a Kill Stealer on Maplestory," They may not always be there to kill steal. They may be checking to see if the portal's full. If you say ""CC please"" (Change Channel please) the minute they enter, they may feel aggravated and wish to Kill steal you more.;
, If you have established that they are indeed KSing you, ask them politely to change channels. They may think you don't mind and being rude will aggravate them.

, If they are insulting you or throwing you rude comments, ignore them completely.

, If they refuse to leave at all and you need to get rid of them fast, try with one of the following ways.



Reason it out with them Be polite, talk it out try to reason with them. Sometimes KSers are sensible. Ask why they're cursing you and see if all they need is a ""I'm sorry""

Befriend them. Although may be difficult, continuing being nice to them may make them more willing to leave you alone.

Invite them. If the curser is a person weaker than you, make a party and invite him. You will some experience, and you can help each other to level!

Be creepy. Although an odd tactic, being creepy may make the KSer feel uncomfortable and wish to willingly leave. Acting over flamboyant seems to make many male KSers uncomfortable easily. Even if they are creepy back, go with the flow. Go ahead, be a Troll.

Confuse them. Doing contradictory things may confuse them. For example, asking them to Change Channels and defaming them, then later sending them friend requests, facebook, email, name or anything personal will possibly confuse them.

Reverse Psychology. Some KSers are there just to KS. Reverse psychology, although may seem childish may indeed work. Saying things such as ""kill faster, please"" and continuing to say ""faster"" may belittle their actions and they may feel the need to leave.

Be Annoying. Don't be too mean, just say really annoying things.

Leach off of them. If they are stronger than you, use that to your advantage. Hit each monster a few times, at least once or twice (depending on HP amount) and then move on without killing. You will at least receive some EXP without having to do any actual work.

Kill steal back. If you are stronger than them, try to do the same to them.Group attacks work best so the whole map is covered. Getting more members from your party, guild, friends, or alternate stronger characters can help you kill steal back. This is a bit risky, as you may get defamed.

, Especially if they're tracking you and following you around. If you blacklist them, they can't track you. If they're still following you, play a different character for a while. Go into a dungeon or go somewhere they will definitely die like Big Foot, or get lost such as Crimson Wood.

, Some KSers will disconnect, get bored, or have to leave. The longer you stay on, the more likely chance the other will leave sooner.

, Accept the fact that you can't win every time and Change Channels.

Complete the Bonus Stage.,
Get your prize and exit.",How to Do the Ludibrium PQ of Maple Story1," Ludibrium is a Lego-like community with two towers, Eos to the left and Helios to the right. From Victoria Island, you board a ship to Orbis from Ellinia. The ship leaves every 15 minutes, on the quarter hour. When you get to Orbis, you board a ship to Ludibrium by going right from the map you landed in. If you are an experienced mapler, you can get to Ludibrium by way of Aqua Road and Korean Folk Town, but unless you don't think you are, stick to the ships.
, Once you land in Ludibrium, walk left and you will find yourself in a huge town map. Keep walking left (3 maps) until you find yourself in a map called ""Eos Tower-100th Floor."" At this point, head up and press up at the large oak doors. There are two sets-one when you walk in and one at the top of the map. You want the ones at the top., When you walk in to a map called ""Eos Tower-Floor 101,"" advertise you are requesting a party by saying ""J>PQ"" in channel one, where people generally recruit for the party quest. It may take a while for you to be accepted, and you may be expelled a few times, but if you keep a good attitude about it and don't give up, you will eventually get into a party. When you have joined a party, ask which channel you should change to. If they don't answer, wait until you have a party of 6 and ask again or check where the other party members have gone., When you have found a channel, ask for a track. If they say they don't have one, ask if they have AC or if they are surfing. AC is automatic clicker, and it means that you cannot leave the map but you can be ""afk"" (away from keyboard). If you are surfing make sure you change channels quickly when they tell you to. If you DO have a track, tell the leader when it is the eighth stage, the ""Crack on the wall,"" and the bonus. The leader should start clicking at the bonus, or at the ""Crack on the wall""., When your leader gets in, you will be moved to stage 1. In this stage, you kill the rats and dark rats, as they will drop passes for you to give to your leader. If your party is a smuggle party, you will do this stage 3 times, but you will skip stages 2,4,5,and sometimes 7. If not, your party leader will clear the stage. DO NOT go into stage 2 until someone says you can., Once you have completed Stage 1, do not enter the portal and go to Stage 2. One person must volunteer to go in while the rest stay behind. The person who goes in will need to hit the second box down and will be transported to a separate map. He will then say ""clear"" in party chat which means the rest of the party can enter the stage safely. Stage 2 is about boxes. Poke the boxes with your basic attack button (assassins and archers can bend down and poke to conserve arrows/stars). The boxes drop passes; give them to your leader and wait for him/her to clear the stage., In stage 3, you are killing ""Octopus""es. Poke the boxes and they will come out. Boxes are found both above and below your starting point, so it is advisable for some people to ""take up"" and some people to go down. When you are done, give the passes to your leader and wait for the stage to be cleared., In stage 4, you have to go through one of the portals you see. Before entering a portal, drop a worthless item or 10 mesos. This is called ""marking"" a portal and it causes others to keep from entering your portal. The top and bottom portals are not really portals. After that, the first 3 are for magicians and the last 2 are for physical-attackers. Although you can technically do any portal you want, it is easier if you stick to your class-portal as you will do more damage. The second-to last one has 2 monsters. Inside the portal, it is pitch black and you can only see/attack the monster when its eyes are open. When you have killed it, get the pass and go up to the top. When your leader gets to the top, give him/her your pass(es) and wait for the stage to clear., Stage 5 is another portal stage. Mark a portal and go in. If you are the only thief with dark sight in your party, put it on and head down. You must never touch the monsters in this stage as they will one-hit kill you. You may do so if you are an HP Warrior (puts points into HP to utilize Power Guard) with the leader's permission, however. If you are a magician with teleport, head to the very top and enter the portal to find the passes. In any case, when you are in a portal, you must poke the boxes and get the passes. Each portal has 4 passes. Then head back to where you came into the stage and give the passes to the leader, and wait for the stage to be cleared., In stage 6, there are numbered boxes. Each box is a portal back to the beginning of the stage or a passage to the next ledge. You must press up on the boxes in this order: 133 221 333 123 111. When you get to the top, go through the portal., In stage 7, if you are an assassin or an archer, kill the monsters at the top one at a time, then jump down and help kill the Rombot that was summoned. You do this 3 times. When all 3 Rombots have been killed, the leader will collect the 3 passes and clear the stage., Stage 8 is confusing if your party is uncooperative. Your party only needs 5 to do this stage, so one person will have to ""sit out."" Basically, there are eight numbered boxes, and you must try to figure out the correct combination of numbers by standing on the corresponding boxes. You start with the combination 1-2-3-4-5, and then the person standing on box 5 moves to box 6, and so forth, until you have found the correct combination. There is another method to do this as well, called ""KMS"" because Korean MapleStory is where the method originated. Once your party reaches 1-3-4-5, the person standing on box 1 will also try box 2 as well as going in ascending order. For example, with KMS, you will try the combinations in this order: 1345, 2345, 1346, 2346, 1347, and so forth., Your leader may decide to exit at this point. If not, wait for Alishar, the boss, to be summoned. If you are an archer or an assassin, summon the boss by killing the rat. Alishar can steal your skills and cast weakness, which causes you to become unable to jump, so watch out. Bringing holy waters and eye drops may be a good idea. When Alishar's HP is lowered to a certain point, he will summon monsters as well. When he is dead, the leader will pick up the keys and clear the stage, at which point you will be moved into the bonus stage., In the bonus stage, you have 61 seconds to poke the boxes and pick up the mesos and other goodies that come out of them. At the end of the bonus, you will be moved to the prize collection stage., In the prize collection stage, go to the top and click on the NPC to get your prize. When you get it you will be moved back to Eos Floor 101."

Be able to tell if you are addicted or not.,
After you've answered these questions, think... Do you want your life to be ruined because of MapleStory?,
Now you have to admit you have this problem.,
After setting up that goal.,
People's opinions: They might think ""it's too hard to quit"" or ""I can't quit."",
Ask people to help you.,
Reside to Private Servers, even though they might be looked down upon.",How to Get Rid of Your Maplestory Addiction," First thing's first. Can you tell that you're addicted? Here are four questions to determine if you are or are not addicted. (It may or may not be a strong addiction)


When you see your computer (closed or opened), do you feel an urge to go to MapleStory?
Does MapleStory distract you from anything? (Learning, classes, etc.)
Do you often go to Maple only? Maybe you talk (or desire to talk) to your friends about maple almost 24/7?
Is MapleStory affecting your grades? Look at your report card. If you're getting D- to C on any grade, this may be a good idea to quit;
, How so? There can be people that have an uncontrollable lust to play everyday. People always competing to be the top. That could ruin your life for good. You could be too distracted to the desire to play. Some people could have easily failed their classes because of that. (Happened to me) So think. Don't ruin your life. You get no second chance.

, After admitting, you should set goals. You don't have to quit to get over your addiction. Maybe play lesser a week. For example on setting a goal: I will play three times a week in # hours.

, Try following it. It might be hard at first but you'll get the hang with it. Try using other hobbies to occupy yourself. Don't feel discouraged if you didn't do exactly what you had intended. If you stopped a bit you've made progress!

, Replace those negative terms with positive terms. The more people think negatively the more they really will fail. Don't forget to try. Making some-what improvement is still improvements too!

, Your friends are there. They should be able to help occupy you like mentioned before.

, They will basically allow you to do a years work of levelling a character up in a day or less. After about a week, maybe two weeks tops, you'd be able to play almost every single character on MapleStory. Private Servers has a thing called Rebirth, basically if you reach level 200, you'll get ""re-birthed"" to level 0 with everything, except for your level.. So yeah.

Start posting on the C&G forum for about a week leading up to the creation of your group.,
Log into Roblox.,
Go to ""Create Groups"".,
Change the ranks and what they can do.,
Go to group rank (the small box that only lets you type in numbers) number and do lowest to highest.,
Click update and those changes you made are saved.,Add something in description that describe your group.,

, If you're new to Roblox, then create a new account. Buy BC, TBC, or OBC if you are NBC.,

Come up with a unique name. Generic names, such as ""The Army"" or ""Empire"", will not stand out, and should be avoided. Search online for a clan name generator, or come up with an idea for yourself. Good examples of names are The Fifth Exile, Gallantry, and V O I D.

, (Post on group wall, group shouts, view group wall, etc.) Using military ranks is suggested if you are trying to run a military army, like Private, Corporal, Sergeant, Captain, Major, etc., 1-19, or 1-6, or 1-10..., You may change them any time, but you will not be able to remove group ranks.,, This will be your group's emblem, and will represent it., The most common training center, a Holo, uses a script to change the map upon command. They generally include several obbys, a map for sword or gun tournaments, and a free-for-all map. Make sure it has an admin script., Bases usually have two teams, one for the defenders (your clan) and one for raiders. Bases also generally have a terminal or flag that the raiders must hold for a set amount of time. You can also take one from free models. Everyone says it's bad, but usually nobody can tell, and everybody does it., Generally, people copy their ranks from other clans. An example of this would be, in order from least to highest: Private, Corporal, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Officer, Colonel, General, Commander. It is best to have about 6-7 ranks. Having lots of ranks serves no purpose and costs extra money., Uniforms unite all of your members under a common outfit, giving them more team pride, and making it easier to identify members., Come up with a generic message which could apply to anyone, and send it to a lot of people.

Invite popular C&Gers, your friends, or anyone else you trust to be a high rank in your group. High ranks host trainings, raids, and other events to keep activity high.

, Once you have about 10 or 20 members, it is time to start hyping your clan. There are several ways of doing this, and all involve using the Clans and Guilds forum. Ways of doing this are having all of your members make forum posts saying ""GLORY TO "", declaring war on a major group (Such as V O I D), and other ways. There are multiple ways of hyping your clan, so find one that works for you., If you are planning to be a power clan (a group that focuses on having skilled, active members rather than being large), make an obby which potential members must complete in order to be accepted into the group. If you are planning to be a superclan (having lots of members), you can skip this step."

Get to lvl 30.,
Go to the cpq place on ch1 and say Joining pq For Coin Farm!

,
When someone invites you to their party to do Monster carnival, accept it.

,
Keep the party window open, so then you can see which channel your leader is going.,
When you start CPQing, Try to go into coin farm.

,
Kill monsters, and when they drop maple coins, get them right away!

,
When you have collected at least a good amount of maple coins, trade in the maple coins for the level 35 dagger, the Gephart.,
While Gepharts are not exactly popular weapons, they get the most bang for your buck when you resell them to NPCs (150k each).

,
Do this again over and over, until you are satisfied with your earnings.,
If you want to make a character that only collects money and equips, etc., you can train him to level 50 with CPQ and getting coins while you're at it, when you get to level 50, you can go suicide so you don't level to level 51, so you can do CPQ all over again, and collect as much mesos as possible.

,
(Example: You have a character say a mule, you train him to level 50 with a job advancement, and you only want him to collect money, equips, etc., when he gets to about 90%, go to somewhere perhaps Ligators if you're in kerning, or go to pixies if you're in Orbis, or go to Master Chronos if you're in Ludi etc, but make sure you have a return scroll so you can get back to you're nearest town quickly.,
So you have a character you don't want to level beyond lvl 50, do CPQ over and over again and suicide over and over again when you reach 90%, by at least a week, you should have about 3m a week, if you play a lot and get about 21 coins a day to purchase a Gephart.",How to Earn Maple Story Mesos Easily for Lvls 30 50," Make sure you make job advancement.;
,,, If your leader changes channels, go to the channel that he is in.

,,, Each Gephart costs seven coins.

,, You can try to sell other items too, albeit for less of a profit if NPC'd.

,, Then when your character reaches around 10 or 0%, you can start getting as many coins again. If you want to get a lot of mesos, save up about 90 coins, and exchange them -via spiegelmann- for a Spiegelmann's necklace and a Spiegelmann's marble and scroll the marble with the necklace, it should successfully be scrolled, if it didn't, I'm sorry(Lol).

, Good luck getting mesos.

Visit the club at night whenever you feel like it, or buy the DJ gamepass if you can.",How to Have Fun on ROBLOX Beach House Roleplay," Go inside of the biggest building. Bet an apartment on one of the floors by walking into it.


You can change the color of you apartment with the small bars beneath your TV screen.
It is better to get an apartment closer to the middle elevator rather than farther way for easy traveling.
If you ever want to lock your apartment use the red and blue buttons next to your door.
You can sell your apartment by pressing the button intended to do so outside of your apartment.;
, There will be a menu on the left side of you screen that can load and save outfits. This is useful for changing clothes without having to reset. On the top right corner of your screen there are shop and closet buttons. First, load the closet. Then buy whatever you like with gems. Don't forget to save!


It is suggested you buy things from the catalog with tix and Robux if you can so you look original. If you're short on currency, using the shop is just fine as well, but there will be other people that might wear the same things as you if they use the in-game shop.
There is a plastic surgeon (face changer) and some places where you can get free hair and hats on one side of the island. These are good for starting off, but if you want to be unique, even the in-game shop holds better hats.

, The load and save outfit menu on the side of your screen is useful for quick changes, but you don't have to use it. If you're using your own outfits from your ROBLOX inventory, arrange the outfit you want for that slot in the character menu and reset to put it on, then save it to the slot. Every time you reset, load the slots again and save your outfit to the loaded ones.


If you are using the in-game shop, the slots are a little bit useful but you can skip this step if you'd like.
A good way to use your slots is to use the first two slots for casual clothing when running around, the third for fancier clothes that you might wear to the club on the fourth floor, the fourth for pajamas if you ever plan on going to any sleepovers or are a role-player and don't like to sleep in your everyday clothes, and the fifth for a swimsuit or swim trunks.

, Go to the side of the island with the pet adoption spot and pick your favorite! Then go to Kooky's Pet Clothes and color your pet's fur and give it a hat or two. Don't forget to name it!


You can make your pet stay in one spot by making it sleep, and after some distance away your pet will teleport to you (Magically)! But sometimes if it won't teleport you can make it in pet commands.
Pets are great ice breakers. Since you can control their chat, make them say something embarrassing and scold them. The person who your trying to make friends with will laugh and if they have a pet too, your pets can socialize or talk smack about their owners in front of them! The bar to make your pet talk is right below the pet commands. Pets are great to be able to get talking to people!

, If there is a DJ in there just get on the floor and start dancing!


One of the best parts of Beach House Roleplay is the socializing, and the club is a great place to hang out with old and meet new friends.

, In Roblox, there's many items of clothing to choose from the catalog. Unfortunately, you may not suit everything. Some items depend on gender, personalities, interests, age, etc. Find something that suits you. You can also purchase hats. This also includes hair for both boys and girls. Gear is available and can be found in the catalog also.

, Roblox provides a lot of items you can earn, and it's always good to have a few of these items! There's a lot you can earn on Roblox, and here's a few things; Badges, knockouts, friends/friend requests, money (robux, tix), etc. Badges are always a good place to start. Begin by making 20 friends and adding them to your friends list, and you will get the ""friendship"" badge. Next, I'd recommend going for the CI (Combat Initiation) badge. You must gain at least 10 victories (kills/knockouts, I believe). Go to a game and ""pwn"" someone at least 10 times. Once you've earned these badges, you should go for 100 knockouts and earn the ""warrior badge"". This shouldn't be too hard.

, If you're interested in Roblox and would like to explore more, I recommend Builders club. For new purchasers, I'd get BC (Basic/normal builders club) or TBC (Turbo builders club/medium builders club). I would only recommend OBC if you're a veteran, because you may get bored of Roblox and you won't want to be wasting money! BC is the cheapest, TBC is in the middle, and OBC is the most expensive one of the three. (BC/TBC/OBC costs real life money). You can earn daily robux with builders club (BC=15 daily, TBC=35 daily, OBC=60 daily).

, Everyone has special qualities on ROBLOX. Some are great at graphics designing, clothes designing, owning groups, foruming, making games, etc. Monkrymonkry got famous by a few games, that could be you some day!

Join an active group which hasn't got too many members.,
Be as active as you can and try to come to group events when others are on.,
Be an active poster on the group wall/forum.,
Go to training sessions a lot.,
Recruit people for the group.,
In group events, show respect, responsibility, and listening skills.,
Don't team kill.,
Follow orders from higher ranks first time.,
Offer to do or make something for the group, such as a training base or a raiding center.,
You can put the group as your primary group and favorite all the group places along with sending friend requests to a lot of the members but this will not necessarily secure you a promotion.

,
If you get BC, TBC or OBC (Builders Club, Turbo Builders Club and Outrageous Builders Club), you can make your own group and do what you want with it.,
Most war groups will have you contact a leader or High Rank for a test to become a High Rank in the group.,
If you get turned down the first time, train more and try again until you get accepted.

,
After becoming a High Rank, some people wonder how they can become an even higher rank.",How to Get a High Rank in a Group on ROBLOX," One to two hundred members should do it.;
, Participate in raids, trainings, and group events. Hopefully somebody will notice that you come on a lot and will point this out to the leader.

, Use good grammar and spelling, and be mature and diplomatic. Again, hopefully people will notice and realize how active you are.

, This increases your skill and may even help with promotion.

, Ask your friends if they would consider joining the group. You could also go to games where the theme is similar to that of the group. For example: If you're in a war group you might want to visit ""The Underground War"" or ""Armored Patrol"". Also try being friendly and give promotion requests for people to like you, but don't do this often, then the HR's will suspect something., This demonstrates that you have strong potential in terms of becoming a High Rank.

, People will get angry with you and you might get exiled from the group.

, This will show that you have good listening skills and can respect others.

, This will boost your popularity.

,, If leaders of other groups see you already have a good active group, they might promote you.

, They usually consist of the things you have learned in training, such as fighting and obstacles. Sometimes they include a record of your past experiences and how you tend to deal with challenges. There might be another test to see if you have proper spelling and grammar. Finally, they usually have you host a training to see how you can handle situations and go about helping people, and giving promotions.

,, That can be another test, consisting of a more difficult obstacle and sword/gun fight. There is sometimes even an election for the highest ranks. This will be a test of how much the community likes you, and could possibly lead to you owning the group.

The following describes Bowmen.",How to Decide Which Class to Choose on Maple Story2,"


Bowmen can use ranged attacks, and hit very hard with them. Although useless in melee early on, their high damage capability at ranged makes up for it. They have unstable damage at first. They are very hard to jump-attack with.
Pros:

Damage starts to shine later in the game
Most range in the game
Most uncommon whole class in the game
Highest accuracy among all classes
Relatively cheap equips (especially for crossbowmen)
High knockback ability
Hurricane's (Bow Master skill) rivals Triple Throw (Night Lord with Shadow Partner (star thief))
Pierce (Marksman/XBow master skill) deals very, very high damage to mobs.
Marksmen get a skill that can one-hit KO any non-boss monster.
Arrow Eruption/Rain allows 3rd job Bowmen to mob up close.


Cons:

Mediocre HP, and MP
Unstable damage (fixed in 4th job, where you get 90% Mastery)
Use up close until you attain Power Knockback and Mortal Blow
Attack speed is slower than that of their star counterpart (especially crossbowmen)
Movement and jumpshooting is tougher (but possible)
No party skills until 4th job.
Only tank ability is puppet (warriors have skills to increase weapon defense, and hp. Magicians have magic guard/magic armor to decrease damage taken. Thieves have avoid-ability and alchemist/chakra later on to improve regeneration)


NOTE: Bowmen are not as useless up close as sins, as the skill, power knockback (pkb) knocks close enemies away much more easily.;
"
"
The following describes magicians.",How to Decide Which Class to Choose on Maple Story3,"


Magicians are very abundant in the MS community. You can see any class of the Magician walking around all the time. Unlike bowmen and assassins, their attacks are both melee and ranged. A constant damage dealer they often have some survivability through magic guard. They are liked in Party Quests for the damage they are able to do and the skills they can contribute.
Pros:

Very good damage comeback in 4th job in the form of mob skills
Incredible amounts of HP and MP recovery
Take damage through Magic Guard, in MP
Higher magic defense
Can telecast (teleport + attack skill)
Heal, used by Clerics, Priests, and Bishops, defeats the purpose for HP potions
Owns all the other classes at 4th job. (15 monsters at amazing levels of damage but use more mp).
Most mages have mob moves


Cons:

The only 2nd job advancement attack as cleric is holy arrow, which is equal almost to magic claw.
Low weapon defense
Same problem with bowmen with jumpshooting
Low HP
Overpowered by some classes
Though Magic Guard helps it so they don't die, it also costs a lot of mp, and mp is more expensive than hp to buy potions for. NOTE: monsters/bosses that dispel also dispel Magic Guard, so it requires fast reflexes to recast and avoid dying)


NOTE: Although other classes overpower Priests in 3rd class, they have a whole slew of party skills that attract the attention of all parties.

"
"
The following describes thieves.",How to Decide Which Class to Choose on Maple Story4,"


Thieves are a very interesting class in MS. They can jump-attack with throwing stars and attack up close with daggers (although you will have to choose between those). They also have the coolest-looking equipment (debatable). Thieves don't get much defense, but they have high avoid-ability, making the enemies tend to miss. They get fast attacks instead of few strong blows, and as a 2nd class, they get one of the most fun skills in MS, Haste.
Pros:

Fast attacks
Range (for star-throwers or melee (knife-wielders) but can go hybrid
Can jump-attack
High accuracy (though not as high as Bowmen) and very avoid-ability
Triple Throw with Shadow Partner (Night Lord) speed rivals the Bow Master's Hurricane
Alchemist is very useful for Hermits (Heals 150% more from pots, and things like onyx apple last 15 minutes instead of 10)
Hermit's low survivability rate is made up for their good avoid-ability skills such as flash jump, although it takes some practice to get used to using it correctly. Also a good skill to get around faster.
Meso Guard greatly increases bandits survivability rate
Meso Explosion is a very powerful skill, but you have to use your own meso's for it.
Night Lords 4th job skill Ninja Storm knocks back all monster in range and stuns them so you have more room to attack (commonly achieved in much higher levels because of the difficulty acquiring the skill)
One of the best choices in parties for boss runs


Cons:

Mediocre HP
Assassins must be funded (to have good stars e.g. Ilbis, which cost around 15mill depending on the world)
Dagger thieves have the hardest time leveling in the 1st job (unless they use stars until level 30)
Assassins generally have less defense than Bandits because if the ability to wield shields
Assassins have nothing to protect their HP (But they can HP wash, requires a bit of nx)
Dagger thieves (Bandits) are harder to level until 3rd job
Daggers have short range, though fixed by Boomerang Step in 4th Job
Assassins tend to require more meso to maintain than other classes as well as the price of acquiring stars.
Thieves are very abundant, dagger and star alike (though much more of the latter).



"
"
The following describes warriors.",How to Decide Which Class to Choose on Maple Story5,"


Warriors are mostly melee fighters. They cannot use range attacks like the other classes until much later in the game. Therefore, and as presumed, warriors have the far more health and defense than other classes. Attacking melee is sometimes boring, but the sheer damage of every hit makes it worthwhile.
Warriors do a lot of damage at higher levels, but are eclipsed by Mage's in the intermediate zone. At this point, Warriors seem pretty pathetic, but don't give up!
Also, it is debatable to choose 2H, or 2handed, weapons over 1H weapons. The good news is that you can use both depending on the environment. This is resulting because of the Warrior's 'Mastery' skills. For example, Fighters get Sword and Axe Mastery. If you pick Axe Mastery, you get a higher minimum damage + accuracy for BOTH 1H and 2H axes.
Pros:

Highest HP and Defense of all classes.
Choice of 8 different weapons types.
Can choose between 1-handed and 2-handed weapons.
First Mapler's to get a mob skill.
Pages (mace/sword users) can use elemental charges like those of Magicians to enhance attacking in 3rd Job and beyond
High raw damage.
Spearmen are wanted in parties should they have Hyper Body (increases max HP and MP by 60%)
Fighters are liked for their Rage ability. Increasing attack by 10.
Dragon Knights are the first class to have the ability to hit 15 monsters in the map. (Dragon Roar)
Crusaders do more damage on single monsters, while White Knights do more damage based on elemental powers, and Dragon Knights do more damage to mobs.
Dragon Knight have a more increased range but more evident in 3rd job.
Crusaders and White Knight gets mp regeneration in 3rd job.


Cons:

No ranged attacks until 3rd (for Spear and Polearm users) or 4th job(for every other warrior)
White Knights/Paladins (Pages past level 70) have restricted training choices since they rely on elemental advantages (like magicians) to train efficiently.
Lowest MP of all classes (until 3rd class).
Axe and Mace users have relatively unstable damage throughout the whole game. Spear and pole arm users also face this problem, though this is fixed in the 3rd job. Either way, this unstable damage is akin to the damage of pre-4th job (cross)bow and claw users. Pole-arm users and spearman get more mastery however in 4th job. Although Axe and Mace are unstable, they do relatively more damage than the stable sword
Low accuracy + avoid-ability.



"
"
The following describes pirates.",How to Decide Which Class to Choose on Maple Story6,"


Pros:

Have both Brawler which in later levels pays off with pretty cool skills such as Transformation. Also the Gunslingers are fast, can jump shot, and have fire or ice bullets/ammunition when lvl. 70
The job doesn't get as boring like most jobs because at the 1st and 2nd job there are pretty cool skills. This also applies to 3rd and 4th job.
As of 2008, there aren't that many of them yet so you have a better chance to be well known.
Gunslingers eventually get a skill that rivals hurricane (rapid fire)
Gunslingers can get onto the haystack at the Henesy's Market Entrance.
Infighters have one of the best survivability rates in the game because of invincibility frames.


Cons:

Pirate can be viewed as a different version of thief. They both have somewhat a same job style consisting of either short range attacker (aka. Brawler/Bandit), or throwing objects such as stars or shooting bullets (aka. Gunslinger/Assassin).
Also, after a while they can get boring and even annoying. Since the release many Pirates have invaded the HPQ (Henesys Party Quest) spots and now it takes even longer to get into a party. Of course, as of 2010, HPQ is pretty empty.
Ask friends for advice. If any of your friends are already playing, ask them for some advice on the class benefits. It might help you to decide.

",How to Get on the Front Page in Roblox," The more friends you invite, the faster you will reach the front page.;
, They must be good looking and must have a bid of a pretty high price, since people who bid more money are more likely to get their ad shown.

, This will make more people come as they are curious to know about the creator of the game and might never see him/her again.

,, Players will get bored of the same game over and over again without any changes made.

, This will make the players have objectives to get. Also, add some badges, same thing.

, Don't put them at a too high price though, as not many people would buy it.

, This will not only benefit you but benefit them too!

Between 8am to 12am, at XX:15 and XX:45, you will get a letter from Spiegelmann.,
You will be in a waiting room for 1 minute.,
You will then be placed in a party with 5 people who's levels are similar to yours.,
To heal yourself, monsters will drop potions and can be used to heal you and your team.

,
Summon monsters using the CP earned.,
After 10 minutes, the EXP given will vary on how many CP you earned and if your party won or lost.

",How to Do CPQ in Maplestory1," Click the letter and accept it.;
, If you change your mind, click on Spiegalmann and say yes. Otherwise wait. If there aren't enough people to do the party quest, you will be sent back to town with a 20 ATT/MATT buff for 30 minutes or some Shiny Maple Coins.

, For the next 10 minutes, you will be killing monsters for CP. Unlike the EMS method, the match isn't about the most CP, but is about how many monsters you kill.

,, They are based depending on your party's levels, so you don't have to worry about which monster to summon.

,"
"
Go to the Dimensional Mirror found in any city.,
Once you get there, find a man named Spiegelmann.,
Find an empty room.,
To win, get more points by killing monsters.,
Each monster drops MP and HP Potions so don't worry about it.,
You can also make difficulties for people.,
You won!",How to Do CPQ in Maplestory2," There should be a symbol for the Monster Carnival. Click on it, and then click Move.

, He will take you to the Monster Carnival. Go in and party with about 4 to 8 people. Then you will split into 2 groups. One group will be Maple Red. The other will be Maple Blue.

, Go in and wait for the opposing party to enter. Trojans and Robos are the most common monsters in CPQ. Get things that will increase accuracy because when you are only level 30 to 35 you will often miss.

, The opposing party might ask you to summon them something. The most popular is Rombot. IF YOU ARE LEVEL 30 TO 35 DO NOT ASK THEM TO SUMMON ROMBOT!!! Only high level or people with ultra high accuracy will be able to hit it.

, Save your money for armor and weapons. You're going to need it.

, You can do poison, which lowers the opponents HP little by little. Or make them lose their skills. These can be advantages for you and your teammates. Another method is to use some of your points to summon a Master Chrono as it is very powerful and will probably give you an advantage.

, If you win, your average exp from all of that is probably from 30,000 to 40,000. Keep doing this and you will get to level 50 faster. Happy Mapling!

When you first start MapleStory, you are given the option to choose the job you want.,
Find a good place to train.,
Familiarize yourself with your character.,
Customize your controls.,
Join or start a guild.,
Try doing some quests, as they sometimes give you good, rare items.,
Understand the Hidden Potential system.,
Try using Nebulites (GMS).",How to Be Good at Maple Story1," The jobs currently available are Explorers, Cygnus Knights and the Resistance. Dual Blades, Cannoneers, all 5 Heroes (Aran, Evan, Mercedes, Phantom and Luminous), the Nova (Kaiser and Angelic Buster), the Sengoku Classes Kanna and Hayato (JMS and KMS only), and Demon Slayers are also available, but are limited time classes. Korean players have access to two classes; Xenon, a Thief/Pirate hybrid and Demon Avenger, a spin-off of the Demon Slayer. Global players have an exclusive class called Jett (bounty hunter). Depending on the job, you'll begin your journey in different places. For example, Resistance members start in Edelstein while Explorers are at Maple Island.;
, A good place has a lot of monsters that are at least 3 - 5 levels below you. If your level is below 10, there will not be any monsters with low enough levels, so just train on snails and mushrooms on Maple Island. Due to the recent patches on the game, new, tougher monsters have shown up on Maple Island. If you want to be a Warrior, you may want to train on them.

, It will take some trial and error to discover your character's attack range, jumping height, etc. Once you become familiar with the basics, try to learn more advanced tricks, such as how to dodge a monster that is chasing you by turning around and jumping at the same time.

, You use the mouse and keyboard to navigate MapleStory. While the default keys may be acceptable, you might be able to improve your game by changing them. A good keyboard layout optimizes all of your skills.


Movement skills (ex. Flash Jump) should be put at the X key. This is because it's close to ALT, which is the space bar. You don't need the Sit button for MapleStory.
Put your main attack skill on the space bar. Also, put other skills you use on the lower part of your keyboard.

, To start a guild you will need 100k mesos, and you'll have to talk to the guild NPC (Non Playable Characters) (found in towns). If you create a guild, you become the guild master or leader. Then you may invite others, etc. You can also pick a logo of sorts, and distribute different titles to members. Membership in a guild helps you make friends, who you can then easily find and contact. Friends can help you with questions you may have or can go on quests with you. Plus, hey, it's good to have friends.

, Even though quests often give you little experience, they are a good break from training all day long.

, Sometimes when a monster drops equipment, the equipment may have a red border. You can go to a store and buy magnifying glasses. Use the glass on the equipment to get the potential. If you don't like the potential, you can use Miracle Cube and change the stats. If you're lucky, your item's potential may upgrade to the next tier. You may get free Miracle cubes from Hot Time or buy them in bulk in the Cash Shop.

, When you train in high leveled places, monsters may drop a box with a gear on it. Go to the USE section and click on the box to reveal the Nebulite. You can go to a town and pay an NPC to drill a hole in your equipment, so you can attach the Nebulite to your equipment.

"
Get your First Job Advancement.,
Do some quests.,
Get your job specific hat.,
Join a Party Quest when you get to level 20.",How to Be Good at Maple Story2," Each class has a different method of getting their advancements.


If you're an Explorer, take the taxi in Lith Harbor to your respective city (ex. Thieves go to Kerning City). Then talk to your respective job advancement leader. If you're a Cannoneer, after you get off the island, go and talk to Kyrin for your 1st job. Dual Bladers also go to the Kerning City and talk to the Dark Lord, but they talk to Syl when they're level 20.
For Cygnus Knights, accept a quest and go to a Chief Knight so you can pick your class (ex. Blaze Wizards go to Oz for their 1st Job).
Arans just need to click on the giant Pole Arm in Rien.
After doing the quests, Evans will start their 1st Growth.
Resistance members will receive a letter that will move them to the Resistance Headquarters. Then they talk to Belle (Wild Hunter), Brighton (Battle Mage), or Cheeky (Mechanic). Despite being a Resistance character, Demon Slayers does not follow this method.
Mercedes, Demon Slayers, Jett, Luminous, and the Nova Classes automatically get their 1st jobs after the cutscenes.

, Quests give a generous amount of EXP in the first levels, but they aren't worth it after you're level 25. Some quest rewards sell for millions of mesos in the Free Market (ex. Subani's Legacy gives 60% Gloves for Attack scroll, which can sell for eight million depending on your server)

, At level 18, you should get a message from your job instructor asking you to kill a certain monster. After finishing the quest, you will get a hat that gives 12 of your main stat.

, In any city, go to the Dimensional Mirror, choose a party quest, and ask to join a party. If it is your first time, tell them so they can brief you and give you tips. Party questing is a great way to gain experience fast and is also very fun. Sometimes you may get goodies such as Squishy Shoes, Broken Glasses and other neat stuff! However, you can't do the Henesys (Moon Bunny’s Rice Cake), Kerning City (First Time Together), or the Ludibrium (Dimensional Crack) party quests after level 69!

"
"
Make your second job advancement at level 30.,
Get a profession.,
Train at Theme Dungeons.,
At level 50, this may be a great time to use those ticket pieces sticking in your inventory and trade them in for Monster Park Tickets.",How to Be Good at Maple Story3," Each class is different in the advancement, so do some research to find out how to go about it.

, You can choose 2 professions and the professions are Mining, Herbalism, Alchemy, Accessory Crafting, and Smithing.


Mining and Herbalism are gathering skills. Mining is required for Accessory Crafting and Smithing, while Herbalism is required for Alchemy.
Smithing allows you to make weapons, armor, projectiles, and androids. This is a good skill if you're low on funds for weapons and armor.
Accessory crafting gives you the ability to make earrings, belts, pendants, and rings. If you're lucky enough, you may get a finished product with Hidden Potential.
Alchemy lets you make potions, fuse items, and extract items for item crystals. If you're mainly away from the keyboard, set up an extractor and let people pay you to use it. If you set up a 1 meso extractor, you may get free fame.

, The Mushroom Kingdom Theme Dungeon is a great place to train. You also get a glove with 1 weapon attack and 2 magic attack after doing the storyline! Kerning Square is another place to train, you also get a nice medal. At level 55, head over to Chryse. You can get level 70 weapons after defeating the boss.

, The monsters have more HP, but you get more EXP and Hidden Potential items.

"
"
Make your third job advancement after you reach level 60.,
Training at Jesters is a popular place to train because of the quick spawn and good experience (around 1350 experience per jester).,
At level 100-110, train at MP3 (Mysterious Path 3).,
If you have no access to any of those spots, train at the pirates in Herb Town.,
The Herb Town and Magatia Party quests are also a great place to train.",How to Be Good at Maple Story4," You will need to do a quest which requires you to ask questions about Maplestory and get a necklace (name varies by class) to advance to the class depending on the second job you chose.

, However, don't be surprised by the amount of kill-stealers. It is a very crowded area so don't expect a whole map to yourself.

, Just like Jesters, don't expect a whole map to yourself. This is when people start being rude and competitive.

, It isn't competitive because there's a mini dungeon in the map.

, However, there are some people who will kick their party members so they can train on their own there. Finishing the Magatia Party Quest will either give you Romeo or Juliet's pendant. They both have Hidden Potential and can be combined to make a stronger pendant.

"
"
Make your fourth job advancement when you are level 100.,
At this time, you can train at the Evolution World.,
Once you get to 120, you can train at LHC (Lion Heart Castle) in the El Nath area.,
When you are level 160, you get the ability to go to the Henesys Ruins and Cygnus's Stronghold, which is 25-30 years in the future, and the monsters there are mutated versions of weak monsters and evil versions of Cygnus Knights.",How to Be Good at Maple Story5," This varies by class.

, You can use cores to modify the monsters' stats for more experience. However, you can only enter five times a day.

, It is an extremely good training place to get to lvl 200. You can start there at 110, but not a lot of parties will choose you, unless you can do high damage or you're a priest who can cast Holy Symbol. The thing about LHC is that everyone trains in parties so they can get up to 250% more EXP. Add the 50% extra EXP for 375% more EXP. If you try to solo, it will take you forever because the monsters have at least a couple millions of HP, and you only get around 50 thousand EXP per monster.

, Just like LHC, you can train at the Stronghold with party members for more experience. You can join an expedition to go defeat Cygnus when you are level 170. When she dies, she drops level 140 equipment. However, you're better off killing the Chief Knights, because Cygnus is glitched and is impossible to kill.

Go for the medals.,
Complete the Crusader Codex.,
Go for the stars!,
Remember that it's a MMORPG.,
Reach a high level with all classes.",How to Be Good at Maple Story6," The medals are easier and, mainly, go for Veteran Hunter. If you already have Veteran Hunter medal, go for Outstanding Citizen or Wonderful Pet Owner.

, It is easier to do this when you are a high level.

, Finish all PQ's. (Recommendable that you start doing this at level 20.)

, It can't be completed. Many patches will appear with loads of new content.

, There are 18 free character slots, the exact amount of classes that actually exist in Maple World.

"
Decide what type of Archer you want to be.",How to Be a Good Archer in Maple Story1," The following options are:

Explorer Archers. They are one of the first 4 classes to be released. They are normal archers who can choose from bows or crossbows. Bowmasters can summon Silver Hawk (2nd Job) Phoenix (3rd Job) and they can enhance their Phoenix at 4th Job, while Marksmen can summon Golden Eagle (2nd Job), Frostprey (3rd Job), and can enhance their Frostprey at 4th job. All second job archers can learn a skill that gives 30 STR and DEX when mastered (Physical Training), and can double jump.

Hunter>Ranger>Bowmaster (uses bows)

Cygnus Knights. Cygnus Knights are the easiest class in MapleStory. The Bowmen there are Wind Archers, who use the power of the wind. At their 3rd job advancement, they can learn a transformation. However, their level cap is level 120, which means they can't do a Cygnus Expedition.
Wild Hunters. They are Crossbowmen who rides a jaguar with the same speed of Haste. Wild Hunters can summon monsters and set mines along with their crossbow attacks and Jaguar attacks.
Ultimate Adventurers. They cannot be created at the character creation screen. You will need to have a level 120 Cygnus Knight to make one. Ultimate Adventurers start at 50 and are similar to the Bowmen, but they get free clothes, the Wind Piercing skill, and a medal.
Mercedes. Mercedes are elven archers who use Dual Crossbows. They know a different skills that lets them recover 5% HP and MP every 4 seconds, a skill that lets them go up ropes and ladders quickly, and a skill that lets them return to Elluel (Mercedes town) and gives a bonus 10% EXP

You can find them from the Free Market or by doing a Zakum Run. If you are playing in a new server, Cassandra will give you an event which you have to reach level 70 in a month. If you do, she will give you a bandanna with Zakum Helmet stats. If you can't afford any of those, wear your regular job hats.
Clothes. All archers can wear most armors. However, Low STR and STRless cannot wear anything from the Von Leon, Ipos Bloody, or the Falcon Wing series. Any of the clothes mentioned here have set effects, wear all of the clothes in there for a set bonus. If you can, try collecting the Wind Walker set for a bonus.
For gloves, try to get your hands on work gloves with attack. You can scroll them, buy them from the free market, or buy them from the MTS. If you don't have any work gloves, use the Mushking Leather gloves that you can get from the Mushroom Kingdom themed dungeon. Gloves for Attack scrolls can be obtained from Jane's final quest. If you can, check your Crusader Codex for which monsters drop those.
Squishy Shoes are good shoes for your archer, as they give stats. Alcaster also gives a quest where you have to defeat the Ice Knight 10 times. When you finish the quest, you get Ice Knight Chain Crampons, that increase your PvP damage by 2%. If you don't have access to those, wear your regular job shoes.
If you are STRless, the only weapons you can choose are the Maple Bows or the Visitor bows.

Ultimate Adventurers will receive a level 60 bow/crossbow, which can be used even if you're STRless.
You can mix and match accessories, but if you wear an accessory set, you get bonuses. An example of an accessory set is Larson's Challenger set.Try to buy an Archer symbol when you're level 90, or make one if you have accessory crafting.

Step in the tower.,
Hide in the dirt patch.,
Find the two strange buildings.,
Change your angle to make your body semi-transparent (pretend you are a camera in front of your Roblox body) and then walk forward.",How to Escape from Prison in Roblox Prison Life," When you are in the yard, either for some fresh air or just to keep yourself fit, you can also escape from here. There is a tower in the corner of the yard so put your body in the corner of the tower and look down.;
, It takes a few tries to do this.

, This tower is also the watch tower for guards and it connects with the wall, allowing you the roam free.

, So, you have escaped but you are in danger of getting spotted by guards. Once you get down the wall, you should see a patch of dirt. Some might wonder what is that, and when they walk forward, they fall a little bit lower into the ground. This glitch is a great way to hide from guards.

, You might have noticed there are two white and gray buildings once you escaped. There is no door, but do not fear, you can use the method you did before to escape here, too. Put most of your body in the corner of the building and do your best to shove yourself in as much as possible.

, Presto! You should be able to get in the building. This building is a great hideaway and secret base.

Smithing lets you create weapons and armor for yourself and other people. Some of the most profitable items are androids (Female ones are more profitable, since a lot of players wants girls following them), throwing stars, and most of the level 120+ items.

Accessory Crafting lets you sell accessories. This is the most profitable professions, as you can make from one million (for an earring with 3% of any stat) to around two billion (for an earring or pendant with Legendary Potential that has 36% luck or all stats combined) Most players love to make Half Earrings for potential and sell them in the Free Market for up to seven hundred fifty million mesos, and drop or fuse the ones without potential.

Alchemy allows you to create potions. Try to sell pills, as you can carry more pills than potions. You can also set up fusers in Crafting Town. New alchemists would fuse sneakers from the Henesys Market to gain EXP and sell the ones with potential for a few million mesos.

, You can find new players selling their items for cheap prices. If there is a player who offers you an item for an expensive price, haggle with them. Say ""Hi"" when the trade window opens and say thanks when you finish trading. This will help you build your reputation as a merchant while getting the items you want. This also works with Gachapon winners too, however, you may annoy them.

Find a spot in the FM.,
Sell spots.,
Choose a good name for your store.,
Advertise.",How to Be a Successful Merchant in Maplestory3," Channels two and three are the best spots to set a store. Channel one is better, but you may be disconnected by hackers. Pay attention to patches and get a spot first thing after it's finished.

, If you find a good spot in Channel one, sell it for five to twenty million. If you find a less busier spot, you can still make a profit, but sell it for cheaper prices.

, Choose one that actually describes the items that you're selling, such as ""Empress Equipment"" or ""Cheap Mastery Books"". Not a lot of people wants to buy from a store called ""I like Pie"" or ""In Soviet Russia, Car drives You!"".

, You can smega (super megaphone) a message about your store. You can buy those in the Cash Shop, the cheapest one being 400 NX for a Skull Megaphone (red border, no icon in top right corner. Some smegas sell for over 2,500 NX (Super Megaphone, your avatar in top right corner, plus an advert on Maple TV (the tv in most cities that talks about things such as the Big Bang patch, Friend Finders, and losing EXP) Remember to put the channel and FM in your ad, or your customers can't find your shop. If you want your ad to be super effective, say something interesting or attention attracting, but don't lie and claim the items in your shop are one meso or you risk annoying customers. You may sell out fast, or go as far to making a marketplace.

An Assassin is a class of Thief that uses throwing stars with a claw.,
There are two class groups that have assassins available - Explorers and Cygnus Knights.,
When you begin, simply follow the instructions and complete each quest given.,
At this point, you have a choice of your AP (ability point) build.,
This is a recommended Skill Build for 1st Job.,
At the end, you should have:


Nimble Body: 20 (Max)
Lucky Seven: 20 (Max)
Keen Eyes: 5 (Max)
Dark Sight: 10 (Max)
Disorder: 3
Double Stab: 3
Total SP Spent: 61

,
Go back to the Dark Lord/Eckhart.,
Second Job Skill Build: First off you want to max Critical Throw, as high criticals will give a huge boost to damage.",How to Become a Master Assassin on Maple Story," They can deal quite high amounts of damage very early on, and are one of the best classes both early and late in levels.;
, Cygnus Knights are much faster to level (they gain 10% of their EXP bar each level up for free and get +6 ability points per level instead of +5), but they are limited to level 120. Normal Explorers, however, have a limit of level 200, and are a bit more flexible.

, For Explorers, this should get you near enough to level 10 (remember to talk to Olaf at Lith Harbour), at which point you can catch the cab to Kerning City and talk to the Dark Lord to become a thief (found inside the thieves' hideout, in the middle of the city). For Cygnus, stop as soon as you reach level 10 and make the job advancement with Eckhart.

, There are three types: Dexless, Low-dex and Regular dex. The more DEX you put in, the less money you will have to spend on equips, but the less powerful you will be. If you are starting fresh with no money, just go for regular dex. The rest of your AP goes into LUK.


Regular Dex just auto-assigns DEX until you reach your cap (most players choose to cap around 80-110)
Low-Dex thieves cap their dex much lower, around 40-60 usually. This is more of a balance between power and practicality.
Dexless thieves add no dex whatsoever to the starting 25 DEX. This means you need more money as you will have to buy special equips that don't require DEX. The trade-off is that you have much higher damage, as your damage is mostly influenced by LUK.

, Put one point into Lucky Seven to start training (you should ALWAYS use it for everything, never normal attack). Next you max Keen Eyes so that you can act like a proper ranged class, before pumping L7. Nimble Body is very helpful, and Dark Sight is huge later on but not that useful yet, so it comes last. The extra 3 points arbitrarily go into Double Stab, as they must all be spent before advancing. Night Walkers should replace Double Stab with Night.


Level 10: +1 Lucky Seven (1)
Level 11: +3 Nimble Body (3)
Level 12: +3 Keen Eyes (3)
Level 13: +2 Keen Eyes (MAX), +1 Lucky Seven (2)

Level 23: +3 Nimble Body (15)

Level 25: +2 Nimble Body (MAX), +1 Disorder (1)
Level 26: +2 Disorder (3), +1 Dark Sight (1)
Level 27: +3 Dark Sight (4)
Level 28: +3 Dark Sight (7)
Level 29: +3 Dark Sight (MAX)
Level 30: +3 Double Stab (3)

,, They will give you a task so you can get your second job advancement. You are now an Assassin!

, Next you max Haste for its insane mobility - you will fly through maps. Put 5 points into Booster so it lasts for nearly a minute and it's not such a pain to activate. Then Mastery to stabilise your damage (mastery boosts your minimum damage, which increases your average damage and makes it swing less wildly), followed by Drain - you'll never need HP pots again! - and Booster winds up at 11. While Booster is good, it's only a minor pain to reactivate and none of the other skills can be sacrificed (including Shadow Resistance - 10% HP Boost plus Elemental resistance is really good)


Level 30: +1 Claw Mastery (1)
Level 31: +2 Claw Mastery (3), +1 Critical Throw (1)
Level 32: +3 Critical Throw (4)
Level 33: +3 Critical Throw (7)
Level 34: +3 Critical Throw (10)

Buy and sell collectibles.,
Trade your collectibles with other members if you have Builder's Club.,
Sell shirts/pants.,
Sell Your Creations!",How to Earn Robux in Roblox2," Buying collectible items usually requires that you already have a whole bunch of robux available. Selling requires Builder's Club and that someone else is willing to buy at the price you set.

, You can add robux to trades, and if someone is willing you can trade a high-value collectible away for the value of the collectible in robux.

, If you have Builders' Club, you can create cool shirts or pants and then sell them for Robux!

, If you're a skilled builder or scripter, you can easily earn money by selling your creations, or yourself for hire. When I mean yourself, I mean that you are hired by someone to build/script something for them for a set time. The best place to start off with selling your creations is at the Group Recruiting Plaza ( http://www.roblox.com/games/6194809/Group-Recruiting-Plaza-NEW-DISCORD-SERVER ). Although it is supposed to be a Group Recruitment Center, many people go there to sell their creations! You can build a Cafe or a Script for someone and they might even pay you 2k ROBUX. I would mainly recommend starting off with the low numbers so that people get even more dragged in.

Bring it one step further and consider selling your exploit.",How to Develop a Roblox Exploit," Visual Studio is Microsoft's suite of development tools used to create software (programs) for the Windows operating system. Fortunately, Microsoft provides a completely free version of Visual Studio named ""Community"" for those who collaborates in open-source projects or makes software as a hobby.
, The process of reverse engineering is dissecting a program's internals in order to study its behavior or its code. In Roblox exploiting, this is necessary as you need to know how Roblox works in the inside in order to make hacks for its client. There are many reverse engineering tools out here, but the most prominent ones are IDA Pro and Binary Ninja., A debugger is used to locate and fix bugs in software, and in some cases, it's also used to modify a program's behavior. While not completely necessary, using a debugger may help you in diagnosing issues in either Roblox's code or your very own exploits. If you purchased (or plan to purchase) IDA Pro, then you don't have to obtain a debugger as it already comes with one (the IDA debugger). Else, you can obtain a free debugger from the Internet, such as OllyDbg.

Alternatively, if you have Cheat Engine (a popular cheating tool for video games), then you could also use its debugging features, albeit they're known for their instability.

, High level languages such as Lua, Python or Go lacks the features and compatibility needed to develop Roblox exploits, whereas low level languages such as C/C++ and Ada can manipulate structures that are necessary to make a working hack. Additionally, considering that the Roblox client is programmed in C++, it would make sense for you to make your hacks in that language too (but it's not necessary)., A lot of free ebooks/PDFs about reverse engineering can be found through a simple Google search. Some of them may require deep understanding of how a computer works, but if you narrow down your search to the subjects you  specifically need to know (such as reversing C/C++ software), then you can find some relatively easy guides that'll help you understand the process of reverse engineering., Roblox's largest exploiting community out here, V3rmillion, contains plenty of guides related to developing and using Roblox exploits. While the majority of users on V3rmillion doesn't like people who are new to the exploiting scene, some can be highly welcoming and will help you in developing an exploit., Fortunately for newcomers, seeking help from benevolent (and competent!) exploit developers is a breeze. A collective of expert Roblox reverse engineers called ""Rain"" can be contacted on V3rmillion, and some of their highest ranking members will definitely be happy to give you a hand in developing your very own exploit. Take note that some other exploit developers, which are Jordanic or anarchojordanic (a term coined by V3rmillion users to describe users who aren't willing to help on the basis that making your own things by yourself is better than collaborating with other users), exhales elitism and rarely wants to help other people, so you need to make sure that you're contacting the right people., Certain exploit developers have released the source code to their exploits to the public so people can understand how they worked. This might be very beneficial to the process of learning how to develop Roblox exploits. Plus, code that was developed over two years ago still works nowadays and is constantly recycled by exploit developers (as the code is known for its stability and its ease of use), and is currently in the public domain, so don't be afraid to use code coming from already existing exploits in your own projects, as long you understand how the code works and what it does., While some users want to keep their hack(s) to themselves, some want to release them to the public for the greater good of the Roblox exploiting community. You can easily locate a website to publish your exploit. In fact, any video-game-cheating websites is a good website to post your exploit on., Some exploits that grew big formed a big, organized community usually revolving around a group chat. Communication software such as Discord or Skype is perfect for your exploit's users as they are free and usually bug-free. Please note that you don't have to create a centralized community for your exploit: most free exploits out here doesn't grow big (this is almost always the case), so their creators usually doesn't spend their precious time creating a Discord server or a Skype group chat for their exploits., Selling or releasing your exploit for free is entirely up to you, but if you happen to be low on funds, then selling your exploit might help you get some money. The exploit business is very profitable (in fact, more than ever: the number of exploits sold in 2017 doubled over the course of simply 3 months) and the prices usually range from 30 to 60 US dollars. For example, the ""ProtoSmasher"" exploit generated (approximately) over one thousand dollars merely two days after the exploit's release.

Take note that selling an overpriced exploit will always decrease sales, so make sure your exploit's price is adjusted depending on your hack's capabilities.

Take your time to perfect your design.,
Add scripts to enhance gameplay.",How to Build a Good Airport in ROBLOX," Every building starts with a part. Anchor it, and change the surfaces with ""No Outlines"" to make it look very good and graphic-like.;
, Make sure you know how big each place is, like how big the check-in room or terminal floor is. Try using a Robloxian 2.0, 1.0 to check the size you really want it to be.

, Begin very simple, as you can edit it later. Do not forget to use:


Anchors
Transparency (For Windows)
Con-Collide (For Doors or Furniture Details) Gates (Use Moving Jetways to make it realistic and controllable)
Studs move | Rotate | Scale |

, Start adding your exterior details, like pillars, sign boards, overheard roof, etc. Try also looking at some real airports and ROBLOX types of airports and try to get an idea. Building first before thinking could make you start over. Also, make it the way you want it to be, and when your done, make sure you like it, if not, try changing it again until your happy with it.

, Ask them for tips and things you need to know or should add.

, Try make windows 5-10 studs long and 5-15 studs wide. Making a huge window could make it look very weird and unrealistic.

, The last thing to make a realistic airport is to add some things like ground crew cars, control towers, lighting, blinking lights, taxiways, taxi lines, tower structure lights, runways, and more. Try to give it an airport feeling by adding some things that you might see in an airport.

, Do not get over excited about playing on it because that will make you rush and also will make you make a very ugly airport. Don't rush it; instead, take your time. Taking your time will make it a very decent airport.

, These can make the airport actually function like one.

Consider a surface GUI but scripted, so it can scroll through different departures at places.

Script the airplanes so they'll go somewhere at a certain time. It's not exactly as fun to build the airport, but not be able to ride an airplane.

Fill out the form.,
Always, always, always, use perfect grammar!,
Make your posts captivating.,
Join a club, and use this information.",How to Roleplay on Stardoll," Roleplaying is where you step into the shoes of a character that you made up and post in various topics acting out their actions, the things they say, and, for some extra dimension, thoughts, if you'd like. In the club discussions list, there will be different topics.


The most important one is normally labelled as ""Enrollments"" or something similar, where you fill out and post a basic form with your characters name, age, gender, and whatever else is included in said form. When you look at the clubs discussion list, you will see that there are topics that state a place.
When you are posting there, you will post as if you are in that place. When starting a post, always start with a heading, your name and Clique. Then, begin your post below. You can represent actions by putting symbols like -, *, or -- around them, and quotation marks around their words. Or, if you would like to seem more advanced, you could attempt writing a first or third person paragraph.;
, Without it, you'll look like your character isn't intelligent or that you don't care enough to make a post look good, neat, and interesting. This means no run-on sentences, proper commas, and absolutely no text talk! You'd be surprised at what a huge difference this can make.

, The first step to achieving this is stepping out of the basic format of having symbols around actions and into paragraphs, because you have more room for detail and creativity in that form. Adjectives are essential, because they make sure that another Roleplayer can read the post and construct a good visual in their minds eye. Keep a keen eye on detail. If your character has an accent, every now in then, just throw in a ""... in her lilting Irish accent,"" to remind another Roleplayer that they should add this in to the mental scene they may be forming.


Also, adding in little things that people do all the time, but they're not thought much of, like, fidgeting, or playing with the hem of a shirt, crossing their legs, playing with their hair, or biting their lip. These will keep your character feeling and sounding real, and not like a mechanical list of actions and words.
Make sure that you throw in facial expressions your character may be making when they see someone or say something.

, Make friends, and have fun!

, These are red flags of a scammer! They may keep it hidden so no one can complain about all of their stardollars being taken. It's also a good idea to watch other users commenting on the broadcast to get attention., It will take all of your coins or drain all of the stardollars out of your account.

Making an account is the obvious first step if you're looking to make it big in Stardoll., Stardoll encourages users to network with friends in the game by offering a Starcoin bonus for each new in-game friendship made. Seeing as other people will likely be hounding for game cash as well, it's a mutually beneficial move and you won't often find users that will shirk away from the free money.Leave a message in their guestbook while you're at it! This will help attract more Starcoins into your piggy bank.

, If you're serious about making some cash in Stardoll, its important to have patience, consistency and dedication. Logging in every day will earn you 40 Starcoins. If you're subscribed as a Superstar, you can receive the equivalent of 100 Stardollars for a month of consistently logging in!


Changing your doll's clothes and editing the suite every day will earn you extra points on a daily basis. Don't forget about the Mystery Gift each day. It may not be much, but it's easy to get.

, Being a superstar is arguably the most effective way to make money in Stardoll; subscribing to superstardom shows you're serious about the game. Although it requires a start-up fee to get going, you'll find the money (particularly the Stardollars) starts rolling in faster.


You'll get 200 Stardollars by default for each month you're subscribed to Stardoll.

, You can get a display set up in the bazaar for other people to peruse and choose from your creative wardrobe. If you muster a great reputation for your good fashion sense, you'll find customers flocking to you in droves.


Try not to get too steep with your prices. In most market situations, it is better to sell larger amounts for more cheaply rather than relying on a few expensive sales.

, Stardoll regularly hosts contests you can join in, offering prizes with in-game monetary value. Contests will usually put your fashion skills up against other players; if you end up winning, you'll be all the richer. Contests and other far-flung schemes shouldn't be relied upon as a primary source of income. Rather, they should be a fun way to see if your creative talents are up to snuff.

, Even if you're not subscribed as a superstar, you can still get Stardollars via participating in associated surveys and offers. Stardoll's partners may be anything from a shopper's census to a sale offer. Keep in mind, however, that these tend to be very dull and detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. If you're looking to make a quick in-game buck they'll do in a pinch, but it's not recommended that you rely on them for your income.

Join other role play clubs.",How to Start a Roleplay Club on Stardoll,",


First you must enter your club name. Make sure your satisfied with your name, as it can not be changed. If your role play club is a school, you may want a name such as Redwood Prep, Clarherst Academy, or Shady Hills High. If it's a town, perhaps something like Riverville or Clifftown.
Next, you  must enter a brief description for your club. It could be something simple such as ""Hollywood High: Where only the best succeed..."" Or slightly more descriptive. Remember: you have limited space. (Note: Your club description can be changed as often as you like.)
Finally, you must choose the club category, language, and membership type (private or open). Role play clubs typically fall under Tears and Joy or Miscellaneous. The club language should be the language that you speak (It's assumed that's English if you're reading this). As for membership type, this is completely up to you.

Click the ""Create Club"" button. Congratulations, you now have your own Stardoll club!



,


To do this, open a Microsoft Word document on your computer and play around until the font, colors, and text are the way you want. Your text should include the name of the club, a little bit about the club (""Welcome to Ford Academy...""), a list of cliques (if your club has cliques), and anything else you feel like adding that will draw people to your club.

,


Your club's poll can be found at the bottom of the club home page. A good poll question to start out with is ""Which event should we hold first?"". Then you can list options such as A Dance, A School Play, Cheerleading Tryouts, etc.

,


This is where members of your club can enroll their characters in your role play and describe their characters. In the description for this topic, put the following:
Name: Age: Hometown: Personality: Appearance: Bio:
These are the basics, but you can add other things such as Likes/Dislikes, Hobbies, Dreams, etc.

,


It's important that you have other discussions ready for role playing, even before your club has any members. Otherwise, people who join your club will get bored and leave the club.
A good discussion to start out with is a welcoming dance. This gives role play characters a chance to get acquainted.
Your discussions should vary in topic. Some ideas are a park, dorms (if your role play setting is a school), library, movie theater, Starbucks, etc.

,


Now that your club is ready to go, you need members! Broadcast your club, post in people's guestbooks, ask your friends to join...just get your club name out there!
Be patient. Usually the number of members a club already has influences how quickly people join the club, so the number of people joining might start out slow, but will rise.

,


Remind members to stay active and post often.
Create special events such as blizzards or parties to keep things interesting.
Keep recruiting members. The more the merrier!

,


This way you can see what's trending in role playing, get ideas for role play plots, and meet other role players who may want to join your club!

Adjust the face.,
Apply mascara.,
Add eyeliner.,
Use eye pencil.,
Apply eyeshadow.,
Fix the eyebrows.,
Apply blush.,
Put on lip gloss.",How to Look Like an Anime Character on Stardoll1," Before you can apply makeup to give your Stardoll an anime look, you should change the facial appearance so that she can appear as cute as possible. Give her large eyes, light eyebrows, a small nose, pale skin, and an innocent-looking mouth.;
, Once you have adjusted her face, focus on her eyelashes. Apply white mascara in the corners of her eyes to help them shine. Place black mascara on her eyelashes. Don't worry about applying a certain amount, as more eyelashes gives your doll bigger eyes.

, Take a white eyeliner, and apply a generous amount in the corners of her eyes. This will enhance the glow in her eyes and help brighten them. Then, switch to a jet black eyeliner before applying it to her eyes without leaving a wing on the ends.

, Once again, focus on the corners of her eyes with a white kohl pencil. Layer it on top of the white liner and mascara. Then, apply black kohl eye pencil to the other areas of the eyes without worrying about it appearing perfect.

, Using a black eyeshadow pencil, apply it straight across the eyelid from the slight crease to the very end. Repeat for the other eye. Avoid making it too thick, or else your Stardoll will appear fake and overdone.

, Ombre eyebrows help them appear slightly thinner. To do this, stroke the ends with a light brown eyebrow pencil. Then, move onto the middle, running this streak from the middle to the ends. Finally, stroke the entire brow.

, For a dewy appearance, apply two strokes on each cheek with a medium-pink blush, including skin going down the cheekbones. Take a dark brown blush before applying three strokes on each cheek, going directly down the cheekbones. This will help her face appear slightly tighter and lifted.

, To help your Stardoll's lips appear soft and moisturized, apply a small amount of lip gloss to her mouth. This will be the final touch of her makeup.

An example of a cute look would be a beige jacket, a dress in a matching shade, a heart sling bag, pink platforms, and ballet detailing.

, Purchasing expensive pieces will eat away at your Stardoll dollars and lower your chances of quickly expanding your wardrobe. Rather than buying the most expensive clothing, find cute ones at a more reasonable price. Although you can splurge once in a while, be sure to keep an eye on your spending so that you have enough dollars for other purchases, such as makeup and hair.

, You should not only find unique clothing but also make space in your wardrobe for classic pieces. They will allow you to create a variety of different sets, preventing you from having to waste Stardoll dollars on different pairs of bottoms just to match a few shirts."

If you ever happen to come across a rude person while playing a game, report them.,
Do not fall for scams!,
Don't listen to people like that they are wrong and you might get banned from Roblox and you won't be able to play on your account for a couple of days or a week.

,
Don't ask for boyfriends or girlfriends.,
Don't kill people for no reason, unless you're on a fighting game.

,
If you're building, don't say or build anything mean or bad.

,
Don't share passwords.",How to Be Safe on Roblox," If it is getting out of hand, just leave. If you have the power to kick them out or ban them from the server, do so.


Reporting a person can essentially help if they are an exploiter. Exploiters are people who ""hack"" into game files and make changes to them. They range from major incidents to minor ones.;
,


An example of a scam would be someone who offers you a valuable item for your currency. After the trade, they'll get your items, but you won't get theirs.
Another one would be trading accounts. You might lose your account, while the person could be ruining your account.

,, You will get in trouble or reported.


This would also make you an Online Dater (ODer), which ROBLOX has strict rules about, and the community dislikes them harshly as well.

,,,


Doing so could result in a warning most of the time, but if it gets out of hand, it could result in a temporary ban.

,


Spawn-killing is when someone kills another player who has just spawned from death of joining the game.

,, If people ask for your password, they're trying to steal your account.


Another way people get their password exposed is when your password is not secure enough. Make sure to put a random combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.

, Be intelligent, witty, kind, and well-informed. The more quality posts you make, and the nicer you are to other players, the more popular you will become.


Forums are a place to be clever. One wrong post can lead for you to be known in a bad way, so make sure you think before you hit post.
There are bunkers. Bunkers are places for forumers to go in when spam-bots or strict moderators come in the forums.
Spam-bots are usually alternate accounts used by the same person. They spam random things across the forums and usually, people won't post at that time.

, Talk to people. Ask them to add you as a friend, but make sure you know them well; there is a limit to how many you can have

, Help other players with their work, if they ask you; even make a cool level that people will like.

, It costs money but when you have builders club you get Robux everyday, get more money faster, can make more places, etc. (This is optional.)

, Assemble an inventory of valuable items. You can use these in trades with other players. The more you trade the more you become known, and having a valuable inventory will help you be respected as a better player.

, Learn to script on roblox. Ask for help on the forums. The better at scripting you are the better your place will be.

, People won't come to it if they don't know about it.

, On games like Apartment Life, don't delete other peoples stuff. It just makes them mad and hate you.

Use the W A S D keys.,
Try to kill from behind.,
Use heavy hats such as presents, helmets, etc.,
Talk to someone next to you and while they're responding, kill them!",How to Blox on Roblox," It will be hard at first but once you figure it out it's easy!;
, Using W A S D in that order will make you spin around with your sword to kill easier to accomplish.

, If you do this, you will be able to kill the enemy before they have a chance to attack in response.

, If you download the double hat glitch, use it!

, Note that this particular method of killing is very deceitful, and will result in a lot of name-calling!

Perform the Outrageous Sword speed trick (optional).,
Get a good melee weapon.,
Get a good explosive.,
Get one or more guardians.,
Get a long ranged weapon (optional).,
Get a good close range weapon (optional).,
Get a good Medium Range weapon (optional).,
Get Some Flying Gear.,
Get Health Items.,
Add a remote mine to your secret base.,
Get a RC Tank.,
Use the Force Field potion.,
Try using some other useful/fun weapons.",How to Be Successful in Catalog Heaven in Roblox," First, get the Outrageous Sword, then find the grey character (if you have VIP, he's in your closet), and slash and hack with the sword for 10-30 seconds. Do not go over or else you cannot control your self. You will find that you are now extremely fast.;
, Some of the best melee weapons are the Darksteel Katana, Dual Katanas, Darkheart, Outrageous Board With a Nail In It, Tormentor's Axe, and Ghostwalker.


If desperate, get orbital flute and gear cloner and clone your orbital flute. This may also be used in combo with invisibility items to cloak the projectile. First when you spawn in your spawn box get the items specified. Next use gear cloner to clone your orbital flute pick your orbital flute up; you are doing this because orbital flute takes a while to recharge so by having two you can pass the time with the other orbital flute. Next use the orbital flute steering with your mouse. If you do not want your enemies to know who their murderer is use one of the invisibility items once you have activated orbital flute. This will cloak the flute and the only thing the enemies will see if they do look up (highly unlikely) is a trail of fire. The bloxed by feature will still work but your enemies will not see you because of the invisibility item used.

, The best rocket for that is the Exponential Rocket.

, Some suggestions are the Phoenix/Icy Arctic Fowl, Korblox Flying Oblivion Horn, Orinthian Falcon, Bald Eagle, and Ghost Minion. One tactic to win (it might not be as fun, but it works) is to just get all of these and use all of them at once.

, You should get the M1 Garand with infinite ammo, 8 bullets in a clip (for some reason, you can't manually reload) and 30 damage. Performing a headshot is an instant kill. If you are more worried about killing a certain person, use the potato cannon. It won't give you a KO, but it's a very good long ranged weapon.

, A good close range weapon is the Scatter Blaster and the Trench Warfare. The Trench Warfare is a powerful shotgun. If you are close enough, it's a two hit KO. A Scatterblaster is also deadly, but you can get hit by your own bullets since you are fast

, A good medium range weapon is the Sten gun, It's like a SMG, but it's much stronger. It wouldn't hurt to use the Luger Pistol too.

, Make sure you have some flying gear, in case you fall. Pompous, Santa's Sleigh, Artemis Bow, Sinister Flying Carpet, and Golden Fleece are some good choices. Also, you can use the hover glitch (it's kind of a cheat, so you shouldn't use it)


Get the Green Epic Sauce. Search 'green' and click the green bottle.
Get the Moonwalk Potion. Search for 'moonwalk'
Get out the Green Epic Sauce
Drink it and then quickly drink the Moonwalk Potion.
You are now temporarily hovering.

, If you ever get damaged, make sure you have a quick slight healing source and a healing potion. If you have VIP, regenerating a healing potion is very easy as it's on the top bar. Your quick healing source can be Beans or Bloxy Cola. You can also use the health glitch (it's kind of a cheat, so you shouldn't use it). There are a few ways to do it, but here is one:


Get the Knights of the Splintered Skies Wing Potion. Search 'knights' and click the blue potion.
Get the Dragonshead. Search for 'drag.'
Get out your potion.
Drink it and then quickly switch to the Dragonshead.
You are now invincible to any melee weapon and most other weapons.

, Once the enemy tries to get inside your base, try to explode them at the right moment.

, This is not needed, but let's say you're lazy. Find a good hiding spot or a safe spot, then summon a RC Tank. That thing is pretty resistant, but explosives are it's weakness.

, (you have to buy it) Don't be afraid to use the Force Field potion when you really need to!

, They are as follows: Epicsauce, Merely's Sparkle Time Hoverboard, Bear Mine Gun, Snake Sniper, Seranok Golden Chalice of Fame, Conjurer's Fist, Zeus's Lightning Bolt, Freeze Ray, Astral Cloak of Transportation, Dual Plungers, Medusa Head, Arachnix Drone, Finger Laser, Fist of Schoolage, Gravity Gun, Forbidden Box, Tornado Staff, Wraith's Screech, and Orbital Piano.


Get an invisibility item. This will make assassinating people so easy. It is advised you also use some sort of item to immobilize your enemy such as the Earth Orb, as it causes your enemy to sit down each time they are shocked preventing them from running away (too quickly) or the Heartbreaker Sword which cuts their arms off stopping them from using weapons.

"
"
Look professional.,
Find someone who will hire you.

,
Agree on a way of payment.,
Be an elite assassin.,
Locate the target.,
Don't get killed by your target.,

Make secret areas in all or most of your places with weapons.",How to Become an Assassin on ROBLOX," Buy a suit if you want the hitman look. Or, wear a cloak if you want to go with the more stealthy look.;
,, Settle a price that both of you agree on. For example, if 5 tix, he or she can visit your game, if more, and you are BC, you can make a T-Shirt that he or she has to buy.

Go to More>People then search ""Assassin's Creed: Elite Assassins"" and click Search Groups.
Click the group that's called it and then hit join.
Wait 1-2 hours.
In the group description, read the links, also the ""Novizio Test"" to rank up.
Start going to Masyaf and be active in the group.
Someone will soon then be holding a training, and you'll be trained as an elite assassin.

, Go to a war game that the target is at, or get him or her to come to you.


Note: A good way to assassinate is to befriend the target.

, If you kill him or her, and he or she kills you before you leave, the assassination doesn't count.

, Ask the man or woman who hired you if he or she wants the target to know they sent you. If so, say ""NameHere says hello.""

, They will be weary of the price on their head.

, Invite the person who hired you to your place (5 tickets) or have them buy a T-Shirt.

, These are needed in case a target comes to you. You may be targeted for assassination, as angry assassinated targets may try to have you killed.

Start videos.,
Some ways that you could to this are :

Join a ROBLOX Video making/acting group eg, RRTV Studios






Act for already popular ROBLOX youtubers eg, - Bereghost, EthanGameTV, etc.







,
Watch videos for some ideas to share.

,
Try to take the lead on every single place you go to.,
Give guests one step ahead on everything.,
Sacrifice yourself on obbies so others can win.

,
Don't kill people if you don't have to.,
Pick the right clothes.,
Get a lot of badges.,
Make a really fun place which is unique and hasn't been made already by someone else.

,
Not only can making a game can make you famous, but a good forum poster is also very helpful into becoming famous.

,
Are you wickedly awesome at your fighting skills?,
Get Builders Club.,
Really good at scripting?,
Maybe you're really good at building your own models.,
Have lots of friends, it makes you look popular.

",How to Become Famous on ROBLOX," Robloxians usually find other Robloxians by watching their videos (e.g. Telamon).;
,,, Players are more inclined to follow leaders.

, They'll think, ""Wow, that guy must be really caring. We should appreciate him.""

,, They'll get really mad at you, and it'll hurt your ROBLOX reputation.

, People think regularly of people with ordinary clothing.

, To get badges that not a lot of people have, go to a place that barely anyone is on.


Having badges such as the Bloxxer Badge, the Homestead Badge, the Bricksmith Badge, the Inviter Badge, and the Ambassador Badge are such badges that not everyone has.






Having the Veteran Badge is also great, but it just means that you've been around for more than a year. After all, some noobs can be veterans on Roblox as well, right?







,,, Maybe you could be famous for that. You'd be known as a knight of Robloxia (e.g. a really good fighter).


This can also apply to those who are very good at shooting.
However, this should only be practiced on Roblox games that involve combat as a necessity (e.g. something with a title like ""Combat Wars""). Or this can give your reputation a bad rap.

, You will have more options available to you. And you'll be noticed as a VIP of Roblox.

, You could try to teach others how to script.

, Chances are that free models are more likely to make your place lag, so if someone is having a lag problem, you could help them out by showing them how to build their own things.

Open up Roblox Studio.,
Create a frame for the door out of normal parts.,
Make the hinges that hold to door together and make it open.,
With the hinge(es) selected, go to the surface tool and select hinge.,
Create the actual door.,
Anchor all the parts apart from the door and you are done!",How to Build a Door on ROBLOX,";
, Make sure it's not too big or not too small and anchor the parts. It's a good idea to have a model of a character so you can judge the size on that. Try not to make the frame too thin but also not too thick.

, Place a small brick preferable with the same thickness off the frame at the bottom of the frame, making sure that there is space between one side of the frame and the brick you just put down. Do the same thing symmetrically at the top of the frame - this bit is really important!

, This turns the two parts into a hinge! A small axel should appear on the top of the two parts.

, Make a brick that fits in the frame touching the hinges but not any of the frame walls.

, You can test your game using the play function.

Look for suspicious items before you insert the model.,
Go ahead and insert the model if you want.,
If you do get an infected model: You can try deleting the evil script.,
Do not believe the people that say ""look at my model it makes u admin 4 everything!"",
Also, do not feel safe because the admins HAVE NOT fixed the infected scripts.,
Another good idea is to insert a virus protector, which will do all of this automatically.
,Go to to your toolbox, and go to the search section.,
You will see a search bar.,The first one should be fine.,Now your game is automatically protected by viruses.",How to Avoid Infected Models on Roblox," It may say something that says ""OOH! PLEASE BUY! IT WORKS!"" but don't fall for it.

, Just go to Explorer (Tools > View > Explorer > Workspace) and look for bad scripts like ""ROFL"" or so. Or it might say random letters in another language and say ""Lol i got u"" or ""U fell for it XD"".

, but if it comes back after deletion, you might have to delete the whole model all together. But if it has a script that infects ALL the models.....Yeah, just exit out of your game WITHOUT saving.

, or something like that. It's a trick.

, So watch your back.

Get all the good items.,
Travel carefully.,
Use trampolines carefully; put any weapons away as they make you twist in the air that causes you to bounce away.,
Use Shadow Sphere when passing nearby players, especially on the arena bit.,
Get Touch Stone as it teleports you to safety.,
Use Venomshank.,
Avoid Venom attacks by other people.,

Get spare gear.,
When you're crossing the part with the spinny blades use the invincibility sphere.

,
Use the Ice Dagger on noobs trying to run away from you.",How to Be Good in Sword Fights on the Heights IV on Roblox," Start out with the Shadow Sphere, Armour, Jet Boots, and Venomshank.

Shadow Sphere is an object to be invisible for a short period of time, but still be aware of your surroundings. People with Illumina can detect you. You cannot use a sword while using Shadow Sphere.
Armour, when worn, doubles your maximum health, although it does not double your current health, and gives you a shiny torso to let others know you have armor on.
Jet Boots work when you click and hold down your while equipped, and to let go when you don't want to fly for the time being. When it is out of fuel, you drop down either into the sky or the ground, depending on where you were when the boots ran out of fuel.
Venomshanks are sword longer than a Linked Sword (default sword). They are green all over it. When a player is hit with it, they are poisoned, and their health decreases for a period of time.;
, Avoid any fierce-looking people carrying strong weapons. These include Illumina, Venomshank, and Windforce.


Illuminas have the strongest lunge damage, behind a Ghostwalker. When equipped, the player's jump is higher and able to detect nearby invisible enemies. Sparkles come out of the sword, and it is white. Be careful, as Windforce and Firebrand will kill you instantly when attacked.
Windforce pushes a target back when hit, but he/she is able to get back to safety using a touch stone. It is slightly bigger than a Linked Sword, and looks similar to Illumina. It is one of the swords that deal the most lunge damage.

,


When bouncing on a trampoline, be aware that you are venerable now. Players can jump from under and attack below you, unless you are using Windforce.

, The arena is a common place for fighting, as the most spawn points are there.


Use Shadow Sphere when chased by a player and you want to use a teleport, as without it they could chase you through the teleport.







, Use it only when it's an emergency as it takes longer to recharge every time you use it. Use the safe spot to regenerate. Also, the Touch Stone is a life-saver when falling down.

, Remember, it poisons your enemy. For most noobs, that just means certain death!

, If you get hit by Venomshank, use a medic kit or invincibility sphere which will stop the poison hitting you.

, Remember; dying loses all your items.

, Get two pairs of Jet Boots and Shadow Spheres so you can switch between them quickly.

,, That will freeze them and stop them!

Don't excessively use bad words.,
Don't be inappropriate.,
Don't tell other people you're an admin (administrator).,
Do not hack the game.,
Don't hack the game, ask for passwords, or spam.",How to Avoid Getting Banned on ROBLOX," Most Robloxians use cuss words, but remember that Roblox is for people of the ages 8-22+. There are little kids playing, too, and you don't want to ruin their childhood. There is a filter in place that stops most swear words, and no harm will come to you if you make sure your swear words are filtered in Studio first (an easy way is to make a script that prints your chat messages to the debug console).;
, Don't talk about drugs, sex, gangs, hacking, etc. If you do so, players will find out and report you to Roblox.


Remember that Roblox can read the chat log for proof. If you make games about sex, you will have a 98% chance that your game will be taken down and will be either warned or banned once the Roblox staff receives a complaint from a user about your sexual games and has been reviewed.

, If you tell everyone that you're an admin, they will probably not believe you. If you have read Roblox's safety rules, they say that if anyone claims to say they're the administrator when they aren't, players will have to report them and Roblox will check the bad behavior out. However, it may not apply to anyone with admin scripts used for a specific game.

, Similarly, do not exploit bugs on the website that give you unfair advantages on purpose and claiming you're the game's admin.

, Many players say, ""Builderman gave me a hack to give me 9999999 robux, copy and paste this on 8 hats, log in and log out and you'll get the robux"". It's not true, though; how could you get robux just for copy, pasting, logging in and out? If you do that, you'll make yourself look like a fool! Don't ask players for their password or they will report you.

Find a big ball of bushes, believe me, they are easy to find, and park in it, but MAKE SURE NOBODY CAN SEE YOU! If you do this right, you can kill tons of helicopters very easily, and have a hidden bombardment system to decimate the enemy. But the enemy will probably find you if they hit you or you are seen firing through the bush. If you are attacked by an enemy heavy tank or are found, try to retreat or find high ground to fire off of.

There are demo versions available on other sites, but this is the only place you can play the full game.Happy Wheels is well-known for its cartoon violence, including exploding body parts and spurting blood. Know what you're getting into.;
, This way you can not only play levels, but can also rate them, save replays and even create your own levels for fellow users to play and rate.

, Some other games in which you control movement allows you to accelerate the vehicle using various keys. With Happy Wheels, you use the Up arrow key. The other controls are shown at the bottom of the game window. If these controls are too hard, go to Options-Customise Controls. Here are the default controls:


Hold ↑ to accelerate forward. Use ↓ to brake, and keep holding to drive in reverse.

← leans backward, and → leans forward. Use these controls to move over obstacles, when piloting a two-wheeled vehicle.

, Happy Wheels is easy to figure out, and half the fun is watching your character get thrown around the screen as you mash the keyboard. Click Play, select any of the featured levels, and click Play Now!? to begin your first game. If you're more the cautious type, read the instructions below first.


Most Happy Wheels levels are designed by users. If you don't enjoy a level, just switch to a different one for a new perspective.

, Space bar, Shift, and Ctrl will each use a special ability determined by the character you selected, or that the level creator selected for you. Here are all 11 of them:Wheelchair Guy — Shift & Ctrl to rotate the jet, space to fire
Segway Guy — Space to jump, Shift & Ctrl to change posture
Irresponsible Dad or Mom (parent and kid on bike)— Space to brake, Shift & Ctrl to eject individual riders, C to switch camera to child
Effective Shopper (woman with shopping cart) — Space to jump
Moped Couple — Space for speed boost, Ctrl to brake, Shift to eject woman, C to switch camera to woman
Lawnmower Man — Space to jump; can also mow over people and some objects
Explorer Guy (in minecart) — Shift and Ctrl to lean, hold Space to attach cart to rails
Santa Claus — Space to float, Shift to release elves after they are injured, C to switch camera to elves
Pogostick Man — hold Space to charge a larger bounce, Shift & Ctrl to change posture
Helicopter Man — Space to release magnet, Shift & Ctrl to raise and lower it

, Some levels are skill-testing obstacle courses filled with wrecking balls, spikes, gravity wells, giant spiders, and landmines. Others push you off a cliff and send you into free fall with cocktail umbrellas and corpses raining down around you. Most have a finish line you can reach, but there's no guarantee. Keep exploring, and have a laugh when you die.

, Lost an arm or leg, or all four? Ignore the blood and keep going! Your character only dies once the head or torso is squished or severed. Even then, you get to watch your ragdoll fly around the level. Press tab or the menu button in the lower left to restart the level or exit to the main menu.

, In some levels, you'll need to get out of your vehicle and walk or crawl around. When out of your vehicle, use the arrow keys, Shift and Ctrl to move your arms and legs. Each character works a little differently, but they all usually end up flopping in place like a fish. You can try alternating Shift and Ctrl immediately after you eject to walk, but this is a difficult challenge.


Oddly, the easiest character to control while walking is the wheelchair guy., From the main menu, click Browse Levels to get access to non-featured levels. You can sort by most recent, most played, or highest rated, then click the refresh button (the curving arrow) to see the new list.


If your friend made a level, search for your friend's Happy Wheels name, or ask for the level's URL and enter it using Load Level from the main menu.

, In order to do this, click 'Play' and you will see a complete list of levels that have been specially chosen by the editors to be showcased and receive extra plays and acknowledgement.

, This way, you will get extra fun when you persistently try and beat the level and get some laughs when the character explodes or loses a few guts!


Classic levels include The Combine 2.1, Ultimate Payback!, Car Thief, Speed Bridge and BMX_Park II.

, The gore of the game will only get funnier.

, After a period of time, you will have eventually played all or most of the featured levels. If you have had enough of the featured levels, go back to the menu and click 'Browse Levels' where there are hundreds of thousands more levels uploaded by users. If these levels are good enough, they will be submitted into Featured Levels so you can always go back and check for more. Feel free to rate and save replays if you wish.

, By doing this you can contribute to the Happy Wheels society and eventually be recognised as a full-on Happy Wheels user. To rate a level, press Esc or the Menu button in the bottom left hand corner and click on your preferred rating with 0 = Godawful, 1 = S****y, 2 = meh, 3 = good, 4 = pretty great and 5 being Superb! To save a replay, simply click on Save Replay and add a few comments if you wish.

, You'll need to create a profile in order to save the levels you make, and to share them with others. In the top right corner of the web page, above the game window, click Register and fill out the form.


Always check that you are logged in before you make a level, or it will not be saved.

, This option is available from the main menu. Once open, you can create a level from scratch, or click the editor menu button in the top left and load an existing level to use as a starting point.

, The pane on the left has several types of tools you can select. One easy way to get started is to select the star-shaped ""special item"" tool, and use the new pane that appears to place building blocks, cannons, a finish line, and many other objects.

, The cursor-shaped select tool lets you choose an object you've already placed and move it around. The selected object can also be resized, rotated, or have its parameters changed. For example, you can uncheck the ""interactive"" box on some objects to make them part of the background, instead of an obstacle you can collide with or drive over.


If you're not sure what a menu option does, hover your cursor over it and wait for an explanation to appear.

, In the Happy Wheels level editor, you can make objects move, connect them into simple machines, or even create events that trigger when the player performs a certain action. The best way to learn is to try everything out for yourself, but here are some tips to get you started:


Use the joint tool to connect two objects, or one object to the background. Make sure to select the objects and uncheck the ""fixed"" button, or they will not swing or move.
With an object selected, press C to copy it, then ShiftV to create a new copy.
To test your level, press T. During the test run, press F to mark the position of the character in the level editor.This lets you see how far the character can jump or be thrown, so you can place the next platform precisely.

, Sometimes it is even funnier watching famous YouTubers like Tobuscus or PewDiePie playing the game.

, First thing you see when you start playing is 2 little spinning things, a matchbook box, and a big building.

You see the gray gear thing that's spinning? That's called a Pebble Shiner. This harvest pebbles as 'resources' and you can use those to build other buildings.






The brown bottle cap thing is a Twig Snapper. These also harvest resources and the harvest twigs (hence ""twig snapper""). Anyway, you also use these to build things.






The Red Matchbox building is called a ""General Store"", Use this to buy certain things, such as resources.






The biggest building you see is called a ""Town Hall"" Upgrade this to upgrade your other building, as well as unlock them.







, To do this, click and drag your mouse toward where you want to look.





, Click the ""Buildings"" option, and select the building you want. This takes some resources, and also takes up space in your yard.


To upgrade a building, you click on it and select ""Upgrade"" (note this causes you to use resources) When you upgrade a building some features of the previous level will become better, or new features will be added. Try upgrading all your buildings as fast as you can.






To get rid of a building, click on the building, then select ""more..."" then click ""recycle."" This will give you 80% of the resources you spent on it, and the building completely disappears.







, The Tutorial is pretty straight forward, showing you the other two resources to gather, how to attack/build defenses, make monsters, and what shiny is. (the little ""gold"" used as currency that you can speed up upgrades with, and you buy them with real money) So if you missed anything in the tutorial, this is what you should do.

Build a Goo Harvester and a Putty Harvester. These collect the other two resources.






How to attack: First, build a Hatchery (found in the ""buildings"" section) and select the monster ""Pokey"" (these cost goo). This is a monster and when you attack someone they will do damage to their buildings. But where do you put these Pokeys? It's called a housing. These can be found in the ""buildings"" section. You have a capacity of these housings, meaning you can only have so many Pokeys. When you have enough Pokeys on your first attack (say.. 20) then build a map room & catapult. Both can be found under the ""buildings section.""






Click ""attack"" on somebody. This will take you to somebody's yard. On the side of the screen there is an icon that shows how many Pokeys you have and a + or - sign.






Click on the + sign to add Pokeys to your attack.






Once you added your 20 Pokeys from your housing, click ""fire"". This sends all of your Pokeys to attack someone. They will damage their buildings, and the object of attacking someone is to destroy their town hall. (But, beware they can attack you back if you attack them)







, If you attack someone, chances are they will attack you back. So you need to build defenses, right? Well, click on the buildings section, then click the Defenses tab. Then build walls around your base for protection. (monsters can break through the wall, it just acts as a light barrier) After that, click on cannon tower and sniper tower. Put these strategically where all of your buildings are protected. This takes brains to completely protect your base, but at least you won't get destroyed by the person you attacked!

, Walls can be upgraded, so upgrade those too. Resources harvest more resources per hour when you upgrade them, as well as increase their holding capacity.

, When you upgrade this you can capture outside post who will help you with your resources. When you get it from a wild monster tribe, you will start again with the yard. When you get it from another player, you get control of all his buildings

, When you reach level 20 with these items, you should immediately teleport to the Godlands, (usually in the center of the map). Continue to kill the gods within the area of the Godlands. Remember, killing each one only wields a 1/100 (1%) chance of obtaining stat potions, so stay committed and stockpile any of your stat potions in your vault.

, As soon you have stored a significant amount of potions, use them all at once on your wizard. After the first few stats are maxed, you can move on to maxing other stats, buying better gear with the potions, or buying other potions that the gods of the Godlands do not drop.

, There are multiple dungeons that a person can complete consecutively to gain profits, whether it be stat potions or high-tier gear. The most popular of these dungeons include Sprite World, Abyss of Demons, and Candyland Hunting Grounds.

, The Sprite World is regarded as the easiest to find, and to complete, dungeon. Each Sprite World has hundreds of small rapid-firing elemental enemies that can prove deadly to low defense classes. These enemies shoot 4/5 projectiles at a time that do about 16-18 HP, hundreds of these damaging projectiles can and will take a toll on your HP bar, and in seconds your character can die. In order to farm these dungeons, also commonly know as rushing, you should at least have a total of 20 defense points.

, Although the Abyss of Demons is easily found, it is one of the hardest and most unpredictable dungeons. This dungeon is a lot like a maze, with many dead ends and (gonna think of a word here). The rooms of this dungeon are filled with lava, and 4-5 assorted red demons that deal about 60-100 HP damage. When approached, they group up and chase you at a high speed. These enemies have been known to kill any character in less than a second if a player's mind detaches from the game. To help complete the Abyss of Demons faster, you should have at least over 40 defense. Melee classes are highly recommended for their high defense and high close-range damage. Some classes, such as wizard, can also farm this dungeon if they have the ability to kill the enemies quickly to prevent ""running away from the enemies"" which often results in death.

, Often referred to as just ""Candyland"" or ""Cland"". This is by far, the most difficult dungeon to find. The entrance only drops after you kill a Candy Gnome, one of those rarest enemies in RotMG. The chance of this dungeon dropping is not guaranteed, it is expected to be about 50%. The Candyland Hunting Grounds is a very unique dungeon, it is the only dungeon in the game that can be farmed after being completed. In order to spawn bosses you need to kill mini-bosses that spawn in various rooms of the dungeon. Although the Candyland can be farmed until infinity, the bosses usually do not drop anything of value, so a lot of time is required to get a full inventory.

, By far, the safest way to obtain good items is to become a merchant. Becoming merchant in this game means that you buy and sell items in order to profit. There are hundreds of items in the economy, each with its own set price."

, It could be one of their friends you're being mean to, or worse, a best friend. If someone is insulting another person on the Stardoll queen's guestbook, say, ""Hey, (username of insulter), stop bullying (username of person being insulted)! We're all friends here."" The SQ will see that you are a nice person and you want to give peace. This is what a SQ would look for (if they are not snobby.)

, A SQ would not want a BFF who goes on Stardoll once a month. Always have friendly chat with the SQ like ""Hey, I really like your outfit. Where did you get it?"" or ""Hey, do you know a good bazaar to get hot buys?"" or if you want to be nice, ""I saw that you're running for Covergirl. I'd love to help!""

, Personally, my favorite things to do are suite chat fashion shows, enrolling at modeling agencies, chit chatting at a club, or just hanging out at a party. No one wants a friend who just likes to say, ""Hey. I think you're cool."" or ""Your outfit's pretty.""

, If you're a girly and friendly girl, and there's a goth, snobby, but popular girl, you shouldn't be friends. Snobs and friendly girls don't work. Don't be that girl who only has friends because of their popularity.

Most Windows computers that are somewhat modern already have this preinstalled.;
, Many of the exploits you download are written with this. You can download it for free from microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653.

, You'll need a couple of Visual Studio debug DLLs in order to inject your exploits.


Download msvcr100.dll from dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100. The file will download in ZIP format.
Download msvcr100d.dll from dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100d. The file will download in ZIP format.

, Double-click each downloaded file and extract the DLL file inside. Place them on your desktop for now to find them easily.

, You'll need to place the DLL files into the correct system folder. If you aren't sure if you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, press ⊞ Win+Pause and look at the ""System type"" entry.


64-bit (most modern computers) - C:\Windows\SysWOW64

32-bit - C:\Windows\System32


, This will allow Windows to inject your exploits while you're running the game.

, These utilities scan for currently-running programs and then allow you to inject your DLL into a specific process, such as ROBLOX. This loads the DLL code into the game, letting you run the exploit. There are several DLL injectors that will work with ROBLOX exploits:


dllinjector.com
Extreme Injector

,

For most exploit forums, you'll need to create an account before you are able to view forum posts or download links.

,, There are free working exploits out here, but most of them are unstable or almost completely broken. The highest quality exploits out here, such as Elysian, Intriga or Cerebrus, requires payment before gaining access to the software.


Most transactions occur using Skype, PayPal or Discord. There is no guarantee that you're not going to get ripped off, or that the exploit won't be fixed the next day by the ROBLOX developers.
Avoid cracked versions of these exploits. Most cracks are scams or viruses, and exploit authors have been known to do unkind things to people who crack the paid exploits.

, ROBLOX gets updated often to fix exploits, and exploits that work one week may not work the next. New exploits are released all the time, and free ones come and go. If you're desperate for a free ROBLOX exploit, you should keep tabs on the forums for new posts.

, Using an exploit from your main account is asking to have it banned, so you should always use exploits from dummy accounts. Make sure there is no information in the account that can link it back to your main., Using exploits can get your IP address banned from ROBLOX, which will affect any of your accounts. Consider using a proxy or VPN to hide your IP address before connecting to ROBLOX and using exploits.

See Be Online Anonymously for tips on masking your home IP address.

, Having your DLL injector running before you start ROBLOX will make the process a little easier. You'll see a list of the currently-running programs appear in the DLL injector window. It may take a few moments for the list to populate.

, Click the ""Add DLL"" or ""Select DLL"" button and browse the exploit DLL that your downloaded or received. This will load it into the injector and have it ready to go when ROBLOX is running.

, ROBLOX needs to be running before you can inject your exploit DLL. Start the game and load the room you want to test your exploits in., You don't want a room that's too populated, or you run the risk of getting reported quicker. You'll need at least a few people to test commands on., Look for the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe process in the list and select it. This will tell the DLL injector which process to inject the DLL into.

, This will inject the exploit DLL file into the ROBLOX process. For most exploits, the command window should appear if the DLL was injected successfully.If the injection fails, make sure that you've installed everything listed in the first section of this article. The exploit could also have been patched by the ROBLOX developers, rendering it useless.

, You can usually type something like cmds to see a list of possible actions you can take with the exploit. These commands could include invincibility, noclip, superjump, and admin abilities like killing and kicking other players. The available commands will vary depending on the exploit.

Check out YouTube videos for the exploit you are using for some examples of commands you can use.
Check the ReadMe file that usually comes with the exploit for additional information on available commands.

, ""Leeching"" in the Roblox exploiting scene is the equivalent of receiving a product or a service and not thanking the one who served you. Most exploit developers out here who works fully pro bono simply expects a mere ""thank you"" if the one using the developer's exploit likes his work. This kind of behavior (""Leeching"") is highly frowned upon in several Roblox exploiting communities. If you download a free exploit, make sure to send a ""thank you"" note to its creator!"

Take cover, behind a wall, rock, car, etc.,
Try ambushing the opponent, when you attack an enemy from cover or behind, it is often too late for them to react.

Look for trick shots.",How to Avoid Being Killed on ROBLOX2,", While you have the chance, like if the attacker is reloading, jump out of the cover and shoot them with your weapon.,, If, in your game, bullets can reflect off a wall, see if there is a way you can ricochet bullets from a sloped wall behind you into the attack in front of you.

Search each zone for nodes.,
Break down items into components.,
Sell the materials at the Black Lion Trader.",How to Get Gold in Guild Wars 21," On each of the games maps, there are three different types of resource nodes which yield crafting materials. These nodes are mining, woodcutting, and herb gathering nodes, requiring a pickaxe, axe, and sickle respectively. These things can be purchased at many of the games traders. The further in the game a player gets, the more advanced their tools need to be. They break after a certain number of use so keeping track of how worn they are is important.;
, Players will pick up pieces of armor, weapons, and salvage materials throughout the game which seem to have little value. In fact, these can be broken down using salvage kits, turning them into crafting materials. Salvage kits can be purchased at most major traders.

, After a player accrues enough crafting materials, they should sell them, but rather than selling them to some NPC whose going to give them a few coppers at best, they should sell them to other players. The best way to do that is by visiting a Black Lion Trader in one of the major cities. From there the player can sell their variety of crafting goods to other players in a quick and easy fashion.

Get geared up.,
Find a group.,
Complete the dungeon or fractal.",How to Get Gold in Guild Wars 22," Before a player can start jumping into these cooperative activities they need to get the correct armor and weapons that will ensure they can pull their weight. It varies from class to class what the best weapons and armor are, so it's worth checking out build guides online from the forums in sights like Dulfy or even the Guild Wars 2 sub-reddit.

, Players can search for a group to jump into either activity by going to the social tab at the top left corner of their screen. From there they can select ""Looking For Group"" from the sidebar. It is there that they would either find exactly the group they're looking for. If the group isn't there they can start their own!

, Dungeons and fractals provide a wide variety challenges and situations for the player to face. But with great risk comes great reward. Dungeons yield a fair amount of gold for their first completion each day and also give each player a ton of loot to use, sell or break down for crafting components!

, What profession do you primarily play or what profession do you want to use to make gold with?

, Choose a build that you can use or a build you will work toward using.

, If you play through all three plus the expansion, you'll have a lot of money.

Start a new person and choose a profession you like to play.,
Do some of the first quests to get some money and weapons.

Have Fun and Enjoy Your Gold!

",How to Get a Lot of Gold in Guild Wars,";
,, Keep training until you are level 4. Remember to Pick up everything the monsters drop.

,, Try different monsters to train on like in Wizard's Folly. There are higher level monsters there.

,,, However, sometimes if players are really desperate for the dyes they might pay more than the traders.

, When you hear people talk about Farming they are talking about hunting for a weapon or something. If you want gold just go outside any town and kill every thing in the zone if your kinda new maybe take a henchie ( i suggest only taking the healer ) and then once every thing is dead make sure you pick up all the loot and then go back to the starting town sell every thing besides dyes and wands, swords, shields,etc that were better then what you started with. Consider getting salvage kits or ID kits.

Analyze your character.,
Learn how to use the skills your class comes with.,
When the problem of money comes around, simply sell as much as you can.,
When forming a team, make sure it has some sort of strategy.,
Join a solid guild.",How to Win in Guild Wars," Both the primary and secondary class are very important over the outcome of battle. In this you must use common sense. An Elementalist won't benefit very much from being a secondary Ranger, for example, but would be able to take better advantage of the skills of a Mesmer. If your combination is bad, you have two options:


Play the game through until you ""ascend"" and can change your secondary profession. Even if you picked a bad combination, you can still specialize in a skill of your primary profession.
Delete your character and start a new one. This may be hard to do if you've already put time into your current character, but if things are too hard, you can simply look for a good ""build"" on the internet and build your character around it.;
, Take the time to experiment with different skill combinations. The game itself allows for a lengthy period of time for this, as well as a tutorial before you even begin play. Don't just throw in random skills, take time to form combinations of skills that benefit from each other.

, All of those Worn Belts and Grawl Necklaces could one day add up to a Glob of Ectoplasm. Equip weapons as you see fit, take advantage of collectors, then sell the leftovers. That extra money can be used to buy some fancy new armor.

, Having all Elementalists is a sure fire way to die, unless you know what you're doing. In which case of knowing what you're doing, always use Meteor first, it helps with chaining. Most groups concentrate on first adding a Monk or two, a Warrior to absorb the damage, and an Elementalist to kill the enemies. The Monk is the essential core of the team. Without them, many quests and missions will be long struggles.

, Some guilds are filled with helpful people, who would be glad to aid you in your mission. However, there are millions of tiny, bad guilds popping up and dying. Make sure you join a good one!


First check whether the guild specializes in PVP or not. If you do not share the same game interests as your guild mates, then you probably will not have a fun time.
Make sure you're comfortable with the amount of members. Some people prefer always having someone to talk to, while others would rather know guild mates by name.
Find out whether the guild has a hall. If the guild does not have a ""Guild Hall"", an island you can meet others at, it is most likely not worth joining. More experienced players' guilds tend to have islands, while new guilds do not.

"
Find some spots where you can farm.,
Check some websites like pvxwiki.com or guildwarsguru.com for some great guides for farming.

,
Know your profession.,
Find the right weapons for it.,
Go make a lot of money and remember to have fun also.

",How to Farm in Guildwars," It is easiest to find the spot first, and then see what skills they are using, and then make a build, which can defeat them. e.g. if they uses hex, you might bring some anti hex skills etc.;
,, If you want to make your own, you have to be well known, with all the skills, for your profession. For example, if you are a warrior/monk, you'll have to see, if there are any heavy damage skills, and some good ""stay alive"" skills.

, Normally the weapons, are Green weapons, or weapons you can exchange. These are often the most useful and cheapest.

Start off by wall-jumping on chocolate grounds.,

The brown ground is earth.,
To wall-jump, simply fall towards the wall, then once you're touching the wall, jump away from it and jump.,
To practice wall-jumping, corner-jumping, or whatever you want to practice, go to a private room.",How to Become Pro on Transformice1," Wall jumping on chocolate is the best way to practice your wall-jumping if you are new to the game. By default, it has friction, which means that your mouse will not slide back down while wall-jumping.


The red coloured ground is lava, if you touch it you get thrown in the air with lots of force and speed. It can make your mouse die, but you can stop that by pressing and holding the up key while crossing it.






The purple ground is a trampoline. It's possible to wall-jump it. Instead of jumping away from the wall, just jump, then run towards the wall, then when you bounce away from it, jump again. You will not need to pull away from it because it will bounce you back by itself. Trampoline does not work as well if it is touching wood, though. It's not likely you'll need this, unless you're playing bootcamp.






The light blue ground is ice, which can't be wall jumped unless it is at a slant. Although, you can corner-jump it more easily than any other ground. If you don't get it the first time, keep trying!;
, It's pretty much the same as wood. It's usually pretty easy to wall jump on it.







, Then you should be able to run towards it again to reset your jump. Remember, you have to fall into the wall., Do this by typing /room vanilla *your username here*."

To make a stable start to a bridge, or a stabilizer for a wobbly build, get a plank from the items list, then press B.
To make a stabilizer for a plank that's moving when it's not supposed to, simply click and hold the anchor against the plank.
To make a stable start for a ramp/bridge, always summon it against the ground so it's touching the ground on both sides of the, because B planks rotate around the B anchor. Next, get another plank from the items list, then press C twice. Use your scroll wheel to rotate it. There's also other planks like V, N, and J.

, It will not load if you have Javascript and Flash turned off in your web browser. Once it finishes initializing, the game will take you to a character creation page.

, Enter a unique character name and choose a Ninja village you want to start in. These villages are the main Ninja villages in Naruto: the Fire, Wind, Water, Lightning, and Earth villages.


You may want to base your choice on character statistics (values of how strong or how fast the character is, and how many stamina points he/she has). You can also pick based on weapon use. The three main weapon categories in Pockie Ninja are Sharp, Blunt, and Fists. Your main character will be able to use one. On the other hand, if you already have a favorite from the Bleach or Naruto series, then by all means pick him or her.
Notice that only the supporting characters from Bleach and Naruto are available at character creation. Other (more powerful) characters like the protagonists Ichigo Kurosaki or Uzumaki Naruto are crafted, found, or bought in-game.

, Click 'OK' on the prompt that appears.





, It starts by pitting you against Gaara. If you are a fan of Naruto then you will most definitely feel afraid for your character. If you are new to Naruto lore, suffice to say that Gaara is very powerful in the manga/anime series. He promptly beats your main character. Don't feel too bad about this, the game designers intend you to fail in this battle. Even if on the off chance you knock him down, he gets back up and defeats you. This is a story element – one of your motivations will now be to become powerful enough to defeat him.

, At first you may feel very constrained as the game forces you to go through the tutorial quests. Just follow the instructions and it'll be done before you know it. Once you are done with the tutorials you'll feel more comfortable with in-game concepts and navigation, and will now be able to explore the games world in your own pace.

, Quests can be obtained by talking to Non-Player characters (NPCs) or accepting quests posted in the 'Bounty Quest' room.


A good way to see all possible quests for your character level is by using the 'Quest Navigation' Menu in the bottom right of your screen.






An exclamation mark (!) above a building or and NPC also means an acceptable quest.







, Once you have completed enough quests, your character increases in level and unlocks one new skill.






You can pick the skills you want your character to use in battle in the 'Skill' menu.







, Winning fights against other players is a good way to accumulate medals (an in-game currency used to buy special items) and increase your character's standings.

, These are 'dungeons' where you fight monsters for greater rewards. Valhalla is best played with a team, while Las Noches is a solo quest. It is useful to learn powerful skills and obtain more powerful items before raiding these dungeons.

, Aside from buying them, this is the way to obtain more powerful items. Specifics about crafting and other game concepts are in the game guide."

At level 9 make sure to buy the spell Light Healing (exura) for 175 GP.,
After purchasing exura, knights should find a place with many rotworms in order to gain skill.,
Druids and Sorcerers should get rods or wands respectively, and buy exura as soon as possible in order to raise their magic level, so they can do more damage with runes and heal more hit points.,
At level 10 all vocations should buy ‘Antidote,’ which heals poison.,
At level 11, Druids, Sorcerers and Paladins should buy the spell 'Intense Healing' (exura gran) which heals about double as much as Light Healing.

,
Now you should be all right until level 14, unless you want to purchase a good light spell.,
At level 14 all mages should IMMEDIATELY get the ‘Magic Shield’ spell (utamo vita) and upgrade your wand/rod.,
By this level, you should be at least hunting Cyclops or creatures that give around 100 experience.,
Get to level 20 like this.,
At this stage you should be considering Premium.,
At level 23, sorcerers should keep hunting monsters and try not to die.,
At level 25, buy Summon Creature spell (Utevo Res 'Creature Name').,
You'll gain good loot from doing this, and quite a bit of XP.,By now if you really want to be good, you'll have brought premium and can go on hunts with groups of people or you can buy a whole heap of preemie spells which will enhance your hunting in making it easier an faster to level

,
By now, you can hunt anywhere in the non premium land- even farther if you actually bought premium.,
At level 45, Premium or not, sorcerers should get Sudden Death Rune.,
At level 80 you should have worked out the game.,100 + Do the Annihilator Quest and try the POI Quest

",How to Succeed After Rook in Tibia,";
, Use a weak weapon like a knife, club or sickle. Paladins would do best using small stones. A shield, such as those you might find in Rookgaard, is also recommended.

, At this stage you could kill something stronger than rotworms but make sure you have a good escape plan (and try not to get killed).

, (This is strongly recommended, as you will likely be facing poisonous creatures, such as scorpions, centipedes, and slimes soon.)

,, In which case, get ‘Great Light’ at level 13 or get a newer rod/wand.

, Paladins can get it now or later. It comes in handy when you are in danger as any damage inflicted upon you will be subtracted directly from your mana points instead of hit points. (Mages should use this sparingly, however, because it can very quickly subtract mana points that may be needed later.)

, (Slimes work just as well, as Cyclops can be difficult to kill at lower levels.)

, At level 20 the first thing you should do is the 10 k quest which will give you 10 k and some other items (beware of player killers who kill you after you receive the 10k). Also be sure to buy the ‘Ultimate Healing’ spell (exura vita).

, It helps HEAPS, it gives you more spells, hunting areas, runes and you can buy a vocational promotion for 20 k. It isn't required, though.

, Druids can buy it but its recommended that druids go to level 24 an get Ultimate Healing Rune (adura vita). Make backpacks of these runes as they sell for around 3 k on most servers. If you really want to get a high magic level, use your money to buy mana fluids, as they will speed up your magic level considerably.

, Now you should be able to hunt dragons, but take some Intense Healing Runes, just in case. Summoning 2 Demon Skeletons can help you considerably. Monks work just as well at higher levels, as they can heal themselves. Paladins can get this spell as well, but it won't help very much

, Once you've gotten to around level 35, you should be able to solo dragons and/or giant spiders without summons. Knights should also get Berserk if they have premium and a promotion

,, A good spot is Orc Fort or POI or The Second Floor of DC (Dark Cathedral)

, It’s the strongest rune in the game an it sells for 5-6 k per backpack.

, You can kill almost anything

Fight, and then get some money for new weapons and armor (possibly leading to more deaths), or get money now, and buy new equipment (this way is unlikely to lead to deaths).,
Go to the town center (north from the temple)where you should see a sewer gate.,Fight off as many rats as possible, being very careful not to be cornered or attacked by more than one rat at a time.,Take their loot (loot means whatever they drop), and save the cheese they drop for yourself to heal wounds or to sell when your health bar color is in red or yellow.,

, Use that and you'll go down a hole.,,, Then say ""Heal,"" and then ""Yes."" You will be healed back to green health (which is not the same as completely full health).,"
"
Go to the pen of animals next to the place with the character named Tom in it, and you may find some animals there (they might already be dead).,
Do one of two things:

If you went for combat first...

Leave The Rookguard Town by going NORTH from Toms place and you should see some stairs go up them and you will be on a bridge go north until you see more stairs go down them and your outside of the city(NOTE you must be at least level 2 to do this)then walk Right(--->) then when you can go south (V) until you reach water then go right AGAIN until you see a raft on the coast there will be poison spiders.,
Remember that the hardest part of all choosing you Vocation (job) here are the Pros and Cons of each of them:

Knight Pros: Does More Damage at lower levels uses Meele weapon(such as Kantana and carlin sword and has the highest HP out of all the vocations can get skills up higher then any other vocation Cons:Cannot attack from far away unless you wanna use a bow or spears(HIGHLY not recommended) also has the LEAST amount of mana out of all the vocations and has almost NO spells Cannot get magic level higher then 8 and is VERY DIFFICULT to get higher then 2 3 or 4
Paladins Pros: Can attack from far away due to its use of Bows and spears and other Ranged weapons Has a Decent amount of spells and can get magic level fairly high has a good amount of HP and mana can use the trees and other obstacles to its advantage Con.,Go to the library and go UP the stairs and talk to the Oracle in the other room say Hi then Enter a town(the oracle will tell you what towns to choose from any will do) then tell the oracle what job you have chosen (this is irreversible so once you have chosen your job you can not change it think twice before making your choice) then when you're done say Yes then your off to the mainland as your new job buy some new armor and get out there and show the world who you are made of!",How to Get Past Rookguard in Tibia3," If you do see some, kill them. They may be hard to kill but it's worth it. They give no experience at all but the meat does. And maybe the ham they drop is worth money. They sell for 2 gp (gold pieces) each and the meat is 4 gp.

When you can't hold any more meat (when your Capacity is at 0 system told:it's too heavy), or when there are no more animals, go to a man named Willie just on the right of the pin (leave out of the north exit, then go right). Sell him ALL of your meat, cheese, and whatever food you may have (that he will accept) and get plenty of money now since there aren't many animals left now.
Go south of the animal pen (go right through it and go right again until you come across a big field. Kill everything that is there: deer, chickens, rabbits, etc.) and collect their meat. And check all the dead bodies and see if anyone left anything. Now sell everything again and check the animal pen again! And repeat.
When you have around 300-400 gp buy this list from either Al Dee(north of Willie) or Obi(Left of Toms) they all sell the same things at the same prices( either one will do the list includes Leather Legs Leather Boots And(maybe if you want to save a little money but have weaker armor out on armor) a Helmet this doesn't add up to much but it WILL when you get the list above go to the center of town(where the sewer gate is)and say:Buying Chain Armor Offer
Wait until someone replies this is the best armor in Rookguard when you get to main(main land) its worth nothing its mostly around 50 gp but can go higher.
Then when you get your chain armor yell(if you didn't buy a helmet) Buying Legion Or Viking Helm Offer)these are good helmets in rookguard then when you've done THAT shout Buying Katana Or carlin Sword Offer the katana is the BEST weapon in rookguard and carlin sword is the second best do this until you're done.
When you get this you should be AT LEAST level 4(if you trained fist) or level 1(if you got money first when you have done this go buy a backpack from obi or al dee for 20gp and a rope and a shovel(you will need these)if you don't have enough money kill more animals for meat until you have enough this will ring up a HIGH bill but is worth it next off more training places.

,
If there is only 1 fight it if there are 2 or more lure(this means letting it follow you)somewhere else or get a narrow space and fight them 1 by 1 if your level 4 do this if your level 5 fight them both there will be other normal spiders that won't be a problem with your new armor and weapons when everything is dead get on board the raft there should be a chest there open it up and you should receive a book
Go back to the town and go to the library(north of the sewer gate can't miss it) and go down the stairs go into the room with many beds and look for someone named Amber say ""Hi"", then Book, then yes.


Receive a short sword sell that to obi and receive some good money (This quest can be done as many times as you want as long as you find another book on the ground)when you have done that go back outside the city and look ALLOVER the place for monsters fight them and when you get to level 5 or 6 go to a little bridge South of the bridge to the city(go south of the bridge then north until you see it)cross over there and go south then left until you find some trolls and a tower fight the trolls and snakes you see and walk around the place looking for them(stay IN THE SWAMP(where all that green goo is) unless you want to be killed!) kill snakes and trolls when you reach level 6 or 7 its time for your first dungeon!

When you're in the swamp(at troll tower)go Left(<---) until you reach water then go North until you see a building there may be monsters in it but nothing to scary go inside fight off everything there(make sure to have food) then go all through the cave(make sure to have a rope as well and a shovel) until you reach level 8 then you may leave Rookguard (YAY) but before that finish some quests( a link at bottom of wikihow) .


If you took the money first...

Follow the same path as others(kill rats trolls and snakes dungeon!)until level 8.



, Everything ranged uses up ammo and that can get expensive when buying(unless using spears and fighting trolls because trolls drop spears) Has average melee, and magic. Paladins and very all around characters, and very fun to play. But Paladins along with knights pay the price early on you have to train a lot. You want your Distance fighting over 60 when you hit level 20.
Sorcerer Pros: Can use Magic Wands from a distance Can Make Many Runes(Including SD's(Sudden Death Runes)and they are VERY strong runes and VERY expensive Has a VERY high amount of mana then other classes The higher there ML(Magic Level) The higher there rune strength will be Cons:Wands use mana and when mana runs out you cannot use it(can still use runes though also mana can be restored by eating food) Has the LOWEST Cap(capacity this is how much you can carry) has the LOWEST HP
Druids Pros: Can make Healing Runes and other Healing Spells(VERY popular and can get a lot of money) Can heal other people Uses Rods that can attack from a distance Has the HIGHEST Mana in the game Is accepted by everyone due to the fact they can make Healing runes(they can be used to HEAL other people ANYONE can use them this like a healing spell in a rock that anyone can use)


The higher there magic level the HIGHER there heals will be Cons:Has the lowest HP and CAP in the game Rods use mana and when mana runs out it can't be used(can be replenished with food).

To get there, left click the mouse and hold in the direction you want to walk or run.


If you've never played before, pick Early Poptropica. This island has proved to be the easiest out of all of the other islands.

, Each island will involve different challenges that you can complete, and once you finish the quest in an island, you earn Poptropica Credits. They're used to buy special effects and costumes for your player to customize the experience.


The quests will change from island to island, and at the different age points. Basically, you just want to move around and find different challenges and complete them.

, You can make friends in the Common Room, and then add them to your friends list for the future. The Friends icon should open the list. You can basically look at their profiles and get to know basic information when you click on their profile in your friends list.

, It's important to start a user name and a password when you start, and to make sure you save your progress each time you play. This way, you'll be able to come back and pick put he game where you left off the next time you want to play.

, The is always a Common Room where you can chat, battle, and even friend other real players in Poptropica. Sometimes you won't be told where to go, and you'll just have to ask around and make friends, solve problems, and find challenges to complete.


Talking is crucial in this game. Often, someone you talk to has a problem, and then you can fix it by using what you have or looking deeper into the place they have the problem in to fix their problem. You will normally get an item from this.

, If nobody in the place you land has a problem, and you've looked everywhere in the little space, go to the left or right and check out those spaces seeing if anyone there has a problem. Once you find the problem and get the item go to another place and fix another problem. That's a big part of the gameplay.


Each world on the Poptropica map has a different story, none of them will link together. However on each map, once you win and are granted a medal, you will given certain privileges that apply only to that map. An example of this is when you win Super Power Island and can fly on that island only.

, Some places you might not be able to go in yet, but attempt to visit every place on the island that you can to find challenges and tasks to complete.


Click books, cards, drinks, bookshelves, boxes, shelves, animals, and anything that just looks peculiar. They might have hints and stories along with your quest.

, You pick things up by running through them or talking to people who have the item. There should be a backpack icon, which contains your inventory as you collect things as credits that may come in handy for later quests.

, One of the fun things about the game is to buy new clothes and customize your character. You can make yourself look like a rock star, Darth Vader, or a number of other things. Every island success will give you 50 coins, so you should save up for new stuff.

Spawn!,
Survey the scene.,
Gather some resources.,
Craft!,
Pick your engrams.,
Find food.,
Make clothes and housing.,
Keep experimenting and learning.",How to Get Started Playing ARK: Survival Evolved," Creating your character isn't very necessary. There is no change in stats if you make you Character Arnold 2.0 or a midget.


The important part is choosing where to spawn! Even the good players never spawn on the north end, unless you have a death wish. You'll instantly be freezing and surrounded by more dangerous predators than you can count. As you become more experienced, you could spawn on the east or west ends, but for now, try to spawn on South 1, 2 or 3.;
, As soon as you get up, and scratch at the strange implant in your arm, look around you. You'll probably be on a beach, with a thick jungle behind you and an endless ocean in front of you.


Look around for resources (large boulders and tall trees) and try to spot predators. Keep an eye out for giant crocodiles, anything that looks like a raptor, or anything with a T-rex shaped body. If you see anything, just be aware that they could notice you too! If anything is too close, you might need to move homes.

, You're not going to have any tools right of the bat, but you'll get to that. Now, this part is simple.


Run up to a tree, and begin to punch it (right trigger 2 on Xbox or PS4, left click on PC), until it falls to the ground. You now probably have some thatch and maybe some wood, right? Good!
If you are on a beach, there should be numerous rocks scattered in the sand. Run abound, picking these up (△ on PS4, Y on Xbox, E on PC).

, Go into your inventory (○ on PS4, B on Xbox, hold I on PC). You'll see you have a few items there - hopefully stone, thatch, and wood. There is a tab up at the top where you can go to crafting. When you first start, you have access to two items: a torch and a pickaxe. Craft both. If you are lacking materials, continue to grab rocks, and punch trees.

, Now that you have a pick, go swinging at some of those giant boulders with the pickaxe! You'll walk away with plenty of stone and flint.


By now, you should have leveled up. Go into your inventory and under your character, there is a list of stats. Select one to increase (health, food, water, crafting speed, stamina, melee damage, etc). It will bring you into the Engram List. Here are all the things you can craft in the whole game. Some you must be a certain level to unlock. For now, chose to learn campfire and axe. Craft these.

, So, your probably getting hungry, right? You can gather some food!


Get berries: If you go up so a small bush, and begin to press △ /Y/E without a tool equipped, you begin to 'harvest' this bush, granting you fiber and different berries. All of these berries can be eaten, but they won't fill up hardly any hunger, so watch out!
Get meat: If you want any chance of surviving, you're going to have to kill things for food. It's just impossible to live off only berries. Here are three animals that are perfect for beginners: Dodos, Lystrosaurus, and Moschops. Run up to one and repeatedly hit it with an axe. Once it is dead, keep hitting it until its corpse disappears. You will have gotten meat and hide. Now, go over to the fire, put your meat and wood in the campfire and light it. Eventually you'll be left with cooked meat! Eat this as you need it.

, Continue to level up. Choose to learn how to make cloth shirt, pants, gloves, hat and boots, and learn how to make thatch foundation, walls, doorways, roofs and doors.


The thatch building materials require large amounts of wood, thatch and fiber. Get gathering! Once you have enough, you'll want to build a small thatch hut. It can be as big as you like, but a good start is 4 thatch foundations, 4 roofs, 7 walls, a doorway and a door, set up in a square fashion.
You need very large amounts of fiber for cloth clothes. The boots and gloves also require hide.

, These basics should cover you for your first day in the game. You'll learn more as you go!

Go on this dirt road until you reach the fence at the base.,
Go towards the other side, and at the South-East corner is a small mount with a vent on top.,
When you're inside the base, use an 'Infinite Health' cheat code.,
Then when you finished visiting inside Area 69, the only way to get out is NOT TO kill yourself but to get BUSTED!,
Deactivate the 'No Cops' cheat code by using it again:

Find Your Style.,
Learn the System.,
Download the Right Songs.",How to Get Good at Stepmania," There are many ways of playing Stepmania. While the possibilities are pretty much endless, there are some main styles you should probably try first. Stick with what fits you best.


Note that to change the keys with which you play, go to Options>Config Key/Joy Mappings.


One-Handed. One-handed is a style in which you only use one hand to play the game. This hand will almost always be playing on the arrow keys, because anywhere else would require a huge amount of hand-stretching. This form is probably the hardest to master.
Index. Index is when you use two hands, but only the index fingers of both. While this style is mostly played on the arrow keys, you can also play it on different places, like the alternate keypad (with 2468).
Four-fingered. Four-fingered is when you use both of your hands, using two fingers from each. The most common form of this is (← = Left Middle Finger, ↓ = Left Index Finger, ↑ = Right Index Finger, → = Right Middle Finger). This is probably the most common form between casual players, and is quite versatile between all patterns.
Spread. Spread is fundamentally the same as Four-Fingered, but the position of your fingers are different. The most common form is ASKL spread, where it is (A = Left Middle Finger, S = Left Index Finger, K = Right Index Finger, L = Right Middle Finger). There are also other forms of this, such as diagonal spread (QSLP Spread).;
, There is much terminology to be learned in Stepmania. Try to keep these in your head when playing.


Learn the Scoring System. When playing Stepmania, you may be given a score that confuses you. Here is what most of the scores mean.


AAAAA: Passing a song with all Ridiculous notes. The chances of getting this score is nigh impossible, so don't be surprised if you never get it. You will also need to download Ridiculous Timing to even have a chance at getting this.
AAAA: Passing a song with all Marvelous or better notes. Once again, getting this score is very very very hard, unless on a very easy song, so don't expect to get this. You will need to turn Marvelous timing on to get this (which is included with Stepmania, unlike Ridiculous Timing).
AAA: Passing a song with all Perfect or better notes.
AA: Passing a song with either a Full Combo, or very near it, with good accuracy.
A: Passing a song with only a few Combo Breakers and good accuracy.
B: Passing a song with a good amount of Combo Breakers and OK accuracy.
C: Passing a song with a lot of Combo Breakers and perhaps decent accuracy.
D: Barely passing a song. Lots of Combo Breakers and bad accuracy.
E: Failing a song.


Learn the Terminology. There are other terms to learn to when playing Stepmania, such as names of patterns.

Learn the Patterns. There are many patterns you must learn in Stepmania, some of which will give you trouble. Note that, in this section: ← = 4, ↓ = 2, ↑ = 8, and → = 6 (as seen on the numpad).




Stream. A constant string of 16th notes (yellow notes).
Rolls. A rolling pattern between all 4 arrows (68246824). It may also refer to a long note that requires you to repetitively tap in order for it to count.
Staircases. A pattern similar to rolls but with a staircase pattern (6824286824).
Trills. A repeating pattern between 2 arrows (686868 or 646464).
Jacks. A pattern consisting of quick, repeated taps to one arrow (888888 or 666666).
Triples. A pattern involving 3 quick taps and a pause (686, 424, 464).
Jumps. A pattern involving 2 arrows hit at the same time.
Jump stream. A stream with jumps in it.
Gallops. A pattern consisting of 2 quick arrows in a row, making a galloping sound (tap-tap).
Crossovers. Patterns of 4262426, 4868486, etc. in which pad dancing would require you to cross your foot over to the other side of the pad.
Runningmen. A pattern where there is one constant arrow hit with 2 arrows alternating in between. ( Note: The two alternating arrows must each be on the same side of the constant arrow, otherwise it's a mini-staircase or crossover staircase).
Chains. A pattern consisting of alternating jumps and single notes, connected by a single common note. (46), 6, (26), 2, etc.
Hands/Quads. A hand is three arrows at once, and a quad is four arrows at once.

, If you are just beginning, do not download a pack full of hard songs. If you play index, don't download a pack full of songs for people who play spread. Start easy, then slowly build up.

Train yourself either on the single player campaign or on Terrorist Hunt.,

Train your skill with grenades.,
Don't wear bright colored camouflage like orange, pink, snow/white etc.",How to Get Good at Rainbow Six Vegas," Once you get good on the normal difficulty setting, play only on the realistic setting. Terrorist Hunt is personally harder than fighting real players online when playing with the difficulty set to realistic and the enemy density set to high. This is because there are much more terrorists against you than if you had a full game with real people; plus the AI can spawn behind you and take you out without you even realizing it.;
, It is important to react quickly if an enemy has opened fire on you. Try to find the nearest cover and locate the position of the enemy (it is much easier to do so in RSV2 because when players fire their weapon, they appear on radar, just like Call of Duty) . Terrorist Hunt is a great way to work on your reaction time because there are many enemies against you and ambushes can happen fast.

, soldier that matches the best with your skills. First decide if you like speed or strength more. If you would rather be quick, don't put much armor on your character, only use the light armors or none at all. Remember, the less armor you have, the more vulnerable your player is. Pay very close attention to your Protection and Mobility meters while equipping the armor for your character. Or, if you wish to have the best protection, build a character with only heavy armor. The drawback is you will move slower, but you really don't move too slow. If you can't decide between speed and strength, build a character than has both the Protection and Mobility meters even at the center, so you move at a fairly quick speed, but also have a good amount of armor.

, The stats don't match the weapons very accurately (unless the stats are very, very high, like the G3 or MTAR 21). The only way to tell if a weapon is truly good for you is to experiment and try them all out to find the best.

, If they are noobs or aren't using mics, don't expect to win... unless they're really good players. They might be, you never know. Remember that just because someone is the rank of Elite, doesn't mean they are good. They may have just played Terrorist Hunt non-stop each day to slowly gain experience and slowly rank up.

, Calypso Casino - very popular for the game-type Attack & Defend, probably the most popular). Find the best routes to get around the map and also the alternative routes if it's too dangerous to move along your usual path. Knowing the best routes really helps for Attack & Defend, so you can get to the Intel quickly and get back to the extraction point without too much trouble.

, Grenades can be the fine line between life and death for you. Use fragmentation grenades and incendiary grenades a lot. They work well for taking care of enemies behind cover or when it's too dangerous to pop out from your own cover to aim with your gun. C4 is very fun to use. You can lay traps, just place a stick of C4 somewhere and wait for someone to walk by then detonate it. It's very useful to plant C4 within lethal range of the Intel in Attack & Defend because as soon as the game tells you the enemy has nabbed the Intel, detonate the C4 and you may successfully kill the carrier just before they get away.

, Those colors are your enemy, unless you are very good and being spotted isn't too much of a problem for you. When you become an Elite you unlock the ability to create your own camouflage so you can make rainbow camouflage or whatever the heck you want to do.

Pick your game!,
Distinguish reality from imagination.,
Be prepared to be scared.,
Never play late at night or in the dark.,
Be aware of game cliches.,
Make fun of the monsters and force yourself to laugh at the characters.,
Reduce the game audio.,
Listen to music that makes you relax once you turn off the game audio.,
Play when someone else is in the room.,
Keep in mind that a horror game is only as scary as you want it to be.",How to Not Get Scared While Playing Survival Horror Games," There are many ""survival horror"" games. Some of the more recognizable ones are the ""Silent Hill"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", and ""Left 4 Dead"" series. Some other smaller titles include the well known ""SCP: Containment Breach"" or ""Penumbra"", the spiritual predecessor to ""Amnesia"", another survival horror game.;
, These are just video games, and nothing in them can hurt you. It's fake. There are no such things as zombies, monsters with pyramid-shaped heads, tentacle beasts, or killer animatronics, as far as we know, at least. Never forget that a video game is a video game, nothing more. Remember that playing games like these too much can cause you to get paranoid, and the often tense atmosphere can leave you quite on edge once you stop playing.

, Survival horror games are meant to scare you! If you jump out of your skin a couple of times, that means that the creators have done their job. If games or movies scare you to the point that you lose sleep for extended periods of time or provoke paranoia, you should stop playing/watching them all together. It's not worth making yourself feel uncomfortable and causing inconvenience for the sake of a cheap thrill.

, While this may seem obvious, a lot of these types of games are in an extremely dark environment, so as to add the level of fear and excitement the player experiences while playing. You should move on to playing a Horror Game in the dark after you have gotten over your fear, till then play with the lights on.

, This can be anything from a simple jumpscare to rising tension. Being able to detect when a typical type of scene might play out, especially when it involves jumpscares as these are often the selling points of many ""horror"" games, notably, ""Slender"". Jumpscares aren't actually scary, rather just startling, and you can get good at avoiding at having a response to them by experiencing them a few times in different forms., Attempting your hand at humor, even if false, can lessen the mood of the game and make it less scary. You can also watch spoofs of some video game monsters, such as Pyramid Head, on the internet which may make the characters less scary. Sometimes it can even help to picture yourself as a stronger entity compared to the monster or object that scares you. Other ideas include imagining the protagonist using bright colorful weapons to fight the monsters, which bleed rainbows. It may be a bit ridiculous, but it will lessen the paranoia you may experience.

, This is extremely effective, you will notice how a horror game or movie becomes soft and easy after the sound is taken away. It's all in the sound, While this doesn't work for everybody, not having screams or high-pitched noises when you least expect them should do a decent job of making the game slightly more tolerable, especially in the Silent Hill series since usually the music adds to the terrifying mood. Don't forget about those jumpscares!

, Listen to music on either your computer, radio, or iPod. The music should make it less scary. After all, imagine listening to a happy, bubbly pop song whilst slaying hordes of undead. It's almost comical, and you'll find yourself far more relaxed than you would with the original game soundtrack. Try something from Tiny Tim.

, Having company beside you could help you relax, especially if you trust this person. They could also help for making small chat in between action-intense parts of the game. Even if it's your pets!

, Do not play horror games if you do not enjoy them, people play horror games because they like being scared. It's an exciting feeling! Feel free to embrace it. Move on to playing a game in the dark, alone, with headphones, if possible after you have gotten over your fear. If you are going to buy a survival horror game; you might as well get the full experience. Also, if you have a headset, you could possibly record the video and upload it on YouTube, so later you can laugh at it and it will make it less terrifying!

Start by playing the video game of your choice.,
Now start off by playing a few practice matches against some people.,
Once you've warmed up now you can go into some ranked matches or against harder opponents or difficulties.,
Now here's when your mind kicks in and everything just seems to fall into place for you.,
Using this method can get the outcome of the match to be in your favor.",How to Own at Any Video Game (Through Thought)," Make sure it has events which are unpredictable and can take place anytime during the match. (Anything online is fine because you don't know what your opponents are thinking, hence making it unpredictable);
, Don't really try too hard to do anything in the game. Just go where the wind takes you and don't get upset if you die. Try to achieve a carefree feeling.

, Keep that carefree attitude you had in the practice matches, but now you have to point out your objective in the match. Say you had to capture the flag in the match. Don't concentrate too hard on trying to get your hands on it, just slowly advance toward it. If there are enemies guarding it then your new objective is to eliminate them to get your hands on the flag. Concentrate on whatever obstacle gets in your way.

, When you're concentrating on your goal, your brain will create the events necessary to reach it. If you need to get your hands on a sniper rifle to kill some enemies guarding the flag which was your primary objective, you may see your teammate die and drop it in front of you. Weird huh?

, The only thing that can keep this from working is that your opponents may use it as well and then it comes down to your own actions that will determine what will happen.

RULE #2 - Take Cover!,
RULE #3 - Aim & Shoot!,
RULE #4 - Move & Shoot.,
RULE #5 - Charge if necessary.,
RULE# 6 - Reload!",How to Increase Your Skill in Shooting Games,"


You don't need super jumping abilities or swift running to be a Super-Soldier!;
, Cover! Cover!


Don't just stand there like rookie.
Move back to cover.
Let the enemy come to you.
Make sure the cover protects even the tip of your head. they can still snag a lucky head shot with even a little bit of head showing.

,


This is a rule every Shooting-Game fans should know.


Don't just shoot as soon as you spot an enemy.
Be patient.
Look closer. He/She might be one of you team mates.

It's better to get a small amount of bullets through your enemy than a spray of bullets that shoots past them.


Aim if the enemy is far away.

It usually increases your weapon's accuracy.



,


Never ever just stand in one spot and then shoot.
Move around while moving the cross-hair.

It's very simple if you try.


If you can jump, jump to the right or to the left while moving.

It can sometimes confuse the ones who are shooting back at you.


Don't move around too much.

Just enough so you can still see your guy.



,


When you have no ammo left or if your just in the middle of reloading and a guy just pops out of nowhere and start shooting, CHARGE AT HIM/HER!!
This (sometimes) could be the only thing to do when that happens.


Melee them if you can.
If you don't want to risk it then just run to cover and finish reloading.

,


Whenever you shoot to much you will eventually lose a whole clip in less than 5 seconds.


Always look at your ammo bar (if you have one).
If your ammo is less than 25% then reload unless there is still some enemies shooting you.
If there's not then reload.
If you have any spare time when your just walking, reload.

Keep the letter.",How to Identify Sabjorn's Silent Partner in Skyrim," After the Honningbrew Meadery has been poisoned during the first part of the “Dampened Spirits” quest, Sabjorn, the owner, will be arrested and a person named Mallus Maccius will be put in charge. Go to the Honningbrew Meadery by walking at least a minute directly south from the city of Whiterun. The Honningbrew Meadery is a large wooden house situated beside a river.;
, Enter the Meadery through its large main doors at the front and inside you’ll find the new owner, Mallus Maccius. He’s a pale-skinned man with long brown hair and shadowed eyes. Approach him and press the designated “Speak” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to talk to him. He will then say a short talk on what he will do with the meadery. Afterwards, he will give you Sabjorn’s dresser key.

, Enter the room just behind where Mallus Maccius is standing, and turn right to find a staircase that leads to the second floor of the meadery. Once you’re on the second floor, walk along the hallway and you’ll find a door at the end of it. Go through this door to find Sabjorn’s room.


If you already reached this area without talking to Mallus Maccius first, you’ll find the door locked. The dresser key that Mallus gives to you unlocks this door to Sabjorn’s room.

, On the right side of the door you entered through you’ll find a wooden table. Approach the table to find some leftover food on a plate, some bottles of draught, and a letter on it.

, Approach the table and press the designated “Read” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to read the letter. You’ll find that the letter came from Maven Black-Briar, which is Sabjorn’s silent partner.

You don't want to be confused when your last teammate dies after telling you ""2 on cat w/b"". There is a lot of important info underneath all of the useless stuff, so don't be afraid to sift.

, Start a multiplayer game by yourself, and if it's hosted online, slap a garbage password (""asdfasdf"") on your game so nobody can join. Play around with the game, and get a feel for the timing, speed, and caution you need. For RTS, practice your ability to ""micro"" your base and units correctly. For FPS, practice with your guns and grenades. For example, find safe points in Halo 2 and memorize how to throw the grenades into popular camping points.

, Find the game with the lowest ping and the simplest name, so you get good results with simple rules. When you play, generally focus on your opponent only while skirmishing. Don't waste your time thinking, ""Well, he's not here,"" because chances are, he's been there. Concentrate on when you see your enemy, and when he sees you. Watch for patterns. Play a few games, and see how you fare.

, If somebody spots you, you're now engaged in what is referred to as a ""mind war"". For example, if you plant the bomb in Counter-Strike, the enemy will know your general location. You can either guard the bomb, strike while they're defusing, or run the map looking for the enemy. Do whichever feels right for who you're playing against. On the other hand, if you're playing the opposite team, think about where your opponent might be waiting or watching. Consider your opponent's options, actions, and common patterns (if you play the same people for a while). If your enemy did it once, he's sure to do something really similar at some point (more often than not).

, Learn to shoot when something moves. Throw a grenade if you can't see your enemy. Memorize a strong build order. Crouch-block sweep attacks, stand-block jumping attacks. As soon as you can do this without thinking, you'll be so much better already. Don't, however, practice a bad habit. As soon as you start doing a bad habit, practice alone, or do whatever it takes to get back on track. Bad habits develop fast.

, You won't get anywhere killing newbies all day. Learn it the hard way from the top dogs themselves. A lot of players online are good, and almost fifty percent of those players are total jerks. When you find a player who isn't a jerk and you get whooped, talk. Make friends, ask questions, get answers, and learn. Give them the occasional, ""Wow, where were you?"" or, ""How did you do that so fast?"". They're bound to share some tips with you.

, If you skip out for a few days, you're going to get rusty. Also, play in medium bursts, around two to three hours per session, two to three times a day. You would generally want five or more hours under your belt before bed. This ensures you don't overplay the game, which adds to stress and boredom, and that leads to quitting.

Put down your controller.,

Get physical exercise.,
Take deep breaths.",How to Get Over Anger Caused by Video Games1," You don’t want to break your video game controller in a fit of anger, so the best thing to do when you first notice you are feeling angry is to gently put your controller down. You may want to shut down your game system as well to remove the video game images and sounds from your environment.;
, You might show signs of anger in your body, even before you realize that you are feeling angry. Pay attention to how you are feeling physically. You might be headed toward an angry outburst if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:


Tense muscles and clenched jaw
Headache or stomachache
Increased heart rate
Sudden sweating or shaking
A dizzy feeling

, If you have become angry, you should take a break from playing the game. Distract yourself from the aspect(s) of the game that made you angry by doing something else for a little while. Taking time to cool down may allow you to return to the game with fresh eyes, and you may find yourself more successful upon returning to the game later.The next time you need a distraction from your frustration you can:


Call up a friend (or meet with one in person!)
Make yourself a meal or snack
Clean your room, the kitchen, or the bathroom

, Getting a change of scenery by going outside is a great way to calm yourself down in a hurry.To keep recurring anger under control, try to balance your video game time with some daily outdoor time., Exercise is another great way to help improve your mood.Getting physical exercise can make you feel happier in as little as five minutes.What you do for exercise does not matter. Just make sure that you raise your heart rate and your body should release some endorphins to make you feel better., Becoming angry can elevate your heart rate, cause you to shake, and make all of your muscles tense. You can counteract these effects with deep breathing. You can also use deep breathing along with meditation to help control your emotions.But using deep breathing techniques alone can offer benefits that are similar to meditation as well.To practice deep breathing, count to three as you inhale. Then, hold the breath in your lungs for three more seconds. Then, count to three again as you exhale. Try to focus only on the numbers as you do this.
Be sure that each breath in fully fills your lungs, causing your chest and belly to expand. Exhale fully each time, and pause between the exhale and the next inhale.
Keep breathing until you feel that you have regained control.

Remember why you play video games.,
Play a less violent video game.,
Consider that you may be frustrated by a lack of success.,
Block or avoid another player who is making you angry.,
Realize if outside factors are influencing your emotions.,
Put a game away if it constantly frustrates you.",How to Get Over Anger Caused by Video Games2," You probably play video games just because you enjoy playing. But if playing video games is causing you to have recurring anger, then you might not be enjoying yourself as much as you used to.


If you experience chronic anger as a result of the games you’re playing, think about taking on a new hobby to replace gaming for a while.
If you are not having fun, it’s not worth continuing your “relationship” with certain games.

, Playing (or even watching) violent video games may lead you to feel to increased feelings of anger and aggression, especially if you already have some anger issues.If you feel angry after playing or watching violent games, try switching to games that are not as violent.

, Not being able to get past a difficult level or obstacle in a game might also cause you to feel angry.Think about why you tend to get angry when you play and whether or not failing a level or getting killed in the game is what sets off you anger.


To deal with this type of anger, try playing a game that you have already mastered for a while and enjoy your success. Or, if you have the option to choose the difficulty in a game, try selecting a lower difficulty level to help prevent yourself from getting angry.

, If someone is trolling or harassing you on a MMO (massively multiplayer online) game, block or report the other player. It’s not worth engaging with someone who is just trying to get a rise out of you. Be sure that you are aware of the game’s community or user guidelines before reporting a player so that you are sure that they are acting inappropriately based on the MMO’s expectations.

, Sometimes you might feel anger (towards people or inanimate objects) when you are dealing with difficult problems in your life. If you find yourself getting angry about a video game (particularly if it is unusual for you to become angry), try to determine if other aspects of your life may be bothering you.


For example, if you have just lost your job or gotten in trouble at school, you may feel frustrated and out of control of your life. Failing to master a new level of a video game on top of the other experiences may lead you to blow up about the video game, even though it is not the primary cause of your feelings of powerlessness.

, This may not be what you want to hear, but if there is a particular game that causes you chronic anger—whether it is from violence in the game, an inability to master new levels, or even an annoying character—you may want to hide the game from yourself for a while or even consider trading it in a for a different game. It’s okay to put away a game for the sake of your emotional well-being.

Diagnose a video game addiction.,
Stay in control of your emotions.,
Ask for help if your anger turns violent.",How to Get Over Anger Caused by Video Games3," Video game addiction (internet gaming disorder) is not a formal diagnosis, but it is starting to get more attention.If video games or your reactions to them are beginning to seep into your everyday life, you may be experiencing a video game addiction. Addressing an addiction is important to maintain a healthy emotional life. You may have a video game addiction if you:


become angry, violent, or depressed when you do not spend time playing video gamesplay in secret and lie to others about how much time you spend playing video gamesnotice that video games have taken over your interest in other hobbies, schoolwork, or your jobconsider playing video games more important than spending time with other people in real life, You should be in control of your emotions; they should not control you. If you feel like your anger in response to video games has taken on a life of its own and you are no longer in control of it, then you should seek help with anger management. You may want to see a therapist or take an anger management course. It’s likely that your anger is not only in response to video games and is present (or will become present) in other areas of your life as well.

, You should seek help for anger management if your feelings of anger are causing you to feel violent towards others. You may want to seek help in the following situations:


You think about harming yourself or othersYou use physical violence (such as hitting) towards people or objectsThe problem is chronic, happening over and over againAnger towards the game seeps into other areas of your life
You have a record of violent or aggressive behaviors at work or towards a loved oneYou feel unfulfilled in your life"

Play against other people online.,
Practice and learn more and more about the game!",How to Get Better at Fighting Games," Many people enjoy Blazblue, King of Fighters, Tekken, Virtual Fighter, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, Street Fighter, and other such games. A lot of games, especially if they're of the same dimension (like, 2D fighters) they generally share a lot of similarities that can be applied.


Pick a fighting game that interests you and appeals to you so that you’ll be willing to play it and invest time into the game. Invest time into learning the game you chose.;
, If you aren't used to the controls, consider changing them to your liking so that you won’t have to look down at your control every time you want to execute a move, as these types of games require your entire focus on the screen.

, You'll have to play around with a few characters to find which one you're the most comfortable with.

, Learn what your character's good at, know which normal to use at each range, the recovery of each normal and it's usefulness and properties. Then move onto the special moves along with supers and how to apply them then, move onto combos.


Play the tutorial as soon as you decide which game you'd like to buy. Study what it will show you, including the basics of all fighting games and mechanics for that specific game. It’ll also show you some already built in combos for certain characters, depending on who’s being used in the tutorial.
Play the story mode once the tutorial is finished. Aim to figure out how those newly learned mechanics and combos can be used in actual gameplay against an opponent, the level of difficulty of the story/arcade mode can be picked at the users leisure, and comfort level. However, consider medium difficulty so that you have a challenge, but not so much that makes you not want to play the game.

, The Importance of blocking cannot be stressed enough! Always block as this is the easiest and most effective way to avoid taking large amounts of damage. Learn to recognize overheads (Moves that can hit players that are crouching and blocking) , patterns, sweeps (A normal move that knocks an opponent down, usually a cr. Roundhouse) and cross-ups (A mid-air attack that makes it more difficult for an opponent to determine whether they should block left or right).

, Movement is a really underrated aspect in fighting games. Try to learn about moves that can help your character zip across the screen (Zangief's Green Glove/Banishing Flat and Yang's command dash from Street Fighter IV). Some characters might have a 8 way air dash which is a very valuable asset (Dr. Doom/Magneto/C. Viper in UMVC3). Some characters might have really amazing forward dashes, and a crappy walk speed (Makoto from Street Fighter IV) and a character might have an insanely fast back dash (Rose from Street Fighter IV). Walkspeed is also a make or break for some characters as well. Point is, be mindful of your movement options.

, Start venturing out and play against your friends for competitions. Since you’ve beaten the story/arcade mode on the hardest difficulty, the artificial intelligence is no longer a challenge for you.

, It’s best that you play against other people because then you can see how well you do against another person and try to learn their tendencies and game plans and how you can adjust yours to win. If you can’t find people in person to play with, take your talents to the online circuit and battle with others in an online setting.


Playing against people online will help improve your skill at the game because it will require you to read your opponent and adapt to different situations since you’re going to be facing a multitude of opponents. Keep moving up as you battle more in the game until you can beat the tournaments.

, Nobody gets good at fighting games instantly. Learn how to use training mode effectively, frame data, play online mode and set up games with friends that main different characters and attend local tournaments

Study the terrain.,

Know your guns.,
Fix look speed depending on situation.,
Use cover and concealment.",How to Get More Kills in Shooting Games," You may be lost, but your opponents aren't. To avoid getting double-barreled in the back, learn the maps by playing alone. You'll not only memorize layouts and weapon locales, but also find hidden shortcuts. Picture your enemy's face when you snipe him through an open skylight.;
, Strafing - or sidestepping - is the best way to avoid getting a face full of metal in a close-quarters melee. But you need to vary your moves: Try two long side-to-side jumps followed by two short ones. The pattern is hard for opponents to figure out but easy for you to remember.

, Experiment with how different munitions work and how to use them effectively. Shooting a rocket into the ground near a foe will surely kill him, but you'll need to know the blast radius. And be creative: Grenades, for example, are often more than lethal weapons - they're sometimes used to flatten walls, move objects, and usually provide a good cover for a quick shot.

, Set your controller to track faster - in fact it needs to be much faster if you are a rush pray and spray kinda guy. Initially, you'll want to puke, but you'll also be able to turn quicker than your foes. When someone attacks you, you'll be able to whip around, splatter them across a wall, and continue on your way. However if you are using a sniper/rifle and sniping from a long distance you should turn down the speed so you can focus clearly on the target and not miss them when you accidentally go way past his head.

, If your enemies can see you, they can nail you. Do your best to stay out of sight and out of mind. Be sneaky. The person who sees and shoots at the opposition first usually wins - the person who lets themselves be seen and fired at usually loses.

Configure Wine.,
Install your Windows application(s).,
Run the installer.",How to Install Old PC Games on a New Computer2," Wine is a program that acts like a bridge between Windows and Linux, often described as a compatibility layer between the two.Using Wine, you can run an older version of your OS compatible with the game you want to play alongside your current OS. Your normal computer processes will continue as usual while you install your game with Wine.


Many users recommend using the Ubuntu package, which is built including a stable version of Wine.Check to make sure this suits your purposes before downloading; other packs might work better for your situation.

, You can find many outdated applications from your childhood online by means of a broad online search, or you can visit the Wine application database at appdb.winehq.org.


Always exercise caution when you download third party software online. Some may be harmful to your computer, or in some cases these files might be other than what is claimed., Depending on your goals and the OS you are using, you will need to find the appropriate packages needed to run a 32-bit/64-bit system.You can find a list of recommended packs on the FAQ page of wiki.winehq.org. Each pack is different; you will need to follow accompanying directions to compile your chosen package.


If you have chosen Ubuntu as your package, you will not need to compile Wine to run older Windows applications.

, Depending on the package, this process will vary. Follow the directions included with your download, or if you have downloaded the Ubuntu pack, access the applications menu and navigate through: Software & Updates → Other Software → Add. This should prompt a dialogue box, into which you should enter: ""ppa:ubuntu-wine/pp"". Now you can click ""Add Source"", enter a makeshift password (any will do), click ""Authenticate"" and then close the window., Now that you've authenticated and added your source, you should be prompted with a dialogue box asking you to reload.

, Now that you have your folder, you can configure wine by opening your terminal (also known as your command prompt, accessible by searching your computer for ""Command Prompt"") and typing ""winecfg"" followed by ↵ Enter. You should now see the Wine configuration window, under which you can find the ""Drives"" tab. Click it and select ""C:"". Using the browse feature, you will be able to find your ""Drive C"" folder and press ""OK"" once to accept and a second time to close the dialogue box., In your terminal, you will now be able to access and use the installer file for your application. Go to System → Preference → ""WineFile"". In the prompted window, navigate to the folder containing your application, where you will find your installer file., You can run the installer by double clicking, which should prompt a series of dialogue boxes that direct you through the installation process. The process should be similar to the way you install a new program in your current version of Windows. Once the application finishes installing, in the application folder you should find an executable file (a file that ends in "".exe""), which you will now be able to double click to run the application."

, Ignore the pop-up installer, selecting cancel to close the window, and instead right clicking the program, choosing ""Properties"" from the drop down menu.

, If you know the version of Windows that your application runs in, you can check the box labeled ""Run this program in compatibility mode for..."" and select the version of windows that suits your application.

Install the software and open the program.,
Mount the ISO to the virtual drive.,
Open the drive in Windows Explorer.,
Follow the setup prompts to install the game.",How to Install an ISO Game File on a Windows PC2," Earlier versions of Windows do not natively support disk mounting and require third party software to accomplish this task.Search online for terms such as “mount iso” or “virtual disk drive” and read reviews to determine the best software to use. Some software may be available for purchase or offer free versions.


Use caution when looking online for software. Reading reviews can help you obtain trustworthy software that won’t cause harm to your computer.
Some programs provide support for other ISO file types. If the file type is not supported, you can search online for conversion software to convert into a compatible file type.

, Run the setup program of the software you chose and follow the installation prompts to install the software on your computer. Once the program has been installed. Open the program from the Start Menu or from the desktop if there is an icon shortcut available.


The software will create a virtual drive that will appear as a regular drive on your computer. This can be specified as a CD, DVD or Blu-Ray disk. Make sure the drive matches the type of ISO you want to open.
The program may open, but not appear as a regular window. Check the system tray located on the taskbar to see if it is open there. The taskbar typically appears at the bottom of the screen.

, In the disk mounting software, you will see a list of virtual drives that are available to mount an ISO onto. The software may provide a cataloging system that you can add an ISO to. Right-click on the ISO in the program to “Mount” it onto a virtual disk drive. You can also mount the ISO onto the virtual disk drive directly by right clicking the virtual drive and choosing “Mount.”


You will need to browse for the ISO file on your computer. Once you mount the ISO to the drive, it will stay on the drive unless a different ISO is mounted or the ISO is unmounted from the drive.
You may be able to mount an ISO file from Windows Explorer by right-clicking on the ISO file then clicking on “Mount.”

, Your mounted ISO appears as a regular disk drive. Right-click on the disk drive, then click on “Open” to open the drive and double click on “Setup.exe,” “Install.exe” or “Autoexec.exe” to run the installer for the program. If you double-click on the drive, you may run the “autoexec.exe” program, if it is available, that may provide a guided shortcut to install the game.

, If the game requires the disk to be present for the game to run after installation, make sure the ISO is mounted in the virtual drive.

Patience is a virtue.,
Eve online has a 14-day trial period.,
Don't skip the tutorial.,
Leveling up is not similar to other online RPGs.,
It is best that you specialize in one skill, and continuously learning it up.,
Get a mentor if you can.,
Be psychologically prepared that you will eventually lose your ship.,
Being psychologically prepared to lose your Eve ship does not mean you can go reckless with your ship.,
Credit and ship management is very important.,
Most importantly, have fun.",How to Start a Game Like Eve Online," For the first few days, it can't be helped to feel being overwhelmed. Just stick with it, and be patient. Sooner or later you will get accustomed to the rules of space;
, Make use of this free time in understanding and exploring the game.

, In other online RPGs tutorials are dispensable; in Eve online they are mandatory. Eve online has a steep learning curve, made even steeper by skipping tutorials. As a bonus, you can gain a decent amount of money and get a better ship by doing the tutorial.

, Eve online has a different leveling structure. Learning skills are based on real-time, and not on experience gained or game-time like other online RPGs. Basically, you have to queue the skills you want to learn. These skills will finish learning even though you are not logged in, and doing other stuff such as work, sleep or school.

, Being a jack of trades is not advisable

, It can either be a trustworthy ally, a helpful Corporation or a friend. Getting help from an experienced player is invaluable especially during your early stages. It can save you a lot of time if someone teaches you, rather than figuring it out yourself. Remember that Eve online has a steeper learning curve compared to other online RPG, and you'll need all the help we can get.

, Maybe it will not happen today or tomorrow. But the truth is, it will eventually happen. It is simply the nature of the game.

, As a general rule, don't fly your ship to anywhere if you're not ready to lose it.

, Only risk losing a ship if you can replace it at least five times over.

, If you're not having fun with the game, then you are stressed out or you're playing the game in a wrong way.

Obtain the following for your Drake:


Shield Power Relay II x 4






Large Shield Extender II x 2






Set of two of each T2 shield resistance amplifiers (not shield hardeners, unless you are planning on experimenting with an active tank)






Core Defence Field Purger I x 3






Why two of each shield resistance amplifier?",How to Tank a Drake in EVE Online1," This tank will result in four free mid-slots for resistance amps or active hardeners. Most missions will have rats that dish out one or two damage types. Having four slots free lets you stack up to four resistance amps of a single damage type, or an air of resistance amps for two damage types.






With one of each damage type resistance amp installed, this tank will be prepared to handle, on average, 247/647 damage per second with no skills/all level V skills respectively.






For example, if you are running a mission against Serpentis, who deal Kinetic and Thermal damage only, and use a pair of Kinetic/Thermal resistance amplifiers, your Drake will be able to handle 388/1153 damage per second.






Since full level V skills would take years to complete, a moderately trained Caldari pilot with a mix of level V and level IV engineering skills should be able to handle about 900-1000 damage using a stacked pair of resistance amps.






Using this strategy, your passively tanked Drake should be able to breeze through level IV missions assuming you're careful. Level III missions will be a walk in the park.

",How to Get Easy Neopoints,";
, The games i find most rewarding are the sponsor(ad) games. They are simple and easy but can give 1000 or more NP in under 3 mins. A few are my favourite games are fashion fever(just click randomise character, end game and send score to get 300 neopoints - 900 a day!), Ice cream machine ( type in strawberry vanilla chocolate to get a free life!) and turmac roll (slow down your turmac by clicking the left arrow so that you can have more time to react!).

, Your dailies are in the games room under luck and chance (they are mostly wheels for you to spin). They are cheap to play and can send you off with great rewards. There are also such things as the tombola, Coltzan's shine (available every 2 hours of the day in the lost desert), the fruit machine, the Snowager, Free jelly and free omelet( at tyrannian plateau).

",How to Make a Webkinz School," Will it be fifth graders or generally lower school? A general group may be better if you own fewer Webkinz or if they have drastically different ages. A specific grade is good if you are teaching a small class. A grade one or two years younger than yours will be easiest to teach.;
, You could teach a class, but you could also have one of your older 'Kinz be a teacher.


You could also have an assistant teacher, especially for lower grades. She can grade papers and do general classroom tasks while the teacher teaches. This is great if both you and your friend want to be the teacher!
Designate substitute teachers as well. If you teacher is sick or takes a personal day (in other words, you lost her) she can step in to teach!

, A larger class will be harder to move around for field trips, but a smaller class may not be able to do some activities. Four to six Webkinz is a good class size.

, If it specializes in one thing, such as singing or medicine, reference that in the title if you like.

, You can collect things such as mini chalkboards/whiteboards, mini journals, pencil and colored pencil stubs, and boxes for desks. If you don't want to round this all up, you could buy a mini school kit to get you started.

, Some trades are free, and usually include jelly or omelettes. Always try to get these by simply offering a junk item and a few Neopoints!

, You can sell freebies you get to make money. When pricing items, use the Shop Wizard and refresh a few times. Then, price your items 1NP lower then the lowest price.

, Playing games is the fastest way to make money, especially if you're good. Play Fashion Fever three times each day to get 900 NP.

, When doing this, choose the Cockroach Towers hotel, no extras (they don't do anything for your pet) and 28 nights, so your pet will be fed for 28 days for only 140 NP.

, If you just started playing Neopets, you should be eligible to get a ""Newbie Pack"", there's a link to get your Newbie Pack on that page if you haven't got your Newbie pack yet. The Newbie Pack includes some basic color Paint Brushes (you cannot trade or sell these Paint Brushes), and Potatoes.There are two ways to get to your inventory.


If you're on the Neopets homepage, hover over the image ""shops"" and click Neopia Central. Now, you will see a bunch of links. Click the link that says ""Inventory"".






Another way to do this is to look on the top right corner and click on your Neopoints. Now, you should be on a page where it says ""Your Items"" (it's written in bold).







, So now you know where to look when you want to go to your inventory. You can feed your Neopet from your inventory, If you have food, that is. The Newbie Pack also comes with some Potatoes, which you can feed to your Neopet (if your pet isn't stuffed already!) So, once you got your Newbie Pack, go ahead and try to feed your Neopet by clicking on the picture of the food you want to feed it. . You can buy fish very inexpensively and many pets will be glad to eat these.

, You may be wondering, how in the world do I entertain my Neopet? Well, there's many, many ways to keep your Neopet busy! Here are some things you may consider for your Neopet:


Get a Petpet - I prefer getting your little friend a Petpet because first of all...Petpets will FOR SURE keep your Neopets entertained! Plus, with a Petpet you get to go to the Symol hole, and if your looking for a Petpet you can just use the Shop Wizard or simply look on trades for one.







Get a toy, or toys Get a bunch, or just one toy! Toys are the best things to keep your Neopet busy, but be careful, some Neopets don't like certain kinds of toys! So I recommend you should try not getting expensive toys for your Neopet unless you know for SURE that your Neopet will like the toy, and is not scared of it!







Go on Tours Yes! You can even take your Neopet on a tour! The most famous, popular tour around is the ""Tiki Tour"". To go on a Tiki Tour, go to Mystery Island! It only costs 50 NP (neopoints) to go on a tour (and plus, you get an avatar at the end of the tour too!) so it's worth to go on one! Plus, your Neopet will just LOVE seeing the fabulous views of Mystery Island.

Decide what pet you would like and which pet you would like to trade.,
Find out if your dream pet is a reasonable trade with the pet you wish to trade.,
Advertise your trade on the Pound Board.,
Do not take the first offer - unless it's exactly what you are looking for!,
If you are having problems finding a suitable trade you may want to go through the first steps again.,
If you are still having problems then perhaps put a note in your siggy (useful if you post on the boards a lot) or your lookup saying that your pet is up for trade and what you are looking for.

,
When you find a trade you like you must use the user-to-user transfer system in the pound.",How to Trade Your Neopet,";
, For example you are not going to be able to trade a Christmas Zafara for a Mara Shoyru! Check if the paintbrush used on your current pet is within the same price range as your dream pet, consider whether you would be willing to take a badly named pet and whether your own pets name is a good one or not. A good pet name is short, pronounceable and has no underscores or numbers. Very few people trade for badly named pets.

, The Pound Board is the only place you should make topics about wanting to trade your pet. Anywhere else will be considered spam. The Pound Board is a very fast moving board. You will have to keep bumping your board and be patient.

, Don't be afraid to say no to people - they will not (usually) be offended.

, Are you being realistic on your expectations?

,, You must not simply use the pound option as this means you are likely to lose your pet - if you put a pet in the pound anyone can adopt it and there is no guarantee your intended trader will receive it.

",How to Restock on Neopets," It is recommended that beginners go to shops such as the Food Shop or the Book Shop.;
, You can watch the shop as it restocks for a while, or look it up with a search engine.

, In the shop, they will sell for a set price, usually higher than you can actually get for them in the user marketplace. Some items, like certain neggs or chia pops, will sell in shops for a few hundred to several thousand neopoints below what you can get for them from other users, while rare items such as morphing potions will fetch up to a few MILLION more points than you spend on them. (Note that the higher the profit, the more likely it is that someone else will get to it first.) You can check out how much an item is worth to users by using the Shop Wizard. If it doesn't show up there, it might be too expensive. Try searching it in auctions and at the trading post.

, If there is, move on to the next step. If not, just wait a bit and refresh a little. Do not constantly refresh, or Neopets will ban you from restocking. If you are unsure if you are banned from restocking, go to the Tiki Tack. That shop is never empty. If there is nothing for sale, you are for sure banned from restocking.

, It should go without saying that you only want to buy the items you will make a profit on.

, Now you have to haggle. It will give you a price that the shop keeper wants at least for the item. Haggle around 50 Neopoints below the price they want. If they don't accept the offer, keep haggling.

, Put it into your shop, and price it slightly below the lowest prices you see on the shop wizard, to ensure it sells, or if it is in a price range of a million or more, put it on the trading post or up for auction.

, This is the key to having people buy from you. Get the link to your shop, and post it onto the boards under shop ads.

, If you go to school/work in the day, choose one that isn't necessarily your own, because the factory and shop only work from 9AM to 5PM; do the math and figure out when you'll be at home the most. If you're on holiday, just choose the correct time zone seeing as you will likely be there during the day.

, This will cost 2700 NPs, so you are left with 46,730 NPs to spend.

, It is impossible to say the correct things to buy, as the price of plushies is determined by the Supply and Demand, but this is ever changing: however, it is generally best to start off with plushies that uses 3-4 rolls of green cloth, neocotton, rare gems and paper bags. See 'tips' for a guide as to what plushies need what materials. Work out whether it is worth buying everything, or waiting for prices to change: Add up the cost to make 1 job of a 4 roll plushie (4 green cloths + 1 neo cotton + 1 rare gem + 1 paper bag):


If the cost is more than 3,900NP: Do nothing, wait for prices to change.
If the cost is less than 3,900NP: Start with 6 jobs.
If the cost is less than 2,900NP: Start with 8 jobs.
If the cost is less than 1,800NP: Start with 10 jobs.


, Look at how many you can start with: if you are making 8 jobs, buy 8 paper bags, 8 rare gems (buy for the plushies you plan to build), and 8 stuffing. You also need to buy green cloth.


If you want to make only plushies that need 4 rolls of cloth you will need to buy 4x6=24 green cloth.
With only plushies that need 3 rolls, you have to buy 3x6=18 green cloth.


, Now that you have everything you need, go to your factory and click 'start job'. Make sure to make 100 jobs. The rest of the procedure explains itself. Expand your factory until it can fit all 6/8/10 of your jobs in.

, Go to your factory, click 'personnel' then 'hire workers'. Never, ever, use dropouts as they are useless! A ratio of 250 workers to 25 managers is usually about right (there is one manager who you cannot get rid of, so that means hiring 24 managers to make 25). The easiest way is to start with 250 trainees as they work fairly well. Don't worry too much about the cost as this is only for one update, then you can fire them all, except that one manager. After that one update has passed (updates are one minute past every hour from 10AM to 5PM) return to your factory and fire all your workers. Do not worry if all the jobs aren't finished, just leave them.

, Your plushies should now be loading. Once they are finished loading (this can take a few hours, but it will work 24/7 so you do not need to worry about getting it done before the end of the day) tick the check box next to them and ship them off.

, After 5 minutes the plushies should now be in your shop. However, they aren't going to be selling at more than about 1 or 2 plushies per job per hour, and you'll never make a profit that way! Upgrade your store and get some advertisements: buy 3 levels each of the 3 cheapest upgrades (carpet-standard carpet, lighting-gas lanterns and store security-anti-theft tags), plus 3 levels each of the cheapest 4 adverts (Flyers-stickers, gifts-dry erase boards, candy-jelly beans and clothing-t shirts). This will cost you 8736 NPs altogether; if you are left with over 1,000NP left, buy a few more ups and ads, starting with maxing out the cheapest one, and you can work your way up from there. However, always keep at least 1k on hand, or else you can't pay your permanent manager and you will lose the game. Your plushies will only sell at the updates (one minute past each hour) so don't expect a huge rush the minute you stock up.

, Once all of your plushies from a job are sold, you receive the neopoints, and once again you have some cash. Continue upgrading and advertising your shop, expanding your warehouse and factory, and start using better materials. Better materials means more expensive, so make sure you have a reasonable amount before you start using velvet bags and red cloth, or else you will go bankrupt, lose the game, and all your hard work will have been for nothing!

, An elite guild? A literate guild? Think it through. Remember, certain types attract certain people. Do your research.

, Make sure it is related to the theme, and also, make sure it is unique. Don't be afraid to make up your own words, and shy away from using too many symbols in the guild name.

, Make a board on the guild boards saying you want to create a guild. Be unique! Think about this: 'Why is my guild original?'. If you know HTML/CSS or know how to make graphics, you'll have a better chance finding people to help you create a guild. No one wants to do all the work. If you don't know HTMl/CSS or graphic making there are many guides around Neopia and on the Internet. Go on the help boards and ask for a guide.

, A lot of guilds rush to finish their guild, when really, there is no need rush. Take time thinking through ideas with the owners and prejoiners; odds are they'll have some good ideas. Don't take too long, however. A week or less should be sufficient.

, Don't copy other big guilds, it'll just end up backfiring on you. Remember, the best guilds are the ones that are unique.

, Offer rewards to your members to advertise, maybe promise them a higher rank if they refer a certain number of people. Have an attractive advertisement, but keep it simple.

, People love it when you stay and chat with them; it scores your guild Brownie points.

, Listen to your member's requests, complaints, and questions. Be friendly, and get to know each of your members individually. Even if your guild board is fast, review all posts to make sure no one is left out.


The worst thing to do is to ignore a newbie member. They are trying to develop friendships, because usually the don't know most of the people in the guild. Act like their friend already when you meet them. Don't just post a short, choppy message, like ""Hi. Thanks 4 joining."" or something unfriendly like, ""Follow all the rules, if you don't you'll be banned, if you have a problem with the rules, I couldn't care less, go join some other guild."" Be friendly and post something like,""Hi there! I'm really glad you're in the guild, if you ever need someone to talk to, neomail me!"".

, The more activities you have the better! And don't be bland, make up your own activities that are fun and original. An avatar lending program, adoption center, guild mall, petpet adoption center.. the list is endless! Make sure you don't break the rules! Things like guild raffles, bashes, etc. are breaking the rules.

Turmac Roll Send your score when it's anything over 250. Also, if you slow your turmac down to almost a stand still, (press the left arrow) you will have a higher chance of getting a rare berry that will get you more points.

Fashion Fever You don't have to actually dress up the pets to get the points. Simply start the game and click the end button right away. Easy 300 points each time, for a total of 900 Neopoints. If you send the neo pet picture to your e-mail, you get 100 Neopoints. You can do this three times to a total of 1200 Neopoints.

Bouncy Supreme Send your score when it's above 1200 and you will get 1000 Neopoints. 1000 is the highest you can get on this game, in one day, you can quickly rake in 3000 Neopoints.

Sutek's Tomb Type in pyramibread as many times as you would like to see the next possible move.

Meerca Chase If you play on hard, you will get more points, and with time and practice, you will get used to the speed. If you really want a challenge (and attempt to get extra points) type in superextrahypergravity mode for a funnel type game, and ferociousneggsareontheloose for a game with ferocious neggs that chase you instead of the traditional red neggs.

Ice Cream Machine if you type in strawberry, vanilla, or chocolate, you will get an extra life.

Typing Terror If you're at least decent at typing, you could easily earn 1000 Neopoints from getting 2700-3000 points in the game.

AdverVideo Watch up to 5 advertisements for free Neopoints. Earn up to 800 points per video.
Sponsored games are usually easy.
Playing the featured game earns you double the payout for that game.;
, Some dailies are better than others, but if you play them enough, you may get lucky.

, A good amount is around 10,000.

, Learn how to restock. You can sell any item in your inventory that you don't need. Use the Shop Wizard to price your items fairly.

, Look for items priced 500-1000 Neopoints below the market price, then wait until they have almost expired and bid 100-200 points up on them. Then you can put the item in your shop or re-auction it.

, If you find items with an increment of at least 500, bid enough on it that you are making a profit if you resell it, but if anyone else bids they will have to pay over market value. This is a good way to ensure you win rare items and typically works better once you already have a few hundred thousand Neopoints and can bid on high-value items with increments of 10000 or more.

, This is crucial to making loads of Neopoints. Go to a main shop and continue to refresh until a rare item comes up.With practice, you could be buying ten items a day that will wield at least 5,000 in profit. If you snag a rare item from Kauvara's Magic Shop, you may even get millions in profit. Make sure that you always keep 30-50k Neopoints on hand if you plan on buying a lot.

, Find a valuable item (codestones work at lower price ranges, paintbrushes at higher price ranges) and repeatedly search for it. Often a newbie player will only put a valuable item up for its suggested worth or what they think it is worth from its purpose, which is often far below its actual value. You can get codestones for 2500-10000 below their actual value or a paintbrush for several tens of thousands below. However; this is a very rare occurrence. You would probably be better off investing that time in one of the options above.

, There really isn't much difference between them, so this is just a personal preference.

, Professor Milton Clodbottle will guide you through this.

, Once you have a nest, a house, and a storage, spend your remaining resources on the cheapest decorations, the Mossy Twig. These will prove useful later on.

, All your structures should be placed so that there is a space 2 blocks away from the structure where it can be accessed.

, All jobs of P3s can perform the task of building, so while there is nothing else to be done, put them all on building the structures.

, This will prevent them from being damaged by pests, and in the case of the storage, allow your P3s to harvest faster. Be sure that there is a space on the other side of the decoration that is empty.

, Place your workers and nesters next to the resources to harvest them. The best resources to harvest are stone, wood, and mud.

, This will allow you to create eggs, which can then be discarded or hatched into another P3 of the same species as the nester. To do this, drag a nester onto a finished nest.


Once the progress bar below the nest has been filled, drag the nester off the nest and back to the resources with the workers and other nesters. Then, click on the egg. In the status it should show you the species and job of the P3, have a button to discard, and a button to hatch. Discarding will yield 200XP while hatching will yield 30XP and a new P3.

, Pests will appear randomly while the Habitarium is running, and will attack P3s, decay structures, and decay resources. Your soldiers should automatically walk to the pests to fight them, although you can speed up the pursuit by dragging them next to the pest. All jobs can fight, but soldiers are the best for defending.


When a pest is defeated, they drop a gem. Click it for 30XP.







, As you gain resources or gain more capacity, buy structures and hatch more P3s to maximize your XP.

, If you haven't logged in for several months, Neopets will ask you for your birthdate.Try your real one first. You only get 3 guesses, so don't guess randomly yet.

, If you friended someone on Neopets who still has access to his account, ask him to log in. He can view your account's profile and look for the Age entry, which is based on the birthday you entered.Use this to figure out the year of your birthday. You're down to 365 guesses (plus one if it was a leap year), but if you're lucky you used your real birthday month and day. Try that first.


For example, you view your profile on September 1, 2015, and it says you are 20 years old. Your birthday must be between September 1, 1994 and October 31, 1995.
Only friends can see your age. You cannot make a new account and try to friend your original one, since your original account needs to accept the invitation.

, Many people didn't enter their real birthdate, either to avoid spreading personal information or to avoid asking parents for permission. You only have 3 birthday guesses per day, so make them count:


Try January 1, 1900. (An obvious fake option if you were pretending to be over 18.)
Try the birthdays of friends and family members.

, Visit Neopets help and click ""Create a ticket."" You will need to log in to Neopets, but you can easily create a new account and use it to contact customer support. Include the following information, or as much of it as you can remember:


User name of the account you can't access
Summary of your problem: how long it's been since you accessed your account
Email addresses that might be linked to the account. State which ones you have access to and which ones you do not.
Your real birthday
Whether or not you've purchased Neocash (spent real money)
(if remembered) names of your Neofriends, items in your closet or equipped to your pet

, You'll usually get an email within a few days, but it can take a month or longer if you're unlucky. Sending a new ticket will not speed up the response. Once they respond, here are the most common next steps:


If they ask for information about the account, answer their questions as thoroughly as you can. They might ask for the names of items in your safety deposit box, what you spend Neocash on, major trades/auctions, or any warnings you received.These are all designed to verify that you are really the account owner. If they're satisfied, they will send you the correct birthday and password.
If your old account was frozen, follow their instructions to fill out a new ticket requesting that the account be reactivated. You will need to include as much info about your account as possible.
If your account has been inactive for many years, it may have been deleted (even if the profile page is still visible). There's nothing you can do if this happened."

99% of famous people on Neopets are famous because someone (or the majority) dislikes them - examples Kaleena, Sam, Salena, Mandi, Curse etc.,
Go on the Neoboards often.,
There is a small minority who achieve a more dignified (and lasting) kind of fame through their pet pages.,
Screenie pages have become a popular way of becoming 'neo-famous' as they are easy to make.,
Another way to become famous is by making a lot of Neopoints.,
Battledomers and Help Chat are especially close knit communities and members of these groups are most likely to know each other by name.,
Yet another way to become famous is to own a popular guild.,
Neopia is full of half-finished, abandoned guilds.

",How to Get Famous on Neopets," This is usually done by spamming, arguing or clearly not being who you claim to be. Then you will probably be the spur of the Neoboards.;
, You will eventually be recognized, thus making you famous. The user Furiously is a good example of this.

, People who run guides or make graphics will always be popular.

, However it can be hard to be original and funny as there are so many out there.

, To do this, play a lot of games and do your dailies. This step will take time and patience.

, If you want to go where everyone knows your name then establish yourself in one of these areas. However as Help Chatters are sticklers for rules and Battledomers are experts in their own area you will need to do a lot of research and hard work to keep up. Also, the Help Chat tends to have an in-crowd, if you get in with them you would be automatically famous but if they dislike you, it will be almost impossible to become famous on the HC. A good way to become famous on the BC is play the BD a lot, and share your tips with everyone.

, Now this step will need time, effort, and energy as well as perseverance. Stick to it!

Selection Tool - The selection tool is helpful as it has the ability to select objects, entities, and so on (hence the name). Pretty much self-explanatory.
Magnify Tool-- Once again; another self-explanatory tool. The Magnify Tool isn't important. Using the mouse wheel while using the Camera tool zooms in and out just as much as this tool does.
Camera Tool-- This tool is helpful as it allows the mapper to get a 3D perspective of his map (You can change between what the Camera tool renders in the View menu bar.) Left click to alter where the camera is facing, and right click to strafe the camera. If you look at one of your 3 grids while using the Cam tool, you can left click then drag the mouse to set a perspective point.
Entity Tool-- One of the most important tools; the Entity Tool allows you to place entities such as info_player_start ~ player spawns. To access the list of entities, when you click on the Entity Tool, a list on the lower right side of your Hammer should say ""Categories: Entities"" click on the drop down menu below that and you'll find a list of entities to spawn. Most commonly used are info_player_start, light, light_environment, prop_physics, etc.
Block Creation Tool-- The BC Tool is the most important tool in Hammer, as it is what allows you to create your maps. It is used to create the 'hull' of the map.
Texture Application Tool-- This tool is useful because it lets you target a texture on a surface rather than the entire object's texture. You can also replace textures, rotate, and scale them. The 'Displacement' tool is used for making hills and such.
Apply Texture Tool-- Self-explanatory- it just changes anything you've selected with whatever texture you currently have in your upper right texture menu.
Apply Decals Tool--This tool is for applying decals, which is semi-important. Decals help 'beautify' a map (posters, spray paint, etc). To use it, click on the selection tool and then click on the Apply Decals tool, then while looking at a wall you want to apply a decal to, click on it in the 3D render window and it should pop up on that wall.
Apply Overlay Tool-- I have never used this tool so its *obviously* not very important. It takes the same overlay features (texture application features) and applies them to the selected surface.
Clipping Tool-- This tool is one of the two coolest tools. The clipping tool allows you to clip walls and ultimately make them not rectangles at all as how they were spawned. It's really sweet. You should try it.
Vertex Manipulation Tool-- Here's the second sweetest tool. You need something done; the Vertex Manipulation tool can do it for you. It allows you to manipulate vertexes.

Fashion Fever - Gives 300 neopoints each time you send a score. Send a postcard 3 times to an email address for 100 neopoints each before you submit the last game.
Fruit Machine- This is a chance game. You will win prizes or money, or get nothing. However, it is free to play, so you can't lose!
The Tombola - Located on Mystery Island, the Tombola is a free game similar to the Fruit Machine. Although players usually win nothing, some receive money or a random item.
Meerca Chase - A very enjoyable game, playing Meerca Chase is an easy way to earn some extra neopoints.
Wheel of Slime (AD)- This wheel gives only neopoint prizes. You can spin this wheel every 8 hours.
The featured game - The featured game changes daily, but you will receive 2x the amount of Neopoints for playing than you normally would.
AdverVideo - You can get free Neopoints from watching ads.;
, Most are free, and you are always guaranteed to get something, whether it be Neopoints, food, or any other item. Some things you might get can be sold for many Neopoints.

, Invest in companies by buying stocks. This is in the games section. Buy your stocks when the prices are low, sell the stocks when the prices are high.

, Spinning the wheel of excitement, wheel of knowledge, etc. are fun, but if you are wanting to be rich, save your money. Don't waste it on a little worthless prize.

, The more money you put in, the more interest you can collect each day. Try to resist taking money out of your account to spend it on a high-price item. At least for a while, try to avoid spending what you've put in the bank. Keep about 5,000 Neopoints out on hand to avoid spending on things you may regret buying.

, Buy low priced items (it doesn't matter which items) And sell them for higher. Be be careful! No Neopets user wants to buy an overpriced item.

, After a while, you will receive good prizes that can be sold for a lot.

Avoid common ""traps"".,
Know some basic terminology of TTT.,
Don't suppose everybody on your scoreboard is alive.,
Lastly, look out for plugins.,
Do everything exactly like how you play innocent, except kill other innocents.,
Use stealth to your advantage, and punish the innocents' mistakes!,
Use the traitor talk and group up on people.,
Pick your equipment wisely.,
Use grenades.",How to Be Good at TTT (Trouble in Terrorist's Town)," This will tell you the basic what to do and what not to do's of TTT, as well as some help for whenever you play and you have no idea what you're doing.

, This requires SOME basic knowledge of Counter-Strike: Source weapons, but familiarize yourself with the guns that lie around that you can pick up to help you in your traitor (or innocent) vanquishing quest. Don't pick up a shotgun if you're a sniper, and don't pick up a rifle if you're ""godly"" with a Mac10. I personally recommend getting used to at least two guns in case you don't get a desired weapon at the beginning of the round, you can still be good with another one.

, Buddy up with some guy on the server if you feel the need to, just make sure you make it known you're buddying with them, because it's often considered suspicious to follow somebody around a map on TTT, and, in a lot of servers, traitorous. Also be careful with who you pick. They might seem nice and wait until you walk into a room completely obscured from the other players to kill you, then walk away for your body to... well, be found. The only time you don't have to doubt this is if you're a traitor, because, of course, traitors only have to worry about innocent bodies being found!

, The difference between suspicion versus innocence is a pretty thin line. People will suspect you if you're...


Shooting the air, since nobody can tell if you're shooting somebody or just a wall.
Walking away from (or by) an unidentified body. Like the last tip, nobody can tell if you killed them or not except for detectives who have DNA scanners.
Being the last person a corpse saw. This can lead to a lot of innocent deaths, since traitors can sometimes wait until somebody's looking at another person, then kill them somehow.
Shooting explosive barrels near players. This is very borderline traitorous, as explosive barrels obviously harm players.
Having the murder weapon after finding a corpse, because most people can assume you killed them.
Calling out somebody who turns out to be innocent. This is also borderline traitorous seeing as traitors will yell that out sometimes on their microphone and stop talking to make it seem as if they're dead.
Shooting NEAR other players. This is pretty obvious as to why it's suspicious.

, Some maps have traitor traps which can (bodily) harm innocents if they trigger it. An example is on ttt_minecraft_b4, where a minecart filled with TNT will head down a set track on the ground. Anybody standing in front of or by it when it comes towards them will be killed by an explosion.

,


""RDM"" means Random DeathMatch. This is when a player randomly kills somebody without evidence they are an enemy.
""KoS"" means Kill on Sight. This means that person is probably a traitor, and is often used by dying victims with microphones. ""Oh no, KOS Johnman843!""
""Suspect "" means to mark them as Suspicious by pushing TAB (or your scoreboard bind), clicking that person's name, and then clicking ""Suspicious"". The next time you see them in your crosshairs, their name will show ""Suspicious"" under it.
""ID that body!"" means to identify any nearby bodies. This often isn't used in a polite fashion so usually it's more of a suspect callout, due to the fact that they may have ran by a body and forgot to ID it.

, Traitors don't have to ID bodies; that's the only way you know if your friend is dead or not.

, These aren't always necessarily bad things, but it's still a good idea to see which ones don't and do have certain addons.

, If you use the mic as innocent, use it as traitor, etcetera;;
, Don't expect to get far by running in with an M16 and shooting anything that moves. If you see an innocent by himself, go for him instead of the group (unless you have C4.)

, You can kill more innocents as a group.

, If the map is small, don't pick buy a sniper, as it will be a waste of credits. Likewise, if it is huge, C4 isn't your best friend.

, There are usually 3 types of grenades on most servers. There are Incendiary, Smoke, and Discombobulators. Use incendiary grenades to hurt a group of people that are bunched up. This will give you and your T-buddies a HUGE advantage. Alternatively, use them to block people off from an area. If people are in a room with a C4 in it, block off the most commonly used exit. Next, use smoke grenades to hide yourself or to escape from a dangerous situation. You can also use it on a group of people to obscure their sight, then kill them off. Finally, use discombobulators to push people away from each other. They WILL be scattered and separated or, if you're lucky, they will fall off of a tall cliff and either die or survive with a little amount of health.

Open the Spawn Menu of Gmod by pressing and holding the Q button. In this menu, you should see an extensive list of props that can be used in this game.Browse your available props until you find a chassis that will suit your purposes.
If you spawn a prop you have decided will not work for your vehicle, you can hover your cursor over the prop you wish removed, opening the context menu by pressing C, and selecting ""Remove"" from the drop-down menu.;
, You will need at least four wheels for making your car, but once you've become more comfortable with the physics behind car creation in Gmod, you may want to add more to your design.


Look through your wheel choices by opening your Spawn Menu. Press Q, and from list that appears, choose the ""Tools"" option. Under the ""Construction"" heading in Tools, you should find the ""Wheel"" option.Select this to look through potential wheels you might use.
Spawning causes your wheels to weld in place, either to the ground or the object the wheels have been spawned against.You may want to wait until assembling your vehicle before spawning your wheels.
In the event that your wheels don't work for your situation, keep in mind you can alter the wheel model in the context menu by hovering your mouse over the part, holding C, and selecting ""Model"" from the dropdown menu., Your thrusters will give your vehicle the forward and backward force that you'll need to move.You will also need thrusters to steer your vehicle. Open your Spawn Menu by pressing Q, open ""Tools"" from the Spawn Menu, and look under the ""Construction"" heading for a list of potential thrusters.Spawning your thruster will also cause it to affix either to the ground or an adjoining prop.You may want to wait until you begin assembling your vehicle before spawning your thrusters.

, This step is optional, but if you want your vehicle to look like an authentic car, you'll need a chair in which to sit. You can find a list of potential chairs in your Spawn Menu by pressing Q and looking under the ""Vehicles"" tab.

, You will need to use your Physics Gun, which should be your default Gmod manipulator, and left-click your chassis to pick it up. While you are holding your chassis in the air, right-click your mouse to freeze the object in mid-air.Having your chassis suspended in the air will make it easier for you to attach wheels and will keep it from sliding or moving.

, Go into your Spawn Menu by pressing Q, and locate the ""Tools"" option. Here you will find several categories; select the heading labeled ""Construction."" In the list of construction materials, you will find a ""Wheel"" category. Choose the wheel you have decided upon to activate your wheel attachment gun.


Aim your wheel gun at the corners of your chassis. You should see a translucent wheel appear where your gun is aimed. To attach the wheel, shoot your wheel gun by left-clicking and your wheel should attach to your chassis.

, When you approach your wheel with your in-game character, you will be able to adjust the wheel settings by pressing and holding C and entering your context menu. These variables can be adjusted to your preference, but your torque should be about 2/3's your friction.


The friction rating of your wheels will influence your car's sturdiness, and higher wheel torque will give your car more speed. Setting your friction too high may affect your car's top speed.
Keep your ""Force Lift"" set to zero, or your wheel may fall off.

, In your context menu (accessible by pressing C while hovering your cursor over the part) you should see the ""Keypad"" option. Use this to set a numpad value that you can use to control the spin of your wheels. Many players default to:


Right side wheels:

Front spin: 9
Back spin: 6


Left side wheels:

Front spin: 7
Back spin: 4



, The rest of your parts will have to be added to the body of your car directly, so using your physics gun, left-click your chassis and then release your left-click to unfreeze your vehicle so it can fall to the ground.You may need to refreeze your chassis by left-clicking with your Physics Gun to hold it in place and right-clicking to freeze it. If you are not on level ground your car may start rolling away.

, Thrusters can be found in your tools menu, which you find in your Spawn Menu by pressing and holding Q. Under tools there will be a heading labeled ""Construction,"" and under this you will find ""Thrusters.""


Selecting your thruster will equip you with the thruster attachment gun. You can attach your thrusters by left-clicking while hovering your cursor over the part of your chassis to which you wish to attach them.
You can use your thrusters to control turning by placing one on each side of your vehicle. You may have to experiment with positioning, as an improperly placed thruster might cause your vehicle to flip.
After attaching your thrusters, you will need to set keys to activate these parts. Do so by hovering the part with your cursor, holding C to open the context menus, and selecting the ""Keypad"" option.Consider the following key-binds for your thrusters:

Right thruster:

Forward: →

Reverse: ←



Left thruster:

Forward: ↑

Reverse: ↓






, Depending on the weight of your chassis, your vehicle might require a lot of force or only a little. Too much force will make your vehicle difficult to maneuver, but too little force (or a high friction setting for your wheels) will severely limit your speed.


Access the context menu to set the force of your thruster by hovering over the part with your cursor and holding C. Select ""Force"" from the following dropdown menu and adjust to your preference., Seats can be found under the ""Vehicle"" category of your Spawn menu (accessible by holding Q). Once you have selected your chair, left-click to spawn it in a place of your choosing on your chassis.


You will need to go into the ""Tools"" section of your Spawn Menu and select the ""Weld"" option. This will equip you with a gun that, by left-clicking, you can use to attach your chair to your chassis., If you have refrozen your vehicle due to uneven terrain, you will have to unfreeze it before you are able to give it a test drive. After you have verified that all the moving parts work correctly, you can continue to add to your car, or enjoy it as is.

, If you are creating a door that only you can open, set it against a wall so it's straight up and maybe move it into a corner to set it straight. You can also hold 'E' and press shift. This will cause the prop to align with a major axis, like straight up and down, or flat.

, Some things you might want are doors that open with elastics and thrusters, so you would set the thrusters to a middle-thrust and the elastics to max strength, then when you press the thruster button it opens, but smacks shut killing anything in the way.

, The materials tool is really useful for giving it the final touches that make it look desirable. It also helps it to not look like a blast door in the middle of the map, but a cool looking force-field type door.

, This may include things such as using breakables to auto-shut the door. This is done if the door somehow flips over and is stuck in the roof or something, set the door to a bottle with an elastic. When the bottle breaks, the elastic disappears and the door will try to auto-correct itself.

, If you are happy with the size and height glue them down.

, Glue around the sides of the hill and apply the tissue paper and glue over the top (watered down PVA glue is best for this) you want to cover all the side so you can’t tell its corrugated cardboard underneath. To make it more realistic (well as realistic a cardboard hill can be) don’t do it all the same put bumps and clumps in random places.

,, Paint the whole thing what colours you feel to make it as life like as possible normally I would do an undercoat of dark green and dry brush with a brown so it sticks to the tops of the sand and throw in some light greens for shading.

, You have a hill with a flat surface to put your archers/warmachines on to rain terror on the battlefield and it didn't cost you much, in fact if your lucky you can do it with stuff laying around the house/outbuildings so a nice hill that costs nothing.

Always keep your followers working.,
When you zoom out of your planet, click on the little planet with the words 'Free Gold' on it any time you see it.,

Limit your spending.",How to Make a Lot of Gold in Godfinger," They will bring you the most gold. If you don't play too often, invest in a building that takes a lot of hours for your followers to build up gold, so that when you come back, you'll be showered with tons of gold! Make sure that all of your followers have 100% energy so that they can keep working for long amounts of time. And never forget; go on once you are notified, as you don't want all that hard-earned gold to become spoiled!;
, By just clicking the ad, you can earn 25 gold. Most of the time, it will exit you out of the game and into the App Store or Safari (unless you click the 'Done' button quick enough), but you can always go back to the game and your gold will be there.

, Get your friends to play the game and enchant their followers; you'll help yourself and them. It also dishes out a decent amount of money each time.

, Every day that you launch the app, you earn a random sum of gold in the daily draw. Sometimes you can earn a huge amount, so it's always important to just click on the app every twenty-four hours.

, Sometimes when you level up, the rune gives you some random things, in which you can sell if you really need the money. Most of the time they won't sell for much, but if you're tight on cash, it can sometimes help.

, When you toss a follower into a rainbow made from rain and sunlight, it launches you into a game where you jump from cloud to cloud. On some clouds, there are stars and on some, there are five gold. The downside to this game is that you have to trade in one awe to keep the items you collect, but sometimes it's worth it.

, When you use these mana-powered objects on your followers, your followers will each generate three stars. Tap on these stars to add them to your followers. When you reach your goal for stars, your followers will do a flip and present gold to you. The more you level up in stars, the more gold they will generate each time. Also, followers with a higher star rating make more money when enchanted!

, Try to stay away from buying decorations for your planet until you have enough money to freely spend it. Only buy the important things, such as buildings for your followers to work and rest at.

Get Some Experience.If you haven't done so already, go create an account in PR2.,
Start Looking For Ideas.,
Start Building Your Level.,
Use a Variety of Blocks and Experiment With Them.,
Make Your Level Fancy.,
Test Your Level.,
Publish Your Level.,
Tweak Your Level and Publish it Again.,
Make another one!",How to Make a Good Platform Racing (PR2) Level," Once you have your own account, try playing the game for a while and levelling up until you get to around rank 15 or so. This will help you develop a good feel for the game's mechanics and allow other players to take your levels more seriously.;
, Once you've gained enough experience in PR2, it's time to start looking for ideas for your level. Try to think of what type of level you wish to make. If you can't decide for yourself, check out some of the levels that are under the ""Today's Best"" and ""All-Time Best"" tabs. Many of these levels are typically made by higher-ranked players who can often be of great influence since they've been around the block quite a few times and know plenty of good tricks.

, As soon as you have a level concept that you're happy with, you can finally begin building your level. It's wise to start by adding your players' starting positions. You can allow your players to start a race/match normally or go even further by incorporating a hat remover or a santa/crown/cowboy hat filter into each of your players' starting positions.

, Try to use a variety of different block types, but make sure that you're actually making the race/match more fun instead of just tacking on extraneous features. If you're stuck, try experimenting with some blocks and placing them in unique places. The possibilities are endless, and this can give you a chance to exploit some glitches as well.

, In PR2, art is the best way to add a personal spin to your level as well as make it appear much more professional to your players. Draw on layers 00 through 0 if you want your art to overlap the player and the blocks, and draw on layers 1 through 3 for art that only appears in the background. If you're having trouble drawing sophisticated designs with your mouse or touchpad, simple colorful line designs distributed throughout your level will work just fine. Use the preloaded landscape art sparingly; don't add too many trees/cactuses/rocks/etc. as your level will look very rushed if you do. On the other hand, PR2's text tool can be very useful, but avoid writing huge blocks of text as this can distract the players too much.

, As soon as you feel that your level is just about done, the only thing you have to do left before publishing it is to test it. This is your chance to look for any problems in your level and think of any possible improvements you can make. Such questions as ""Is my level good enough?"" and ""What do I want to fix/add?"" are very useful here. Make sure that you are able to win the level entirely on your own. If you are making a level that requires more than one player, you can always put a temporary password on your level (while keeping it unpublished) and ask a group of friends to help test it out with you. If you don't want people playing your level while wearing a specific hat, be sure to make note of that at the beginning of the level AND in your level description.

, As soon as you are completely satisfied with your level, it is time to publish it for everyone to play. Make sure you add a very fitting and attractive name; an unfitting name will give someone a reason to rate your level low, and a more generic name won't catch a player's eye as easily. Add a description that briefly describes what your level is all about; don't make it too long or part of it will be cut off when it's being viewed. Remember: More people will notice your level while more people are online. If you have to, save your level and wait until a time of day when the servers are most active to publish it.

, Most of the time, your level isn't going to be perfect on the first go. Don't be afraid to ask other players and moderators for help and feedback; they'll be more than happy to give you suggestions. You can edit your level as many times as you want to your heart's content. The more you fix it up, the better it's going to be and the higher its rating is going to be.

, Done already? Who said you had to stop at just one brilliant level? You can make as many levels as you want! The more levels you make, the higher your popularity will increase. And the best part is that all your other levels will get even more attention and higher ratings!

Choose the proper weaponry; melee, pistols, and rifles are the only weapons that are feasible to loot with.,
Attain the proper stats.,
Go to Fort Pastor, or Precinct 13.,
Agility is also an important stat.,
Know the various economies of the game.,
Carry the proper equipment and supplies when you leave the fort/barricade to go out looting.,
Understand that looting buildings raises your chance to loot weapons, but also inhibit your ability to escape aggro because you are inside of a confined space.,
Keep on your toes.,
Remember that the difficulty of the block you are looting depends on where you are in the city.",How to Loot in Dead Frontier," Get one of these weapon types to at least 100 (and buy a level 100 weapon) before you try to loot the end zones of the map. All of the other weapon types are too loud, and are mainly designed to deal with high amounts of aggro after a spike.;
, It's important that you look at critical hit most of all. If your critical hit isn't capped for your chosen weapon, you aren't utilizing the full potential of that weapon (these caps can be referenced on the Dead Frontier Wiki). When your crit is capped you will crit 80% of the time you shoot/swing on average.

, They are the forts that offer the closest access to the end zones. Fort Pastor is the most populated fort, so according to the laws of supply and demand you will find the strongest economy there, also typically the best pricing for any given item.

, It determines how fast you can run(from aggro), and how fast you can get to the end zones from Fort Pastor or Precinct 13.

, Fort Pastor is the best place to sell your weapons and armor, and the south-east zone is the best place to sell ammo because then you don't bog down your storage space with it. The east and north-east zones are sparsely populated, so you will tend to see much higher prices there as demand there is very high for ammo and services (with the recent additions to the map all along the east side of the city this may change in the coming months as these areas now have more of a reason for people to loot there).

, I carry: 3-4 heals, 2-3 food, 1 hammer, 2 nails, 2 wooden planks, and a spare set of armor or 2. I know this takes up valuable inventory space, and you can carry less supplies if you choose, but survivability is important to looting the end zones. If you die you have a long walk ahead of you to get back to start looting again.

, An aggro spike indoors can kill even the most geared and experienced players.

, Looting requires that you pay attention to the game, what you're doing, and what kinds of zombies are on the screen at any given time. It IS possible to wade through the city avoiding the vast majority of zombies as you loot. No matter what you do though, if a Siren sees you and you can't kill her before she screams, you're going to have a lot of company; a siren scream can also initiate a full on aggro spike.

, Check the Fairview City Map on the Dead Frontier Wiki, note how zombie difficulty gets harder the further east you go; but also the further north or south you go from the center. Looting the most difficult areas is where the most profit is to be made as the highest level of items drop there."

, You can garden these, or buy them with your coins/tokens. Make 24 Party Poppers. Or more/less as much as you need to reach level 3.

, You will need them to make Cream Pies. You need at least 3x Azure Trumpets so buy Azure Trumpets from the store with tokens or gold.

, These are much more expensive so you have the same options. Buy Alien Coralite. Pay up or garden em'! You will need them until level 7 crafting.

, Good. Because now we are crafting Magical Egyptian Relics. Azure Trumpets are still needed so stock up on those. You will need to do this until level 10 crafting.

, While your stocking up White Buttertrees and you got 100 you could (optional) make snowballs as well! It's a good idea if you want tokens too. Hopefully you still have cream pie if you want to make snowballs.

, Make Fish Head Scrolls. Alien Coralites and White Butter-trees are needed.

Choose skills that you will use.,
Choose a race which benefits your play style.,
Experiment before committing to a build.",How to Level Up in Elder Scrolls Online1," The key to leveling skills quickly is to emphasize and choose skills that you will actually use in the first place. Using skills means that you gain experience with them, and the more you use them the more experience you'll get. So while a certain ability or weapon may be cool, don't be surprised if it slows you down when it comes to leveling.;
, Certain races have bonuses to XP (experience) with certain skills. Examples include Altmer with Destruction Staffs, Bosmer with bows, Bretons with Light Armor, and Khajiit with Medium Armor. Decide what skill you really want to be good with and then consider creating a character with that race bonus.

, It takes time to figure out just the right build and just the right skills you'll need in order to get your character leveled up quickly. Even just deciding what skills you care about the most can take time. You may need to experiment, so be patient.

Do general quests.,
Do guild quests.,
Fight in the faction wars.",How to Level Up in Elder Scrolls Online2," General quests, picked up from NPCs across Tamriel, can give you lots of experience. You get this not only for completing the quest, but also for killing the enemies you encounter along the way! More demanding quests will give you a higher amount of money, so don't only go for quick and easy quests.

, Guilds are back in the installment of the Elder Scrolls, so take advantage and complete the guild quest lines. The various quests you pick up can give you an easily laid out way to get XP, helping you level faster by creating a clear path of things to do.

, Since battling is the real way to gain XP, what better way can there be to gain it than to participate in a full-scale war? Once you reach level 10, you'll be allow to participate in the war effort, fighting for your home Alliance (and later, switching sides if you want to). This will net you loads of XP, depending on the size of the battle and how much you participate.

Explore the world.,
Kill creatures.,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Level Up in Elder Scrolls Online3," For MMO vets, yes, level grinding is still the main way to get XP. For MMO newbies, level grinding will be the bane of your existence. Start by getting out into the world. Specifically, get out into the wilderness. The more dangerous the environment, the better.

, Step 2, as it turns out, is to kill a bunch of stuff. Use your preferred method and try to kill things on your own to maximize XP gained. Have fun! (just kidding)

, The infamous ""Step 3: Profit"". Just keep killing things and getting the XP. It may be boring sometimes, but eventually it adds up and you'll get to where you want to be.

Seek the Skyshards.,
Activate the Skyshards.,
Distribute the skill point.",How to Level Up in Elder Scrolls Online4," Skyshards are new to the Elderscrolls universe. These shards, when collected, will give you a bonus skill point to spend. You'll have to start by searching the world for them. Keep an ear out, as well as an eye. They make a ringing sound and shine very brightly, so they're easy to spot from a distance.

, Once you see a Skyshard, activate it by clicking on it in order to harness its power. Don't worry if you see someone else at the site: one person absorbing a Skyshard does not stop another from doing the same.

, Once you have a set of 3, you get a point to spend. Keep track of how many you currently have by checking your Skills and Abilities Menu.

"

Try crafting.,
Fight harder enemies.,
Fight with others.,
Get buffs.",How to Level Up in Elder Scrolls Online5," Crafting items can level you overall, but it will also level your skills in that crafting specialty. This is useful for getting experience and the skills necessary to make quality items (that you can sell!). There are a number of different crafting skills to try, including weapon smithing, armorsmithing, and alchemy.

, The harder the enemies you fight, the more XP you'll get when you kill them. As such, if you're getting into higher levels and you see those wolves aren't really leveling your skills anymore, you'll know it's time to move on to something a little bigger. Quest time!

, Some less well-balanced MMOs allow other people to steal your kills, but not so in ESO. Since you don't need to worry about stealing someone's kill, you should feel free to help out others in battles. If you help enough, you'll get a little XP. If you really work together, you can split the XP evenly!, You can get buffs (or bonuses to your normal leveling rate) through a few different means. The easiest is to find a Mundus Stone (like the standing stones in Skyrim or birth-signs in Oblivion) which will increase the stat you wish to level. These are located across Tamriel and you will need to seek them out.

Play many mini-games.,
Walk your pet(s).,
Buy plenty of items.,
Add many friends.,
Do all quests.",How to Level Up on Panfu," Go to the last server shown, when you log on, to peacefully level up.;
, Completing these will boost your level dramatically! Whether you have to create multiple accounts for it or constantly annoy other pandas, go undercover and complete them. You will even get extra powers and emoticons, and maybe even a new treehouse!

, Whilst you're adventuring on Panfu, you can throw water-bombs randomly, jump to places instead of walking, and take a pet with you to raise your level percentage even higher.

, These are the most recommended tips for leveling up. You can make lots of money too, provided what mini-game you play. By clicking on your high score section of your player card, you get access to most games on Panfu. The best one for having fun is Cloud Number Nine, and the best money-making one is Crazy Numbers.

, You can buy a pet straight from joining the game! Go to the Pokopet Barn to buy a Marieta ladybug and walk your pet all around the island for the cheapest way to do it. Of course, Bollys are the best. The more expensive your pet is, the higher the level percentage!

, From player cards and panda colours to new tree houses and pet furniture, you have to buy many items to level up! By simply buying things, your level will increase by a huge amount.

, This will not only give you a higher level percentage, but it will look good on your player card too. After all, a VIP must have over 400 'friends' to let alone be considered a cool kid.

, These really do maximize your level, along with complete achievements. From doing one quest alone - even the weekly ones - you can go up by 4 levels. It's best to do the shortest ones first: Spies in Bitterland; Penny and Lenny and the Chronicler. Then you can go on to do My Son is a Pirate, The Lost Wooby King and others.

",How to Level up Fast on Silkroad," Make sure with a spear you choose armor, not protector or garment/robe.;
, When you are at that point, you will want to add all points to Str.

, The ones you need to level up are Lightning, Force, and Heuksal.

, Kill those until you reach level 3. Again, level up Lightning, Force, and Heuksal, along with adding all points to Str.

, They may be one level higher than you, but you can level up faster. Kill a few then rest, and so on...

, They will bring you to level 5.

,,, (When you kill Yeohas, watch out for the Party monsters. They will have a blue icon before their name. I recommend that you don't kill them. They may look easy to kill but their strength and health are higher than the normals'. Their health is eight times more and they hit twice as hard. Try killing these when you are level 16 and above.
