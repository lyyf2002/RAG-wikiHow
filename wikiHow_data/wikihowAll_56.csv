, This is very important. Farms are the main source of food in Evony and if you don't have enough, you are going to be in big trouble in the future. If you do not have enough slots to build farms, then destroy some other resource fields. Like Quarry's, stone is useless in the game. You could buy them at a decent price.

, If you have such a big army, then they will need a lot of food. Resulting the loss of food. You can shorten your army and you will see productions raise depending on how much you release. But do not shorten all of your army, someone may be attacking you and you have no defense for it.

, Researching this helps increase the production by 10% every time you research it. Build more cities to research more things.

, Food is at a very decent price. Like in na47, if you buy 1,000,000 food, it is priced at 496,000 gold. Sell some of your lumber/iron to earn some gold. You can earn a lot of it if you keep selling them.;
, Some people in your alliance might have some food to spare. You can ask them through alliance chat and see if they can spare. You must give them your coordinates so they know where to send it.

Enter steps here to describe your method in detail.,
If this is your first time going to kill a monster, go to map 3, you will see him/her there.,
If the Khezu don't know that you are in it, place 'hit it' with a paint ball.",How to Kill a Khezu in Monster Hunter," Bring 10 herbs, 4 tranquilizers, 3 paintballs and a shock trap. You can have 2 shock traps when you are in the quest, and if you have an iron katana with no upgrade, you are good to go. But when it is upgraded you'll be able to kill that monster.;
, Do not place the shock trap yet if you are playing this on Monster Hunter 2; you can capture your monster anyway. Let's go to hunt the Khezu.

, Don't attack yet, because he will do the electric shock defensive course now. Attack it, but if he does the electric shock, get out of his way or you will catch his electricity.


If you are using a katana, that is good because you beat the Khezu with an iron katana. Make sure your katana is full tip always hit the Khezu in 1 side of it's leg now.
Always attack his 1 side leg. If he falls down, attack his head repeatedly. If he gets back up, hit his leg again.
If he is not moving or it's mouth is going blue or colored place the shock trap and attack it. If he doesn't get in the map 3, attack him again, but be be careful; it will give you more damage if you catch the shock now if he goes to map 3. Go there, I am sure the Khezu is sleeping there now.
If you are playing Monster Hunter Fu, place the shock trap and start attacking it and it will be dead for soon. But when you are playing Monster Hunter 2, place the shock trap in it's position. Then, in his paralysis, throw the tranquilizer to it, and it will fall asleep.

Consider this a checklist of things to consider.,
Rewards in DDO boil down to 3 things: XP, Loot, and Favor.,
Play a Cleric.,
Don't go for the bonus XP such as ""conquest"" or ""ransack"" unless it is really easy.,
Always do quests on the maximum difficulty that can be *safely* accomplished by your party.,
Build or join parties with your level as the minimum, and your level + 3 as the maximum.,
Don't be afraid of 10% or 20% penalties for doing a quest that is a little below the group level.,
Don't be afraid of the 50% ""power level"" XP nerf on longer of higher level quests.",How to Keep up in Ddo As a Casual Player," Not everything here will work for everyone. But much of it will work well for most people.;
, Always shoot for getting all three. Don't do XP runs to level up, and favor runs to get some other goal later... Get them both along with some good loot in every quest you run. Use the quest chart (under the star icon, hereafter called the ""star chart"") to track what you have already done. Never redo a quest at the same or lower difficulty unless it is particularly fun for you.

, The demand for Clerics is very high, as they make it easier for all other classes to succeed. If you play a Cleric, you will be able to spend less of your rare game time looking for groups. And, in most cases you will be able to control what quests the group will do, allowing you to avoid repeating quests that you have already done.

, In one hour, you might be able to run 4 quests quickly and without bonuses for a total of 10,000 XP. But if you take the time to get the bonuses, you might get more XP per quest, but only complete 3 quests in the same hour for a total of 9,000 XP. And you will have less loot and favor too. Break every box or barrel you see while running through the quest though. It takes no time, and most of the time will add up to a 10% increase.

, The bonuses from doing quests on high difficulty (or doing higher level quests than you can handle) are very tempting. But you lose far more in one failure than you will make up in the bonuses of several hard quests.

, Getting the most out of limited play time means accomplishing goals as quickly as possible. What your party can accomplish, and how fast, depends on the total ability of the party. Putting a couple of higher level players next to you does more to help you succeed than having that uber weapon you keep hoping to pull.

, You can literally run some quests 2 or 3 times as fast when you are a little above level. So, even though you take a small penalty in XP per quest, you more than make up for it by being able to run more quests in less time.

, The 50% penalty only applies to the base XP for the quest. So, if you have made it to level 10, one option would be to do all of the level 9 quests that take an hour to finish and give 1500 to 3000 XP. For a casual player, it might take a month or more to level up using this method. Or, you could build a level 10 to 14 party that includes a couple of good level 14 players, and then do Madstone Crater on normal, hard, and elite difficulties. The base XP of Madstone Crater is around 15,000 XP. You will get a conquest bonus without any extra effort most of the time, which is about 3250 XP. You will get a first time bonus of either 3250 or 6500 depending on difficulty. And you will get a few other bonuses as you complete it. So, even with the 50% penalty, you will be getting over 15,000 XP on normal and hard, and over 18,000 XP on elite. Continue this with other Gianthold quests and you will soon level up to where you are no longer taking a penalty.

Choose a class suitable for kiting.,
Find a place suitable for kiting.,
Find a target.,
Get a movement speed buff.,
Snare the target.,
Begin kiting.,
Meditate to regain your mana, and repeat the process.,
Understand the strength of the ""mob"" you are about to kill, look it up on online, make sure it does not summon.",How to Kite Mobs in Everquest," Obviously, melee classes won't be able to accomplish this task with the exception of the shadow knight. Druids, wizards, necromancers and bards are particularly adept at kiting, and druids obtain kiting spells particularly early in the game. The ability to snare is not mandatory, but it is very helpful. Together, Snare (or another speed debuff) and movement speed (Spirit of Wolf, Selo's Acceleration, etc.) make it much, much easier.;
, Large, wide-open areas are generally preferred, though a skilled kiter can kite in dungeons.

, Ideally, kite targets should be melee fighters only. Spellcasters tend to cause problems during kiting since they can hit you from a distance. Similarly, watch out for targets that use ranged attacks .


Most classes can bring down a yellow or white-con target without draining a full bar of mana.

, Cast, or have someone cast Spirit of Wolf/Spirit of Eagle on you. Again, movement speed increases are not necessary if you can snare, but they make the process easier and give you a backup method for escape, should your snare break or be resisted when you're not expecting it.

, This is one of the primary techniques for kiting, and is often referred to as 'snare kiting'. When the target is snared, you can easily stay ahead of it during the kiting process.

,


Maintain a good distance from your target before you start casting a spell. It helps to know the approximate number of seconds that it takes to cast a particular spell.
Begin with using your damage over time (DoT) spells, if applicable. These will help to weaken the target, and will save you time spent on waiting for mana later.
Wait for the DoTs to apply a considerable amount of damage. This is necessary so that you are not wasting extra mana in casting your direct damage spells.
Hit your target with your strongest direct damage spell. Continue to hit the target with your direct damage spells until it is defeated.

, Don't forget to loot your kills.

, If this is your first time killing this ""mob"" have full mana(just in case)

Learn the basic moves first.,
Learn the advanced moves.",How to K Style in Gunz,"

Butterfly (BF). A simple but yet effective move. The steps are, Jump > dash > slash > block.



 


Slashshot (SS). First shooting move. Steps are, Jump > dash > slash (hold) > switch to weapon > shoot > switch back to sword.






Wall Cancel. A quick way to scale walls. Steps: run at wall, Jump on wall from distance> flip off wall> Slash > dash back on wall> Jump off wall once you hit it > repeat from slash flip onwards.





;
,

Double butterfly (DBF). This is just 2 slashes per jump instead of 1. Steps are, Jump > slash > block > dash > slash > block. (First slash as you jump, Second slash at the top coming down.)
Triple butterfly (TBF). Hardest one of the butterfly moves, not needed to be good, but can be useful. Steps are, Jump > x3 (First slash as you jump, Second slash at the top, Third slash before you touch the ground.)






Reload shot (RS. Faster than slashshot by a few milliseconds but that can often mean the difference between life and death. Steps: Jump>Slash (hold)> switch to a gun > Shoot >reload >Switch back to sword *note: reload and switch should be within the same second.*






Insta. Flip > Block > Jump > Bf (Note: Any k styler reading this who has more please click edit and add on to this) Fun and annoying. (Edit: By slashing the enemy in the air it renders him in a frozen animation till he touches the ground, thus being a good move for maps like stairway when you can insta flip, slash or bf him in the air while can not wall cancel hes way back up).






Juggle. Flip > Block > Jump > Bf/dbf/tbf > repeat (Note: You should slash your opponent while he/she is going up. This cancels his/her going up and puts him to the ground before they get a chance to react and safefall. Don't expect a level 50 to fall for insta though, because some people have reactions fast enough to safefall.)






Meteor. Flip > Block >Jump > Dbf> Flip > Block, dbf/tbf. (Have fun learning this one).

Serif is a sprightly lightning-element warrior. He possesses high defense and can damage a single target. This is a very good starter Eidolon for players who need a tank to protect them.
Merrilee is an ice-element sylph. She uses magic and is a range-support type. Most Wizards and Sorcerers go for Merrilee because of her ability to cast a magical shield that regenerates the health of party members.
Grimm is a fire-type Eidolon and quite favorable in Infernal Abyss since the monsters in this dungeon are weak against fire elements. Grimm is mostly partnered with tanks such as Guardians and Berserkers because of his devastating damage and AoE skills.
Alessa is a young unicorn and a master of the element of light. This Eidolon has a high evasion rate and possesses skills for both single and AoE. She's also equipped with a skill that can damage an enemy continuously.;
, When you reach level 25, the quest “Call of Gaia” will be available for you. Your reward will be the Eidolon Sigrun. Sigrun, a Valkyrie, is a mighty warrior-maiden who combs battlefields for the souls of the fallen. She is an ice-property Eidolon with high attack power and defense.


Most players use Sigrun during dungeon raids because of her ability to take on multiple opponents.
Sigrun is also a good tank for players who frequently do solo raids.

, As you reach level 40, another Eidolon quest, “Resonance of Gaia,” will be available for you to complete and will reward you with Gigas.


Gigas is an Iron Titan who wields lightning. He holds high single-target damage and defense, with skills that can stun mage enemies and decreases their attack speed and accuracy.
This is the last Eidolon you can acquire through quests.

Visit the Temple of Eidolon.",How to Hunt Eidolon in Aura Kingdom2," Energy Crystals can be gathered from dungeon monsters, but these have a low chance of dropping. To hunt successfully, you will need equipment with a bonus loot rate stat.


Most players purchase a set of low-level equipment with high loot rate then use it whenever they hunt dungeons in solo mode. Some enter low-level dungeons in Hell Mode to get more chances of obtaining Energy Crystals.

, After collecting 75 Energy Crystals, you can fuse them all with one Hero Emblem and five gold. This will create an Unidentified Summoning Device, which you can use to summon an Eidolon for a chance to obtain Eidolon keys.


If you fuse 100 Energy Crystals instead, you will get a Summoning Device that can be used in Guild halls.

, Accepting a Daily Quest will automatically summon you to a dungeon where tasks will be given to you by an NPC either seeking your help or testing you. Ancient Eidolon Fragments and Eidolon Energy Crystals will sometimes be given as rewards.Your Daily Quest resets every day and can be obtained in every map's bulletin board.

, You can use recipes purchased from merchants to turn 30 Eidolon Fragments into 1 Key Fragment. To get a full Eidolon Key, you will need 10 Key Fragments. It’s a very long process, but if you do your Daily Quest in every map, you will eventually get the summon you want. See the chart below for the various recipes available.

, The Temple of Eidolon is found in Crescent Hills. You can enter the Temple of Eidolon up to 4 times a day. Once you enter the temple, you will be given a chance to pick a treasure box, depending on your level. There are three types of chest that can be opened inside the Temple of Eidolon.


Make sure that you're strong enough to take on high-level summons or else they will be wasted.
A level 35 treasure box will give you a level 25 Summoning Stone, a level 50 treasure box will give you a level 40 Summoning Stone, while a level 60 treasure box will give you a level 50 Summoning Stone.
You must use the treasure box right away to obtain the Summoning Stone or else the box disappears once you exit the dungeon.
The Temple of Eidolon refreshes at 6AM, 12PM, 6PM, and 12PM EST.
It is important NOT to accept or join another party while doing the Temple of Eidolon; otherwise, you risk being booted from the dungeon. After being kicked out, you won't be able to get inside again and have to wait for the next dungeon reset.

In this dungeon, random Eidolon may spawn. You can kill Eidolon spawns for randomly dropped Eidolon Keys and Fragments; however, Eidolons spawning in Skandia is rare.

Sign up for the game.,
Learn about the Jorvik currencies.,
Go to the cafe.,
Train your horse.",How to Play Star Stable1," Once you register to the game, it requests you to login with your password and email address (at this part, it doesn't matter if you don't give a valid email). You start by creating your character and horse. There will stand on the screen a base model of your character. You can change the hair, hair-colour, eyes, make-up, and you start with an orange top and mauve jodhpurs. Then, you choose your first and second name from an alphabetical list. A message will come up if you pick an already chosen name. Then you customize your horse. It if the same basic features as the character choosing, except with the horses the choices are more mane, body, and then you choose the name. Then the game starts to load and you are ready to play!


Until the player reaches level four, the game is free. Then, to continue the story and get access to cool new features, it's time to think of buying a membership.;
, There are Jorvik Shillings and Star Coins. Jorvik Shillings are earned from simple things such as racing, quests, and selling things from your inventory. However, Star Coins are more precious. Star Riders receive a weekly allowance of 100 Star Coins. Star coins can also easily be bought on the online site. Star Coins can be used to buy gear, clothing and later on, horses. There are plenty of shops scattered around Jorvik, each shop vary with prices, quality, etc.

, There are cafes everywhere, just find some tables and chairs, and there will be an option on the bottom right of the screen to sit down. You can change the camera angle so you can even zoom in. There are two options: order and open backpack. The backpack is your inventory. When you click 'order' A waiter stands near you with a speech bubble saying ""May I help you?"" and there is an inventory-shaped list of food and drinks waiting for you to buy. There are milkshakes, sodas, tea, coffee, and sandwiches, as well as many desserts. When you click 'buy' the item will be added to your inventory (just like ordinary buying) and you drag that item onto the table, and your character will eat and enjoy.

, You and your noble steed have a level, and the maximum level is 15. The higher level you and your horse are, the better quality clothing you unlock to buy. Also, to level up, there is a small bar next to your horse profile. Keep doing more and more races and that bar will soon fill up with orange. When the bar fills, Your horse levels up. It is a similar process with your character, but this time the bar is much larger and longer and can only be filled up by doing plenty of quests. Remember, the better mood and the higher level your horse is at, the better it performs!


You and your horse have stats. Your horse has swiftness, discipline, agility, endurance, and strength. Swiftness adds to your horse's speed, strength determines how high and far your horse can jump, discipline determines how well your horse responds to commands, endurance determines how much injury your horse can take (added onto the green bar next to the horse profile), and agility affects how fast your horse changes directions. For your character, riding improves speed, caring determines how long your horse feels good after caring for it, command shortens how long it takes for your horse to change it's gait, and jumping determines how long and far your horse jumps.

Do quests.,
Shop.",How to Play Star Stable2," Star Stable is known for it's amazing 3D quality, and just spending time relaxing and enjoying the scenery can give you a mood boost, especially if you're not too busy with quests and racing. Enjoying with a friend is even better. Try going to Fort Pinta Beach, and just let your horse and you relax near the sea. Try exploring Jorvik when sunset comes; it's utterly astounding!

, Not only will it give your horse that little XP boost, but it's good to practice, and try to fulfill those champion racer dreams. There are lots and lots of races everywhere, even a pony race! There are championships, too. Championships are a lot harder, longer, and especially when you're surrounded by level 15 know-it-all's. But relax, don't fret, because practice makes perfect, right? Try wearing better gear and clothes. To make your horse faster, get gear and clothing that says Swiftness 3 Swiftness 1 and 2 will work but the best players use all ""swiftness 3"" gear and clothing.

, When you are a Star Rider, there are thousands of fun quests to play, every single day. Some quests are daily, and don't give XP, but they give plenty Jorvik Shillings and improve your relationship with that place. Doing quests sometime unlock new places, and you have to be a certain level to unlock them, such as Golden hills Valley. But don't worry, you'll get there!

, There are many shops, so there's plenty of places to spend some of that extra cash!

Ignore your advisers.",How to Master the Mcdonalds Video Game," The first thing you need to do after starting your game is to pause it. You'll quickly go bankrupt if you try to manage the company without the game paused. Keep the game paused while you do everything in this section. You can find the Pause button in the upper-right corner.


Don't worry if these initial steps make you go negative, you'll quickly make the money back.
Note: you'll still see animations while the game is paused. When the game is unpaused, the Play button flashes.;
, Click an empty pasture and select the ""Soy"" option. Build three of these.

, Click a fields and then click the DNA symbol. Repeat this for all three farms.

, Click four empty lots and select cow pastures for each one.

, The Feedlot has a picture of a cow on the button. Click the scientific-looking machine at the back of the room and select ""Hormones"", which has a syringe as an icon. This is all you'll ever need to do in the Feedlot screen to keep making money.

, Click the burger button to switch to the Restaurant view. Click one of the registers and hire a cashier. You'll only need one as you start the game.

, Click an assembly line in the back of the restaurant and hire a single worker. You'll only need one for now.

, Click the McDonald's logo to open the Corporate view. Click the desks in the front and then click the ""+"" button, which will corrupt a health official. You will be leaving this option enabled for the rest of the game.

, Once you've completed the above steps, you can unpause the game. Your bank account will likely be fairly negative at this point; don't worry too much about it, as you'll soon be making money hand over fist.

, You'll see tractors harvest the soy every few months. You don't have anything to do until you have made two harvests.

, After the first two harvests, you'll only need two soy farms for the rest of the game. Select one and remove the Genetic Modification option (this will get you more back when you sell it). Click the Sell button after removing Genetic Modification to sell the single Soy field.


Pausing the game while making any changes can help keep you from getting overwhelmed.

, Like the Soy fields, your cow pastures are ""harvested"" every few months by cranes that grab the cows. Wait for two of these harvests to happen before moving on.

, Once you have completed two cow harvests, it's time to stock your restaurant with employees. Add employees to all of your available registers and assembly lines.

, Click the marketing department on the left side of the Corporate screen and enable the Food Pyramid and the Third-World Advertising options. The Third-World Advertising has a handshake as an icon. Only enable these two, and never disable them.

, The above steps are the main things you need to accomplish in order to start raking in cash. From here on out, you'll be maintaining your infrastructure so that you continue to bring in cash every month. One of the most important things to keep an eye on is your cow pasture fertility, as this can negatively impact your meat production (Your soy fields should be fine forever since they are genetically modified). You can see your pasture fertility when you select the pasture.

, Once your pastures start losing fertility, you'll want to remove them and build a new set in different squares. This will allow the old land to heal. Wait for a cow harvest, then pause the game. Sell all four of your cow pastures and then build four new ones. You'll have two empty spaces, and you'll need to demolish two squares of rainforest. This will be the only time you need to demolish any rainforest squares, and you should never have to demolish city squares.


When your fertility degrades on the new squares, you can switch back to the four original squares, and so on.

, You'll want to have the Climatologist corrupted to prevent a negative impact on your business when you destroy the rainforests. You don't need to keep the climatologist corrupted forever, and you'll only need to ever destroy two rainforest squares. Use the Detractors information on the Corporate screen to see when you can disable the climatologist.

, Whenever you see an unhappy crew member, either give a badge for encouragement, or fire the employee. Avoid the Discipline option, as it is rarely effective.

, You can avoid negative backlash from firing employees by corrupting a Politician from the Corporate menu. You'll only need this enabled when you're firing someone. Use the Detractors window in the Corporate screen to see when you can disable your corrupted politician.

, At this point, everything should be fairly self-sufficient. You'll just need to perform the steps in this section whenever necessary to maintain your burger empire. You should see lots of money coming in each month, except the months that you're replacing pastures or corrupting officials.

, It may take several years, but you may eventually notice a surplus of soy or a shortage of beef. Add a pasture for a while to increase your beef production and get rid of your soy surplus at the same time. You should only need the change for a little bit to fix the imbalance, and then it will be back to business as usual.

, You can pretty much ignore any complaints or warnings from your advisers and just continue making money without issues."

Go to http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-run-2.,
Wait for it to load, then select ""Runner"".,

Begin Level 1.,
Continue playing the game, and look for the bonus on each level.,
Constantly reorient yourself.,
Collect all the bonus you can.",How to Play Run 2 on Coolmath," This is where you will startup the game.;
, This is the better option for beginners, as the runner is easier to control. While you don't jump as far, the levels are designed to work around that.

, Your first goal is to complete the level; your section objective is to get the little bonus.


Many players switch these objectives and try a level 10 times just to get the bonus. Do not play this way, even though it is tempting; you can always go back and replay levels if you want.

, This level just requires you to press each of the keys once: left, right, then space. The walls even look like arrow keys, showing you the way to go. At the end of the level is a block that looks like a space bar (hint, hint) and the bonus.


Many times the bonus will be sitting on the underside of a block, and you need to figure out how to get to it, but not this level. Just press space once you have jumped up once, and you will get the bonus. Once the floor beneath you starts to turn different colors, you know you are at the end of the level.

, One strategy is to run through the level, on the main path, then look for the bonus as you are completely the level. If you can spot it, try to get to it. If you can't jump high enough, or you can't see the bonus entirely, then maybe there is another path that leads to the bonus.


For example, on Level 2, if you hold down ""right"" from the start of the level, you can get past the long wall to the right of the level, and you'll find the bonus along that path.

, If running on one path doesn't work, jump to the wall on your right. What was the wall on the right will become the floor, and the floor will become the wall on the left. This will shift perspective and sometimes allow you to see hidden areas you haven't seen before.

, After level 25, special bonus levels will be available depending on how many bonuses you got.

, Make sure your PC or MacBook meets all the basic requirements for running WOWS. Open the client then it will automatically start installing.

, When you have finished downloading and installing your game, login with your email address and password:

, After logging-in WOWS, your in-game interface will look like this.

, WOWS is a game for you to collect your favorite virtual warships. To collect the warships you need to fight in many battles to gain experience (exp.) and credits to research and purchase your favorite warships.


Credits can be used to purchase warships, consumables, and camouflages. Exp. can be used to research your new warships.
Your credits and exp. are shown on the top right corner of your main interface:






You will be granted with credits and exp. after each battle.






Your ship commander also gain the same amount of exp. after each battle. Ship commanders can learn skills to increase performances of your ship.







, Here, ""your level"" means your service record. Service record shows how many levels you have reached. It is a beginner-friendly system that can help players get familiar with this game. Each level will grant you additional in-game functions. Eg. You are able to access the tech-tree after you reach level 2.


Credits and exp. you obtain after each game are determined by the damage caused by your ship during the game.

, There are 4 types of warships in WOWS:


Destroyers - The fastest and most agile class of ships--lightly armored but possessing huge firepower in the form of torpedoes. It is also the most difficult to be spotted. In battle, destroyers can use smoke screens; which allows them to cover its own torpedo attack or hide allied ships.







Cruisers - A versatile and multi-purpose class of ship--each comes with its own loadout containing a combination of anti-aircraft guns, torpedoes, or even aircraft launchers. All cruisers are known for their high rate of fire; making them the perfect vessel to apply pressure to enemy forces at any stage in the battle.







Battleships - The real heavyweights of the World of Warships universe. Possessing massive guns, thick armor, and bristling with secondary armaments, these behemoths ply the seas with impunity.







Aircraft Carriers - Aircraft carriers scout the battlefield, send squadrons of dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighter to wreak havoc upon the enemy. Though they're lightly armed themselves, their wide array of aircraft makes them a micro-manager's dream come true.







, Here only introduce non-premium ships.


USA - US ships have the highest firing rate, strong AA defense, and the best smoke screen but weak at bullet speed--this means it takes longer time for bullets to hit the target, and makes enemy ships easier to dodge.

Japan - The Imperial Japan Navy was once on the top of the world and outrageous across the Asia pacific and even at the front door of US. Japanese ships are weak at AA defense. But have more advanced torpedoes and higher camouflage rate--that makes ships easier to hide on the sea.

USSR - USSR have strong firing power and the highest bullet speed, but weak at camouflage and torpedoes.

Germany - Germany's ships have good firing power, but weak at armor.
Here is a brief comparison of each nation's warships:







, Before each battle, you need to:

Confirm if your ship upgrades are correctly mounted.






Mount consumables. Consumables can repair your damaged ship modules and extinguish fire caused by high explosive shells or bombs. Consumables for special skills are also required. Different kinds of ships have different consumables that are specialized to their role.






Mount camouflages. Camouflages can increase your invisibility on the sea or decrease gun accuracy on enemy ships while firing at you.






Hoist signal flags. Signal flags can slightly improve the performances of your ships or increase credits and exp. income.






It is recommended to buy level 2 consumables and camouflages as it will lower your chance of being destroyed.

, You and your team are to fight against a robot team. Select your ship and select ""Co-op battles"" at the top in the middle. This mode is more friendly to beginners but can only gain 1/2 credits and exp. comparing to random battles.

,


In random battles, you and other random 11 players are to fight against another team with random 12 players.
In ranked battles, you and other 7 random players are to fight against another team with random 8 players. You can only select a warship at a certain tier (mainly between 6 and 8). You can rank up if you win a certain number of battles. When you reach a higher rank you will be granted with more rewards than random battles, like signal flags, credits, premium accounts, and even doubloons (premium coins). Note that your rank is completely independent to performances of other players.
In team battles, you can form a team with up to 8 members and to fight against other teams. (Note: team battles are currently unavailable.)

, Click ""BATTLE!"" at the top, and you will be waiting for system match making.


On the following page, you can check information about your team, the opposite team, game mode, and the map. After loading up the game, you will enter a battlefield like this:

,,


Use your keyboard keys to steer: W -move forward. S -recess. A -turn left. D -turn right.
You can switch to ""auto-pilot mode"" by pressing M if you want to lay a course for your ship to automatically travel along.







,

Except for aircraft carriers, each ship has two types of shells: High Explosive (HE) and Armor Piercing (AP). AP shells can cause massive damage when penetrating a target, while HE shells cause less damage but can cause fires on ships and do continuous damage. Note that AP shells can cause over-penetrating and cause little damage to destroyers as they have very thin armor. Use HE against destroyers.











Find a target you would like to hit. Move your mouse to turn ship guns to the target. Press ⇧ Shift or scroll your mouse to binocular mode. Wait your reticles to turn green before shooting at the target. Determine target's approximate speed by your sense, and shoot at the position in front of them. Aim at the waterline of enemy's ship to gain maximum damage. Double-left-click your mouse to shoot.












, Torpedoes are invisible killers and can do massive damage to other warships.


Not all ships are equipped with torpedoes. Press 3 if your ship has torpedo tubes. The green semicircles are the area where torpedo tubes are able to launch. Press X to aim at a target, then a white line appears. The white line is a calculation based on enemy's speed, direction, and your torpedo speed. It basically tells you if you launch torpedoes along the white line, you can hit the target . However, this white line can only show the real-time speed and direction of enemy ships, and the enemy can change their speed and direction anytime. In this case, you should have your own judgment when launching torpedoes, and the white line is just a reference.

, Aircraft carriers do not have a firing range limit--that makes them functional and powerful in WOWS.


The interface for aircraft carriers works differently from other types of ships. When you enter a battle as an aircraft carrier, your battlefield should be like this:





This mode grants you a panorama view of the battlefield.
Fighters--fighters are the best for AA defense. It can be used against enemy attack aircraft or other fighters. Hold Alt to let your fighter squadron strafe 6x normal damage in a small area:
Note that strafe skill can do team damage, so avoid putting your squadrons inside your strafe range.











Attack Aircraft--torpedo bombers and dive bombers are main weapons against other ships. Select squadrons and click on enemy ships to auto-drop torpedoes or bombs.
You can also use manual drop by holding Alt in order to increase accuracy.






















,

Use hotkeys to send requests to your team, instead of typing while you are in a fierce battle. Hold Tab ↹ to identify the frequently used hotkeys.






If you wish to point out a position for your teammates on the mini map, hold ""control"" and move your mouse cursor to designated position, then double click to send messages.
Avoid language abuse in the game. Give compliment and gratitude to your team, and commend your teammates if they play well.







, You can win by destroying all enemy warships, capturing enemy base, or scoring 1000 points before the enemy. However, it is almost impossible to achieve these goals without proper teamwork. Fight as a team!"

, To help you answer the level, a set of letters are displayed on the bottom part of your screen. The name of the restaurant can be formed using the letters given. If you’re having a hard time thinking of the name for the logo, you can scramble the letters to help you find the name.

, Tap the letters corresponding your answer. As you tap each letter, it will be placed inside the box representing your answer. If your answer is incorrect, you will see a message indicating you’re wrong. If you got it right, you will be rewarded with coins and the level will be completed.

, Tap the “Continue” button to proceed to the next logo. Continue moving through the levels. If you get stuck, you can get some help.

, You are rewarded coins for every level you answer correctly. You can use these coins to buy assistance. You can also buy more coins using real money. The number of coins you have are indicated on the top right corner of your game screen.

, The letters provided to you are more than what’s needed. This means there are excess letters that can confuse you when thinking about the answer. Tap the trash can with a letter button on the right side of the screen to remove a letter you don’t need. This help costs 30 coins.

, If you don’t have any idea what letters you really need, you can use the next help to put a correct letter into the answer box. Tap the letter with a pen button on the right side of the screen to do so. This help costs 60 coins.

, If you really have no idea what the answer is, you can just skip the level and proceed to the next one. Tap the fast forward button on the right side of the screen to automatically fill up the boxes with the right answer so you can continue. This help costs 300 coins.

Use Holy Light to save at-risk allies.,
Heal the team and damage enemies en masse with Holy Radiance.,
Use Hammer of Justice to disable vulnerable heroes.,
Give allies time to get in the right position with Divine Shield.,
Use Divine Storm to disrupt tight enemy formations.,
Support allies even after death with Eternal Devotion.",How to Play Uther in Heroes of the Storm1," Holy Light is Uther’s Q ability, which heals the targeted ally for a burst of health. A pretty straightforward but nonetheless powerful heal that can keep an ally alive while being focused down hard-hitting abilities. The 12-second cooldown is a bit long though, so Holy Light is best used on allies that you think will take even more damage in the next few seconds, not the ones that are safe in the rear lines.
, Holy Radiance is Uther’s W ability, which shoots a ball of light that heals all allies (including yourself) and damages all enemies along its path. This ability is very useful for recouping the damage done by enemy teams with hard-hitting area-of-effect abilities, as well as punishing the enemy team should they clump up too tightly together. If you line yourself up just right for a best-case scenario, you could end up healing your team while hurting the other team with one cast., Hammer of Justice is Uther’s E ability, where he uses his hammer to stun and damage the targeted enemy. The stun from Hammer of Justice is a great way to keep enemies on their toes, either to discourage them from getting too close to you or to close in on vulnerable targets. Hammer of Justice is also a great way to disable enemy heroes with channeling skills, like Azmodan’s All Shall Burn and Nazeebo’s Ravenous Spirit., Divine Shield is Uther’s first ultimate ability, which grants a 20% movement speed buff and turns a single target hero invulnerable and immune to control effects for three seconds. You can also target yourself with Divine Shield. Timing is everything with this skill, and is best used on front-line warriors or hard-hitting assassins that are trying to get into position. You can also use Divine Shield to turn the tables on enemies that are diving deep into your team to target vulnerable heroes, punishing them for their risky maneuvers and then finishing them off once they find themselves trapped within your team’s formation., Divine Storm is Uther’s second ultimate ability, which damages all nearby enemies and stuns them for a short duration. Divine Storm is excellent when you manage to insert yourself in the enemy formation, as the subsequent stun could buy enough time for your allies to get into position and start tearing apart the enemy. It can also be used as a last-ditch effort to delay enemy heroes so you can either escape or catch up to them if they’re the ones trying to escape., Eternal Devotion is Uther’s trait, which transforms him into a spirit upon death. It lasts for ten seconds, triggers once every 180 seconds and gives Uther the Flash of Light ability as long as he is a spirit.


Flash of Light is his spirit’s Q ability that heals allies for a respectable amount and has a very short cooldown of just 1.5 seconds. This gives Uther the ability to keep his own team alive even after he dies, giving him a strong post-mortem presence in the battle even when he is first to be focused down by the enemy team.

"

Support the team from behind with the Rear-Line Healer.,
Outlast your enemy with the Sustain Healer.,
Absorb the hits with the Off-Tank.,
Hold the enemy in place with the Controller.",How to Play Uther in Heroes of the Storm2," This build focuses on keeping Uther in the back-end of the team formation. This not only keeps him safe for Hardened Focus to keep his cooldowns low, but it also gives him more room to better position himself for a well-aimed Holy Radiance. Hardened focus coupled with Holy Shock also gives Uther a surprising amount of sustained damage, although Shrink Ray is the better pick against enemy heroes that dive too deep into your team’s formation. Cleanse should only be picked if the enemy team has a lot of deadly disables (e.g., Murky’s Octo-Grab, Butcher’s Hamstring, Rehgar’s Earthquake, Rehgar’s Earthbind Totem, etc.). Bulwark is ideal only if your tank or assassin needs more time to set up; otherwise, Storm Shield is the better pick to help your entire team better cope with burst abilities.


Talent Build: Reach > Boundless Conviction > Wave of Light OR Cleanse > Divine Shield > Holy Shock OR Shrink Ray > Hardened Focus > Storm Shield OR Bulwark of Light

, If the rear-line healer is all about hanging back, then the sustain healer is all about joining the thick of battle to support allies for extended periods of time. All the talents in this build revolve around keeping Uther’s mana topped up, which in turn make it easier for him to keep using his abilities over a longer period of time. This build, however, works best when Uther is able to hit stuff to regain mana with Hammer of the Lighbringer and maintaining heals with Blessed Champion. This puts Uther at greater risk, though Divine Shield, Redemption, and Storm Shield can help mitigate that risk by giving Uther added survivability should he be focused down.


Talent Build: Conjurer’s Pursuit > Hammer of the Lightbringer > Wave of Light > Divine Shield > Blessed Champion > Benediction > Redemption OR Storm Shield

, Uther has a decent health pool along with his two main heals recovering a large part of his health. This gives you the option of building Uther so that he can better survive walking up to the front lines, which in turn will give your teammates the time they need to get into position and unload on the enemy team. Spell Shield works against ability-reliant heroes (e.g., Jaina, Kael’thas, Kerrigan, etc.) while Shrink Ray works especially well against auto-attack assassins (e.g., Illidan, Raynor, Tychus, etc.).


Talent Build: Block > Amplified Healing > Holy Fire > Divine Shield > Spell Shield OR Shrink Ray > Imposing Presence > Redemption

, Uther has a surprisingly effective means of keeping his enemies stunned and slowed down if built properly. If executed properly, Uther can thus be built to not only heal his teammates but to pin down isolate enemies and make them easier targets for your team to focus down. This build revolves largely around Hammer of Justice, meaning that Uther will have to engage his targets in close range. He won’t have the added benefit of survivability talents this time around, so you’ll have to carefully balance risk and reward in order to pin down enemy heroes without getting suckered in by the enemy team.


Talent Build: Fist of Justice > Hammer of the Lightbringer > Burden of Guilt > Divine Storm > Shrink Ray > Benediction > Divine Hurricane

See a small menu depicting controls and settings.,
Click on the square at the bottom to save the settings you have made.,
Begin playing.",How to Play Rasterwerks (Phosphor) Efficiently," Utilize these buttons to adjust gameplay. You can adjust the controls, the number of bots, the difficulty of the bots, your gender, what you look like, number of kills, and the time limit. There are many other things you can do; simply play around with the buttons.;
, You will then return to the main menu.

, You should spawn in one of many places, such as outside on grass, inside on rafters, etc. The world is rather large and there are over 10 spawn points. You will spawn with one of the 4 weapons: Machine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Rocket Launcher, or the Pulse Gun. You spawn with 100 Health and 0 Armor.


Gameplay is rather simple. Click to shoot, and use the controls you set to move and strafe. The next thing we will cover is weaponry, which is obviously vital to gameplay.
The machine gun is a good weapon. You spawn with 80/200 ammo. It has the fastest reload in the game. Although it only hits around 1-10 per bullet, it accumulates very quickly and can do plenty of damage when used in excess.
The Sniper Rifle is an iffy weapon. You spawn with 20/50 ammo. It is slow, but inflicts 45 damage per hit, not to mention that its bullets travel the fastest in the game. You can right click with your mouse to zoom in a bit with this weapon, emulating a scope. The Sniper Rifle is a good finisher, as you can machine gun someone to around 45 and then finish them off with it.
The Rocket Launcher is a dangerous weapon. You spawn with 15/50 ammo. A direct hit from one of these deals 75 damage to you, which is three quarters of your maximum health. Even if it misses, the explosion it causes, or 'splash' damage can hurt you. For example, someone can miss with the rocket launcher by around 5 feet (1.5 m) and still deal 25-30 damage to you. Be careful not to shoot this at close-ranged things, as the explosion will hurt you as well. The rocket launcher is good for sending bots flying, as one hit bounces you back a good distance.
The Pulse Gun has never been one of the good weapons. You spawn with 60/200 ammo. It does 20 damage per hit, but it is rather inaccurate and not as fast as the machine gun. It can kill a newly spawned bot in 5 hits, but it is not a good weapon in general.
Armor can be found only inside, in a large room with rafters on top of a few boxes. It is a yellow floating shield. You have to jump off the rafters to get it. It immediately provides you with 100 armor, therefore increasing your vitality.

Hold W to do the splits.,
Tap W to scoot forward.,
Tap Q to pull your back leg forward.,
Tap W repeatedly.,
Alternate between Q and W. Keep repeating this knee-hop, and you'll scoot forward with very little chance of falling down.,
Wait, there's a hurdle?",How to Play Qwop1," At the start of the race, press and hold W to clench your left thigh. One leg will shoot straight forward while the other stays behind. Just let the runner fall until he's balanced on his foot in front, and his knee in back.


If you landed past 1.5 meters, break out the champagne.;
, If your front leg isn't fully extended, tap W to scoot forward another couple tenths of a meter. Once your runner stops moving, continue to the next step.


Forget that you ever knew how to stand up. Standing is a story that only children believe in.

, Don't hold it down too long, or you'll tip over backward. Just tap it to bring your back knee forward, until it's a short ways behind your butt.


If you've been playing for longer than 10 seconds, Usain Bolt would have already finished the race. Don't let it get to you.

, Now that your back leg is further forward, you have more room to scoot. You can often tap W several times, hopping on your back knee or dragging it forward slowly. Stop when your front leg is fully forward, or when more tapping doesn't cause you to move.


There are no fans in the background because they've all walked home. On their legs.

, Tapping between the two keys quickly will get you there, but you'll move faster and avoid tendonitis if you move in larger spurts. Hit Q to bring your knee forward, then hit W several times to lunge forward. Repeat until you're at the hurdle.


QWOP is too easy. We don't need those O and P keys.

, Yes, there's a hurdle at the 50 meter mark. It is possible to stay in the splits position, knock the hurdle over, and push it to the finish line. You'll move even slower than before, but stepping over it is risky. If you do want to get over it (after knocking it down), try propping yourself up on your front foot with O. Once your front calf is tilted a little forward of vertical, hit Q and W vigorously to clear the hurdle. It's very hard to do this without falling over.


If you've made it past the hurdle, you deserve a break from sarcastic comments. Congratulations, and good luck becoming a National Champion at the 100 meter mark.

"

Understand the movements.,
Practice long key presses.,
Press W and O to push with your right foot.,
Press Q and P to push with your left foot.,
Alternate between WO and QP.,
Speed up your stride.,
Correct mistakes.,
Stand up.,
Break through the hurdle.,
Keep practicing.",How to Play Qwop2," Practice will help you get a feel for the controls, but it can take a long time before they make sense. Here's a straightforward explanation of what the controls actually do:Q moves the right thigh forward and the left thigh back.
W moves the left thigh forward and the right thigh back.
O bends the right knee and extends the left knee.
P bends the left knee and extends the right knee.

, Beginners sometimes don't realize that holding down the key keeps the muscles flexed. A quick tap will flex your leg and relax it right away, leading to jerky movements. For consistent, powerful strides, you want to hold the keys down for a solid second.

, Press and hold these keys at the same time to give the runner a little forward momentum. Think of this as one control: pushing off with the right leg.While your right leg is pushing off the ground, your left knee will flex. When well timed, it will raise the left foot up off the ground.

, Just before your left foot (in front) hits the ground, release W and O, press Q and P at the same time, and hold. This will push off with your left foot, and bring your right foot all the way forward with a lifted knee.

, Keep your attention on the leg in front. Just before the foot hits the ground, release the two keys you're holding and press the other two. This will get your runner into a slow but well-balanced rhythm. He should shoot the next foot forward while leaning back, then fall forward a little further on the track.


You can also watch the runner's front thigh. It's time to press when it falls to a level parallel with the ground., If you don't want to spend a ton of time, you'll need to speed up. Instead of holding the keys down until your next stride, press for 1/4 to 1/2 of a second, then let go. When your forward foot just begins to fall, repeat with the other pair of keys. You'll move faster, but it will be much easier to make a mistake and fall over.


When done correctly, your runner's torso will stay vertical. The front foot will hit the ground directly below the torso. If the foot falls behind the torso, you're hitting the keys too late., Leaning too far back slows you down, but with practice you can recover fairly easily. The next time you hit the keys, press the thigh button slightly before the calf button, instead of at the same time. For example, instead of Q+P, press Q, take a split second pause, hit P, then release both keys.


Forward-leaning mistakes are very difficult to correct, since you usually fall quickly. You can try pushing off hard with your back leg (repeating the same keystroke pair) and dragging the forward calf up to catch yourself.

, If you accidentally fall into the splits, here's how to stand back up again:If your front leg is stretched forward, tap the key for the forward calf until your calf is roughly vertical.
Tap the key that controls the trailing thigh until it is vertical under your torso.
Tap the key for your front calf until the trailing foot just barely starts to lift off the ground, then push off with that foot. (In other words press p-p-p-W+O if your left foot is in front, or o-o-o-Q+P if your right foot is in front.)

, The hurdle at 50 meters isn't as scary as it seems, as long as you don't actually try to jump over it. Stick to your steady stride pattern and you should knock it over. This will often require one of the mistake corrections described above afterward, but with practice you'll learn to recover smoothly. After that point, there are no more obstacles between you and the 100 meter finish line.

, Even after they get the running rhythm down, most people don't reach the 100 meter finish line. It takes many attempts and often hours of practice. Good luck!

For the PS4 edition, you will have to download Paragon through the PSN store.
For the PC edition, you will have to first download the EPIC Games launcher through the Paragon website. Then within the launcher itself there will be an option for you to download Paragon.;
, To start playing you must make an account with EPIC Games or have a PSN ID.


You can either go to Epic Games directly and sign up, or to the Paragon Website. They both have links in the upper right hand corner that you can use to register.
For PS4 once you download the game through the PSN Store, your account will be linked to your PSN ID.
Surprise though! If you’d like you can link both your Epic Games account and your PSN, and you’ll be able to link accounts to use them on both PlayStation and PC.

, For those who aren’t used to the MOBA genre, or those who just want to test out characters, playing by yourself is one of the best options. You can get a feel for a game and the way the map works, as well as the abilities of the character you’d like to use.


Remember making mistakes are okay with A; it’s just you and the computers. If you decide you’d rather explore the map to get a feel, that's okay
What you do in this mode may not be okay to do in other game modes; being with you and only you takes a multiplayer experience and turns it singular. When you start playing with others for real, it’ll become a team game.

, Though you are still playing with AI in this game mode, this is for players who are starting to feel more comfortable with themselves and are ready to play in a team setting with real people online to defeat an enemy team made of AI. Play this game mode if you're feeling ready to communicate and play with others, or if you're feeling like making others frustrated with the lack of understanding of mechanics.

, So you’ve trained yourself, and you’ve trained with others, now it’s time to not only play with others, but fight against them too. Nothing changes between this game mode and the other ones besides the fact you are going to be expected to know how to play the game, and how the mechanics work, as well as communicate with your teammates, and understand that humans are a lot harder to face than AI.

, Choosing the role you like is important; there are 5 main roles in Paragon.



Carries - Farming farming farming. The goal of a carry is to not die, and to carry the team late game. Most of their damage comes from their basic attacks, and they usually stick in the safe lane

Offlane - Heroes that can play well solo. They have a lot of survivability and movement abilities, and are a big threat to the other team's experience early game.

Jungler - Heroes that gain exp and card exp from killing neutral minions in the jungle, or the spaces in between in each lane. Taking buffs is the way, and ganking lanes is their game.

Support - Heroes that can help in team fights and assistant heroes. They usually stick to the carry and help them get to late game. Starting in safe lane like the carry, their number one goal is to keep their carry alive.

Midlaner - Heroes that have heavy ability damaging moves, mages, and those with large boosts. Their auto attacks are usually weak but they pack a punch with their abilities.

, Paragon currently has 28 heroes available, with more being released at a rate of one every 3 weeks. There is a type for everybody: Supports, Carries, Midlaners, Offlaners, and Junglers, as well as melee heroes and ranged heroes. Picking heroes depends on your knowledge of the game.


Difficulties range from Easy, Advance, Intermediate, to Expert.
Heroes are categorized by their Basic Attack Power, Ability Power, Durability, and Mobility.
They are also often categorized by their traits, which are not a hard set of rules, but a guideline for those are beginning; Assassin’s, Attackers, Burst, Controllers, Durable, Elusive, Ganker, Guardian, Initiator, Marauder, Sieger, Wild, and Zoners.

, Now that you know the roles and the heroes you can choose you can get to know the abilities of the heroes you want to play.


Each hero has 4 abilities three basic and one ultimate, and you assign ability points to every time you level up.
Putting the points into the abilities make them stronger, basic abilities can be upgraded 3 times for a total of 4 levels, and ultimates can be leveled up two times for a total of three.

, In game with the deck you bring into the game, you will be able to purchase the cards you have put into your deck with card points that you gain from card experience.



Equipment Cards - Equipment cards simply put are your items. There are 6 slots for equipment cards, and you may upgrade equipment cards with upgrade cards. Most equipment cards have 3 upgrade slots.


Passive - Passive slots for equipment cards are two. These type of cards do not have an active ability assigned to them.

Active - Paragon’s active cards are cards that have an active ability (e.g. a health potion card that heals you). Each hero has 4 active slots to put active cards in.



Upgrade - These are cards that have specific stats and can only upgrade equipment cards with that stat.

Prime Helix - These cards activate for the entire ally team giving them a strong buff; they are activated by destroying the Prime Helix Guardian in the Jungle. The prime helix is the strongest neutral creep in the game.

, Lanes are important in Paragon. Your choosing a lane all depends on the role of the hero you chose, as each lane is slightly different from one another. Some heroes don't even play in lanes; they kill neutral minions in the jungle.



Midlane - This is usually a solo lane, and the lane where your mages and ability carries go, or heroes who use primarily strong abilities to harass the enemy .







Offlane or the left lane - This lane is primarily for the heroes that are able to do well on their own. This lane is shorter than the safe lane, and can be harder to farm close to you tower in comparison.







Safelane or the right lane - This is usually a two-person lane that inhabits the carry and the support class. The lane is ideal for farming close to your tower, or for hard pressuring your opponent and taking their tower.







The Jungle - The jungle is where heroes who are built to farm neutral minions go. You farm camps, and within camps you gain different type of buffs from different coloured camps, each colour having a buff associated with it, and different effects with that buff.







, Experience is essential and important to you in the world of Paragon. It helps you level up abilities, and also allows you to gain card points so you can buy cards, to buy equipment, upgrade it, and so on.


Card Experience - Card experience of CXP is used by you to gain card points that allow for the purchase of cards. It is given from killing minions, structures, as well as the amber link.

Hero Experience - Hero experience or XP is used to raised Hero Level, which allows you to upgrade abilities and so on. There are give ways to gain normal experience: killing a hero, assisting in killing a hero, killing/being around a minion death, destroying structures, as well as neutral monsters within the jungle.

Amber Links - This is a mechanism in game that generates CXP every time an ally kills a white minion or a green guardian. Amber links are emptied every 2 minutes and each team member equally gains the experience. The enemy can steal CXP from it.

, Killing the enemy is the most important step to Paragon. If you're not killing enemy minions, and getting experience from them, you will be killing enemy heroes. Killing enemy heroes will give you the most experience, and can determine how hard you can push into their base, as well as if you will win the game or not.

, Though farming and killing heroes is important, destroying structures is the only true way you can win. With certain structures destroyed, you can force your way into enemy territory as well as avoid more damage, or even allow you to gain special ‘super minions’ to help your team.



Towers - There are two towers in each lane. They attack minions of the opposing team, and can do a considerable amount of damage to you and your team. Towers are essential to destroy as they give experience, card power, as well as pushes the lane and their destruction are key to victory.

Inhibitors - Inhibitors are the last protection before the core can be destroyed, they produce minions, consisting of ranged melee and siege. There are three of them per team, and if they're destroyed, your team will gain a “super minion” they have higher health and cause more damage.

The Core - The primary objective in the map; you cannot target it until one of the inhibitors on the enemies side is destroyed. With the destruction of the core, your team wins.

, The final key for you to play Paragon well is to play with your team. Listening and working together can be beneficial for all. Don’t expect others to know what you are thinking, or understand your strategy; you have to tell them, Paragon is a team/online game and to get the most out of it you need to work together."

Heavy against lancer.",How to Play Pawn Tactics,";
, Forts allow you to fire bullets down at your opponents with out getting hit yourself. It is also called height advantage.

, Hold mouse down before releasing to get a farther throw.

, Only heavy, guards, and assaulters have them.


assaulters can kill practically anything for as long as you are skilled enough, heavies can destroy almost all classes except for guards and lancers. Lancers can destroy basically anything but are frequently killed by recons, assaulters, and even supports in a defense. Supporters have powerful shotguns that is capable of defeating a recon at close range. However, due to the reloading issues, they can be easily killed in open fields.

, Don't just stand in one place and shoot. Move around so that not all of the bullets are hitting you..


Guards have a special defense mode call ""shields up.""
This can easily be destroyed if you have explosives or move behind the guard.

assaulters vs guards. Always save your grenades for the last. If a guard comes up to you with shield up, you should try to kill it by first blinding it with a flash and then go behind his shield and attack him.
Recons against heavies. Switch to mp5 and start firing from a position of advantage.
Lancer against recons. Switch to automatic pistol and move backwards as the recon chase you.
Support against heavy/guards/assaulters. Fire once, dodge behind a wall and wait for reload. Fire again, and then dodge again.



, Try to hide behind wall and fire at the lancers.




Maulers against recons. blast the recons with explosives and remember that it only take two careful aims to kill one recon.
Mauler against guards. Continuously moving left to right and fire straight at the guards.
One against all. This situation occasionally arises when too many people leaves the game. In this situation, heavies and maulers are the best class.

Attack instead of defend.",How to Play Nova in Heroes of the Storm," Nova’s trait allows her to enter Stealth mode after 3 seconds of not shooting or getting shot. Combine the trait with Nova’s high-damage auto-attack and Sniper skill, and you have the best single-target assassin in the game. Nova also has a Pinning Shot that slows targets, and can project a decoy at will, to cause confusion. All of Nova’s usefulness comes from her huge burst damage that allows her to swing the tide of most battles in a matter of seconds. Picking the wrong skill with Nova can seriously cripple her damage output, greatly reducing her use to the team. To get the highest damage possible by level 9, these are the skills that should be taken:

Ambush Snipe at level 1 - 20% extra damage to the Snipe skill for one second after leaving stealth is a lot, especially during late game.
Gathering Power at level 4 - Extra ability power means extra damage to all skills. Warning: stacks of gathering power will be lost upon death!
Anti-Armor Shells at level 7 - This will greatly lower Nova’s attack rate, but it will increase the damage by a lot. Perfect for applying as much burst damage as possible.;
, Nova has a unique play style, so unlike other heroes, Nova should never stay on a single lane. Nova is a hero that requires constant movement between lanes, attacking low-health heroes whenever the opportunity arises. Nova can force just about all squishy heroes to stay near their towers or face death., Especially if there’s a Gazlowe or Sylvanas on the enemy team, Nova should be stalking the enemy camps when possible. At these low levels, all heroes will have problems clearing camps quickly, so it’s an easy opportunity for a good Nova player to not only get a kill on a hero, but maybe also a free mercenary camp! This is one of the easiest ways to get hero kills in the early game, and it’s also a viable strategy after level 10., Nova should be able to single-handedly kill the enemy damage dealer after level 10, if no healer is around. As Nova, you should always try to focus the enemy damage dealer during team fights, if you can’t kill him before the fight! To make sure that the damage dealer goes down as quickly as possible, these are the skills that should be taken:

Triple Tap at level 10 – One of the highest damage single-target ultimates in the game. Warning: it can be easily interrupted, and any hero or building that gets in the way of the shot will take the damage instead of the target.
Lethal Decoy at level 14 – Causes decoys to deal 25% of Nova’s damage. This may not seem like a lot, but the decoys also use Snipe and can deal a fair amount of damage before disappearing.
Double Fake at level 16 – Two decoys for the price of one. Combine with the previous skill and you have an extra 50% damage caused by decoys alone. The confusion factor is also something that should not be overlooked!, Focusing the enemy damage dealer can be difficult at times, especially during heated team battles. This is why it’s always better to try to isolate the damage dealer before a fight starts. You can either lure him or her by shooting and then running away, or you can use decoys.

Warning: enemy damage dealers will stop chasing you after several kills this way, but you should be able to kill them if they’ve lost any health before the engagement.

, Always choose your engagement wisely! Going in at the wrong time will certainly mean death, as Nova has no escape mechanisms other than her trait. Attacking the damage dealer when he has other teammates around is not a good idea, so it’s important to know when to attack and when to retreat., One of the worst things you could do during the late game (after level 19) is to die. This may see obvious, but the death timers are huge after that level, and knowing that Nova is dead will cause the enemy team to become more daring in their attack. It’s always best to retreat while you can, even if this means missing out on a kill!, Once again you will be stalking objectives and enemy mercenary camps. This time, however, make sure you stalk the boss sites as well, since most enemy teams will now try to get the boss before pushing toward your base.

Don’t let the enemy team kill the boss to try and take it later! Kill enemy heroes while they’re doing the boss to prevent them from taking it. Time your attack right before the boss stuns, and you may be able to get several kills at once.

, Nova can’t defend against enemy minions waves since all of her damage is single target and her attack speed is extremely low. This means that it’s always best to leave the defending to another hero, and go out looking for enemy heroes to kill. Make sure you get Fast Reload at level 20 to allow you to use your ultimate to get as many kills as possible. It’s one of the most game changing ultimates in the game when used properly."

Pick the right legendary.",How to Win Using Rogue in Hearthstone," Hearthstone is an online trading card game (TCG) that is designed to allow players to enjoy the fun of TCG duels online. It is somewhat a toned-down Magic: The Gathering for its simple mechanics yet strategic approach to TCG.;
, For you to win in a Hearthstone duel, you must deplete your opponent’s hit points (HP) to zero.


If you depleted your deck, no problem. In Hearthstone, an empty deck does not result in defeat. Instead, you will just receive fatigue damage on each of your following turns.

, Hearthstone players will have heroes to choose from before they enter the duel. These heroes will each have a unique ability that will aid you in defeating your opponent. Hero abilities cost 2 mana.

, Hearthstone cards are divided into three categories: minions, spells, and weapons.


Hearthstone cards cost mana. They can only be used if you meet the exact amount of mana they require.

, Attacking your enemy is simple: you must first select the card you’d like to use for the attack; it may be a weapon, a spell, or a minion. After selecting your card, simply select the target of that attack. You can attack an enemy minion or the enemy hero directly.

, The name of your hero is Valeera Sanguinar, and she really means business! Her style is to bombard her enemy with damage and to finish off the match when her enemy least expects it. Her hero ability is to equip herself a weapon with one damage for two turns.


If you have no decent play on your turn, use your hero ability to damage your opponent instead with your equipped weapon.
The Rogue class is heavy on combos. Make sure to take advantage of this effect to increase the damage you deal your enemies. You can do so by playing a card first before playing the card with the combo effect. Some of the combo cards you should utilize are Cold Blood (+buff), Eviscerate (+damage) and SI:7 Agent(+damage effect).

, The play style popular for the Rogue is called Miracle Rogue because in order for this play style to work, it takes a lot of luck in drawing the cards. Really risky, but once you get the cards you need, you can already claim victory on the very next turn! It is very popular because of its burst attacks which catch your enemy off-guard for your powerful finisher.


Miracle Rogue relies heavily on one minion card, the Gadgetzan Auctioneer. Since Rogue spells cost insanely low (some even cost no mana), this allows you to draw lots of cards as you play spells while Gadgetzan Auctioneer is on the field.
Until Gadgetzan Auctioneer appears on your hand, keep your enemy busy with your hero ability, and use some of your removal spells if you feel like you are starting to get overwhelmed with strong enemy minions.
Ideally, you would want to get hold of Leeroy Jenkins and two Shadowstep cards to deliver the final blow on your opponent on the very next turn. A Cold Blood is a nice addition, too, for its buffing effect.
Summon Leeroy Jenkins, attack, use Shadowstep, summon Leeroy Jenkins again, and attack directly. It is best to use this if your opponent’s life is 12HP below so the game ends with this burst attack.

, Since Miracle Rogue relies heavily on the Gadgetzan Auctioneer and low-cost spells, there aren’t many minions included in this deck. However, the only Rogue-exclusive minion included in this deck still has damage effect.



SI:7 Agent is the minion that should be played after you play another card to take advantage of its combo effect. It deals 2 damage to any character when its combo is triggered.

, Not a lot of minions here, but of course the star of your deck is the Gadgetzan Auctioneer. The other minions are rather supporting casts to this elaborate play style.



Earthen Ring Farseer. This minion’s healing effect could buy you more time while waiting for your Gadgetzan Auctioneer. It has a decent HP to stay on the board for a couple of turns.

Azure Drake. Since you should be constantly drawing to fish for your elusive Gadgetzan Auctioneer, this minion can be very useful. It allows you to draw when it is summoned, and its spell damage boost can also be helpful when used with Fan of Knives and with other damaging spells.

Gadgetzan Auctioneer. Finally, the star of the deck! This minion allows you to draw a card every time you use a spell. So, with so many spells costing 2 mana and less—it’s raining cards when you have this minion on the board. After a few draws, you’d finally have the perfect finishing combo to defeat your opponent.

, Now, this is where the Rogue shines. It has a lot of low-cost spells that either buff, damage, or execute other cool effects. Again, reserve some spells, and use them when you already have Gadgetzan Auctioneer on your board for maximum effect.



Backstab. For no mana cost, you can deal 2 damage to an undamaged minion. Use this to remove low HP enemy minions.

Shadowstep. This spell costs zero mana, and it returns a friendly minion back to your hand. This minion now costs 2 less to summon. Imagine using this with Leeroy Jenkins! In short, this is very important for your final assault.

Preparation. You know that Rogue spells cost either so little or cost nothing like this spell, but this even stresses that advantage by making your next spell cast cost 3 less mana. This can be useful in using spells that are not as cheap. It virtually makes them zero cost to play!

Deadly Poison. This spell buffs your weapon’s attack for just one mana. It’s very useful for direct attacks and enemy minion removals with 3HP below.

Cold Blood. Another card with combo effect, use this spell’s combo and you‘ll be able to buff a minion’s attack by 4. Again, this can be useful on your burst attack with Leeroy Jenkins.

Conceal. The primary use of this spell is to put your Gadgetzan Auctioneer in stealth so it can’t be targeted by your opponent and can be used again on your next turn.

Blade Flurry. This deals damage to all enemy characters equal to your weapon’s attack value. Use this while your weapon has Deadly Poison for maximum effect.

Shiv. This spell deals one damage to any character plus it allows you to draw a card. A very nifty spell to damage enemy characters and to increase the chance of drawing your finishing cards.

Eviscerate. Another damaging spell that could deal up to 4 damage when its combo is utilized. Use this for stronger enemy minions or to damage your opponent directly.

Sap. This spell card could really save you in tight situations. It forcefully returns an enemy minion back to its owner. It’s a real lifesaver! Use it on enemy minions that are really strong such as legendaries.

Fan of Knives. Another area effect card that deals one damage to all enemy minions and, like Shiv, allows you to draw a card. This can be helpful in clearing your enemy’s side of the board.

, A couple of legendaries are important in completing the Miracle Rogue deck.



Bloodmage Thalnos. Again, it’s a low-cost legendary that boosts spell damage. It gels well with what this deck is all about: small drops with big effects!

Leeroy Jenkins. This, combined with Shadowstep spells, is the ideal finisher for this deck. This combo deals 18 damage in one turn! So the idea is to draw your deck until you find these essential cards for your final blow.

Edwin VanCleef. Another legendary that benefits from playing lots of cards in one turn is Edwin VanCleef. It gains 2/2 each time you play a card that turn! Top the turn with Conceal to this legendary, and your opponent will be worrying about it on your next turn for sure.

Pick the right legendary.",How to Win Using Shaman in Hearthstone," Hearthstone is an online TCG (Trading Card Game) that enables you to challenge anyone in the world to a card duel. It works like most of the TCG games out there, but Hearthstone made it easier even for beginners to understand.;
, Winning the duel just means depleting your opponent’s health (HP) to zero.


Unlike other TCGs, depleting your deck does not make you lose the match. You just deal damage to yourself each turn you aren’t able to draw anything from your deck.

, Both players will have their own heroes to use plus access to their specific hero powers. These powers or abilities can be triggered by clicking the hero ability icon just right beside the player’s hero avatar.

, Hearthstone cards are divided into three categories: minions, spells, and weapons. These cards can be used when you have acquired enough mana equal to their usage cost.

, Attacking simply means clicking on your minion and directing its attack at your target. You can target an enemy minion or the hero directly. Spells also work the same way. Just choose the spell you want to cast and then choose the target you want to affect.

, The name of your hero is Thrall, and his power lies in totems. Mind you, these totems vary and sometimes that’s a good thing. There’s a 1/1 totem, a 0/2 taunt totem, a 0/2 healer totem, and a 0/2 spell buffer totem. With these, how can you have an empty board?


If you have nothing decent to play, just summon a totem. This still gives you at least board presence.
Some of the powerful Shaman minions have overload. Meaning, after activating these cards, some mana crystals will be locked on your next turn, so be aware of this and plan ahead before using that card with overload. Plan ahead by making sure you can still play a card despite the locked mana crystals on your next turn.

, Due to the nature of the Shaman’s hero ability, it is obvious that its play style will revolve around board dominance. Just keep your side of the board with minions and buff whenever possible.


Winning success of the Shaman relies heavily on what you draw on your first four turns. Hopefully, you have decent summons that could actually stay on the board so you can establish your dominance.
Mid-game and endgame are the parts where the Shaman really shines, so make sure you survive the first turns, and you’ll be in good shape.

, Your minions should be a mixture of normal minions and minions with overload. Remember, choose strong minions because you will have unlimited totems to cover for your early game minion supply.



Flame tongue Totem. This totem buffs adjacent minions with 2 attack. Ideally, you put this totem in between two of your other totems, and start causing damage.

Unbound Elemental. This is the most important Shaman overload minion since it buffs itself whenever you play a card with overload effect. Having a base HP of 4, it already has proven its value for just 3 mana cost.

Fire Elemental. This could be the strongest Shaman-exclusive minion without the downside of overload. It boasts a 6/5 stat and even deals 3 damage to a character. Really a momentum shifter once dropped to the board.

, Since you have a lot of overload cards, it is wise to use minions that actually benefit with this effect. If not, better to choose minions that will give you additional defense and boost on your spell damage capability.



Defender of Argus. This minion gives adjacent minions taunt and plus one for both attack and HP. This does two things: first, it makes your 0/2 totems with attacking power, and secondly, it makes use of other minions with taunt.

Azure Drake. This minion is actually effective not only to Shaman, but it seems to work well with any other class. This is so because not only does it give you an additional draw when it is summoned, but it also gives plus one on your spell damage (which you have a lot of).

, Shaman has lots of spells that stop threats instantly, and some deal damage to enemy characters. This balances Thrall’s minion dominance with enemy minion removal with these spells.



Earth Shock. This spell simply nullifies a minion’s effect and is very useful in removing taunt abilities.

Rockbiter Weapon. This spell deals 3 damage on any character. This can be very useful in removing low-health enemy minions, and it only costs one mana.

Lightning Bolt. Again, for just one mana, this spell does 3 damage to any character. The only downside is that it gives you one overload. The good thing is, if you have an Unbound Elemental on the board, it will be buffed by this spell.

Feral Spirit. This spell summons 2 minions with taunt. What a value for just 2 mana! This will make it hard for your enemy to charge you with attacks early in the game. Again, this gives an overload effect.

Lightning Storm. A very important spell if you need to wipe off minions on your opponent’s side of the board. This deals 3 to 4 damage to all enemy minions, and it gives you 2 overload.

Hex. Imagine you find yourself against a super powerful legendary, and all you’ve got on your side of the board are totems. What now? This is where the Hex saves the day! This nifty spell transforms any minion, including legendaries, to a 0/1 minion with taunt.

, Because of the strong normal minions the Shaman has, legendaries aren’t that necessary for Thrall to win. However, some legendaries will definitely help the Shaman deck enhance its damaging capability.



Bloodmage Thalnos. One of the low-cost legendaries around, this legendary boosts damage spells by one. Not only that, it has a death-rattle effect of drawing a card when it leaves the board.

Al’Akir the Windlord. Al’Akir is an exclusive legendary for the Shaman deck. It has the move Windfury, which allows it to attack twice. Did I mention that it has taunt, divine shield and charge effect, too? Now you know its value. Perfect for finishers!

Once the front of your car is well into the corner, swing wide by slowly releasing the Left arrow key while still accelerating. This will prevent you from hitting the left side wall, and allow you to take the next corner in the same fashion.

, When opponents slow down to negotiate corners, it is your best chance of overtaking them and garnering a good lead.

, When you’re shoved by racers’ cars and when your car slides to an angle of anywhere between 30-60 degrees, a quick burst of Nitrous (tap Left Alt key) will help you straighten it up.

, Doing so allows you to compensate for speed lost while cornering.

This ensures that the position where you place your colony is safe from any early wars. Early wars are the worst scenario you can face in Battle Dawn.
, Try to have a minimum of 1K tokens (reds or blues) before the era starts so that you can take an early lead in the game.

If you don't have any tokens on your main account, and no medals earned in earlier eras, disband your account and make a new one. Plant on servers with tick 500+ in both Battle Dawn and Battle Dawn Galaxies to farm 800-1000 blues. Also make use of free bonuses, such as verifying your email.

, Put on a broadcast that you are sleeping and put ""JW"" after your player name. This should be done because the process to be a top player on Solo worlds will get you rank 1 after tick 30-35, depending on how much you boost. When people see that a player who was rank 50 or 60 at the era start is suddenly rank 1, they will feel you're a professional and will fear you., Build level 1, level 2 and level 3 structures of each - food, metal and oil. Then, build barracks and then a vehicle factory. Assuming you are a blue booster, boost light worker, light metal and light oil. Then, go for building a Beam Weapons factory, Explosive Weapons factory and Damage Units structure. When completed, you will be left with only 100 metal., Don't rush the unit, let it train for 2 ticks. Refresh your client and wait for the ticks to start rolling. Whenever you get any boosts or bonuses, use it mainly for structures. Only use the remainder of a boost for an army., Make sure you are online every 12 ticks to give a boost. Don't always boost oil with metal and workers, only do it when you are low on oil., When finished, with the metal and oil you have, train as many Tanks as possible with Concussive weapons and damage upgrades. Never hurry your units.

After 6 ticks, pack 1 tank in each squad and launch on nearby mines. You will have all the mines near you in no time. After you collect nearby mines, make ops at 6-8 ETA range and move some more Tank spam squads to collect the distant mines.
Use damage units until tick 30. After tick 30, start building your army in the ratio of 7 range tanks : 3 armour tanks. In other words, in 1 tank squad, put 7 range tanks and 3 armor tanks. No damage tanks. Make some level 1 energy structures and upgrade them until level 3.

, Around tick 50, start making allies. Never make a player who is close to you your ally. If you really want to make him your ally, tell him to relocate to a farther spot and let you have the mines in your area., They assure your win by beating the anti-spam squads of your enemy. The structure you should unlock is the Scan (basic and advanced), Spies and Radar structures. Get them to level 3 so that you can build radar posts across the map., Do this on tick 75. Get your radar and gate coverage as far as possible., On tick 125, focus on your resources. Once you have maxed-out the resource structures, continue building armies. Try to figure out your main enemy and know his chassis. Use a single chassis and not a mixed chassis because it dies very easily. When you know his chassis, make 50% of your army anti-soldier/vehicle/tank (depending on what the enemy uses) and the remaining 25% on each of the other two weapon types., Don't make deals to split the map and allow another player's gate and radar coverage close to your hive, unless he is a very trusted player and has spent 3-5 eras allied to you., Seek to make sub-alliances and brother alliances; make sure you know the leader of each one very well and that they are reliable and responsible players. Offer them around 5 mines so they know you care for them. Treat them with respect and make them feel as important as you (main alliance). Make sure that they pick different chassis from yours so that your enemies need to tailor their armies more to combat you., There are some tricks like the Relocate and Lock trick, ETA match, and Tricker for the early game before people have shields; there are also the nuke-firing trick and nuke fields setup trick., When you are moving in an enemy territory with your army to fight him, always keep your own ops at 4-6 ETA range. Never attack your enemy's ops or you will be put on lockdown and virused., Never be in war with more than one top 15 ranked enemy at a time. Make non-aggression pacts with other players who are not allied to you., While you should be active throughout the era, be more active at around tick 500 - 700 because that is the time the relics drop. Scan the relic before attacking. Still send a spam squad and then your army at a delay of 1 tick. This way, you get the battle report of the relic and calculate your losses beforehand through the battle simulator. If the casualties aren't high, go for the relic. When you capture it, immediately make it start moving near your colony if you are far from oceans or at the corner of the oceans. This makes sure the relics are safe.

Capture as many relics as possible. Capture as many relics as you can so you can end the era as fast as possible. When all relics are captured, ask other players if they want to end the era by handing you relics. If not, simply wait until the maximum tick of the server approaches.

, When you win the era, the admin will feed you with a large number of blues and a medal/ribbon. Brag about your medal/ribbon, but not too much. If you're annoying, nobody will want to form alliances with you. Use your blue tokens earned from this era in the next era."

Log in.,
Select your character.,
Connect with your guild.",How to Use the World of Warcraft Armory," It’s the easiest way to load your own armory. To log in, go to http://us.battle.net/wow/en/.;
, Once you are logged in, you should see your character’s name and picture near the top right. You can click on your character’s name and then on “Profile,” and it will take you to your armory. Alternatively, if you just click on the picture of your character, that will also take you to your armory.


If you do not want to log in, you can still view a character’s armory, but you need to know his name and realm. To find a character in the armory, search for him on Battle.net by putting his name in the search box at the top right of the World of Warcraft home page (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/).
Once you have put his name in the search box, click on the magnifying glass on the right to do a search. You should see a list of links on the left under Summary with one link called “Characters.”
When you click on “Characters,” it will display a list of all characters with the name you have searched. It will also show other basic info about the characters, such as level, guild, and realm. To access the armory of any character, click on his name.

, The first thing you will notice on the top left of a character’s armory is his name, title , level, race, class, and realm. Right beneath that, you will also see the character’s achievement points.


You should double-check this info to make sure you are viewing the right character’s armory.

, When you are at the armory, you will be able to see all of the gear that a character currently has equipped. If you move your mouse over a piece of gear, a small window will pop up with more info on that piece of gear so you can get full information on all of its stats.


This is useful to see if you are missing any gems or enchantments on your gear.

, Directly beneath Gear are two sections. On the left section, you will see a character’s stats, and on the right section, you can see his talents and glyphs.


You can move your mouse over any part of this section, and a small window will pop up on your screen with more information on how the attribute affects them.
Let’s say that you are viewing a Fury Warrior’s armory. If you move your mouse over Mastery, a small window would pop up saying something along the line of “Increases physical damage done while Enraged by 5.23%.” The exact percent would depend on his mastery, but this information would tell you how he is affected by the stat.
Only core stats are shown on the armory by default, although you can look at all stats by clicking on the button with the text “Show all stats.”
To the right of character stats is a section labeled “Talents.” This section covers not just his talents, but also his glyphs. Talents are class-specific abilities that you can choose from every 15 levels. In other words, level 15 characters can pick one talent out of three possible talents for their first talent, and then when they reach level 30, they are able to pick one of three possible talents for their second talent.
By the time a character reaches level 90, they will have six talents (out of 18 possible choices). For more information on talents, you can look through the talent calculator. The link is right on the armory under the Talents section.
You will also see Major Glyphs and Minor Glyphs in the Talents section of the armory. Major glyphs enhance a character’s abilities (for example, a major glyph could increase the damage or healing of one of your abilities). Minor glyphs generally don’t provide much actual benefit for your character—they are usually cosmetic. You can move your mouse over a glyph in the armory, and it will pop up a small window with a description of what the glyph does.

, Further below Talents, you can find more detailed information including player vs. player ratings, challenge mode score, professions, pets, and recent activity. You can click on any of these sections to find out even more about the character.


For example, you could be viewing a character’s armory and see under the Professions section that he has 600 in Blacksmithing. If you click on Blacksmithing, it will take you to another page where you can see which Blacksmithing items he’s capable of crafting, and which items he hasn’t yet learned how to craft.

, You will also see a list of all raids in the game, even if the character whose armory you are viewing hasn’t been there.


Similar to most other sections of the armory, a small pop-up window will appear with more information if you move your mouse over an image of a raid.

, On the main page of a character’s armory, there is a list of links to view specific detailed information such as achievements, pets and mounts, challenge mode times, and recent activity. There are also links to trade on the Auction House with your in-game and respond to event invitations, but you must be logged in as your character to use those links.


When you click on Achievements, you will reach a nicely organized page with the number of achievements the character has completed in each achievement category. To take a look at the specific achievements you can go a step further and click on a category to see which achievements they have completed.

For example, if the person you are viewing has completed 73 out of 196 possible achievements in the Quests category, you will see that under the section titled “Progress Overview.” To see which 73 Quest achievements he has completed, click on “Quests” in the list of links to the left.
The achievements the character has completed are listed from the top of the page by the date they were earned. You can see the date the achievement was earned on the right of the achievement. At the end of all completed achievements, you will see unfinished achievements below, in faded text with no completion date.


The armory can also be used to find out which pets and mounts a character owns. To view pets and mounts, click on the Pets and Mounts link on the main page of a character’s armory.

If you are on another section, such as the Achievement section, you will have to click on Summary to return to the main page. Once you have clicked on the Pets and Mounts link, you will at first see the three battle pets the character has set in his active pet slots. Beneath that is a section with his pet collection. If you move your mouse over the image of a pet, a small pop-up window will appear on your page with more information about that pet.


To view all of the mounts in a character’s armory, you will first have to be on the Pets and Mounts section. At the top of the Pets and Mounts page, there are two tabs. The first is labeled “Pet Journal,” and the second is “Mounts.”

Click on Mounts to be taken to a page with all of the mounts that character has collected. If you move your mouse over the image of a mount, a small pop-up window will appear on your page with more information about that mount (such as whether it is a flying mount or a ground mount).
You can also find out where to obtain a mount by moving your mouse over the name of the mount, and a small pop-up window will appear with information about the source of the mount. For example, if you were viewing someone’s mount collection, and saw that he has a Cenarion War Hippogryph, you can move your mouse over the Cenarion War Hippogryph’s name, and a pop-up should appear with the following information.

Requires Level 70
Requires Cenarion Expedition - Exalted
Requires Artisan Riding
Faction: Cenarion Expedition
Vendor: Fedryen Swiftspear
Zone: Zangarmash
Cost: 2,000 Gold


The information will tell you that to in order to obtain a Cenarion War Hippogryph, you must be level 70, you must have an exalted reputation with the Cenarion Expedition, and you also must have learned Artisan Riding. If you want to acquire the Cenarion War Hippogryph, find it from the vendor Fedryen Swiftspear in Zangarmarsh, and it would cost you 2,000 gold.



, Unlike most features on the armory, to trade at the Auction House you have to actually be logged in on your account. If you aren’t yet, at the top of every page on Battle.net is a Log In link. Click on it, and you will be prompted to enter your username and password to log in.


One reason for this important security feature is that trading at the Auction House uses your character’s in-game gold.

, Once you’re logged in on your own armory page, you can access the Auction House. The link to the Auction House is called “Auctions,” and it is located to the left of your character, on the list of links beginning with Summary.


Once you click on Auctions, you will be taken to a page with basic info about your current auctions (items you have placed at the Auction House to sell), and bids (items you have placed bids to purchase).
There are also four links: Buy, Sell, Bids, and Auctions. The Bids link will take you to a list of specific information on each item that you have placed a bid on. The Auctions link will take you to a list of specific information on each item that you have placed at the Auction House to sell.
If you want to place an item at the Auction House to sell through the website, click on “Sell.” It will show a list of all items in your inventory and bank box.
To select an item to sell, click on it and you will be prompted to fill in the settings of your auction, such as starting bid and auction duration.
You will also see a section called “Deposit Total” with an amount in gold or silver. The Deposit Total depends on the item you are placing for sale, but it will never be lower than 1 silver. You will be charged the Deposit Total simply for listing your item at the Auction House, even if your item does not sell.

, If you want to browse the Auction House for items to purchase, click on “Buy,” and you will see a list of items that other people have placed on the Auction House for sale. You can click on “Bid” or “Buyout” to purchase the item through your armory.


If there is a certain item you are looking for, you can search for it by name by filling in the field “Item Name:” at the top of the page. Note that you will only be able to see 200 items at a time.

, After purchasing an item on the Auction House, it will be sent directly to your character through the mail system. You can pick up your item from any mailbox. Mailboxes are located in every major city and also near most inns across the world.


If you have successfully sold an item at the auction, you will be able to pick up the money from the sale through the mail also.
If your auction has expired without a sale, your item will be returned to you via the mail. Finally, if you have placed a bid on an item and someone else outbids you, the money you have placed to bid will be returned to you via the mail.

, If you want to check on the status of an auction you have placed a bid on, or if you want to see if anyone has placed a bid on items you have put up for auction, you can go to the “Bids” or “Auctions” page from the links on the Auction House page of the Armory.


The “Bids” page displays a list of all bids you have placed on auctions that have not ended, as well as completed auctions that you have won with the highest bid, or completed auctions you have placed a bid on but were outbid.
The “Auctions” page displays a list of all your active auctions, as well as all auctions that have recently been finished whether your item has sold or not.

, If you have an iPhone, iPod Touch ,or an Android phone, then you can also take the armory with you on the go by downloading the Mobile Armory.


Download the app from Google Play if you are using Android, or directly from Battle.net at http://us.battle.net/wow/en/shop/mobile-armory/.
If you are using an iPhone or iPod, download the app from iTunes.

, Since there are different versions of Android and iTunes, the exact steps to install the Mobile Armory may vary slightly. Basically, once you are in the Apps or Apps store section of your device, search for “World of Warcraft.” The exact title of the app is “World of Warcraft Armory,” and the author is “Blizzard Entertainment Inc.”


You may be prompted for payment details or authorization, but do not worry, the app is free to use. There should be a button called “Skip,” which will let you bypass any payment details.

, Once you have downloaded the app, log in by running the app, and put in your Battle.net username and password.


If you are having problems logging in, check and make sure that Region is set to “Americas and Oceanic.” Sometimes, Battle.net routinely goes offline for server maintenance (usually scheduled on Tuesday) or other reasons. You will not be able to log in if Battle.net is offline.

, After logging in, you should see several buttons, namely Auction House, Events, My Characters, Talent Calculator, Realm Status, and others.


Make sure that you first go into the My Characters section to select the character you want to use.
If you are checking on Realm Status, it doesn’t matter which character you are logged in as, but if you are going to be placing bids or items at the Auction House, it’s important to ensure that you are on the right character.

, If you are in a guild, one of the buttons you will see in the Mobile Armory after logging in is “Guild Chat.” Tap on it, and you will be taken to a page with your guild’s message of the day, and a list of all members in your guild members who are currently online.


Most of the functions of the Mobile Armory are nearly identical to the web armory, though the information is a bit condensed since it’s designed to be accessed through mobile device rather than a PC. Guild Chat is the one main feature that is available on the Mobile Armory but not on the web armory.
You can either click on the guild message of the day to enter the regular guild channel, and view or send messages to everyone at once as you would in the game by using the /g command. If you click on a person’s name, you will then be taken to a page where you can send him or her a private whisper that only the two of you will be able to see.

Choose a reasonable, quality headset.,
Select your surroundings carefully.,
Switch on voice chat.,
Be polite and respectful.,
Think before you swear.,
Modulate your volume.,
Be a good teammate.,
Be a good sport with your opponents.",How to Use Gaming Voice Chat Responsibly," Most commercial headsets will do, but try to pick a pair that doesn't let sound bleed out of the speakers too badly.  This can cause audio doubling, which is a severe annoyance. If you can, pick one with a good, quality microphone.

Don't get cheated when you buy.  Buy online where it is far cheaper to shop for electronics.  There are plenty of budget headsets for people on a tight dime that are very high quality.;
, Try to pick a nice, quiet place to play, where background audio won't be picked up by the microphone.  Total elimination of background noise is impossible, but it should be reduced wherever possible.

Make sure the cords of your headset are unobstructed.  You don't want your headset to be unplugged mid-chat.
If you must have music, please don't play it from a device in the background.  Play it on your computer.  Nobody wants to hear music filtered through your microphone.

,

Do a quick microphone check.  The settings menu of your computer should be able to tell you how much sound your microphone is picking up.
On a Windows computer, type 'Manage Audio Devices' into the search bar, and you'll find it.
You may have to enable voice chat in the game.  This will usually be found in the settings or options menu.
If the game has its own mic check, give it a quick try to see how you sound to other players.
If you think you sound good, go right on ahead.

, Humans are possessed of a competitive spirit, but that's no excuse to fly off the handle.  Watch your language when talking to the people around you.

A rule of thumb for etiquette over the headset is this: if you wouldn't say it to their face, don't say it over a headset. Specifically, refrain from racial, ethnic, or homophobic slurs.

,  This depends a lot on the game. If you're playing a T-Rated game, there might be sensitive ears playing. For an M-Rated game, you have more leeway.

If you do swear, though, do not do so excessively.  Nobody wants to play with the man who's screaming his face red and uses the F-word before every noun, subject, and verb. Refrain from racial, ethnic, or homophobic slurs.

,  If you're playing on a headset and chatting, chances are that other people are as well.

Please do not scream, scream, or sing. Nobody wants to hear it. Seriously, nobody has ever said ""I'm glad he started singing.  Our game was really improved by that guy who stumbled through 'Freebird'.""

, Great and speak to your teammates politely.

Do not heckle your teammates, nor pester them with repeated requests.
Do not romantically solicit your teammates.  Just no.
Contribute to the team.  Let them know when there's a less obvious threat on the playing field.

, Don't be overtly malicious.  Trash talk is all well and good, but don't let it go too far. Don't threaten your opponents with verbal, physical, or any form of assault, and don't threaten their families.

Be a graceful winner.  Congratulate them on a well-played game, and be on your way.
Be a graceful loser.  A quick 'Good Game' goes a long way.

Make sure that you have the right class.,
Now you need to have a ship.,
When using the Minotaur, you can play either play Defensive, or Offensive.,
If you are trying to knock a ship backwards, why not add a little spin to it?",How to Use the Minotaur Cannon in Guns of Icarus Online," The best two types of ammunition for the Minotaur Cannon, are Heavy clip (Use heavy clip to snip enemies at long ranges) and also Greased Rounds (When the enemy is close, you would use greased, as it has more ammo and more damage).;
, For the Minotaur, it is a support weapon meaning that on its own, it isn't very effective. The combinations that the Minotaur is commonly used in is ""Hades, Minotaur, Heavy Flak"" and ""Hades, Minotaur Light Flak"". The two best ships for this setup is the Spire and the Galleon.

, You can defend a point in king of the hill by knocking the enemies back, or you can push them out the way and into a rock. You will need to choose one, Deathmatch would normally be Offensive, and King of the hill and crazy king would be Defensive.

, The further away from the ships center of mass, the more spin. If someone is maybe trying to ram you with Kerosene, you would knock them back, which slows them down, and then spin them as when a pilot is using Kerosene it is very hard to steer. Once they are spun then they are heading off target really fast, and if you can time it perfectly you could even ram them into a wall, destroying their hull armour and them shoot them with the Light/Heavy Flak to finish them off.

Achieve a minimum of level 25 by following the quests in the game and by killing monsters which spawn periodically in the different islands in order to have access to all the different moves.,

Place your right middle finger on 7 on the number-pad.,
If you would like to use the other power moves on key 5 which is the ‘Lunging Double strike’, key 8 which is the ‘Flash Kick’ and key 9 which is the ‘Spinning strike’ feel free to do so by extending out your right middle finger to the appropriate keys.",How to Use the Number Keys in Playing Sherwood Dungeon," The number row and the keypad on the keyboard are used for controlling the different moves. Traditionally in the older versions of the game, the shift and control keys were used with the letters z,x,c,v and more, however, the new era of players now mostly use number keys.;
, (Ensure number lock is enabled) When all the fingers are placed in the spots described, this is the neutral position.

, Pressing 1 will cause your avatar to execute a normal attack. This attack does low to medium damage and has 3 different animations. It is used commonly throughout the fight. It requires no Stamina to execute. Be careful not to keep mindlessly attacking. When you attack, your health stops recharging.

, Pressing 2 will cause your avatar to execute a normal block which if you hold the key down, will go up and down. When the guard is down, you ‘’’can’’’ be attacked, so don’t just keep holding it down. Tapping is far more effective. Blocking is the most important skill. Don’t underestimate it. In Sherwood Dungeon, your health ‘’’only’’’ regenerates while you are either standing still or blocking. Hence blocking is very important.


As you can see, it is only at the point in the blocking animation shown on the avatar labelled 2 where you are actually protected from attack.
As soon as the animation moves to parts 1 and 3 the block is no longer covering your attack. This is the position you want to aim for in attacking your enemy when he/she is blocking and the point you want to avoid when blocking.

, Pressing 3 will cause your avatar to execute a magical talisman attack. Make sure to equip a talisman on your avatar by dragging the talisman from your inventory onto your talisman slot. Performing a talisman attack allows you to cause damage even if your opponent is blocking. This attack hits no matter what. However, you must wait for the Talisman Bar to recharge after each use. Each recharge lasts around 8-10 seconds. This attack does medium to large damage.

, This is a duplicate of your left hand placement which enables you to normal attack with either your left or your right hand.

, Pressing 6 will enable your avatar to perform a ‘reverse hammer strike’ which is a power move. This attack does normal to low damage. It is the fastest when compared to all the attacks and thus is very useful in combos and for surprising your enemy.


You must wait for the Green Stamina Bar to recharge after each use. Each recharge lasts around 5-6 seconds.

, Pressing 7 will enable your avatar to perform a ‘spinning hook kick’ which is a power move. This attack does medium to high damage. It is difficult to block and is arguably the best attack to use in fighting.


You must wait for the Green Stamina Bar to recharge after each use. Each recharge lasts around 5-6 seconds.

, All these attacks also use stamina However, maintain the basic hand positions by returning the fingers to the neutral position when you are done.

When deciding what to upgrade, remember that for most skills you’ll receive an upgrade within 14 levels.,
Try to base your upgrade choices on your play-style.",How to Upgrade in Everquest 2 Ranger1," This means that if, for example, you find a rare towards the end of a tier, and you should avoid upgrading a skill that you got at the beginning of the tier, as it will be replaced quite soon.

, If you solo and/or kite a lot, then upgrading certain ranged attacks first will be the best choice (see section 4.2.2. for advice on the best attacks to use in kiting) If, however, you prefer to play in groups, you’ll want to upgrade the attacks you use the most often in groups.


When choosing upgrades at the level cap, bear in mind that the last few levels in a given tier will not be upgraded in the next expansion that comes. This is due to the 14-level upgrade rule – this means those very high-level skills are good upgrade choices, as you will be using them a long time.

"
"
It isn't recommended that you spend money on upgrading anything in tiers one and two unless you have a lot of rare or money on hand.",How to Upgrade in Everquest 2 Ranger2," Since most skills are replaced every 14 levels, and you will level relatively quickly at this stage, there is not much point in putting a high priority on adept III upgrades.


If you’re lucky enough during these levels to harvest rare that can be used in making spell upgrades, then Shrouded Strike and Shadow Blade are your two best options for adept III damage skills.;
"
"
In tier three, Shadow Flame and Lightning Strike are the two skills you should consider upgrading first.",How to Upgrade in Everquest 2 Ranger3," They are both short recast skills (10 seconds or less), so you will be using them a lot, and that makes them ideal options for upgrading.


Shadow Lunge is another strong option, as it’s the hardest-hitting skill in this tier.

"
"
Tier four doesn't contain many good upgrade options.",How to Upgrade in Everquest 2 Ranger4," Many of your skill lines are due for upgrades in the first few levels of tier five.


In this tier, Crippling Blade is your best choice for upgrading to adept III.
Your second choice should be Honed Reflexes, which is the skill made available with the Bloodlines expansion pack. You do not need to own the expansion to purchase an apprentice IV or adept III version of this skill. Honed reflexes are a short duration self-haste so it is well worth upgrading.

"
"
In tier five, a lot of the main ranger attacks get new versions so there are many great choices for upgrading in this tier.,
Before you spend your hard-earned money for Run escape money, it is best to remember the pointers mentioned above.",How to Upgrade in Everquest 2 Ranger5,"


Long shank and Tangle thorn are top choices because they’re fast refresh staple attacks that don’t rely on any particular damage type.
Blazing Thrust is another good fast-refresh attack that’s a great upgrade option.
Culling the Herd and Triple Fire should be your first choices for bow skill upgrades, followed closely by Storm of Arrows, which is a fantastic high-damage AE bow attack that really benefits from the upgrade to adept III. It is devastating in a group where you are fighting many multiple mob encounters.

, These will guide you to come up with the best deals on these products.

Travel to the Yellow Jack Inn.It is located southeast of the Sandy Shores airfield.,
Walk up to the dartboard to start a game.,
Choose the amount of sets and legs per set you want to play.,
Throw darts for your first turn.,
Throw darts for your next turn.,
Throw your winning dart.",How to Throw Darts in GTA V," If you want to play darts while hanging out with another character, call them on your cell phone and pick them up before travelling to the Yellow Jack Inn.;
, The closest NPC will be chosen as your opponent if you are not playing with a friend. If it is your first time playing, you will be shown a brief tutorial.

, You can choose up to 5 legs per set, and up to 15 sets per game of darts. If you want to win a game quickly for the 100% checklist requirement, you can choose to play only one leg of one set.

, You will throw three darts per turn. To win, you must be the first to reduce your score from 301 to 0.If you want to win the game as quickly as possible, aim for the middle ring in the section marked “20.” Landing all three darts there will reduce your score by 180 points.


The numbers around the dartboard represent the point value for each section. Throwing a dart onto the white or black areas will reduce your score by that point value.
If a dart lands on the outermost ring, you’ll reduce your score by double the point value.
If it lands on the middle ring, your score will be reduced by triple the point value.
Throwing a dart onto the ring around the bullseye will reduce your score by 25 points, while landing it on the bullseye will reduce your score by 50 points.
You can steady your aim once per leg, but it only lasts a moment. To steady your aim, either hold down the right trigger (on Xbox and Playstation consoles) or the right mouse button if you’re playing on a PC.

, To do this most efficiently, aim your first dart for another triple 20. For your second dart, aim for the white area of the 11 point section. This will set you up for a win with a bullseye.


Alternatively, you can aim for a triple 20, then a triple 7. Doing this will set you up for a win with with a double 40, which is easier to hit than a bullseye.

, If you set yourself up for a bullseye win, try your best to accurately aim for the bullseye. Otherwise, try to land on a double 40. If you missed any of the previous points, you will need to do the math to figure out the most efficient way to get to 0 with a bullseye or double.


If you are on your last dart of your second turn and need an odd point value to win, this will require another turn. For instance, if you have 17 points to go, it will take another turn, since you cannot score 17 points with a bullseye or double.
If your score dips below 0, your score will stay the same as before that turn. It will then be your opponent’s turn to throw a dart.

Capture a Boss Golem and escort it down the enemy lane.",How to Start Strong in Heroes of the Storm," One of the most effective ways to get an early-game advantage is to form a roaming tag-team that focuses solely on taking down vulnerable enemy heroes. Ideal candidates for this task should have effective control abilities and strong burst potential that can make the most of the element of surprise. This not only gives your team experience while denying the enemy team experience from soaking lanes, but frequent and deadly ganks can demoralize some players to the point that they either play too conservatively or they start bickering amongst themselves. You will want at least one hero with a good control ability that will slow and/or stun your targets. The other hero should ideally have a similar control ability, although an assassin with very strong burst damage will work just as well.

For assassins, you have Nova, Zeratul, Kerrigan, Thrall, The Butcher, Jaina, and Kael’thas.
For warriors, you have Diablo, Muradin, Anub’arak, Stitches, Johanna, Leoric, Arthas, and Sonya.
For supports, you have Uther, Tyrande, and Rehgar.
For specialists, you have Murky, Nazeebo, and Sylvanas.;
, Chatting and using contextual map pings will help you coordinate with your ganking partner. Start by telling them your intent to start a roaming gank team. Once your partner understands what you want to do, you can then move out to begin your roaming gank., You will want to hit targets that are soft, vulnerable, and overextending themselves. Assassins, supports, and specialists with low health pools and no escape abilities make for great gank targets. All classes, even warriors, are viable gank targets if they are on their own in a lane and are way too far from their forts and towers.

If you see only three or four enemy heroes on the map, it will be worth your time to scout out the mercenary camps on their side of the map. Catching enemy heroes fighting mercenaries gives you two bonuses: a free kill and a free mercenary camp.

, Use the fog of war to your advantage and pop out from behind the hero you want to gank. Throw down your disabling skills and do as much damage as you can before the hero can reach the safety of its towers and forts. This should kill soft, vulnerable targets while forcing harder targets to retreat and heal up, losing experience in the process., Whether your gank fails or succeeds, you need to move to the next target. Immediately hide in the fog of war and start threatening other lanes. This will force the enemy team to play more defensively; making them more fearful to the point that they start losing experience and will not want to move out unless they have other players around to help them out., On the other side of the spectrum, you’ll also need to keep at least one hero in each lane to soak experience. Your team will only gain experience from enemy minions if you have at least one hero near those minions when they die. Keeping a hero in all lanes and successfully soaking experience can give your team the advantage in levels and in talents. Even if your team is not winning fights that often, you won’t necessarily fall too far behind in levels because you’ve been dutifully soaking experience.

Some heroes are particularly well-suited for soaking experience from lanes, either by being able to defend it against multiple heroes or by being able to harass enemy heroes so much that they cannot stay in their lane for too long without taking significant damage. Virtually all ranged heroes as long as you play conservatively and don’t overextend yourself, especially if the enemy team has two or more heroes roaming around for ganks.
Warriors are generally not ideal for soaking experience as they are exceptionally vulnerable to harassment. Having a nearby support hero is a different story, as their heals allow warriors to dive in and do significant damage without having to teleport back to base all the time.

, Healers will be essential at allowing hard-pressed heroes to stay in their lane. If you are controlling a support hero and notice that one of your teammates is having a hard time in their lane, go to them and keep their health topped up so that they can stay in-lane to keep soaking experience., If you see a large surge of minions building up on one lane, move to that lane before they reach your forts and towers. This will allow you to not only soak experience from their deaths but will also help deal extra damage so your forts and towers won’t run out of ammunition as quickly as they would without your aid.

Some heroes can soak experience even when they’re focusing on other parts of the map. The Lost Vikings and Abathur are two examples. You can split Vikings off to different lanes to soak experience from the minions dying there, while Abathur can soak experience from multiple lanes by pushing one lane with Locusts and supporting another with his Symbiote. Use these heroes to soak the experience from large surges of enemy minions.

, You can apply strong early pressure by capturing a mercenary camp as soon as they spawn and then assisting those mercenaries as they make a push. This is especially effective if one of your teammates gets the Mercenary Lord talent, which causes nearby mercenaries to do 50% more damage while taking 50% less damage from non-heroic sources. Three or four heroes can thus band together and drive a lane hard. With luck and determination, you could even blast down a fortress to give your team more map control and make it harder for the enemy team to push out without overextending themselves.

All heroes can capture mercenary camps, but some heroes do this task on their own. Heroes like Zagara, Azmodan Gazlowe, and Anub’arak summon minions that can take and dish out damage. Other heroes like Illidan, The Lost Vikings, and Kharazim can keep their health topped up while capturing mercenary camps. These heroes give you the option to solo mercenary camps while your teammates soak experience.

, Stand near a mercenary camp and ping it. This will signal your intent to capture the mercenary camp, and smart teammates will respond to help you out., This strategy is especially useful if you have specialists that are effective at sieging enemy bases. Sgt. Hammer, Murky, Azmodan, Zagara, and Gazlowe can make quick work of bases if they have the support of both their teammates and mercenaries.

Be careful about committing too many heroes into one lane as this will slow down your team’s experience gain, especially if the enemy team can hold your push off with only one or two heroes while soaking experience in other lanes.

, If you have had a particularly good early game and are at least one level above your enemies, then you can widen the gap even further by pushing hard once you gain your ultimate abilities at level 10. They can still pose a threat with their basic abilities, but your ultimates will make it much easier for you to punish them should they commit to counterattacking your team.

Reaching level 10 opens up the ultimate abilities of everyone on your team. If you’ve had a strong enough start using the previous tips, ganking and soaking better than your enemies, then this should come naturally.

, Use map pings and talk with your teammates to signal your desire to commit to a hard push. Assemble in a far lane that will be hard for enemies to reach if they find themselves on the opposite side of the map—typically the top or bottom lane, depending on which map you are in., Take your whole team and knock hard at the gates of their fortresses. If the enemy team attempts to check your push, your ultimates will give you a distinct advantage since they will not be able to retaliate in kind. If they decide to soak experience so that they can also hit level 10 before engaging you, then take advantage of this window of opportunity by driving as deep as you can before they can match your ultimates with their own., If you have the advantage of early ultimates over the enemy team, you can also go for a superpowered mercenary push by capturing a Golem if the map you are playing on has one. Your ultimates will give you the edge if the enemy team tries to stop you, so you will have a much easier time capturing the Golem. You can still gain a noticeable advantage if the enemy team does not challenge you and lets you get the Golem in exchange for soaking experience. A Golem stomping toward the keep is nothing to sneeze at, especially if the enemy team is reckless enough to engage you under the Golem’s shadow. Those caught in a timely root or stomp will be easy pickings for focused fire."

Choose an online provider.,
Obtain a Casino License.,
Choose Your Accepted Payment Methods.,
Market your casino.,
Learn how to Deal with Challenges.",How to Start an Online Casino,"

Before you start, you have to decide what casino software and games (content) you will be using. The software is going to run your gaming site, and will be the backbone of your casino, helping you manage your entire operational activity, including account management, payment processing, fraud management, and marketing campaigns. If software is going to be your backbone, gaming content will be your face. Games are what will attract people to your casino and you should consider that as one of the main factors in deciding which supplier to chose.
There are two types of suppliers - ones that develop games and platforms themselves and ones that offer packages with gaming content of other suppliers (B2B - business-to-business model). Both have their own advantages. If you go with the company that develops games itself, you will probably have to pay lower fees and there will be a lot of flexibility in meeting your requirements. In case you decide to go with the B2B supplier, you can get games from multiple developers without the need to sign multiple contracts, but there will be larger fees to deal with.
Additionally, you must decide if you will choose a casino provider that asks you for monthly fees (this would be like paying a monthly rent + a fee from your profit), or if you will choose a casino provider that asks for no monthly fees and will send you the source code files after your purchase, granting you maximum access over your casino and full data privacy.

Playtech.com, Net Entertainment and Micro Gaming (game developers) are top three game developers that cover over 60% of the worldwide market with their premium casino products. Their award-winning games are considered as the top converting. If you can't include all three, your casino should feature games from at least one of them. They charge a minimum of 10 000 EUR per month while also demanding a minimum of 15% cut of the royalties from the casino. If you choose to buy a complete solution from these guys you will end paying them a minimum of 120 000 EUR in just one year.
On the other hand, companies like EveryMatrix.com, 1ClickGames.com and Finnplay.com are aforementioned B2B suppliers. Aside from a wide variety of solutions, they offer games from up to 10 different developers, including the most popular ones.
If the main factor of your decision is related to your budget and you want to minimize your long-term costs, you can go with CasinoWebScripts.com, which is a casino software provider that aims to provide people interested in starting their online casino with options that do not involve any monthly fees. Their pricing policy lets anybody buy as many games as they want, even with source codes, while letting the casino owners keep 100% of their profit. They also offer a complete casino software solution as well as game customization or custom game development (this means they can develop any game you want). If you choose to buy a complete solution you will end paying them around 100 000 EUR and you can use their products for the next 100 years. They have over 150 games available with free updates and lifetime support.


Choose your business partners carefully and never do that in rush. Request information and contract templates from at least ten suppliers so that you can compare them before the final verdict. Never be shy to ask questions you are interested in or might have concerned about.;
,


If you choose to go with B2B supplier, you probably will be offered a sub-license that will allow you to freely operate legally without the need to obtain one yourself. This would save you a lot of time and funds on your initial investment, but eventually it is better to get your own license when your casino will start generating you serious money.
In case there is non such option, obtaining your casino license must be your first step. Without the casino license you aren't allowed to have a casino running legally. Alternatively you can start a BitCoin casino, which does not require a license.
Decide in which country you will obtain your casino license, it does not have to be your current residence. Some countries, such as Curacao or Costa Rica, are very cheap to obtain a casino license in (around 20 000 EUR/year), while others like UK, Malta or Romania are far more expensive (over 150 000 EUR/year). If you get a license in Curacao or Costa Rica, you can accept players at your casino from non-regulated jurisdictions all over the world.
Use a service like Slogold.net to set up an offshore company that will be the face of your casino in the process of obtaining your casino license.
Pay the fee to get your casino license and provide them with any other information that they require.

,


After you have your casino license you have to set up your payment options so that you can take deposits from players, payout prizes, and withdraw money from the casino back into your business.
Credit cards are the favorite method of payment around the internet, and by allowing credit cards at your casino you are going to improve the chances of getting customers.
You will need a credit card processing service in order to verify they have enough money and to get the money sent to your company account.
Shop around for affordable processing services, many large agencies offer these services at low rates.

,


When you have the casino up and running it is time to populate it with players who are going to make it into a profitable business. The only way that you are going to get anyone playing at your casino site is through casino marketing and it is important that you spend most of your time on this step of the venture if you want to be successful.
Decide on the countries that you want to target the most and setup local marketing campaigns. These can include television ads, magazine ads, radio ads, and search engine optimization that focuses on local cities within the country.
Focus on delivering unique content and unique games that will make your casino stand out of the crowd. Find a development company and ask them to create a unique game exclusively for your casino. CasinoWebScripts is one of the companies that offer such service.
SEO or search engine optimization is going to be the long-term method of increasing the number of players at your site. Pay an expert to create optimized content to draw players into your casino from search engines, this will keep a steady flow of new players heading your way.
A Google adwords campaign is a good way to get immediate customers to your casino. Make sure that you direct them to a very convincing website that talks about the benefits they will get by using your casino.
Support several different languages from countries who are likely to use your casino. The more languages that your website supports the greater the player base you can build up.
Be sure to hold events regularly to keep players coming back to the casino while enticing new players to the casino for the very first time.
Using a system of deposit promotions is also a good idea for increasing the number of players who decide to give the casino a try in the first place.
Always make sure that you reward the players who are spending the most at your casino. This small portion will end supply a large portion of the casino’s money. Offer incentives and rewards to the high paying customers because you want them to come back over and over again

,

Running an online casino forces you to deal with a whole slew of challenges that you probably wouldn't have to worry about with most other businesses.
One of the most significant risks that a casino has to worry about is hackers. It's vital that you hire professionals to make sure that your server is very secure, the first time that you are hacked and money is stolen people will lose faith in the casino and you will lose customers.
When your marketing efforts are driving a large number of people to the casino website but those people are not signing up you may have a few different issues that have to be dealt with.
It is possible that you are not offering enough methods to deposit money into the casino if you only have one or two methods available. Make sure that you have as many different ways to deposit money as you can.
You may not be covering the language of the country that you are marketing to. If the website isn't in a language that they understand they aren't going to sign up.
You may need more promotions or bonuses to make them feel like there is a reason to try your casino. Without an incentive most players will stick with their current casino over yours.
If your players are joining up with the casino and then leaving it very soon after then you probably need to improve the games that you are offering.
Make sure that the games are easy to understand and they come with rules and help;
Only choose games that are pleasing to look at, and avoid games with sharp graphics or games that hurt the eye when playing;
Purchase games that will run in most web browsers and offer an instant play option. Many players can't wait to download a game client to their desktop in order to play;
Get games that cover popular casino games such as slots, poker, and scratch cards;

Read reviews about the game - do you want a medieval game?,
Find out how can you try the game - through free trials or ""buddy"" keys?,
Check the price of the game, subscription and expansions - you don't wanna try something that you won't be able to buy and/or subscribe and/or buy the expansions that everyone is playing.

,
If you're too young to have your own credit card, talk to your parents to see if they would pay for your game, your subscription and eventual expansions.,
Pay attention to billing instructions: most companies charge you for the game, give you a free month and may require a credit card's information to be entered, even though you haven't started playing your first free month - they will charge your credit card for another month (of subscription) only when your free month is over.,
Read the official forums (or other trustworthy forums) - there you can obtain lots of information on the game and its characteristics - and perhaps get a buddy key :)

,
Check system requirements - just to have an idea, because 90% of the time games do work in your system.,
Find out the best servers for your style of play - are you a PvP Gamer?,
Download the game - but don't expect to start playing right away because after downloading and installing you have to...

,
Patch (update) the game - and this may take N hours more...

,
Create an account - do it while you're downloading/patching the game.

,
Read the manual - do it while you're downloading/patching the game.,
Find a (written) guide - a guide can also include instructions found in the manual.,
Read the tutorials/follow the guide - if you're lucky enough for your chosen MMORPG to have a good tutorial, you might not need the manual and/or the guide.

,
Read (at least in the beginning) the dialogues with NPCs, quest givers - they may contain more information on the game and its gameplay.

,
Many MMORPGs have newbie areas designed specifically to give them a taste of the game and/or to prepare them for the ""real"" world.,
Finding a friendly guild helps a lot!",How to Start Playing an MMORPG," Futuristic? Anime-style? Is the game full of bugs? Are expansions constantly released for it? You gotta know where are you going to spend your precious time and money...;
, Free trials can be found constantly on the MMORPG's website or on special occasions. Some games give keys to their players so they can invite their ""buddies"" to try the game (and usually, if you buy the game and subscribe to at least one month, the friend who invited you gets one month for free).

,, Some games can also be bought on retailers, including their game time cards.

, During that time, the credit card information can be removed from your account, preventing another month from being charged and not interfering with the game time you still have (be it the first free month or an already paid month from subscription).

,, What you have to know is required hard disk space and graphic cards (but for these you should check Google and forums).

, A solo Gamer? Role-player? Which are the populated servers? And the empty ones? Some games cater to specific play styles. Also, pay attention to your time zone: games can have servers for different areas of the world and/or languages, so you might not want to play in a server at the time most players are at work or sleeping (which could be an advantage in certain types of MMORPGs, usually an exploit) or mostly speaking a language you may not know (remember: players from a country may choose a server not assigned to their country/language as their ""official"" server).

,,,, Yes, READ the MANUAL. It's not a geeky or nerdy thing to read a manual - it saves you time from asking on the chats and/or forums how to attack enemies or how to reach 'X' city.

, Guides are usually done for newbies, telling them useful information in a practical way.

,,, Do their quests, learn what they teach you and then go to the ""real world"" - only there you'll really know if you like the game or not.

, It's a great way to make friends, to find other players to group with, to learn about the game or just to talk! One of the best ways to know about them is reading the official forums: look for the threads of guild recruiting, pick the guilds that interest you, present yourself and wait for contact!

, PL'ing is when you get a high level mage that can heal you to follow you while you battle so you don't have to heal. This way you will gain EXP quicker and level up faster.

Prepare your PC before you plan to buy the game as wouldn't want to buy the game and be crying a few hours later finding your PC can't handle it.,
Introducing you to the Rift calling.,
Find a friend or partner to play with.,
Unlike other MMORPGs, crafting is essential and very very useful in-game.,

While this new Rift game is very innovative when compared to other MMORPGs, Trion has made the interface and game play very gamer friendly and easy to start.",How to Start an Online Game Like Rift," Another tip is to also reduce to graphics quality in-game to make the game work.;
, There are 4 callings: Warrior, Cleric, Rogue and Mage. These callings can also perform and specialize in multiple areas based on their soul choices.


Rift Soul System is very intricate. In each calling, there are various souls your character can choose to specialize in but you are only allowed to have 3 souls active in one time. E.g. Warrior can select to use Riftblade, VoidKnight, BeastMaster but the damage or strength of each skill depends on how many points they choose to put in each soul.

, Just so it is more exciting, more fun and more rewarding if someone joins in the fight with you.

, Also another very intricate crafting system implemented for enhancing items with augments - items you can add into the crafting process to create more specialized stat items. Another tip is, crafted items are usually better than most things you get from questing.

,, You can run into these along your adventure at anytime and sometimes can result it disaster, but that's what creates the fun and excitement in the game.

, Rift PvP (player versus player) drops very good items and a whole lot of experience. Trust me, it is worth a shot especially if this is your first time.

As you progress through the game you can begin concentrating on the class you find suitable and find your unique playstyle.;
, Also refrain from aborting matches as match completion streak will help you gain additional AC, up to 20 percent of the AC gained. If you are not planning on buying GC, be sure to save them and earn more from monthly challenges.

, Make sure to inert armor upgrades in the slots to make your armor more effective. A well balanced armor should have a boosted max health, health regeneration and damage mitigation.

, The Blitz and ADS for the Assault, the Cloak and Scan for Recon, the APS and Blackout for Support. Before a match starts make sure your team has a balanced mixture of each class and the abilities they have. Choose your ability depending on your team composition. Take your time in learning how each device of the three classes work. Keep in mind that your device needs energy to by used. Make sure to use you Squad Support equipment which provides passive benefits to you and your teammates.Ammo or Energy regen for Support, Armor Boost or Health regen for Assault, Motion or Bullet detector for Recon.

, Use cover whenever possible. This boosts weapon control and accuracy and provides protection. Rush forward only when you have your teammates to cover you. Move from cover to cover to minimise exposure to enemy fire. Go into prone or crouch stance when there is nothing ahead to take cover, to improve accuracy and control as well as to make it hard for your enemy to spot you.

, You are not 'Rambo'. Move with your team. Flank your enemies when your teammates provide suppressing fire. Use voice commands and team chat to share enemy positions. Remember team work is rewarded in the game and is encouraged. Use devices like the ADS and APS when you have your team to assist you.

, Learn the maps to find alternate routes, possible flanking options. Play every game mode to familiarize with the mechanics. Try out different weapons and customize them depending on your playstyle.

This first section of information is just a general overview of the game.,
First go and earn some money (credits) which can be earned by destroying enemies, collecting rock asteroid material and bonus boxes.,
Collect (from Bonus Boxes) as much ammunition for your lasers and missiles as possible early on in the game if you can, because if you do this early you won't need to for a long time.,
Know that when your honor goes into the negative it decreases the amount of credits you get from selling raw materials to your space station, whereas the more honor you have, the more you get for your resources.

,
Know where your team's space station is.,
There are three teams that you can join, the ""Mars mining operations"" (MMO), Earth Industrial Corporations, and ""Venus Resources Unlimited"".

,
Seek a resource called Uridium which is obtainable by picking up bonus boxes, completing quests and defeating enemies.,
When you are in a ship that costs credits, always buy another one instead of paying 500 Uridium to repair it.

,
Uridium and credits are used to buy items; ships, weapons, ammunition.,
Complete quests to gain credits and Uridium.,
Skylab is a very valuable resource for in game credits.",How to Play Dark Orbit,";
, When you destroy an enemy, some of its cargo is left behind, which you can collect and sell. - BUT before that, sign up for a ""Quest"" that gives you EXTRA Credits, Uridium & Experience points for collecting rocks & destroying alien ships.

, (Which actually can be a relatively short amount of time if you use your lasers a lot).

,, (you start there and it is not easy to forget where it is.) it will be a giant Blue square

,, This resource becomes useful when and if you are killed, to repair your damaged ship. Alternatively, you can buy a different ship or take the starter ship (phoenix) which is free

,, One of the main reasons this game is fun to play is because you are constantly upgrading and maintaining your ship.

, Remember that there are two sources of income, Uridium is better than credits because it's much more valuable and can be used to buy better quality items, but it's harder to obtain. Spend it wisely.

, Update your Skylab modules to mine and produce the minerals, then transfer the high value minerals to your ship and sell them. With enough in game credits you do not need Uridium. You can buy anything in the Trade window with enough in game credits.

,

, When you start the game, there will be a stream of bloons flowing along the track. The goal is to build towers in order to pop the bloons. If any bloons escape, you will lose one life per bloon that escapes. Depending on what difficulty you choose, you will begin the game with between 50 and 100 lives.

, In the first few levels, you'll only see red bloons. However, a few levels later you'll discover blue bloons, which have red bloons inside them. Therefore, these take two total hits to pop: the blue layer, and the red layer. More types of bloons:


Green: These contain a blue, so they take 3 hits to pop.
Yellow: These contain a green, so they take a total of 4 hits to pop.
Black: These contain 2 yellows, but are immune to bombs - you need something sharp like darts or tacks to pop them.
White: Whites also contain 2 yellows, but are immune to freezing, so Ice Balls cannot slow them down.

For every bloon that escapes, you lose 1 life plus 1 life for every bloon inside it. So, red bloons are worth 1 life, blues are worth 2 lives, greens are worth 3, and so on.



, To the right of the screen, you see five different types of towers:


Dart Monkey: Dart Monkeys shoot a single dart. Darts pop bloons as soon as they touch them. The cost of Dart Monkeys is cheap, and you can easily pass the game using non-upgraded Dart Monkeys.



Upgrades: Bigger Shooting Range and Piercing Darts (can pop 2 bloons at once)




Tack Shooter: Tack Shooters shoot tacks in eight directions, popping any bloons it touches.

Upgrades: Bigger shooting range and faster shooting


Ice Ball: Ice Balls freeze all surrounding bloons, slowing down the bloons, therefore giving all surrounding towers a chance to pop some bloons.

Upgrades: Faster freezing and longer freeze time


Cannon: Shoots bombs at bloons, exploding at target, popping many bloons at once. Despite the price, cannons work well to destroy lots of bloons at once while also adding a cool aspect to the game. Bomb towers work well near ice balls.

Upgrades: Bigger shooting range and bigger bombs.


Super Monkey: Super Monkeys shoot a continuous stream of darts, acting as a solid wall of darts! But the cost of a single Super Monkey is $4,000.

Upgrade: Epic Range: Greatly increases the shooting range of the Super Monkey.



, Although you will probably not need to use every tower type to finish the game, play around with all the different tower types and see what you like best.

Don't be intimidated.,
Listen to the advice of more experienced teammates.,
If you're new, pick a well rounded mobile (Mage, Ice and Armor in particular) and play with it all the time.,
When picking items, a safe bet is duals (item that looks like two red bullets) or dual+ (one red and one yellow bullet).,
Each mobile has a certain weight to it, that's why it's advised to practice with a certain mobile.,
Think about what mobile your enemy is using.,
If you get hit, it can help to move after each shot to force the enemy to adjust his shot.,
Avoid tough rooms until you get better.,
There are servers for beginners, use them and everyone will be friendlier and you won't get killed so easily, so you have more chances to shoot and learn.,
Understand Delay.,
Understand wind.,
A dual often gives the enemy 2 turns in a row against you, so you only want to use it when it's a sure hit.,
Your SS can be almost as strong as dual or dual+, but it's usually trickier to use, so again don't use it unless you're sure it can hit for nice damage.,
Shotgun (SG) if needed.,
Try to take the easiest shot possible, usually the closest enemy.,
Keep your cool, take your time and you are sure to win.

,
If you plan on becoming REALLY good, you can learn about formulas.",How to Play and Win at Gunbound," Just ignore people who say you are using a ""noob strategy"" such as Shotgunning and dt noob (Covered later).;
, For example, if someone on your team tells you to drop into a hole (called ""hiding"") in order to avoid being killed, please do so for the good of the team.

, Weak mobiles (such as JD, Lightning, BF) are not necessarily weak, but require the user to have a good amount of accuracy and strategy. Advanced bots (Nak, Trico, Boomer) should only be used if you have in depth knowledge of the game. For example, using Trico requires the user to keep the shot in the air a certain amount of time to hit properly. Yes, it is possible, and there are many players that can hit perfectly 80%+ of the time.

, Most rooms have only dual or dual+ turned on. If other items are on, heal is probably best for beginners (bandaid and medkit items).

, If you use random (or pick different mobiles each game) your ""feel"" (ability to guess how much power to use) will be messed up.

, Some bots cannot hit easily at long range, for example (like bigfoot) so teleporting away from those bots might help. Others have trouble hitting bots in a deep pit (sate). Most of the bots have some weakness. Listen to your teammates if they tell you to move.

, This simple tactic can cause a lot of misses and give you the chance to live longer. Just don't move to a place where you can't easily shoot, and don't bother when they're so close they can't miss.

, Usually (not always) players with high ranks will be good. Avoid rooms full of medal, phoenix, knight and dragon rank players. Also watch out for rooms where players intentionally kick anyone they see as a threat, or change the settings to favor their best bots. You can't learn much going against these players, and you will frustrate your teammate(s) if they were expecting advanced players in their room and got a beginner instead.

, If you feel that the best way to get better is to play vs. good players, go ahead but don't complain about unfair teams or dying before you get a shot... also, remember that not everyone with a wand or dragon rank is automatically a god, so talk to them normally and they'll probably be willing to help you. Whine, complain, throw insults, comment on their missed shots, or accuse them of cheating and you won't get any help and you'll probably get kicked.

, Delay is the numbers in the bottom left of your screen. This is what makes opponents sometimes shoot twice after your shot. It's wise to read a guide on Delay, as it introduces a whole level of strategy to the game. A guide can be found in the external links.

, When wind is pointing against you, or down+against you, it holds your shot back, sometimes by a lot. So you need to add power. Also, using a lower angle can help your shot cut through this kind of wind and make it go further, so try lowering your angle if adding power isn't helping much. Wind pointing against and up (up+left if you're shooting right) also holds the shot back, but not as much. To adjust for wind blowing down, just add power. If wind's going up or up+forward, reduce power so it doesn't fly too far. Lastly, wind pointing down+forward shoves the shot forward a bit, but not much. Just reduce power a bit. Depending on how ""down"" this wind is, you might not need to adjust power at all, or you may even need to add a bit.

, It's best to use to kill an enemy with less than half their life left. Definitely avoid using it when you're unsure if it will hit, like when shooting through a tornado. When you have a sure shot on the enemy it's usually ok to use dual+ or dual. If you're right next to them, you can try it without a test shot, but from further away, try shot 1 or 2 first, and only use the item once you are sure it will hit.

, Many SS shots need a ""trick"" to get good damage so it's not enough just to hit the enemy. For example armor's SS must be in the air a little while before it can do good damage, and mage's works best vs shielded bots with blue lifebars. In fact almost none of the bots have a simple SS that requires no thinking.

, A good SG will guarantee maximum damage at close range. Just don't dual unless you're positive you'll hit completely. Sometimes the first shot will drop the opponent and the second shot will fly right over their head!

, But also play smart. If an enemy is almost dead, and you can kill him, it might prevent that enemy from getting one more turn and doing huge damage to someone before he dies. Don't worry about taking someone else's kills, and don't worry about someone else killing your guy either. ANY kill leads to a win which leads to GP and gold. Failing to kill can lead to a loss, which leads to sad feelings :(

,, Formulas are just a mathematical approach to shooting (as opposed to using ""feel""). CreeDo's website has many guides on formula usage as well as in depth tips for each mobile.

Place your bet: Most online casinos will have chip graphics that you click, in order to place a bet.",How to Play Blackjack Online," That is, the goal of the game is to reach 21, or at least come as close as possible (without going over), and beat the dealer’s hand.;
, That being said, it is always preferable to make sure the casino you choose is reputable.


Check the software that’s being used – is it made by a known gaming company?
How about the cashier service? How does it secure your payments and privacy, and what types of transactions does it accept?
If you like bonuses, you might also want to check what type of Welcome Bonus the online casino offers, as well as regular promotional deals.

,, Choose to play the bot at the bottom.

,, The weakest bots will make it easy for you to capture pieces. Often, you can flip a piece into a trap by pulling and then pushing it.

, If it doesn't retreat, threaten it with capture. If the enemy elephant comes to its defense, try to take the camel hostage. This will make your own camel the strongest free piece on the board.


While you're holding a camel hostage, make sure that the enemy elephant does not get a chance to push any of your pieces toward an unprotected trap.
Keep your own camel on your own home side of the board, to prevent the enemy from replacing his elephant with two weaker pieces. If the enemy can manage to protect a camel hostage without his elephant, you will be in a very tough spot.

, The enemy elephant can only protect one trap at a time, and any other defender can potentially be captured itself.


A single piece can be threatened with capture in two traps, via a fork.

, Just because someone has two pieces next to a trap does not mean that the trap is safe. The real key is who has stronger forces around the trap.

, As the board clears, there will be openings for a rabbit to reach the enemy rank. If you have a one-turn goal threat, execute it, and you will have won. If you don't have such a goal threat, check whether your opponent would, and if so, block it. Beyond that, try to create goal threats which will put the enemy on the defensive.


One-turn goal threats, especially those which would use all four steps of a turn, are not always obvious. A rabbit may need to be unfrozen, or another piece might have to be moved out of the way.
Even if there is no immediate goal threat, keep an eye on any open spaces which a rabbit might pass through.

, If you lose all eight rabbits, you lose the game.

, Bots get harder as you go, and long-term strategy becomes increasingly important.

, Consider the safety of your own pieces when forming attack plans. If you put a friendly piece at risk of capture, consider how you would be compensated for the loss of that piece.

,


If the enemy piece pinned to the frame is not the elephant, dislodging it will capture the framed piece.
If the pinned piece is the elephant (or is otherwise untouchable), rotate out any strong pieces which aren't needed to hold the frame. Take care that the framed piece does not get a chance to escape, and that the enemy does not get a chance for an even trade or better.

, This is a good way to tie up the enemy elephant and allow your camel to get into the action.

Try the Draconic Power tree.,
Try the Earthen Heart tree.,
Choose your role in the group.,
Choose the right weapons.,
Use heavy armor.,
Level your health.",How to Play a Dragon Knight in Elder Scrolls Online," The Dunmer are going to be a choice option for Dragon Knights, especially the damage dealers, whose powers focus on fire magic.This is because Dunmer get a bonus to fire damage, making them extra deadly. Their weapons skill is with dual-wield, though, so you can't rely quite as much on their weapons damage. Dunmer are available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.;
, Nords are a natural choice for Dragon Knights, as their race-based abilities are all about dealing damage and taking damage. They also get a boost to two-handed, which is the main weapon for this class. Nords are available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.

, Orcs are another natural choice for Dragon Knights, as their race abilities are focused on maintaining stamina in battle and dealing damage. They get a boost to heavy armor, making them good tanks or damage dealers. Orcs are available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.

, Redguards are born fighters, having bonuses to power and sword and shield, which makes them great damage dealers. They also make decent tanks. Redguards are available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.

, While not the ideal tank, Khajit are decent as damage dealers, having good melee skills. They also have a bonus to medium armor, which will help to protect them in battle. Khajit may not be the most ideal choice for this class, but are the best available to those in the Aldmeri Dominion.

, This skill set is all about bringing the hurt. Several are AOE attacks, and all are very deadly. Yay, fire! , These skills have a focus on healing yourself, with a secondary focus on dealing damage. Some also provide blocking abilities. , These skills mainly focus on buffing the group and protecting yourself, making it much more of a defensive skillset than an offensive one., The exact role that a Dragon Knight plays in a group is somewhat dependent on your choice in play style. How you want to play, what role you want to fulfill, will determine what skills and abilities you choose, so consider it carefully and then commit as best you can in order to be effective.


Damage dealers dole out the pain but dodge or block attacks when possible. They don't necessarily want the enemy's attention, but they do want to deal the killing blow. Two-handed weapons and a healthy stamina pool are good for damage dealers. Damage dealers should make use of the Ardent Flame skill tree.
Tanks are meant to draw the enemy's attention and then take a beating, allowing other group members to deal the damage. Tanks are a crucial part of any MMO group, so take your role seriously. Sword and shield may be better for tanks, as it allows for better blocking. The most important factor for a tank, however, will be a serious amount of health. Tanks should make use of the Draconic Power skill tree.
Supports focus on defending the party, by not only dealing damage but also by providing protection. A support will use the group buff abilities under the Earthen Heart skill tree, mixed with the tactical defense of the other players, in order to help the whole group be successful.

, You'll want weapons that dole out the hurt, inflicting serious damage on your enemies. The best weapon for this class is a two-handed weapon (and there are great two-handed weapon skills to match), but a sword and shield can also do the trick.

, Heavy armor and the skill bonuses that come with it will go a long way towards providing you the protection you need to be your party's tank or damage dealer. Choose heavy armor and wear as much of it as you can. The more you wear, the greater the bonuses and the faster it will level.

, Health is the most important trait for a Dragon Knight, so focus on increasing, buffing, and maintaining it. Some magicka for special attacks is nice, health and stamina (which governs your weapons attacks) should be your main focus.


Note that using a majority of class skills require magicka, while using weapon-related skills require stamina. It's typical that a DPS oriented Dragonknight will stick to putting attributes into increasing their magic ability for class skill abuse, while a Dragonknight centered on blocking and using weapon skills will go for the stamina route.

Play as an Argonian.,
Play as an Altmer.,
Play as a Breton.,
Play as a Dunmer.",How to Play a Templar in Elder Scrolls Online1," Argonians are a great choice for a Templar, if playing as your group's healer. They have a passive boost to experience for the Restoration staff which helps you gain access to those skills quicker, as well as boosts to their own healing, which can help keep them from becoming a target of the enemy team. Argonians are available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.;
, Altmer have a natural bonus to their magicka pool and magicka regen, so they make great Templars. They also have bonuses to magicka damage and the Destruction staff, which should allow them to protect themselves from enemies. This makes them better as a damage-dealing Templar, with a more minor focus on healing. Altmer are available to those in the Altmeri Dominion.

, Bretons make a decent choice for a Templar, as they have a race-based bonus to magicka. They also have a number of race-based bonuses which allow them to protect themselves, important for keeping them alive long enough to heal your team. Bretons are available to those in the Daggerfall Covenant.

, Dunmer have a slightly larger magicka pool to draw from, which can help them make a good Templar. They also have a good mix of resistances and offensive bonuses, which keeps their role in battle more balanced. Their increased fire damage arguably makes them best for damage in this class. They work best as a combat-based Templar. Dunmer are available to those in the Ebonheart Pact.

Try the Aedric's Spear tree.,
Try the Dawn's Wrath tree.,
Try the Restoring Light tree.",How to Play a Templar in Elder Scrolls Online2," These skills are focused mainly on dealing damage. Most are AOE attacks, allowing for great crowd control. , These skills are more defensive in nature, blocking or reflecting enemy abilities and attacks. These are useful regardless of play style for this class., These skills are mainly centered on healing and restoring stats, either for yourself or your allies. Be careful though: some prevent you from moving while they are being cast."

Be a fighting Templar.,
Be a healing Templar.,
Wear light armor.,
Support your allies.",How to Play a Templar in Elder Scrolls Online3," There are two styles of gameplay for Templars. The first is a more combat-based style, where you will be a damage dealer for your party, with a lesser focus on healing them.If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Aedric's Spear tree (and to a lesser extent, Dawn's Wrath).
Good weapons for this style of gameplay include two-handed and sword and shield.
Points should be distributed mainly into magicka and stamina, but it will be important to have some points distributed into health as well, since your character will see some action.

, The more common role and better use of the Templar is as the party healer (this being the second style of gameplay for this class). Templars have many abilities which allow them to play the very crucial role of keeping everyone alive through a battle.


If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Restoring Light tree, though you can also pick up some of the others in order to defend yourself.
A restoration staff will of course be a must have for this class, but you can also build your skills in another weapon as well, in order to maintain a basic ability to protect yourself.
Almost all of your points should be going in to your magicka. Since there are a few spells which let you heal yourself as well, having a higher health will be much less of a concern and you should be doing very little attacking, making stamina a very minor concern.

, The light armor skills include bonuses to magicka absorption and your magicka pool, so it is best to put healing Templars in light armor. Heavy or light armor can be used for a combat-based Templar.

, The best use of your time, as a Templar, will be to support your allies by keeping them alive. This will usually mean healing, but it can also mean playing defense as well. This role requires you to be unselfish, and focused only on group success, not personal glory.

Skins don't have any effect on your gameplay as they are strictly for cosmetic purposes. If you pick a custom name, you won't be able to get a skin unless you've logged in and obtained a ""Premium Skin""., Moving your cell is what you should master first, since it will be the main aspect of your technique. To move your cell, simply move around your mouse/mouse-pad and your cell will follow the on-screen pointer. The bigger you are, the slower you move and the easier it is for someone to catch up to you.

, This allows your cell to shrink itself so it can move faster, or to share your mass with others. To shoot off some of your cell's ""mass"", simply click the 'W' key on your keyboard. The mass will fire in the direction of which your pointer is on-screen.


Speed will be an amazing tactic to add to your custom technique.

, If you'd like to boost yourself to catch up to someone or eat someone smaller than you, you are able to divide your cell. Dividing your cell will shoot out half of yourself forward in the direction of your pointer, thus eating any smaller cells in your direction.


This will take a bit of practice and patience.

, The lower you are in this food chain, the more likely it will be for you to lose the game/be eaten. The size of your cell is very important, you must pay close attention to who you try to pick a battle with.


Bigger cells have the ability to eat the smaller cells. Find a way to knock them down to size, or find out how to grow fast enough to eat them first.
If you are equal to, or very close to, the size of another cell, you cannot eat each other.

, In Agar.io, spikes spawn throughout the entire map. Use these spikes to take down larger cells that are chasing you. Shooting out mass into these spikes with the 'W' key will make them grow to a certain point. Once they pass the point, the spike will split itself and throw it into the direction you are aiming.


Successfully hitting the larger enemy and making them explode will most likely cause them to run away in fear of being eaten, thus saving yourself and giving you the opportunity to eat them and grow drastically!

, If you are greater than the Viruses and/or ""Green Spikes"", in size, going inside of it will make you explode into mini-cells, giving everyone around you the opportunity to eat even quicker.If you are less than or equal to the size of the spike, you will be able to ""safely"" hide inside of it.
Although larger cells are able to eat you if they go inside of the spike, it is unlikely that they will, due to the fact that they will split in to tons of tiny cells, ultimately risking them losing the game.

, If you find a prey to eat, go ahead and eat it, using multiple techniques on this page. Just make sure he is considerably smaller than you.

, The point of the game may be to eat anyone and everyone to survive, but there are still people in the game that are willing to team up with you. Usually, feeding someone your mass by pressing the 'W' key will lead to them thanking you by helping you grow as well. This may also result in them helping you eat other cells as you play the game.


Typically, an alliance will not last very long. Many people who form alliances will only do it temporarily; They'll wait until they want a different teammate or until they get big enough, and then they will eat you.
Permanent alliances are very rare, be cautious.
You can press the spacebar key to give a big chunk of your cell to someone. just sure you aren't bigger than them. then accidentally eat them.

, Forming an official alliance between multiple people will take much more work. There are many forums that people use to have conversations between the Agar.io community, share skins, and most importantly, form alliances. Use the forums to your advantage for creating large alliances by making threads about a team you've created.


Inform everyone of what your Alliance's name is once you've came up with one. Certain names will attract more players to your clan.

Avoid Inappropriate, vulgar, or any alliance names that give away your personal information.


Look around the internet and/or other threads, for Alliance names that have already been used. Copying other's alliance names will only bring bad reputation to your alliance.

Use the gun that is best for the map and/or situation.,
Practise with a few different guns, so you are prepared for any situation.,
At medium to long range, it is best to fire bursts of 1-3 bullets.,
When sniping, always strafe left and right.,
When knifing, always use the right click power attack.,
When jumping off large heights, always transform into a wolf.,
Avoid heavy weapons such as rocket launchers and turrets.,
Try to get primary guns which have a scope so they are good at both close and short range.

,
Try not use use guns with high recoil like the AKE1-GL.",How to Own on Wolfteam," Don't be using shotguns on wide open maps, with lots of places for snipers, like Arrival. Likewise, don't be using sniper rifles on tight maps, where enemies could easily sneak up on you. Assault Rifles are usually a good choice. Make sure to have at least one good one. They can shoot clear across most of the maps, and have a good firing rate, along with a significant damage rating.;
, Make sure you can control the recoil of your guns, and get used to they're firing rate. Know how many bullets it takes to kill an enemy.

, They are much more likely to hit there target this way, and it conserves ammo that can be used later. At short range, spray at just below the enemies shoulders. The recoil will more often than not cause the bullets to hit them in the head.

, Chances are your opponent will not be able to hit you. Stop moving only to fire. Check your back every so often. Most players will attempt to sneak up behind you, and put your sniping to an end. Carry a good secondary, such as a Desert Eagle, or transform into a wolf when you hear something behind you.

, The shelter is a place where other player's abandoned eggs and pokémon are kept, and where you can adopt them. The eggs are in the Egg Shelter and the Pokémon are in the Safari Zone. You can usually only adopt up to six times each day, but this number can be increased by multiplier days or by purchasing shelter passes. You can see more eggs or pokémon by refreshing, clicking the 'show more' button, or pressing space. If something is blocking your view, you can right-click on it to make it disappear. In the Safari Zone, the Pokémon will be bouncing around. If you want to turn this off, click the 'stop movement' button.

, Random eggs will show up in the lab, identified by a short description. Four eggs show up at a time. You can take as many eggs from the lab as you want. If you're lucky, you can find legendaries, Unowns, or Dittos., On the Main page, you can see the eggs and Pokémon you currently have in your party. At the top of the page will be your status, where you can type a short message for others to see. It will also show your points, a link to your settings, and various other stats that you can customize.

You can write down a message (up to 2000 characters) in your journal, and it will be viewed by people visiting your page.
You can drag the Pokémon in your party to rearrange them. When dragging a pokémon, boxes will show up in the middle for the places you can move it. Drag the pokémon to the box and it will be moved to that location.

, The Pokétch is a bar on the side with many tabs. Some tabs will not be available until you purchase the corresponding account upgrade. Sometimes a little circle will show up on a tab to notify you of something.

Friend Recorder: This tab will show the recent activities of the people on your pal pad.
Inventory: This shows you all of the items you currently own. You can sell items from here by clicking on the number to the right of the name. You can also activate certain items by clicking on the name.
Achievements: These are little tasks that you can complete for prizes, points, or just bragging rights. You also need a certain number of achievements to go on certain explorations. Achievements you have completed are automatically unlocked when you visit this page.
Statistics. This tab basically shows your ranking, activity score (which increases when you click and basically are active), and your interactions (how many times you've clicked today).
Daycare: Two Pokémon placed here with opposite genders and a shared egg group will have a chance of producing eggs every hour. You can take one of these eggs, and the rest will be donated to the shelter. The eggs can be the same species as either parent, with the ratio depending on the parent's rarity. Novelty Pokémon (custom Pokémon exclusive to GPX+) will usually produce eggs of the Pokémon they are based off of, with a very slim chance of producing a novelty.
PokéWalker: When you place a Pokémon in the PokéWalker, it will gain steps when you click. When you move the Pokémon, its experience will be increased depending on the number of steps. When you withdraw the Pokémon, there is also a chance to find an accessory, which increases with the number of steps. After you unlock the achievement, IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!!, you'll receive a Scouter, which estimates the minimum level the Pokémon will come out as.
Underground: The Underground is unlocked by purchasing the Explore Kit for 750 points. You can send one Pokémon there at a time, and it will return after at least three hours has elapsed and after you visit a certain number of pages. When it does, there is a chance it will have a item. A Pokémon can only be sent to the underground once.
Vs. Seeker: The Vs. Seeker is unlocked by purchasing it for 4,000 points. You can send a Pokémon in to randomly battle with another entered Pokémon. There are different divisions Pokémon can be entered in, depending on their level. All divisions except training require a fee to enter, but the winner will gain experience, points, and Prize Points in the Diamond division. Pokémon will be randomly paired up with another Pokémon of their division once every hour, and the winner will be determined automatically by a combination of factors.
Mobile Walker: Up to three eggs or Pokémon can be placed in the mobile walker. When you change the Pokémon in the mobile walker, it will be available to be primed the next hour. This gives no experience but will record your current location. After it is primed, you can activate it once every hour. When you do, your Pokémon will gain experience based on the distance you have traveled from the first location. However, even if you have not changed locations, you will still gain a small amount of experience.
Shine Recorder: The Shine Recorder must be purchased from the shop for 6,000 points. The Shine Recorder allows you to start a shiny hunt or race, and participate in site-wide shiny hunts. You can register a hunt for an egg which you have the Pokédex entry of, and it will record the number of eggs you have hatched and number of days you have spent on the shiny hunt.
Released Pokémon: This tab will show you the Pokémon you have released which have been adopted by other users.
Daycare Offspring: Your daycare offspring which are owned by a user are shown here.
Explorations: This tab displays information about the exploration task you are on. Explorations are a series of tasks you have to complete for a prize, usually a Pokémon or item. Special explorations are rotated every month, and will reward you legendary Pokémon. Three are available in one month, and you can only embark on one out of the three. In order to start an exploration, you must have an empty slot in your party, fulfill a set of requirements for dex entries, achievements, and total interactions, and pay a certain number of points.
Pokéchests: Pokéchests are randomly obtained by performing actions such as interacting, hatching eggs, etc. They can be opened on this page. You will get a random set of trinkets from opening a Pokéchest.

, The Pokémon that aren't in your Party are located here, in the Personal Computer. Here, you can move Pokémon between your boxes and to other locations. You can move them by dragging and dropping them, or by clicking multiple Pokémon in a location and clicking the location you want to move them to. The boxes, and the Pokémon in the boxes, can be reordered by dragging and dropping. You can also filter your Pokémon by certain requirements and release them. You start out with 25 boxes, each able to store 24 Pokémon. This number can be increased by purchasing account upgrades. You can change the name and background of a box.

, Trinkets are user-created collectible items which can be traded or gifted between users. Each trinket is assigned one or more affinities, and only users with the same affinity will be able to obtain that trinket from a Pokéchest. You affinity is displayed at the top-left of the page, to the left of your username., This page allows you to have Pokémon battles against NPCs or other users. Up to 18 Pokémon can be moved into the Battle Tower. You can customize the Pokémon's moves and held item beforehand by selecting the option from the drop-down menu on its page. On GPX+, Pokémon can only learn certain moves based on its type, as well as a few support moves. Moves are classified as strong or weak. A Pokémon can only use three strong moves in a battle. It is usually better to have a mono-type Pokémon as an attacker, since dual-typed Pokémon will learn weak attacks from both its type, while a Pokémon with a single type will learn both a strong and weak move of that type.

, The Users page will display a list of users which can be filtered by certain requirements. You can also choose an amount of Pokémon to interact with, which will all be opened in the berry clicker or in separate tabs. You can then interact with each Pokémon by either clicking on a berry or pressing the numbers 1-5 on your keyboard. The spacebar can be substituted for 5. Pressing any of these buttons will warm an egg. A Pokémon's preference for a certain flavor of berry is determined by their nature. The yellow berry is sour, the red is spicy, the purple is dry, the pink is sweet, and the blue is bitter. It is good practice to first interact with any exploration Pokémon, and to make sure to get their berries right.

, On this page, the information for each Pokémon, egg, and shiny form you have obtained are displayed. You can search through your Pokémon, as well as filter them by egg description, stats, type, etc.

, In the Shop, you can purchase a variety of items. There are five sections to the shop.


The Main Shop contains evolutionary stones and items, Vs. Seeker items, miscellaneous items, and account upgrades. Its stock is rotated every day.
The Backroom is unlocked by purchasing the Secret Key for 25,000 points. It contains items that other users have sold. The Backroom will be closed during a sale.
The Accessories shop will be available after purchasing the Fashion Case for 475 points. It contains 15 randomly stocked accessories, which can be used to dress up your Pokémon.
Pass Powers can be activated by spending Pass Orbs, which are obtained by returning clicks to users who have interacted with you. They will temporarily provide some special effect. Only one Pass Power can be active at a time.
Rare items can be purchased in the Prize shop by spending Prize Points. These are earned by participating in site events.

, This is your best friend. The admins don't like your trivial questions, especially when they are answered in the FAQ or Help section. Read this section thoroughly before even trying to contact them. You might just get a warning or banned, if it's that serious.

Understand that real estate costs increase with each purchase of a particular type.,
Besides understanding that costs increase, you need to know that income for each stays the same.,
To maximize your income, find the properties available that have the highest ROI.,
Search online for 'iMobsters calculator' to find examples.,
Either way, once you learn to buy your real estate using ROI, you will see your income climb much faster than just buying random real estate.,
After buying real estate, don't increase your levels as equipment upkeep keeps on increasing.,
Wait for about 10-15 days.,
Your balance will have become very large.,
Keep on repeating this method until you have enough cash.",How to Maximize Your Income in iMobsters," The increase is 10% of the original price, so, for example, your first Street Vendor will cost you $2000. Each subsequent purchase costs 10% more than 2000, or $200. So, the second costs you $2200, the third $2400, etc.;
, Income for your first Street Vendor gives you an additional $50. When you buy your next Street Vendor, it adds another $50 in income, etc.  What happens over time is something all players need to understand and that is Return on Investment or ROI. As real estate gets more expensive, it's ROI will drop, which we will demonstrate below. The formula for ROI is:


ROI = income / cost
For your first Street Vendor, the ROI = 50/2000 = 0.025
For your 10th Street Vendor, the ROI = 50/3800 = 0.013
This is nearly a drop in half of what the original ROI was. 

, To do this manually, calculate the ROI for each available piece of real estate and determine which one has the highest ROI and purchase it. Then do it again until you have spent all your available money. This can be very time consuming, so many players either create their own spreadsheets or use websites that have been already created.

, Then decide if one is right for you. Or, using the calculations and concept for ROI, you can create your own.

, Also, you will climb the leader-board of mob bosses, possibly becoming the Mafia Don!

, Instead, just be stable and let your income accumulate.

, It's a long time, but results are amazing. After this time, check your balance.

, Once this happens, invest again in Real Estate.

Level your new character.,
Make friends and find party members.,
Earn meseta.,
Buy and stock a shop.,
Feed your partner machinery (PM).",How to Make the Most of Phantasy Star Universe," Most players will want to reach level 20 before they consider exploring the worlds of PSU. At level 20, specific races will gain their basic abilities, such as the SUV Weapons for Casts and the Nanoblasts for Beasts. Other races and classes become more stable around level 20 due to the leveling of techs, skills, and the character itself.
From levels 1 to 20, players should find the Linear Line (4th floor on the Space Colony) the easiest way to gain character levels. It is also the most balanced approach to increasing all aspects of your character, from skills to type levels. Playing through these missions alone (Unsafe Passage and Fight for Food) should be done mostly on C rating, but may also be done on B rating if using ranged attacks. For parties, B rating is ideal.
After level 20, players may want to explore a bit more by heading over to Parum for Mad Creatures and Sleeping Warriors missions. Neudaiz is also good for Mizuraki Defense and Forest Islands missions, but you may want to play most of these within a party. If you get bored, System Defense and Valley of Carnage missions on Moatoob are interesting, but not necessarily as balanced for items and gaining levels.;
, Finding party members is a simple task, as PSU allows players to start missions that are open to anyone who wants to join. Making friends might be more challenging unless you're a younger gamer. Since PSU was released on console systems as well as the PC platform, there is a plethora of youth and young adults with online accounts.
Making friends in PSU may be an easy task for younger players, but becomes more difficult for mature players. Within PSU, many mature gamers may find it challenging to meet other gamers that are courteous, respectful, and friendly. Regardless of your age, you are eventually bound to find another in PSU whom you may call 'friend'. When this happens, and every time you log into PSU, expect to receive private messages requesting to do a ""run"".
An alternative way to find teammates and make friends is to scour areas immediately outside of popular mission starting points. Typically players will pause here while they wait for others in their team. On densely populated servers, this waiting time will attract more players seeking social interactions, party members, and friends.

, Throughout missions, you'll discover that containers may be broken open to find items, while creatures carry both items and meseta. These items may be sold to NPC shops (ie: shops on 2nd floor of Space Colony), but at a great loss compared to their actual value. If you feel inclined to sell items you've collected to purchase your next piece of equipment, sell only low level weapons, armor, and consumables (monomate, dimate, etc.). Even though you may find little use for Synthesis items (Photon, El-photon, Carlian, Hustle Berry, etc.), store them with you partner machinery (PM). When you're ready to open your own shop, you'll be glad you did.
Most Synthesis items sell very well to other players, especially photons. Photons not sold by NPC shops (ie: Ban-photon and Ray-photon) can sell for hundreds, if not thousands of meseta to other players. Compare this to the 5 - 25 meseta you'll receive when selling to NPC shops. You'll want sell these collected items in your shop once you purchase an ""Open Shop"" ticket.
The amount of meseta (PSU currency) you earn for each mission is a total of four factors:


Meseta dropped when a creature is killed (positive amount)
Meseta earned as a bonus when a mission is complete (positive amount)
The meseta value of Items collected from creatures and containers (positive amount)
The meseta required to recharge your weapons (negative amount)

, As mentioned above, this should be your first major purchase and your number one priority. It is the critical first step in acquiring large amounts of meseta in the shortest time possible. The player shop (""Open Shop"" item), may be purchased for 15,000 meseta from the room decorations shop on the 2nd floor of the Space Colony. Take it to your PM and 'remodel' your room using the ticket.
If you've saved most of the synthesis items you found earlier in the game, you'll want to sell them now through your shop. Do some research ahead of time by visiting other player-run shops to get an idea of the PSU player-driven market. Remember that some players are only interested in price gouging. For more information on price gouging, refer to the warning ""Avoid player shop gouging"" below.
For now, simply sell what you find. When your PM gains enough levels (20 or more), start synthesizing your own items according to your PM's area of expertise. An example price list for photons that match the market on any specific day (what players are willing to pay in order to move items quickly) are included in the tips section.

, Your PM is the most dynamic component in the online faction of PSU. It can hold items, synthesize items, redecorate your room, and even run your shop! Still, the most challenging and time consuming part of utilizing your PM is feeding it. Your PM gains levels in relation to what items you feed it, losing points in some areas as it gains points in others. Your PM has a maximum of 100 levels it may gain, but those levels may be distributed in any area (Striking, Ranged, Technic, or Armor). Also, your PM will also morph at levels 20, 50, and 80. At level 80 (referred to as a fully-evolved PM), your PM will offer you her partner card and be able to join your party for missions.
For a striking PM (GH-410 and GH-420), start by feeding it low level restoratives such as monomates and melee weapons. For a Ranged PM (GH-430 and GH-440), use traps and ranged weapons. And for a Technic PM (GH-450), use tech discs or rods combined with low level restoratives. There currently is no known fully-evolved PM for just Armor. But, there are shoes that are sold for 1000 meseta at the clothing shop in Moatoob which are gold stars and will increase ur PM's armor rating by a whopping 22 in armor. As you earn more meseta, you will want to feed your PM more expensive items. This is especially helpful if you're in a rush to get a full-evolved PM, with plenty of time to play PSU. It is helpful to use most of your shop's income to fund the task of feeding your PM. Once your PM is fully-evolved, it will be able to synthesize the more expensive weapons, line shields, and items. Doing so will allow you to make an even greater profit from your shop.

Find a world, preferably one with an easy-to-remember and easy-to-type name, and World Lock it.,

Wait until you have a lot of seeds (50-200 seeds of each).,Wait for the trees to finish growing.,Break all the trees and obtain the Grass.,
Place all the Grass horizontally (landscape) and break it all.,
Sell all of your 200 Grass seeds for one World Lock.,
Buy six Chandeliers.,
Once you have 6+ Chandeliers, start farming them.,
Continue farming your Chandeliers until you feel it's a good time to sell some.,
Sell your Chandeliers, but not all of them.,Repeat this process until you feel you have enough World Locks.",How to Get World Locks by Farming on Growtopia," If you do not happen to have a World Lock, you can place a Small, Big, or Huge Lock around the White Door and cover it up so people cannot escape the area.
, The blocks you use do not matter; even Dirt blocks are fine. This is where you will farm your farm tables to later sell them.

The structure of a good farm usually has a small room that covers the White Door so visitors cannot escape, which has a storage room near it so you can store your items, and many platforms in a line style so you can place things. Blocks you cannot jump through are not a good idea; try to use blocks you can jump through such as Wooden Platforms.

, Do this by entering worlds that have no protection and have never been entered before.

To easily find unprotected, unused worlds, type in random names by spamming your keyboard with random letters.
For extra World Locks, you can clear a world with a good name and sell it along with any seeds that you do not need.

, Then go to your farm and splice them all together to create Grass trees.,,,

If you have under 200 Grass seeds after breaking it all, plant all your current Grass seeds, wait for it to grow, and break it all again until you have 200 Grass seeds.

, You can do this by broadcasting about your sale or going to a Trade world and saying that you're selling 200 Grass seeds per World Lock., Once you have one World Lock, you can use it to buy six Chandeliers in a Vending Machine shop world. You can also buy the seeds if you'd like to have a chance of getting more than six upon being broken (you'll have to wait for them to grow though)., If you end up getting no Chandelier seeds in the end, you'll have to repeat Part 2 (or buy a World Lock from the Store if you have enough gems).,

About 200 Chandeliers (not the seeds) would be a good time to start selling them.

, Instead, sell only half of them.

You can also lower the prices to get faster sales (e.g. Selling 8 Chandeliers for one World Lock).
If you don't feel like constantly having to be there to sell them to buyers manually, you can get a Vending Machine in the Store for 8,000 Gems.

If you don't have any axes, ask for help.",How to Grow Crops on Hay Day," These are in the left hand column under the tab that shows a fence around dirt. The amount of dirt squares available increases with different levels, so work with what you have at the beginning.;
,, The available crops will appear. Tap on the crop you wish to plant and drag your finger over the dirt square. The crop will be planted. All you need do now is wait.

, First, you'll see nothing, then small stumps of plant growth, followed by taller but green and immature growth. Finally, the entire plant in all its color will appear, denoting the crop has matured and is ready for harvesting.


Each crop has a different maturity time. Wheat takes about 2 minutes, while strawberries take much longer.

, Tap on the mature crop. A sickle will appear.

, The vegetables, grains or other plants will fly up into your storage tower (inventory). Continue until the entire crop has been reaped.

, You can grow the same crop or grow a new one, depending on what you need.

, For chocolate, cherries and apples (and much later, olives), you'll need to plant trees. Look in the left hand column for the tree/bush icon and open the tab. The types of trees available to you will descend and you can purchase as many as you want, provided you have sufficient funds.


Trees can be harvested three times––hover over them and a basket will appear; simply drag it over to harvest. After each harvest, the tree matures and provides more fruit until the last harvest. At the last harvest, the tree dies and must be chopped down with the large axe.

, For raspberries, blackberries, and coffee beans, you'll need to plant bushes. They can be found in the same way as the trees, and they harvest the same way. To get rid of a bush, use the small axe.

, Use the exclamation (""!"") icon to tell visitors you need their help to get rid of a spent tree or bush. Reward anyone who helps you.


It's recommended that you hang on to your axes; they don't fetch a lot when sold and they're hard to come by, so cherish them.

To challenge another Guild, the Challenger must issue a challenge to the Challenged via the Action menu (alt-G), by selecting the Challenged and selecting ‘Apply for Guild Battle’.,
When challenging, the Challenger must specify the stake and also specify the number of minutes the Guild Battle will last.,
Once the challenge is accepted by both Guilds, members of both Guilds will have a scoreboard appear on the right of their screens.,
The winning Guild is the Guild whose members kill the highest number opponents within the Guild Battle duration.

,
If the challenge is rejected, then none of this happens.

",How to Guild Battle in Last Chaos," Only Guild Leaders can issue challenges and only Guild Leaders can accept challenges. Guilds must have at least 10 members including the Guild Leader.;
, The stake is measured in units of 10,000; therefore entering 10 will mean a stake of 100,000. The number entered for the duration of the Guild Battle must be between 20 to 300 minutes. Once the challenge is issued, the Challenged will then either accept or reject the challenge. Once accepted, the Challenged will also match the stake of the Challenger. Guilds will then begin the Guild Battle at the end 1 minute.

, Any member of the Guilds can attack and is open to attacks of the opposing Guild, anywhere on the map where the challenge was issued. Only Guild members who are present in the map during the acceptance of the challenge are eligible for the Guild Battle. The Guild Battle will end at the specified number of minutes.

Open a new email message.,
Plead your case.,
Provide identifying information.,
Wait.",How to Get Unbanned from Chatroulette1," To contact the Chatroulette staff, create a new email and address it to chatroulette@chatroulette.com.Chatroulette does not have a feedback form on its homepage or a separate email account for technical complaints or unbanning requests. All feedback for the chat site goes through this email address, so understand that it might take a little while before the staff gets to your message.;
, In the body of the email, explain that your IP was banned from the site and state why you believe the ban to be unfair.


You have a better chance of getting the ban lifted if you were legitimately not in the wrong. Many users claim that people hit the “Report” button whenever they see someone they do not want to see. For instance, this could happen if a man wants to reduce the number of men on the site to improve his odds of chatting with a woman, or if a woman or man runs across someone that she or he deems unattractive. If you suspect that you were banned for a reason like this, make sure to elaborate on that.
If you did do something that could be perceived as a violation of the rules, your best bet is to apologize and promise to behave yourself in the future. It may or may not work, but the staff can go back into your chat logs to determine if you were violating the rules or not, so owning up to your error is still a better bet than trying to deny it.

, You should also provide Chatroulette with your IP address and the approximate time at which the ban begin. The staff might be able to figure out who you are if they trace the email back to its source, but making the process easier for them improves your chances.


As noted previously, Chatroulette can use this information to go back into the chat log and determine if you were legitimately banned or not.

, It could take hours, days, or weeks for Chatroulette staff to respond—if they choose to do so at all. In the meantime, continue checking the site to see if your ban has been lifted yet.






Understand that Chatroulette is under no obligation to lift the ban or reply to your email, no matter how innocent you may or may not be.
Also understand that you might be unbanned but may not receive an email back to let you know about it. That is why you should continue to check the site even if you have not heard back from the staff.

Check your IP address.,
Briefly turn off your modem.,
Power everything down overnight.,
Change the IP address manually.,
Call your Internet Service Provider.",How to Get Unbanned from Chatroulette2," You can find this information by using your computer or by accessing an online IP address service. Once you find your IP address, make a note of it so that you can tell if it has changed after going through the process.


You can use Google to check your IP by doing a search for ""my ip."" Your public IP should appear at the top of the results page.
You can use an IP website online to check your IP address. Popular options include:

What Is My IP Address: http://whatismyipaddress.com/

My IP Address: http://www.myipaddress.com/show-my-ip-address/

My Proxy: http://ip.my-proxy.com/



You could find out your IP address using your computer by typing ""ipconfig"" into your Windows Command Prompt or Mac Terminal.

, Turn off or completely unplug your modem or router for five minutes before turning it back on. Once everything is back up and running, check your IP address again.


If you have a dynamic IP address, this simple disruption to your Internet service will likely be enough to change your IP address.
For this portion of the process, you do not need to restart your computer.
Once your connection is back up, check your IP address again and compare it to the old one. If it changed, then try going to Chatroulette again. If it did not change, continue along further in the process.

, If temporarily turning off your modem did not work, turn off or unplug the modem overnight. During this time, you should also turn off your computer.


Again, this only works if you have a dynamic IP address—an IP address that changes on its own when certain conditions are met.
Since this reset lasts longer and is more in depth, it might leave a stronger impression on your modem, thereby triggering the desired IP address reset.
Once your connection is back up, check your IP address again and compare it to the old one. If it changed, try going to Chatroulette again. If it did not change, move onto the next step.

, If you cannot get your IP address to change on its own, you might need to consider going into your computer's settings and changing the IP manually.

From your Network and Sharing Center, go to ""Change Adapter Settings.""






Get the Subnet Mask to fill the IP address in with a random string of numbers. Type ""111-111-111-111"" into the box and hit the Tab key on your keyboard to automatically generate new numbers.






Right-click on your local connection and select ""Properties."" Check the ""Obtain an IP address automatically"" box before closing out. Your IP address should now be changed.

, When all else fails, or when you have a static IP address, you need to call your ISP and ask to have your IP address changed remotely.


If the ISP will not change your IP address remotely, the operator might at least be able to guide you through the process of changing your IP address on your own.

"
"
Find a free proxy server.,
Type the Chatroulette URL into the proxy server URL box.,
Try different proxy servers as needed.",How to Get Unbanned from Chatroulette3," A proxy server or proxy site allows you to browse the Web through a third party server, thereby masking your own IP address. When a website attempts to ping your computer and read your IP, the website will receive a third party IP address, instead.


A few popular proxy servers include:

Anonymouse: http://anonymouse.org/anonwww.html

Change IP Country: http://anonymizer.nntime.com/

Free Proxy Server: http://freeproxyserver.net/ /
Warp Proxy: http://www.unblocked-proxy.com/




, Once you choose a proxy server, scroll down to the website address bar on the page and type the Chatroulette URL into it. Hit the ""Go"" button (or its equivalent) to be sent to the Chatroulette site.


Make sure that you actually attempt to chat using the proxy server. Your IP address may not be blocked from the homepage of Chatroulette, but you could run into problems once you try to chat.

, If the first proxy server you chose does not fix the problem, try a different one instead of giving up.


There is some chance that the server has a gap in it, causing your IP address to leak out to Chatroulette.
It is also possible that Chatroulette will identify the IP address as a proxy and block you for that reason.

The Adobe Flash online settings manager can be found at: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

Note that the settings panel is displayed at the top of the screen. At first glance, it may appear to be a graphic, but it is the actual panel itself.

, The display panel is located at the top of the page. On the panel, you will see a list of websites, all of which have left information on your computer. Scroll through this list until you find Chatroulette. Click once on the name and press the ""Delete website"" button to get rid of it.


If you do this shortly after your ban, Chatroulette should be a recently visited website, so it should appear near the top of the list.
If you cannot find Chatroulette or wish to reset your Internet presence, you can also press the ""Delete all sites"" button. This will clear out the information left by all websites on the list.

, Close out of your Web browser completely. After a minute or two, open it back up again and head to Chatroulette.


You might be able to access Chatroulette immediately even without restarting your browser; however, restarting your browser resets your browser's settings, giving the new change a chance to set in and increasing your odds of success.
If you cannot access Chatroulette after this step, continue to the next step. If you can access it, then stop here.

, If closing out of your Web browser did not do the trick, try shutting your computer down completely and restarting everything from a powered down state.


If a complete reset to your computer's settings does not prove successful, this method did not work.

Remove yourself from distractions.,

Strengthen your mind.",How to Get the High Score on Any Cool Games Online," If you have a laptop, take it somewhere quiet. If you can’t move your computer, either wait till no one is around making noise, or put some headphones on and use an old box to make a cubicle of solitude. Avoid having the T.V on and pausing to sent Texts or tweets. You may be amazed at how much better your scores get when you aren’t being distracted at all.;
, Most people think that hand eye coordination is only useful in real life while playing sports. In actuality, if you can get the precision with which your hands respond to your eyes to improve at all, it will show in your gaming performance. If you’re really trying to become a flash game dynamo, you might want to put the pride aside for a moment and accept that you can always improve yourself.

, Sometimes people don’t realize how much of a delay there really is between their brain and their body. People hesitate before acting in a lot of situations. It’s not a flaw, and it can be improved on. Being able to think and react quickly is of great use in the world of video games. Whether it’s Racing games, Shooting games, action games, or even some puzzle games; your reflexes and reaction time can really come into play. Practicing games that make you use your reflexes often can also improve your reaction times.

, A strong mind, that thinks quickly no matter what the situation, can be your most valuable asset when trying to reach total gaming domination. One of the reasons video games are so popular in general is that even someone with less than impressive physical fitness levels can still win out over someone who would be considered stronger. Someone who can barely jog a mile could very well beat someone in perfect physical condition at almost any video game simply by out thinking them.

The first time you start an account on ZeldereX, you will be required to start and finish the tutorial.,
Realize that upon completing the tutorial some players still find themselves lacking direction, that is where this guide comes in.

,
You start off with around $300,000, however this quickly depletes.,
The first thing you should set at doing is upgrading your Trithium Refinery to level 10, this will take awhile but not too long.,
Once you have upgraded the Trithium Refinery to level 10, you can take your focus off of it and onto defense.,
Click the Build link and begin building an Aircraft Factory, a Land Factory and Hovercraft Factory.,
Your Air Factory, Land Factory and Hovercraft Factory should now be through being built.,
By now you should be fairly established as a functioning base, however money still run short so For now i will leave it up to you to update your Trithium Refinery periodically.

,
You will also need to update your Solar Generator when needed(Do not waste money on updating your Solar Generator UNLESS it is ABSOLUTELY needed!!!,
We should now focus on a bit more research, such as the following: Fuel Storage, Banisher, Colonization, Intelligence.,
Start attacking other player's bases.,
If you have researched Colonization, you can start colonizing other bases, but it would be best to wait until you are stockpiling hordes of cash before doing so, as new bases need to be upgraded just like your home base was, and this takes even more cash as you will be upgrading the new base and maintaining the home base as well.",How to Get Started on Zelderex Online," This is a step by step introduction to the games basics, you will receive a sum of cash at the end of the tutorial as well as the starting money you already have. It is during the tutorial that you should familiar yourself to the interface and menus. Follow the tutorial and then continue to step two of this guide.;
,, You will also have an amount of fuel and you should be making Trithium.

,


You should also build a Mining Platform, this mines ores that you sell for money(You must remember to sell the ores and restart the mining process every hour), upgrade it to level 3. You should also upgrade your Solar Generator to level 7-8 and Fuel Refinery to level 5-6.
While waiting on these to upgrade, click on the Research Center link, this will take you to the research center. First you should invest in researching Trithium and Ore storage, and then research the first defensive unit called ""Crasher"".


By now you should be running out of your starting cash, that is if you haven't already, but never fear! Your Trithium Refinery should now be pumping Trithium and your Mining Platform should be drilling ores.
These two buildings are the main income for the game and you will need to keep them upgraded and maintained in order to make more cash.

, The research on the ""Crasher"" unit should be completed by now, if so click the defense link. Here you will see two units(If you have been following this guide) A ""Laser Wall"" unit and the newly researched ""Crasher"" unit. The ""Crasher"" is $11,700 and the ""Laser Wall"" is $6,000. As you can see by the Health and Attack stats, the ""Crasher"" was well worth the 8 hour wait. Build yourself 1 ""Crasher"" and 10 ""Laser Walls"", this will cost a bit more than expected($71,700), but it is worth it in case somebody wishes to steal your precious Trithium. It is also a good idea to now start with offensive units.

, Once these are finished being built, upgrade them all to level 2-3. Also update your Trithium and Ore storage to level 3, the ore storage can only be upgraded to level 2 for now.


By now you have probably been waiting quite awhile in between steps for money to stockpile, in order to initiate the above upgrades. So here we need to start upgrading our Trithium refinery once more(if have not already). Upgrade the refinery to level 15, and then wait for the Trithium to stockpile. You also should be selling ores every hour in the Mining Platform.

, Go into the units page and create a few units, but you should know that all the units have advantages and disadvantages. The Air Units are the fastest units and take less fuel, but they have a small cargo hold and are not very strong. The Hovercraft Units are the strongest of all the units and have a large cargo hold, but they are slow and take a lot of fuel, the Land Units are a middle ground between the two.

,, Many players think they need to upgrade the Solar Generator every time they upgrade a building, this is not needed! It only takes one level of Solar Generator to every two levels of resource building. Click the Solar Generator link to see if you need more power.)

, As you will have noticed some(most) research topics have requirements that must be met before you can research them, if so then complete the requirements and continue.


By now you might have been playing a few days, because it takes a rather long time to upgrade buildings, stockpile money, research topics Etc. Also at about this time it will be a bit harder to lay down a straight path to upgrade your base, and because of this we are nearing the point where you will have the necessary skills and knowledge to stop using this guide and forge your own path into the world of ZeldereX(which you have probably already been doing).

, If you have not already started attacking other players bases, you might want to look into it, it is a quick way to make cash but it is also a quick way to make enemies.


While we are on the subject Allies and Enemies can be both beneficial and harming.

Trusted Allies will protect you bases if someone attacks you, give tips and hints, establish trade routes with you(Max 5) and all around be you friend. However you should also protect your allies and doing so can make enemies.
Enemies are players who hate your guts and will stop at nothing to attack you and more or less destroy you. You can play the game without Allies or Enemies, but most likely you will be making Friends and Enemies sooner than you think.



, Choose wisely when you decide to start a new base.

The first thing you need to do is go to: http://rstein.org.,
Click on ""Play Game"" to start the game.,
Set up two cannons in front of the hole where the ants come out, keeping them towards the edge.

,
Click on one of the cannons.,
You should now have two Impact Cannons.,
Save up enough money to add two more cannons ($167).,
Upgrade these two into Quick Cannons 1 (Click the middle button).

,
Save up some more money ($160) and upgrade these into Quick Cannons 2 (Click on the first button).

,
Here's where it starts to get expensive.,
Wait some more until you have $400.,
Place two more cannons at the very edge of the screen next to the Impact Cannons.

,
Upgrade those all the way to Quick Cannons 3.

,
Now here comes the part you can't do in any other version.,
By now you should be at about level 55.,
Just to make sure all of the ants are constantly frozen, lets add another Ice Cannon 2 just above all of the other cannons.,
That's it for the Ice Cannons.,
Try different combinations and different places to put your cannons.",How to Get Past Level 70 in Antbuster,"
Click on the ""Antbuster"" picture to go to the game.

The reason you are doing this is because this is the original version of the game. This version will let you upgrade farther than any other version. (All cannons are more expensive than any other version but it's worth it to be able to upgrade farther).;
, You now have ten seconds to start placing cannons. If you mess up, then click on the clock, then click on end match.

,, At the bottom, some buttons should pop up. Immediately upgrade these to Heavy Cannon 1 (Click the first button). Then upgrade them to Impact Cannon 1 (Click the second button).

, Every time you get a new Quick Cannon 4, the speed and damage will increase by one.

, Place these parallel to the Impact Cannons.

,,, Wait awhile, until you have enough to upgrade those two Quick Cannons 2 into Quick Cannons 3. It's definitely worth the price.

, Click on the two Impact Cannons and upgrade the to Ice Cannons.

,,, Upgrade the Quick Cannons into Quick Cannons 4.

, Let's upgrade those ice cannons into Ice Cannons 2 so they will have better range and will freeze the ants faster.

, By the time you get that third Ice Cannon 2, you should be at level 70, more or less.

, The rest will all be Quick Cannons 4. So add another Quick Cannon 4 above the first two Ice Cannons. Now you should at least be at level 80.

, In this example, six ants were killed almost simultaneously. That means that six ants spawned almost simultaneously. All of them got past the cannons, picked up a slice of cake (regaining all lost health), and went through their hole. People have gotten to level 100 before with this strategy.

, At level 24, you'll get access to the mine. The mine allows you to dig for or use explosives to get minerals to make the metal bars needed to make jewellery. Occasionally, this will also release some diamonds, so try to mine frequently.


Watch out! If you're playing without paying, your store of shovels and explosives can soon run down, so avoid selling these if at all possible, as you'll need them for your own use.

, Sometimes it will land on a diamond.

, Occasionally the game makers will gift you a few diamonds for a special occasion. This can occur during seasonal events or an internal event. The amount of diamonds retrieved in this manner can occur anywhere from 1 to 5 diamonds. Look for the gift box, usually placed near the farmhouse by the postie.

, When the server goes offline and players can't play, there will sometimes be an apology gift from the game makers, consisting of diamonds. Again, look for the gift box, usually placed near the farmhouse by the postie.

, Clicking on prize boxes, clicking on the red metal work box both on your own farm and on others' farms can sometimes result in gaining a diamond or more.

, This will get you one diamond. And if you log in to Hay Day using Facebook, you'll get five diamonds. If you don't use or want to use Facebook, this step is optional.


If you like competitions, Supercell (the game makers) sometimes runs them from Facebook and prizes may include diamonds.

, At the start, leveling up isn't too hard as the amount of experience points needed isn't too high. However, as you start moving up the levels, the amount of experience points gets a lot higher and so gaining the diamonds by leveling up will be a very slow process and you don't get very many this way.

, Find the pink movie ticket and click on it (it is just by where the newspaper is.) You will be taken to the ""movies"", either an advertisement for similar games or sometimes a movie short. Watch the short, then close the box on its X indicator. Then accept the reward, which includes both experience points and a diamond.


If you're lucky, you'll get quite a run of these, which can soon add up. A recent change allows you to choose to watch a set of movies in a row, with a slight chance of getting a diamond or a bigger chance of getting something else.

, Diamonds can be purchased for real money. Not everyone wants to do this but it is an option.

, (The yellow shiny light) Think about it as a head-on-head collision. Your block vs their massive. If they massive forward, you block forward. If they massive upward, you block downward (due to bad coding, theirs seems as if its coming out the ground), and vise versa. If they massive backwards, block backwards (due to bad coding, it seems as if it comes out from behind you). There are a few more glitches that you can use to block massives.

, This involves breaking their defense and slashing repeatedly. Finding your own method will work best.

, Such as instead of doing DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF, you'd do DBF > Light-step > DBF > Light-step, or something of the sort. But instead of making it repeated, you'd do TBF > Light-step > DBF > DBF > Light-step > DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF > Light-step > TBF > Light-step. Don't copy me or it will defeat the purpose.

Search for ""Free Shards"".,
Ask your friends.,
Be flexible.,
If all else fails, make your own!

",How to Find a Good Free Online Roleplaying Game," This obvious step will return a lot of irrelevant hits (bad domains, bad pages), but occasionally, it will spit out a good link to a game that is free. You might find higher quality games on an actively maintained list such as Wikipedia's List of MMORPGs.;
, While popular game sites, such as Warcry Online, will feature a lot of modern, pay-to-play games, they will occasionally post something that you can play for free.

, When finding forums and newsgroups, make sure they are active (people post regularly, last post is not marked more than 2 months ago). In fact, the more active, the better.

, Most free to play games don't spend money to advertise. Their publicity is by word of mouth. Being a social player is key to finding new online roleplaying games to try out.

, These games usually are the latest generation in technology and they'll offer you the chance of playing tomorrow's next big MMO today. Some companies are even friendly enough to reward their best beta testers with free play time, items, and (rarely) free accounts. Most open-source MMORPGs will have free servers.

, These sometimes require you to provide credit card information, so if you don't have one, pass on it. But it's worth it to play the latest games.

, While these games still have pay to play features, they have also started to offer free accounts with limited access (like level restrictions). For the most part, however, you can play as long as you want and get a lot out of the game without spending a dime.

, A shard is a player-run server of an online game. Searching for them gives you two benefits: you'll know what game to buy and you'll know where to play for free once you have your game. Shards also have the added benefit of sometimes running special rule sets that the original creators don't run on their servers.

, One of them might turn out to know about a good game. Also, if you play with someone you know, the MMO might turn out to be a lot more fun than you thought it was.

, Maybe you were looking for a combat-centered, PvP only MMO. Go out on a limb and try something new like The Endless Forest instead of World of Warcraft. You might just find that you were looking for the wrong kind of game.

Get Achievements.,
Greet your friends.,
Do the Daily Quests.,
Beat up Eidolons.,
Go fishing.,
Go in the Sky Tower.,
Fight World Bosses.,
Explore the Otherworld.",How to Earn Loyalty Points (LP) in Aura Kingdom," The simplest way to get LP is by getting Achievements. There are many Achievements you can find in the game, from main quest achievements to gathering or cooking achievements. Anything you do for the first time, or for enough times, has its own set of Achievements and rewards, but each Achievement gives you some LP. You can find a list of Achievements and their requirements in the wiki or in fansites.


You can also do Daily Achievements, which has different goals that changes every day. Doing a few of them will net you at least about 100-200 LP, depending on your level and what areas are open to you. You can access them through the Journal menu, which you can get to by pressing L or clicking the book icon at the bottom of your screen. The third tab in the menu is labeled “Achievements,” and when you open it, head to the drop-down menu and scroll until you find the labels “Daily Gathering,” “Daily Top Kill,” and “Daily Wipeout.” Now keep completing all the quests there that you can do, and it will reliably net you quite a lot of LP in one day, especially in higher levels, when you have access to all the dungeons and maps in the game.;
, This requires some friends, which you can get by going on Parties or joining a Guild. Open up your Social tab, represented by the two people chumming around on your world map. Then, simply click the “Greet” button on the names of 10 people. Each name on the list yields 1 LP when you greet them, for a maximum of 10 people/LP once a day! Of course, this works best when you have a huge friends list, and requires for your friends to be online.


To join a Guild, press G or press the Guild tab icon, represented by a flag and found at the lower right portion of your screen. You’ll see a list of guilds you can join, and whichever you pick is your own preference and doesn’t really matter in the long run, unless you’re a very social person. Then just click the “Join” button. Aside from getting some friends, you’ll also get a small buff that gives you a slight increase in EXP and Loot Drops, and access to the Guild Hall, though you can only enter the Hall 24 hours after joining.

, Daily Quests are quests you can repeat every day for a given set of rewards, and they’re a good way to grind EXP, resources, and even LP! You can find a number of them in all the maps in the game, and while the rewards vary between quests, you can rely on those quests to be repeatable, making them a good way to save up LP.


Do know that some “daily” quests are only available in certain days, but still have good rewards.
So far, the Daily Quests that apparently yield the most LP are the following: “Cooking Quest” (Cactakara), “Doctor, Doctor” (Triatio Highlands), “Veggie Tales” (Crescent Hill), “Drop the Bomb” (Crescent Hill), “Moonlight Rabbit” (Crescent Hill), “Turkey Time” (Helonia), “Messenger of Love” (Helonia), and Trouble Time (Helonia).
At level 25, you will have access to Fame Quests, which are basically a random selection of unique quests you can find in Mirabelle’s Bulletin Boards. You can take up 5 of these a day, and you can access them daily. Quite a lot of these Fame Quests have Loyalty Points in their rewards too, so don’t forget about them when you’re doing a Daily Quest run.

, Here’s when things start getting somewhat high-leveled. On the northwest portion of the Crescent Hill map, directly south of the gates of Navea, there is a small, almost hidden path by the gates leading to a small pagoda. When you approach it, you can choose to transport yourself to the Temple of Eidolons. Once you’re in the temple, you can choose the level of the Eidolon you want to fight by picking from the boxes. When you pick which level you are confident you can fight, you will get an Unidentified Summoning Stone. Right-click it, and it will become a summoning stone for a random Eidolon. Now, get ready, buff yourself, and right-click the summoning stone to fight an Eidolon! You might even be lucky enough to get a Key of Gaia, or even just Key Fragments aside from Loyalty Points. Do note that you can only enter it once every 4 hours, making this a bit unreliable if you plan on employing this method alone.


A subquest appears at level 30 that makes you head on over here, so don’t worry too much if you’re unsure where it is.
You might also want to use a Treasure Charm before fighting Eidolons to maximize your loot gains. This applies for the Guild Hall Eidolon and World Bosses too.
If you’re part of a Guild, a Guild Hall Eidolon spawns every few hours on a schedule. They’re much more difficult to fight, since they’re made to fight an entire Guild, but if you and your guildmates manage to beat it, you’ll be rewarded with just about the same rewards as you do from beating an Eidolon in the Temple.

, While this isn’t exactly a high-level venture, you get to access higher-quality fishing stuff when you’re level 40. You can learn how to fish either in the earliest levels of the game or once you hit level 40, and when you go fishing, you have a small chance to pick up a Miracle Cube, which you can open with right-click for a chance to get LP coupons!


Note that you can only get Miracle Cubes from manual fishing, and not AFK fishing.

, This is when you know you hit the big leagues. The Sky Tower is accessible from level 60 onwards, and each level has different challenges and monsters for experienced players to test their mettle on. While you can only access it during the weekends, it's a great way to earn LP. On the higher floors, you get a chance to earn chests that may yield 50-100 LP at once.


If it's your first time tackling the Sky Tower, you'll also get Achievements for every floor you clear, worth 100 LP each.

, Much like the Guild Hall Eidolons, these monsters are pretty difficult and are meant to be fought by a whole lot of people. Each World Boss has their own schedule and spawning area, but are usually killed off immediately by those players camping out in the area and taking advantage of their schedule. If you manage to get a single hit on the Boss, though, you get some loot regardless.


To reduce the massive lag from the mob of players gathered at the World Boss spawn and to ensure you get a single, clear hit, use the Hide Players option in your World Map, and arrive there a solid 5-10 minutes before every boss spawn.
For further efficiency and to farm them effectively, switch channels or logout and log in again on the first channel of your server before the World Boss spawns. You’ll be in the same area you left when you switched. Once you get a hit on the Boss, wait a few seconds then switch to the second channel of the server since the boss will die in a few seconds after they appear, and you’ll still get the loot even when you switch. This will give you a small head start on the spawn on the next channel, since the World Boss appears on the first channel then moves to the succeeding channels every time they’re defeated. You can choose to chase them down the server channel list, or just stay put and count out your rewards.

, Once you hit level 50, you’ll be able to explore the Otherworld Port Skandia. This is basically a variation of your earliest map, where the enemies are much more powerful and the dungeons are much more difficult. Here, the enemies have a chance to drop LP. At level 60, you can then go to other Otherworlds, such as Helonia Coast, Miner’s Steepe, Gydaie Glen, and Alabastren Temple.


In the Otherworld, Eidolons have a chance of spawning at random, and Eidolons tend to drop LP as well.

, At level 10, you will be given the ability to join an Alliance War. Press the L key to open the Alliance War menu. With the Alliance War menu open, you’ll find details about different PvP campaigns currently in progress. Each campaign is a different instance of the same PvP region., Locate the Campaign tab. The Campaign tab can be found in the top right corner of the Alliance War menu.

Once on the Campaign tab, select one of the campaigns and press E to join it.
Once you’ve joined a Campaign, you can highlight your joined Campaign and press the “Go to Campaign” button to be transported to the PvP region.
You can rejoin your campaign at any point in Tamriel by accessing the Alliance War menu with the L key.

, When you join the PvP region for the first time, you’ll be able to find an NPC that will give you a quest and explain the basics of PvP in Elder Scrolls Online to you. You must complete this quest before you can fight other players., You will need to talk to your faction’s NPC quest-giver for the ‘Welcome to Cyrodiil’ quest. When speaking to the correct NPC, you’ll be given the option to either learn about how the Transitus Shrine PvP fast travel system works or skip the tutorial for the Transitus Shrine. It is recommended that first time players do not skip the tutorial.

If you’re in the Covenant faction, speak to Veronard Liancourt.
If you’re in the Dominion faction, speak to Arcarin.
If you’re in the Pact faction, speak to Olvyia Indaram.

, You will now be requested to visit an area to begin the siege munitions tutorial. You will need to use the Transitus Shrine to fast travel to one of the following three locations.

If you’re in the Covenant faction, travel to the Northern High Rock Gate.
If you’re in the Dominion faction, travel to the Western Elsweyr Gate.
If you’re in the Pact faction, travel to the Southern Morrowind Gate.

, Once you’ve travelled to the correct area, you’ll need to ask an NPC in the area for siege munitions. Your quest marker will guide you to the correct NPC.

If you’re in the Covenant faction, speak to Zahreh.
If you’re in the Dominion faction, speak to Fangil.
If you’re in the Pact faction, speak to Mirrored-Skin.

, After collecting the siege munitions, you’ll be asked to complete the siege tutorial. This tutorial will take you through the basics of attacking sieges and will explain more about how PvP works in Elder Scrolls Online. Once again, you’ll need to speak to a certain NPC character to start the siege tutorial. First, you’ll have to travel to a different area using the Transitus Shrine. After completing the siege tutorial, you’ll be free to travel throughout Cyrodiil to search for other players to fight.

If you’re in the Covenant faction, find the siege range near Southern High Rock Gate and speak to Bugbesh.
If you’re in the Dominion faction, find the siege range near Eastern Elsweyr Gate and speak to Zan.
If you’re in the Pact faction, find the siege range near Northern Morrowind Gate and speak to Adalmor.

, Now that the tutorial is completed, you’re given the freedom to traverse the PvP region of Cyrodiil without any restriction. Whilst playing, there will be different objectives that you can capture to help your own faction.

The goal for each faction is to take control of as many objectives as possible. By doing so, all faction members will receive benefits throughout the rest of Elder Scrolls Online. Capturing objectives on your own can be difficult, but you’ll often find contested areas on the Cyrodiil map, which can be accessed from the Transitus Shrine. These are the best places to get involved.

, If you find an enemy that you think you can take on in a fight, initiate an attack on them just like you would with a standard non-player mob. Even if you don’t win the fight, you’re still slowing them down from completing their own objectives. As you play through Cyrodiil and Tamriel, you’ll have the chance to unlock better gear, which will improve your chances at defeating another player. Your level also plays a big part in your chance to win a fight, so being successful in PvP requires you to max your level as quickly as possible. If you can’t find any action, look on the Transitus Shrine for the following icons:

Two or three crossed swords signifies a cross-faction conflict.
A splash behind any other symbol indicates that the area is being sieged.
The larger the icon, the bigger the scale of the fight is.

, Click Duelling Club on the Pottermore map, or on the lower bar on any screen. Before you start duelling for points, try practicing:Practice Your Spells.


""Practice your spells"" lets you cast spells without an opponent, just for practice.
""Practice against your house"" duels with another member of your house. No one wins or loses points for this., The more difficult spells to cast will give you a higher score if you do a good job. To start with, you'll only know three spells. Fire-Making Spell is the most difficult and powerful, while Curse of Bogies is the easiest and weakest.Due to recent updates, the max score for each spell is unknown. According to the official instructions, there are now only two types of spell., When the duel starts, you'll see several circles with letters in them. To cast a spell, you'll need to activate these circles in a certain order, and with good timing. There are two ways to activate a circle:


Click it with the mouse cursor, or

Press the letter on your keyboard displayed inside the circle.

, Look at the spell name at the bottom of the screen. The glowing letters in the name tell you which order you'll need to click the letters. For example, if the first glowing letter is a P, look for the circle with a P inside. That's where you'll start.


The circles will be in the same place each time, but the letters will be different.You'll always go through the circles in the same order.
Once you begin, a white line will guide you to the next circle. You'll make fewer mistakes if you find the order before this starts, though.

, Start your spellcasting by activating the first circle. A ring will appear and expand outward. Activate the same circle a second time. The larger the ring is when you do this, the more points you get. But be careful — the ring disappears in a second or less.

, A white line will appear and move toward the next circle you need to press. Activate that circle as soon as the line reaches its center. The better your timing, the more powerful your spell. As before, a ring will appear. Activate the circle again before the ring disappears.


For the best score, don't click the line as soon as it reaches the edge of the circle. Give it time to reach the center.

, The white line will continue on to the next circles in order. Click each circle when the line touches it (or press the right key). Click again when the ring reaches its largest point.


If you mess up your timing too badly, the spell will end early and be much less powerful.

, Return to the Duelling Club screen. Challenge your friends in other houses using the links under their names, or click on a house crest to duel a random opponent in that house. The winner earns 5 points for her house, but there is no penalty for losing.


Once you've challenged someone, their name will appear on the recently played list. Challenge them to a Rematch if you think you can beat them.

, You can learn more difficult, powerful spells by finding more spellbooks. There are currently two of these that teach Duelling spells, besides the required starting books:Buy The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 2) from Flourish and Blott's. Its most powerful spell is Disarming Charm (max score 163).
Pick up the spellbook on the bench in Book 1, Chapter 12. Its most powerful spell is Jelly Legs Curse (max score 163).
It can be better to choose a weaker spell, if you can consistently get a higher score with it.

, Once you're pretty good at a song, hum a song as you click. Choose a song that follows the rhythm of your mouse clicks or keyboard presses. You can try a metronome instead, but it might take several tries to get it set to the right timing., Each spell requires a different timing. You'll get the best score if you practice a single spell many times. Switching between them is only useful early on, when you're trying to find out which is easiest for you.

, You can sometimes get a second chance at a spell, if you're quick. As soon as you mess up, click your browser's Refresh button. The page will reload, and, if you're lucky, you'll get a second chance at the spell.


The Pottermore developers haven't said anything publicly about this tactic, but it's possible it could be considered cheating. Cheating can result in your house points being taken away.

You don't need a scarf, a necklace, a mask; maybe just a little flower as a hair accessory. Remember, you don't need a HC or VIP membership to look nice. Basically, go or the stuff that looks the most casual and normal.;
, Don't use the ""bacon"" hair, for example., Hoodies are fine, even short or long sleeved shirts. Sometimes the shirts with no sleeves are the best., Girls could wear (black or grey) shorts or even the short skirt (not the longer skirt, you'll look like a grandma). Guys could wear the long, baggy pants., Don't wear fluorescent green, it doesn't look that elegant.

Try to use colours that look good together, wear pants, shorts, or even skirts (sometimes that, it depends.)
It's good to pick neutral colors -- like grey, brown, maybe blue.

, You can wear the eye patch (if an HC)., For example, you could wear the award item, feather, the ""key"" chain, and the teeth necklace. No bling, scarves or other jewelry allowed. No belts either unless you are a male (wear the star belt or the brown H belt).


You don't need to wear glasses.
Don't wear the ""nipple"" hat with the butterfly clip or headphones and the long messy hair, that look is way overused and most people assume you're a boy.

, For the shoes -- try Lego blocks or the thin sandals. High heels or sneakers are a personal choice., If people are mean to you, you don't need to put up with it; everyone deserves respect, so stand up for yourself. However, do not lose your temper and start blaring in caps lock, because it's going to make you seem like a noob. Accept that not everyone is going to like you but just ignore them. You may choose to keep to yourself, or talk just a little.

, There's nothing more annoying than someone who begs for furniture or keeps asking for rights. Don't do that. If it seems like someone doesn't want to talk to you, then just leave them alone. When you go into someone's room, just quietly sit down. Simple as that.

, You can talk using such words as: ""ur, lol, rofl, lmao, haha, replacing ""s"" with ""z"". (Just don't use them for formal writing.)


Carry out normal conversations. Don't talk about weird things.







, Socialize with those players who act smart. Hang out in nicely furnished rooms, with rich owners.


Stay in help centers and in rich casinos. Whenever there is a party going on, go there. Socialize all the time.






Don't add random people.







, You probably need to buy credits. Players are attracted to the players who have a lot of credits, and furniture. They will tend to be nicer to you as they will want some of your share. Be nice to them too, you don't get unlimited friends and people who are nice to you.


If you don't have any furniture, try playing games such as ""CC, FF, or DHTW""







, People who spam you, tease you, upset you are probably not the best type of people/friends to have around you, so choose wisely when making friends. Observe a person first. Remember, you need friends you can trust, and who are nice and respectful to you.

Here's a list of clothing to avoid.,
Use dark colours.,
Make your bottoms grey.,
Match your shoes with your top.",How to Look Good on Habbo if You Aren't Hc2,"

Belts



 


Bling necklaces






Weird shoes, go for the flat ones or the trainers.






Afro or spiky hair.





;
, Use the greys, greens and reds. Use these for T-Shirts. Use the short sleeved ones or the unbuttoned one. If you must, go for jewellery go for the diamond one.

, Use the darkest grey. Go for the trousers, shorts or jeans. Use a light blue for jeans. If you must have a belt go for the white belt.

, This will make you look so much nicer. If you don't want that, go for white shoes or black. Use the flat square one or the trainers. Don't go for the slippers.

"
Things to avoid:

'Bacon' hair.,
Use nice colors.,
Use the skirt.,
Match the shoes.,
Make your hair a very bright crazy colour.",How to Look Good on Habbo if You Aren't Hc3," It's the long hair that has highlights and is the color that is reddish brown and resembles strips of bacon. (Lots of people think bacon hair is ugly and it makes you seem like a noob)






Swirly top






Long skirt.







, Go for light blue, purple and light purple. The light pink is overused and just looks silly. Don't go over the top with accessories.

, Skirts are nice, use black or white. If you want to make a dress, use the tank top and make the skirt the same colour and use a belt. If you want to look laid back (and look nicer), go for grey shorts.

, Use sandals or the flat shoes. Make them black, white or the color of your top. Avoid the heels, many people think they're trampy. Don't go for the slippers, as they're immature and only noobs and the people who act like little kids and tawk wike vis use them.

, Most HC use this style. By doing this, you can look more like them."

Play games.,
Host games.,
Go to giveaways.,
Simply ask.,
Open a shop.",How to Get More Coins in Habbo," Many users host games such as Telephrase, Falling Furni, Cozzie Change, and more, and typically give out prizes. As you play these games more often, you will improve at these games, and eventually win prizes, such as coins or furniture that can only be purchased with coins.;
, Though you will usually need to give out a prize, getting people to pay to play is a way to get more furniture. After accumulating furniture from other games, host a game with higher stakes (multiple furniture, or perhaps coins), and ask if players are interested in paying to play if 1) they have lost a round, or 2) are waiting at the door. Charge only one furni, so people will be more inclined to pay.

, Though these can often be scams, giveaways (such as ones created by owners of Habbo fansites) can be a great way to get furniture or coins. Some will have you go to a website (usually a Habbo fansite) for a code to redeem your prize, or will simply be giving out their furni when they are leaving Habbo. Be weary of scammers, however.

, Start an event entitled ""Donate"", and see if any generous donors are willing to give you furniture or coins.

, If in your efforts you have only received furniture and have no use for it, sell it. Put out all your unwanted furni and start an event advertising it. To drawn in more customers, price everything at one coin, or perhaps two items for one coin.

Beware unsavory casinos.,

Stay away from so-called coin generators.,
Report suspicious in-game activity.",How to Get Habbo Coins for Free," One sure-fire way to earn coins for Habbo is to complete surveys and corporate offers through the official Habbo website. To do this, first, visit the ""Earn Credits"" page under the ""Credits"" tab on the official Habbo site. Sign in and pick an available offer, then follow the prompts as directed to earn your credits. Keep track of your credit deliveries by using the ""Support"" link on the credit offer page. Eventually, you should notice your new credits in your profile's purse.


Another similar opportunity is the Watch & Earn service. The premise is simple: you watch an advertisement, and you're given a random prize (usually cheap furniture, but sometimes coins). To access Watch & Earn, click the Watch & Earn button in the top right corner of your screen (it will only appear when video offers are available).If you use offers and surveys outside of the official Habbo.com website be careful to verify their legitimacy. Some third party sites may offer coins for completing surveys and offers in a way that seems similar to legitimate methods but could actually be a scamming attempt. Some things to consider when judging a websites intent are the age of the domain, the URLs status on security websites like McAfee and Norton and whether you are being asked to do anything dangerous like download executables. Under no circumstances should you enter your Habbo password outside of the official Habbo login page.;
, There are dozens of games to be played in Habbo. Some are official Habbo creations, while others are made by the users. Some are just for fun, while others are high-stakes. The latter can be a source of coins if you're lucky or skilled enough to win consistently, so consider trying your hand at these sorts of games as a source of coins. Below are just a few games that sometimes award coins:


Falling Furni
Don't Hit My Wall
Trivia
Bingo

, In Habbo, there are coins to be made from both sides of the gaming equation. While some games are free to play, others (especially games made by the Habbo community and third parties) can require coins. Three common ""pricing"" options make it possible for the host to profit from a game — usually, the host must be paid in either coins or furni (which can be sold or traded for coins):P2P (Pay to play): A spectator must pay to join a game that's in progress.
P2S (Pay to stay): A player who has lost the game can pay to keep playing.
Rev (Revenge): A player pays to make another player of their choice lose.

, If you think you have what it takes to be a Habbo mogul, start buying low and selling high! Furniture (called ""furni"" by Habbo users) is the cornerstone of the Habbo economy. In fact, buying furni is a huge reason for why Habbo users want coins in the first place. Furni is available at basically every price level, so even if you're starting with next to nothing, it's possible to work your way up from the bottom if you always sell furni at a profit. In 2013, over a million items were traded in the Habbo marketplace, so there's no shortage of in-game commerce to take advantage of!For the most profit, try to get your hands on seasonal and rare furni. When items are hard to obtain or are only given out for a limited amount of time, they're inherently more valuable than when they're commonplace. For instance, if you grab a limited-edition item and hold onto it until it's no longer being produced, you'll be able to demand a very high price for it because people who want it will have no other way to get it.

, One odd type of game in Habbo that can potentially win you big coin prizes is called a ""grabber"" (or sometimes a ""rare grabber""). Grabbers are essentially games of pure chance. In grabber, various prizes are laid out in a square grid. The player randomly selects two numbers from 1-6 (like rolling two dice) and wins the prize that's in the corresponding square on the grid.While the prizes can sometimes be lucrative, because you must rely on pure luck to win, they're often not a wise long-term investment.


To determine whether a grabber game is profitable or not, find the game's average payout like this: Add up all of the coins in the grid (if there are furni, use their coin value). Next, divide by the number of squares in the grid. For instance, if there are a total of 20 coins in a typical 6x6 grid, we would divide 20/36 = 5/9 = 0.56. This means that, on average, you'll win about half a coin. If you have to pay more than this to play, the game isn't a smart investment.
Note also that 6x6 grids aren't always used. For instance, if the same 20 coins above were arranged in a 3x3 grid, there would be a payout of 20/9 = 2.22 coins per square on average. However, because you're rolling two numbers from 1-6, the nine squares in the 3x3 grid represent only a quarter of your total combinations! In other words, 3/4 of the time, you'll win nothing at all.

, Your Habbo experience doesn't have to be limited to simply interacting, trading, and playing games. Believe it or not, some Habbo users even work in the world of Habbo. To find a paying job, look for a room that's advertised as ""hiring"" or ""paying"" in the navigator (restaurants and cafes are good places to look). When you find one, talk to the owner and tell them you'd like the job. Careful — you may be asked to list your qualifications or prove you're not a ""noob!""


Note that compensation rates for in-game jobs will usually be very low — after all, you're not really working. However, even if you earn just a single furni per week, for instance, you can use these furni items to start trading and amassing your wealth. Get creative — no matter what you're paid, try to turn it into cold, hard Habbo coins!

, Occasionally, one-time events in the world of Habbo offer you the chance to earn coins in-game. These can take many, many different forms. Some involve special contests or games, others are events used to correct the Habbo economy after a major patch or modification to Habbo, and some defy classification. These promotions never last forever, though, so be ready pounce as soon as you see one!


One example of a limited-time promotion is a seasonal rare furni giveaway. These events, which are often put on for a holiday, sometimes involve the sale of limited edition furni. Because these rare furni are so valuable, it's possible to profit greatly if you buy one and hold onto it until its value increases., Habbo boasts a vibrant, active community of over 5 million unique users per month. Unfortunately, as with any community of this size, a small percentage of the members are bad apples who don't have qualms about cheating an unsuspecting newcomer out of their hard-earned coins. This sort of deception can take many forms — the most direct are schemes that aim to steal your login information so that the scammer can take your coins and items. Below are a few common examples of this tactic:Phishing: emails or messages from someone claiming to be a Habbo staff member or moderator asking for your username and/or password. Real Habbo staff members and mods will never ask for these details.
Password-blocking scams. Often used to trick new users — the scammer pretends that Habbo automatically censors a user's password by typing a fake blocked-out password in the chat window (e.g., ""Check this out! Habbo censors your password. ********* See?""). If a naive user tries this, their password will appear in the chat window uncensored.

, As of August 2014, casinos have been essentially banned in Habbo — games of random chance that award furni are no longer allowed and there is a hard limit of three dice games per room.Before the ban, not all casinos in Habbo operated fairly, making gambling a risky source of income. However, since the ban, the gambling that remains has become even more illegitimate and informal. Don't rely on improvised games of chance to make money — it's usually easy for the dealer or organizer to steal from you, especially if you need to provide your bet or wager up-front.

, Never, ever give anything (especially rare furni) to someone you don't strictly trust. Once you give something to another player, it's theirs. No matter what they promise they'll do for you once they have your items, there's nothing preventing them from simply taking them and walking away. Because of this, you shouldn't ever give other players your items under any circumstances unless they're a proven friend. Below are a just a few examples of the sort of lies players may use to get you to give up your assets:


Offers to duplicate your item (this is impossible)
Offers to give you moderator status in exchange for your item (moderators aren't chosen like this)
Threatening to block your account (real moderators will never do this maliciously)

, When it comes to getting Habbo coins, if an offer seems to be too true, it probably is. For instance, a common scam run by malicious third-party sites unassociated with Habbo is to offer to instantly generate cons for your account for free. Though this offer may sound appealing, in reality, there is no way to get unlimited coins for free. Sites that offer to do this may ask for your login information, force you to complete surveys, or worse before you're given your free coins. In any case, you'll never actually get the coins you ask for, so don't bother with these scam services.


Some coin generator sites can appear remarkably legitimate, but this shouldn't be taken as a sign of their actual legitimacy. For instance, some coin generator sites use a ticker displaying the names of users who have supposedly just given themselves coins (e.g., ""User12309 just generated 9999 coins."") to entice new users into falling for their trap.

, If you come across a scam attempt, or, worse, if you're the victim of one, don't let the scammer get away. Instead, report the scammer to a moderator by using the Call For Help (CFH) tool. Moderators have the administrative power to stop the scam, and, if necessary, remove the offending players from the community. Though it's certainly not guaranteed, there's a chance you may even be able to recover any coins or furni you've lost.


Most important, however, is that by reporting a scam, you're preventing the scammer from cheating other Habbo users the way they attempted to cheat you. Habbo is a participation-based online community, so look out for your fellow community members to keep the Habbo experience safe and entertaining for everyone.

Have guts.,
Have a variety of music.,
Have a Habbo account.,
Get Sam Broadcaster.,
Have furniture for competitions.,
Be friendly.,
Be on Habbo a lot.,
Have a party room, Fan-sites like to see fun party rooms, If you can't make one because you are a norm, don't have coins etc., that's fine.,
Make a fun introduction for yourself.,
Make fun themes for your shows such as Sci-Fi Night, Country Western Showdown Night, whatever you can think of.,
Use your common sense, Do you listen to songs on the radio in your car with epic amount of swear in them?,
Read DJ rules thoroughly.,
Create good original backtracks.,
Have fun.",How to Become a Good Habbo DJ," You need to not be afraid while on the air.Don't have the attitudes like ""you won't gain listeners"" and ""your show will be a big boring mess"".;
, Make sure you have at least 100 songs, obtained legally of course. Make sure you have a wide variety of genres.

, How can you be successful without one?

, Most fan-sites have links to where you can get this, But if they don't, the 30-day free trial works, as most DJs get bored after that. Winamp works too, but it's extremely different, and the seniors, heads and managers won't be able to help with technical difficulties.

, Lots of people listen for chances to win free furniture and tell their friends.

, Listeners like to get to know the Dj's. Its never fun when you walk up to a DJ who you like on the air, and they are mean when you talk to them.

, It's nice to gain some credibility with the listeners right?

, Just ask another Dj to lend you their room, Or ask if there's a standard room for all the Dj's.

, When you apply they want to hear a quick sample of you ""Deejaying"" Record yourself for under thirty seconds as if you were Deejaying. This step is a sample recording you could do. ""Hey Its Your Girl/Dude DJ *insert DJ name here* And you're tuned into *insert fan-site name here* So keep it locked because *insert funny saying here*"" That's a pretty good dj application. Then when you're done recording, Don't add music, Don't add sound effects, They want to hear you. Upload it to Mediafire.com and post the link in the link spot. Upload it if they have that option.

, Play music to match the theme of your show that night. Make it fun, interesting, and memorable, Remember there's tons of other DJs and you want the listeners to remember you, Not others.

, No. So don't play them on a habbo fansite. Especially if they are looking for more official fansites, That wouldn't help your chances of becoming official, and you could get infracted/fired for doing so.

, You need to know what to do and what not to do, to make sure your first few shows goes well.

, Don't use the same ones which all other DJ's have used. That annoys the listeners

, Be exciting, Introduce yourself. Have a great time.

Decide on what sort of roleplay you want to choose, and whether you are able to host it or not.,
If you are looking for a roleplay that consists of a job (such as working in the Habbo version of Starbucks, McDonalds, a police force, etc) then the easiest way to find this is by using the 'jobs' categories, or searching for 'jobs'.,
If you are looking for an alternative roleplay, then search for 'Roleplay' or try searching for roleplaying groups.,
Find out what the rules of the room are, and get to know the people that run it.",How to Be Good at Role Playing on Habbo Hotel," Going and seeking out role-players is a good way to introduce yourself and meet new people. Having friends who also enjoy roleplaying will mean - should you decide to host your own - means you will find it easier to gain members.;

Be friends with one/all of the popular people.,
If someone calls you names just try to say something nice and say it calm so it won't become a bigger fight.

,
Respect the popular habbos.,
Try getting a rich boyfriend or girlfriend.",How to Be Popular on Habbo Hotel2," The popular Habbos didn't become popular by sitting quietly in the corner. They went to Public Rooms, chatted about stuff, became friends and kept them. Go to the welcome rooms, look at some ""cool"" people and try to dress like them.

, That way, you can ask for advice, copy them (don't let them find out) and hang out with them.

,, They will *hopefully* respect you back. Maybe act a little bit like other cool habbos. The way they talk, act, move or react. Don't get the wrong idea and follow all the popular people. Just if your friends with one, hang with them!

, Ask them to move some furniture into your room, so they can share houses.

"
"
Avoid stupid spellings (hoi, shure, yeahz, wazzup, hubbo, hobbo, etc.).,
Learn your basic Habbo slang.",How to Be Popular on Habbo Hotel3," You'll just come across as a total ""noob"". Try spelling like a normal person, and carry out common conversation. Type with proper punctuation and spelling, this can really intimidate people and make them think you're cool.

, Furni means furniture. Bobba is a swear word. Noob is a new Habbo. Hola is a common greeting. Z's often replace S's. HC means Habbo Club. Norm is a person who is NOT in Habbo Club. Your vocabulary will expand as you move on in Habbo. People who don't say ""whut iz furni?"" often look better than the people who just continue talking than asking a stupid question.

"
"
Know your boundaries!",How to Be Popular on Habbo Hotel4," Don't just walk on into a HC Party if you are a norm, and don't crash Norm parties if you're HC.

"
"
Get rich!,
Make a storage room and get rid of your starter furni.,
Get credits.",How to Be Popular on Habbo Hotel5," You don't have to shell out $15 on credits to get furni. Play games like Falling Furni, mazes, and other things. Look in descriptions or titles to see if there is a prize rewarded, then play to win. You can also win coins to buy HC and furni.

, You could have gained a lot of popularity, but when someone sees a starter lamp, they'll be turned off.

, If you're not allowed to, play games like falling furni or cozzie change. You may or may not win, but you still have plenty of fun playing anyway!

Don't give your password or other account details to anyone asking for them in exchange for free Furni, coins, or moderator status.,
Report any behaviour that looks like a scamming attempt to moderators.,
Understand that Habbo staff do not use MSN, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!",How to Avoid Getting Scammed on Habbo," Use common sense; if you can tell the host is going to scam, it's best not to pay any Furni. This goes for casinos as well.;
, It will most likely be a scam.

, Ensure the room owner is well known and the room is decorated nicely. For example, if you come across a school that's fully furnished, it should be safe. Oppositely, if the room only has a few chairs and tables, it's probably not a good idea.

, Don't visit any suspicious websites that ask for these, either.

, This can be done via the Call For Help tool (CFH).

Make a new account and call it something noobish, like coolboy165243 or hotgurl829456. If you're using numbers at the end write your user name on a piece of paper.;
, Completely disobey the rule of looking good when you arent HC. For the ladies, use bacon hair, the bunny slippers and wear pink a lot (that colour's overused). For men, dress up as a gangster, with a hoodie, bling and sneakers.

, Go for something overused and just plain stupid. Like 'Ouch, you clicked too hard' and 'I am da gangsta babez'. Be creative, no-one's going to know it's you!

, and 'Aren't I the coolest?'. They will get so frustrated they will leave the room and delete you from their contact list. Or you can act like a real newbie and then when they're gone message them stupid stuff. Victim number one - mission complete!

, Dance in the middle of the lounge dancing and move to HC's and call them a noob repeatedly. Keep friend requesting them and insulting them.

, Block doors, say stuff like '(username) has a big head' and say LOL to everything people are saying, even if they're talking about Barack Obama.

, It lags up the game and will annoy people. If a Habbo asks you to stop your noobish dancing, say 'HOW?' or 'I CAN'T!' or even better... 'LOL!'.

, This just annoys everyone. It'll be so bad people will yell at you and have trouble with what you are saying. ls dnt s ny vowels s ths wll bg vryn (Also don't use any vowels as this bugs everyone). If you want to be yelled at type like this.

Plenty of game rooms and casinos are scams.,
Never forget that a single click is all it takes for the owner to ban you from his room even if you won fair & square.",How to Be Habbo Savvy1," Stay clear of onomatopoeia, oft-used internet acronyms & numbers. Names like these will do you little credit. Eg: ""BAMitsJack"" ""OMGitsJack-"" ""LOLJackLOL"" ""Jack1997"";
, Stay clear of clichés such as ""I'm not crazy ask my oven"", ""My motto ran that way"", ""A fat kid ate my motto"" etc. If you're really stumped, song lyrics are your friend.

, Do not copy anyone wholesale. If you are new, it's good to scout around & see what others are wearing. Or you could join a modelling contest if you don't mind getting clued in rather rudely. After getting eliminated a few times, I caught on that pink skin isn't cool & neither is salmon-coloured hair.

Beware of quick traders.",How to Be Habbo Savvy2," Wait your turn & don't forget to say please & thank you.

, There is no need to memorize prices, no one will quiz you on it. And if they do, tell them to check themselves.

,, Even with the new update on the trade function to include the 3-second wait & double confirmation, young kids still fall for quick trade scams. A common example is when the trader offers you 2 of the same sofa then takes 1 out just before sealing the deal. As the icon of the sofa is still in place & only the tiny number indicating the quantity of the item changes, some will not be quick enough to spot the trick.

"
"
Be polite to every customer.,
Always arrange your items neatly.,
Always ensure that every item on display is in fact, up for sale.,
Avoid displaying more than two of the same item.,
Always try to trade the items from your inventory first (rather than those on display).,
Open your store for no more than two hours or so at a stretch.",How to Be Habbo Savvy3," Not because they are nice, but because you are.

, Categorizing them would be best e.g. putting seats together on one side & plants together on another.

, Displaying items that are not for sale will only annoy your customers who will then annoy you with their questions and remarks.

, Having more of the same item in your inventory will make it easier for you to trade them without having to pick anything up.

, Anyone who is insistent that you pick your things up for no apparent reason is just spoiling for trouble. Ban him. He isn't worth your time or effort.

, Being cranky will turn away customers. Close your store once you find yourself tired, annoyed etc.

Find a binder that you like.,
If you don't have them already, get a fairly large number of page protectors.,
Gather the rest of your materials.,
Set everything down on a flat surface.,
Draw and color a front page to put on the cover.,
Put in the information that you've gathered.,
Keep adding to your Webkinz binder over time.,
Have fun with it!",How to Make a Webkinz Binder," This will be where you store all the information you have in the binder.


If you want a simple binder that gets the job done, go for black or white. But if you want to have a fancier binder, go for one that is a bright color or even one that has a pattern on it!
No matter which binder you choose, make sure that it's one you like. If you don't like the binder, you might not want to open it, no matter how important the information in it is!;
, You know those plastic sheets that you put over paper when you put it in a binder? You want a lot of those. That way, the pages inside won't get ripped or crinkled, and if you accidentally spill something on the binder by mistake, the information inside won't be destroyed.

, You want something to draw with; a pencil is best, but if you are really good at drawing and don't make many mistakes, a pen is also useful. You also want something to color with, like markers, crayons, or colored pencils. You'll need paper, and you'll also need your Webkinz and any information about them that you want to put in the binder.


If you are storing your account information in this binder, gather this while you gather your other materials.
If you like, also gather any pictures of your Webkinz that you have. If you don't have any pictures, and you have a camera, over time, take a few pictures of them (and also take a group picture) and get them printed.
If you are a good drawer, you could also draw your Webkinz, but this could take some time.

, You could use a table, a desk, the floor, a chair, etc. but no matter what kind of surface you will be using, you want the surface to be flat.

, Try to make it Webkinz-related! You could draw some of your Webkinz, or various Webkinz items and symbols! But make it creative, make it about you and your Webkinz, and make it unique! You don't want your binder to look exactly like every other Webkinz Binder ever created by anyone.


If you're not a drawing kind of person, print out some pictures of your Webkinz off your computer and glue them to a piece of paper, and then write on that piece of paper (just not the photos!).

, This will help fill up your binder so that it's not just an empty page with a cover and you will have all your information gathered into one place!


If you so desire, spruce up the pages a little bit by drawing fun pictures on them. For example, if you have a piece of paper devoted to all of your Webkinz' birthdays, you could draw a birthday cake or party hats.

, Naturally, you may get another Webkinz, so if you do, add information about them to the binder. Also, if you set up a second (or third, fourth, fifth, etc.) account, you may want to either start a new binder for it or add that account to your current Webkinz binder.

, You're not limited by the steps here or what others are doing; add your own pages and your own flair! It's your Webkinz Binder, so go with it!

, This is a white number next to the distance to the hole, mentioned in step one. Add this to the hole's distance, unless it's negative, then you subtract it.

, With the optimal spin stat, 7 spin, these will be: 1W - 3y, 2W - 5y, 3W - 7y, and all irons, about 9y. Subtract this from the number you got in step 2.

, For every 1m of vertical wind, the effect will be about .6 tiles on the green for 1w, .8 for 2w, and .95 tile for 3w. After you add or subtract the correct number here, you have the power you must use.

, Take the club's maximum power and divide it by 10. Each notch/small line on the power bar is this number, 10% of the maximum power. For example, a 240y club would be 24y per notch. This means every 5% is 12y, every 2.5% is 6y, 1.25% is 3y, etc.

,, For every 1m of wind horizontally (left and right), you need to adjust this many green tiles (approximately): 1W - .6, 2W - .8, 3W - .95

, Start the power meter and look at the model ball in the lower left corner. If your ball is on a slope, black ""steps"" should show around the green horizontal line. Count these steps and multiply by two. This is how many tenths of a tile you must move (count 4 steps and move .8 tiles).

Pouetpu Games - Super Mario Flash and Super Mario Flash 2

Mario Games - Super Mario Flash and Super Mario Flash 2

Via gaming sites like FRIV! - click the Mario icon
And many more - just search 'Super Mario Flash' and you'll see pages of search results.;
,, Press 'Change' to view the next background, 'Select' to pick the one you're currently viewing or 'Custom BG' to upload your own image to use.
Next, set the dimensions of the course (just use the default values if you're not sure) for both layers and press 'Select'. You're ready to start building!, However, to build the best possible level it's a good idea to think about what your level will involve. If you like, draw it out roughly - but only if it's going to be complicated.

Planning what you're going to have before you get stuck in means that it'll have a better structure and you can make it more quickly.
Plus, once you're finished you will probably be more pleased with the results because it's what you wanted it to be, not a random collection of enemies!

, Do you want it to be scary, or fun? Both? Will there be ghosts? Water and fish? How about revolving platforms, invisible walls or warp pipes? There are infinite possibilities!, Or are you going upwards (if so, you may need to adjust the dimensions of the course that you chose in Part 1 to make the Y bigger than the X)? Downwards? Backwards?, If you were eager, you might have closed down the pop-up box that tells you the editor controls before you read it. Don't panic - here they are:

Move around: arrow keys

Show or hide menu: space bar, ctrl or end key

Select objects: mouse


, One thing that's easy to forget is to set Mario's starting position. If you don't set it, your game won't work and he won't appear at all. Do it as soon as you start, otherwise it gets... complicated. Here's how:

Press Space to open the menu.
Choose 'Entrances' from the menu options across the top.
Click on Mario.
Press Space to hide the menu.
Position Mario wherever you want him to start.
Click once he's in place.

If you change your mind, you'll need to do the same but instead of clicking where you want him to go, first click on the Mario that you've already set to remove it. Then position him in a new place and click.


If you're planning on setting a halfway point, check Halfway and End Points below before you add any other entrances (otherwise you'll need to redo them all!)

, If you've ever played Mario, you'll know that there isn't a single level where there are no coins, blocks, question blocks etc. They're super quick and easy to insert, and will give you the overall layout once you've got a few in place:

Press Space to open the menu.
Choose 'Tiles' from the menu options across the top.
There's a range of tiles to choose from. Click on the one you want to insert.

Note: the icons above the question blocks show what you'll get when you add them.


You can insert coins for Mario to collect in the same way.

, Now you've added a few blocks, you might be wanting Mario to jump across a gap in the ground. Who knows, perhaps you want to remove all the ground and make it a different colour. Or maybe not (that would take ages!) - but at some point this might be handy. Here's how you can remove ground:

Press Space to open the menu.
Choose 'Tiles' from the menu options across the top.
Click 'Next' once or until you see ground tiles that match your theme.
Select any tile and press Space to hide the menu.
Click on the ground tiles that are already there to remove them.
Remove the tiles next to the hole and replace them with blocks that curve round into the hole.

This means that the ground doesn't end abruptly; it looks better and more professional. It's highly recommended, though not essential.
To do this, open up the menu again, choose the appropriate block, hide it and click. You'll need different ones for each end of the gap.



, You know how to remove ground, but how do you add it? Making platforms is fairly straightforward, in theory, but just like when creating gaps it takes a little more work to create smooth, professional platforms:

Remove the ground if necessary using the steps above.

Note: you don't need to remove the existing layer of ground first - it's personal taste.


Go back to the Tiles section of the menu that displays ground tiles, as described above.
Choose the tile that has ground on the left going upwards. ID (if you're using the grassy ones): Tile 69.
Click to place the tile to build up the left side of the platform.

Note: if Mario needs to jump up there, it can't be too high. Don't use more than three of these plus the top layer of ground.


Return to the menu and get the block that has ground on the left and the top. Place this on top of the vertical blocks.ID: Tile 242.
Return to the menu and get the block that has ground on the top. Place these blocks joining on to the corner across the width of the platform. ID: Tile 2.
Return to the menu and get the block that has ground on the right and the top. Place this as the final block to the right of the horizontal ones that you've just placed. ID: Tile 70.
Return to the menu and get the block that has ground on the right. Complete the platform by placing these blocks from the top of the platform down to ground level. ID: Tile 74.
Return to the menu and use blocks that have no ground to fill in the platform. ID: Tile 12.
If you did remove the ground, you should neaten the edges by joining them to make a smooth curve. To do this, use the inside corner blocks. IDs: Tile 71 and Tile 243.

, The easiest way to do it is probably to follow the pictures above.

Remove the ground if necessary using the steps above.
Go back to the Tiles section of the menu that displays ground tiles, as described above.
Choose a tile which has ground going at a diagonal. There are three different slopes which each have a different steepness, and go either up or down. Decide which one you want, click it and hide the menu.
In the menu, the slopes are lined up so you can see how they fit together. The bottom ones, in particular, may take a little bit of working out to fit them together into a smooth slope.
Once you've correctly built the edge of the slope, fill in the rest of it with plain blocks (which have no edge). If you're using the grassy ones, the ID is Tile 12.
It's up to you how you finish off the slope: you could continue the ground on a raised level or remove the ground below so Mario has to jump on a moving platform. Try using a corner block and dropping back down.

, You know how to add an entrance from the first step in this part, but warp pipes (the green pipes that you see everywhere in Mario levels) are a little more complicated. Here's how to create them:

On the Tiles section of the menu, click Next until you see the pipes. Build two pipes in whichever directions you want, just as you've done with the other tiles. That's how you can create pipes for decoration (or to confuse the player).
If you want to make them work, decide which pipe you're going to go into and which pipe you're going to appear out of.

The one you're going to appear out of is the entrance (you're entering a place via the pipe) and the one you're going into is the exit (because you're leaving the place via the pipe). This is confusing as it seems almost backwards at first!


You must start with the entrance. Go to the Entrances section of the menu and look at the pipes to see which matches yours.

Check the direction that the arrow is pointing to ensure that you've got the right one.


Hide the menu and match up the entrance pipe with the one that you've built. When you click to place it, a number should appear - probably 2, if it's the first pipe that you've built (the first entrance is Mario's starting point).
Now go to the Exits section of the menu and look again at the pipes to see which matches up with your exit.
Before you click on it, make sure that you click on select the entrance until it shows the number that matches the number on your entrance. If you forget to do that, you'll turn up at the first entrance - Mario's starting point.
Hide the menu, position the pipe over the entrance and click to place.
Now's a perfect time to test it out. Take a look at the final part of this article to find out how to play your level.

, This one isn't so tricky, but it's easier to add sprites once you've finished the basic building blocks of the course (not right at the beginning). Before you start, understand what a sprite is: it's not, as you may think, a 'character' or an 'enemy'. It's simply a part of your level that you can interact with in some way. Here's how you add them:

Press Space to open the menu.
On the Sprites section of the menu, press Next and Previous to see all the sprites available to use.
Pick one and click on it to select.
Now hide the menu and click to insert the sprite wherever you want.

, While you pretty much need an end point, halfway points are completely optional (and slightly more complex to add). Here's how you insert them:

Press Space to open the menu. Go to the Sprites section.
Click Next until you see the halfway and end points. They're the H-shaped blue things on the last page of the sprites.
Click on whichever one you want, press Space to hide the menu and click to position it.
If it's the end point, you're done: that's all there is to it. If it's the halfway point, you'll need to add another entrance.

To do this, check Starting Position in the part above: add an entrance exactly the same way, making sure that the number on the second Mario is 2 (if you've added warp pipes before doing this, you may need to go back and change them).



, Autoscroll is really confusing, and tricky to get the hang of. It is - as the name suggests - when stuff moves along by itself. The hard part is getting the right thing to move in the right direction...

At the top right of the screen, there's a red arrow where it will say 'L1 L2'. Click on the red arrow to switch it round so that it says 'L2 L1'. This means that, instead of editing layer 1 (the main layer), you're editing layer 2.
If necessary, insert the blocks, platforms, spikes or whatever you want to be moving. Make sure that you're inserting them in layer 2!

If it helps, you can click on L1 to hide the main layer. However, this usually isn't necessary - it's easier to show both layers so that you know you are placing blocks in the right place.


Open up the menu and go to Sprites. Press Next and Previous until you see the green 'A1' and 'A4' buttons. Check the list of auto scroll blocks below to see which you need, then click on it and hide the menu.

Choose A1 for A1, A2 or A3 and A4 for A4, A5 or A6.


Put it in the appropriate place - touching whatever you've built that needs to be moved. Check that it displays the right autoscroll - as you move it, it'll change.
Test it out by playing the game using the steps in the Last Steps part of the article. This is important, as it's easy to get it moving in the wrong direction.List of Autoscroll Blocks

A1 - affects both layers: moves upwards (everything moves up)

A2 - affects layer 2: moves to the right (certain parts move along)

A3 - affects layer 2: moves up and down (certain parts go up and down)

A4 - affects layer 2: moves to the right while floating slightly up and down
A5 - affects layer 1: moves to the right while going up and down
A6 - affects layer 2: makes layer 2 rise to the top from the bottom - see this tutorial




, This isn't massively hard, but is a quick and fun trick to try! Here's how you can make Mario run up walls:

Build a wall (obviously...)! Make it as high as you want.
Insert Tile 37 from the Tiles section of the menu (or Tile 39, if you're running up in the opposite direction) at the bottom of the wall, to the left.
Remove the ground below Tile 37 - or 39 - and insert a Special Tile - the green box with a blue and white S - in the gap. You won't see this when you play the level obviously!
That's all there is to it - test out your walls using the steps in the final part.

, It's easy to make this more complex than it needs to be. Looking on the Internet, there are no tutorials for making invisible blocks, perhaps because it's actually so much more simple than you would think...

Insert a Special Tile (the green as described above) where you wanted the invisible block to be.
And that's literally it - test it out if you don't believe it using the steps in the final part.

, Some people may prefer to do this at the start, but it's probably better to fill this in once you've finished creating the level. Either way, it's something that is easy to forget:

Press Space to open the menu.
Choose 'Settings' from the menu options across the top.
Click on 'Set Level Info'.

Note: be careful not to press Ctrl when typing! It will hide the menu without saving what you've put in.


Think of a level name to enter into the corresponding box. It should match your level while sounding fun and intriguing!
Think of a brief description of the level to enter into the corresponding box. Like the level name, it should relate directly to the level while making you want to play the game.
Enter your name into the 'author' box. Consider using a username or nickname, especially if you're planning on sharing the level online.

, It sounds obvious, but you need to save the level before closing down your browser. If you don't save the level and copy the code somewhere safe, you'll lose it all! Anyway, here's how to do it:

Press Space to open the menu.
Choose 'Settings' from the menu options across the top.
Click on 'Save'.
Copy the code using the steps below.

, Surely you can just press Ctrl+C and copy your code? Well, pretty much. Here's how you copy the code.

Save the level using the steps above.
Click 'Code'.
Either highlight all the code (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C), or simply click 'Copy to Clipboard'.
Open up a new document, notebook etc. and paste the code (Ctrl+V). Don't forget to save that document somewhere sensible where you'll be able to find it when you want to play the level.

, This isn't necessary if you've just saved the level, but if you're returning to your level or playing someone else's then you'll need to load the code before you can play or edit it.

Go to the home screen. If you're currently editing a level, either open it in a new tab or save and copy it using the steps above before clicking 'Delete'. It's safe to delete the level once you've copied the code.
Click 'Level Editor' where you will see the main options: Create, Level Info, Delete, Load Code and Play. Choose 'Load Code'.

, Perhaps this step should have been earlier in the article as you may find yourself wanting to test out functions and features while creating your level. But here's how you actually play the level:

Save, copy and/or load the level you want to play using the steps above.
Click Play.
If you've not played Super Mario Flash before, you may not know the controls. Here they are:

Move: left/right arrow

Jump: up arrow

Crouch: down arrow

Fireballs: space

Hold/fly/jump off: X




, All you need to share the level with friends is the code that you've copied. Here are some ways you could share your level:

Email the code to friends with a link to the site.
Share it on Pouetpu Games, where you can also find awesome code to load and play. Note: you'll need to register for an account first.
Record yourself playing the level and post it on YouTube (you can include the code in the description). You can also view others' levels there if you're stuck for ideas.

, Now you know how to create levels with Super Mario Flash, you can create more complex, exciting and imaginative adventures for you and your friends to enjoy playing."

Beware the glitch.,
Check what you're asked.,
Beware the glitch.,
Beware the stalker.,
Watch out for threats.",How to Know if Someone on Webkinz Is Trying to Get Your Information," The person might invite you to games several times. If someone on Webkinz invites you more than eight times, they could be trying to get your password out of the game. If someone invites you for the ninth time, decline the offer.;
, They might try to do unfair trades. Unfair traders usually can find out passwords and users easily, so if someone trades unfairly, cancel the trade. Sometimes people do it because they do not know how to trade fairly, so do not do this every single time.

, They might try to get your password out of you with Kinzchat. Although this is highly rare (less than one percent of players), some people know how to do a Webkinz glitch that can send your password through Kinzpost if you chat with them. So if they do faces in this order: smiley, heart, Webkinz sign, question mark, do not respond to them or use Kinzchat until they leave.

, This one is usually easier to tell. They will say how oak are you? That means how old are you? Some people respond using this: won=one too/to=two tree=three for=four fire=five sis=six several= seven eat=eight pine=nine tent=ten elevate=eleven too leave=twelve tree lean=thirteen. If anyone says anything from how oak are you? to what is your past way?, say it's not for telling or nothing at all.

, They can do a glitch by typing how is you and your mom? and afterwards they type c1. Do not chat after that until they leave because if you do, they will get all your information you gave to webkinz while adopting via kinzpost.

, They will add you and stalk you. If they start stalking you, they are onto you for information. Avoid this by deleting the user, turning on do not disturb, or saying no to their invites. Also do not trust this user when they ask for your information and say come on i won't use it or tell anyone or something similar. Do not trust them.

, They might send you a letter through kinzpost that threatens you if you do not give them your information. Like: I will deli (delete) you if you do not give me your aid. (age) Or: If you do not give me your past (pass) way (word), I will report you for saying something bad. If they threaten you, report them for threatening you. Or delete them. (It is highly recommended that you report such encounters.)

Enjoy!",How to Keep a Webkinz Fur Soft," The best type of Webkinz to do this to are the short, thick furred Webkinz. Other types won't work very well with this method.
, You will need a small spray bottle, olive oil for the fur, a small comb, and a hand rag., Fill the spray bottle with water and drop three to four drops of the olive oil into the water. Shake well., Spray 3-4 sprays over each section of the Webkinz. It's easier to spray in sections, such as the back first, then the stomach, then the arms and legs and face., Start by combing all over the Webkinz in a downward motion to get any knots or crumbs out., Take the comb again, but this time, comb in an upward motion to add volume., Take the hand rag and rub it all over the Webkinz in order to get any extra water out of the fur., After drying, you may want to comb and fluff the fur again, however, this is optional., Now you have a fresh, soft, plush Webkinz!"

Determine if you are eligible to create a guild or not.,
Figure out the purpose of your guild.,
Decide on a proper name for your guild.,
Create a guild page.,
Keep track of each player.,
Make sure your members are active!",How to Create an MMORPG Guild," Most games have a certain level requirement and in-game currency fee you must pay to create your guild. To find out the requirements, the best place to look is on the game's official website. If you are unable to find it there, ask someone in-game.;
, Will you want a guild focused on the completion of quests? Or perhaps your guild will be big on participating in guild battles or wars.

, This is the part where you can really be creative. Here you can create a unique name to show off just how great you are! If you cannot think of a good name, there are quite a few guild name generators you can find scattered throughout the Internet.

, Many games will allow the addition of a guild page or details of the guild. This is the place where new recruits can find the goals of the guild and will then be able to positively contribute to the effort. If your game supports this, creating the guild page should always come immediately after the creation of the guild, when possible.

, Do your best to keep toxic players out of the guild, especially the ones who are detrimental to your cause or just give the guild a negative atmosphere. Having a guild with people who are socially respectable will gain your guild fame within the game and will cause people to like your guild more.

, Unless people in the guild are close friends with you, you are really only going to want those who are actively involved with the guild and the game. If they only log in once or twice every couple of weeks to a month, a warning should be issued. If this happens consistently, they should be kicked.

Learn a bit about the game background.,
Come up with the basic concept for the character you want to create.,
Decide how you want them to play, based on their core concept.,
Find the Archetype in the rulebook (or in Exterminatus magazine or a similar supplement) that best fits your idea of the character.,
Fix the rules.,
Give them equipment.,
Flesh them out.",How to Create an Inquisitor Character," Read up on the Imperium - the Inquisitor rulebooks, Witch Hunter/Deamon Hunter/Imperial Guard codexes for 40k are also good places for ideas.;
, Are they an Inquisitor? Cultist? Hired gun? Try to tie this into the game background. If you want a 'soldier' type character, say, be specific. Are they an Imperial Guardsman? Mercenary? PDF member?

, So a gunslinger would be an expert marksman and probably quite fast, while an Astropath is weak and slow, but a powerful psyker.

, If your character doesn't seem to fit any particular Archetype, good generic ones are Cultists, Desperados and Mutants.

, Give them a profile that doesn't differ to much from the one in the rulebook, or if it does in some way, justify to yourself why. A cultist with exceptionally high BS might have some training in Militias, for example. Decide on what special abilities and psychic powers (if any) the character needs to fit your vision of them.

, Almost all characters will at least have a close combat weapon or pistol. Fighter type characters will need a more powerful firearm such as a bolter or laser gun, or else close combat weapons like swords, chain weapons and so on. It's often good to give a character slightly quirky equipment such as a flamer or power claw, as it gives them more of a sense of individuality. Try to keep equipment appropriate- there is no way a Mutie rebel will have a plasma blaster! Armour or force fields are common, as are bionics.

, Write a couple of paragraphs on where they came from, how they became involved in the inquisition and what their aims are. Explain how they got their equipment and what it means to them.

, The more players that join your alliance, the higher your alliance's rank will be. Click on the castle of the player you want to invite and click Send Alliance Invitation. It will cost you 1 mana. When the player receives the invitation, he will have a choice to either accept or decline your invitation.

, If a player doesn't accept your invitation immediately, he might be considering whether to join your alliance or join another alliance. Sending the player a polite and encouraging message often helps to persuade the player to join.

, At the bottom of the game window, you can broadcast a message for the whole era to see. It will cost you 1 mana. It is a good idea to advertise your alliance to let more people see that you are recruiting players.

, If everybody does whatever they want in your alliance, the alliance will not be strong against intruders. Set rules about what kind of army units to build, what time deadline to set for player inactivity, and what punishments for disobeying orders.

, Make sure that you mark hostile alliances hostile and friendly alliances friendly. If you don't do this, it is very possible that one of your alliance members might attack a friendly alliance by accident.


An alliance tagged red is hostile.
An alliance tagged blue is friendly.
An untagged alliance is neutral. Try to tag them as soon as possible.
An alliance tagged purple is for custom uses. You can use purple to mean a NAP (Non-Aggression Pact) or some other meaning.

, If a player refuses to follow the alliance rules, or isn't active enough, than kick him. If you don't enforce your rules, then your other alliance members will get the impression that you do not keep your word. They might then also do as they please.

, If an alliance member is being attacked, be sure you send enough resources, such as troops to withstand the attack. If you don't have enough resources, create an alliance order for other alliance members to see so they can help also.

, During the game, a player might be attacked while he is off-the-game. In that case, you will need to contact him quickly and tell him to get back in the game! Skype is the best option for this.

Use your map to identify its exact location and proceed to make your way there. You will need to interact with the antenna controls once you arrive.;
, First thing is to click on the antenna controls. There will be three colored lines on the left side of the screen that pops up. The colors are green, yellow, and red. Your objective is to move the cone around the map on your screen using the arrow keys. Once it lands on one of these lines, you will need to click on one of eight channels found on the right side of the screen.

Remodel your layout.",How to Create a Good Yard in Backyard Monsters," There are several defensive towers to choose from, but knowing which one is the correct one to use is crucial. Be sure to place towers in a way that will defend your town hall, resource harvesters, silos, and any other important buildings. Towers with long ranges should be placed towards the center of your base. Towers with lower ranges should be placed on the outer area of your base. (long range towers: Sniper, Teslea, and Aerial Defense.) (Short ranged towers: Laser, Cannon, and Railgun.);
, If somebody attacks you and defeats you, note which buildings are to heavily guarded, and note which buildings are not guarded well enough. Using a wild monster baiter is quite helpful.

, Most people use blocks as walls, but also be aware that blocks can be used to channel attackers. Creating a pathway is a good strategy, and placing booby traps is also quite helpful.

, Notice that certain monsters attack certain things. Use this to your advantage. When monsters are attacking a certain building, you can place towers to fire at them while they are distracted.

, Building a yard planner is also key. The new yard planner features save slots. Use these to try out different layouts if one just isn't working. You can also delete everything and start from scratch.

Brainstorm.,
Bots.,
Recruit.,
Clan Site.,
Offer perks.,
Tournaments.,
Clan battle.,
Clan Radio.,
Clan Allies.,
Clan Killing.,
Clan Merging.",How to Create a Battle Net Clan," You want to come up with a clever name for the clan that is short, or if it is long has good acronyms that flow together. For instance, the clan Chaotic Avengers in US-East has the acronym CA. When you come up with a good name look around on battle.net for any clans with similar names. A good place to look is the Clan Recruitment room, this is a room where clans post advertisements for their clans. If you find a clan with the same name then try another name until you get the right one.;
, You want to have bots that monitor the chat room. Bots are user operated chat clients that sit in rooms, you can do things with them like kick people out, ban people, change your font color, play games, play music for yourself, and other such things. To operate a bot you need a cd key for whatever game you have, Starcraft, Warcraft, Diablo. Once you have a bot and it works you want to read the instructions and the manual, if it didn't come with one then look under the help menu. If your clan channel is like, Op HMK9, or something like that that starts with ""Op"" you should name your main bot the name of the channel, for instance if your channel is ""Op AwX"" then name your bot AwX so it can be the moderator with a hammer icon or the big silver character with the maul. I prefer Stealth Bot, because it is by far the best (links under ex-links). At this point if you don't have any extra cd keys to spare ask friends for theirs if they don't play, buy more Starcraft, Warcraft, or Diablo games, or you can look on the internet for sites with cd keys (links in links sect).

, First of all you want to think up a chain of command and offer friends positions. Post bots in different channels (just open the bot a bunch of times for other bots but you can't use the same cd key on 2 bots), if you can't get multiple bots then ask friends to run bots in channels that say something like ""Clan At2, join up today! Come to channel Op At2 and ask about recruitment."" The Pro clan sites set up their bots so when you type something like .recruit it recruits you and then you are added to the clan on that mod bot, then whoever has unlimited access to it can see the clan roster. Tell members to put your clan tag on their names, like if your name is Jack4Life tell them to add the clan tag on it so it looks like AtX.Jack4Life, or Jack4Life, be creative and come up with a really good clan tag. When you have enough members you can really get pumping.

, Now that you have a thriving clan with a few members and you need something to keep your members coming back, consider making a clan website. The first step in looking for a free clan site is to go on Google and type free clan site. You will get a list of sites and look for the one that suits you. Look for a free one that has templates and offers easy set-up. Not good with HTML or Photoshop? Well ask a member if they could help with the website, creating images and such. A lot of good websites offer templates that already have all the images you will need, so you should be set. Add members to the site rooster and let them have a login and do things like show member's pictures and have a order of command page and other such things. Many sites offer these pages on the templates and all you need to do is type normal words no scripts or anything. You should add a forum for the members to post on and for other clans to set up matches with and such things. Setting up contests and in-clan tournaments is also a fun thing, picture contests are often a popular event.

, On your clan site offer prizes for the tournaments or contests. In Diablo II its always good to give away good items as prizes or in Starcraft and Warcraft offer higher clan positions and other things. Put up clan maps on the website and other things.

, On your forums or in the clan channel advertise a clan tournament for Starcraft or Warcraft. Have your bots advertise it auto, and keep track as people sign up. Create a pyramid and set up matches. Create the rules of the tourney and have fun with it.

, Go to other clan's websites or clan channels and ask to speak with their leaders and offer clan battles or clan wars. Send in your best and wait to come out on the top, or bottom. Have fun with it and post the outcome on your clan website. It is always good to write up your clan happenings on the site for others to see, and get interested.

, Download Winamp and look up on Google how to create your own radio station for clan members to listen to. This is good because if you play good music and have many subscribers chances are you will have less clan deserters.

, Go to other clan sites and offer a clan allegiance. This is where two clans become allies, thus making a stronger clan because you can be backed up by another clan. Do not get too many clans on your ally list because then you have a better chance of backstabbing, and make sure when you have multiple allies they are all allied with each other, too. The one thing you don't want is two of your allies fighting and both wanting you on their side.

, When your clan gets really good, challenge other clans to fights. Offer a high stakes game where if they lose their clan gets to be turned into a branch of your clan, where you ultimately rule over them. Also destroy the competition, if you beat clans in fights more people will join because they know your clan is strong and will be a good place to call home. Thus weakening the other clans.

, Go to weaker clans and offer them a chance to merge into your clan where they can still be in their own channel but be a sub section of your clan. It will offer them better protection and they will like that. They can still make their own website and recruit, like a normal clan but again be ultimately controlled by you.

First put together your guest list.,

As this is a guide for just a standard house party, you might not want to pick a pink theme.,
When arranging furniture, be careful not to put a hugs sofa in the middle and the coffee table behind it.,
Have activities.,
Everybody likes having something to eat, and your guests may get hungry at the party.",How to Have a Webkinz Party," You can invite as many people as you want, but make sure you have enough room to accommodate your friends.;
, If you know the people personally, you can simply call them and ask them to come. But if you don't, you can ask them in Kinzchat plus of the clubhouse.

, Try parts of the Blue Skies theme, Country Western, Jungle, Diner, Kids, Upscale Condo, and Rock themes. Mixing themes will create a happy mood.

, Arrange your furniture in a simple but gorgeous way. Somewhat coordinate your colors, too.

, You may want to put a TV in. This is always entertaining. Multiple people can watch it, and there are 3 great shows to watch! Also, put in some games for people to play. Hockey and Billiards are always popular. Even board games will work.

, To keep your guests Webkinz happy, send them a package in Kinz Post. In this package include a food and a drink. I wouldn't send a gift for them, as this a house party and you usually don't thank them for coming with a gift.

Invite people.,
Provide food!,

Make beds/sleeping bags for the Webkinz.,
Watch a movie.,
In the morning, have all the activities open!",How to Have a Webkinz Party at Your House," Make sure the guest has webkinz and tell them to bring it! It can be embarrassing if they have no webkinz and everyone else does, so still invite them even if they don't have webkinz. Also, if they are a new user, explain things to them! They probably won't have or understand things like rare items, or trading.;
, Try to make recipes instead of regular old food from the W shop. Cheeseburgers, milkshakes, and chicken nuggets are not original! But Soccer Floats, Cara Milkshakes, and Yummy Tummy Tumblers are!

, Some ideas are:


Jelly Bean Challenge. Count jellybeans as you put them in a jar, keep the number handy, and give the closest or exact guess a prize of your choice!
Wheel of Wow. Cut out a circle of paper, make prizes (actually have the prizes), and attach a paper clip to the middle. Spin it, award prizes, and you're done.
Wishing Well. Take a bucket, tub, pool, or sink full of water and get small plastic containers (preferably the ones you get cheap toys from machines in, but whatever you can find is fine), and add prizes like ""10 kinzcash"" or ""100 kinzcash"" blindfold them and tell them to pick a prize. If they get 1,000 or higher give them a special prize.
DiceKinz. Make a board and have them roll dices to see how far they can move. Then have defenses like ""Kick"" or whatever and use them however you want!
Super Models. Make clothes and dress up the webkinz. Judge them!
Chef Challenge. It's easy, but will require cooking, or fake food. If it's real, eat it and grade it, but get adult supervision! If it's fake, grade it by its looks. If it's like fake bread and a cookie, give it a lower grade, and if it's something you'd eat if it were real, grade it higher.
Quizzy's Webkinz. Put together some questions and give each person 20 seconds and 10 questions (unless they're having a lot of trouble with it). First person with under 6 seconds gets 5 points, 7-9 seconds gets 4 points, 10-13 seconds gets 3 points, 13-15 seconds gets 2 points, 15-18 seconds gets 1 point, and higher than that gets no points!
Where's Wacky. Make cards, make them find matches! Easy to set up and clean up!

, Make them look pretty realistic to the ones online. Here are some ideas:


Set up a clubhouse! You can just add a Trading Room (where they can trade their rare items) or just whatever room they want.
Have a ""W"" shop! Have easy items like homemade beds for the pets to sleep in at night, clothes (at a toy store, or if you can sew), toys and other stuff sold at the W shop. Award kinzcash after games and let them go to the W shop whenever they want to!
Consider adding a Curio Shop. Add items that are more uncommon! Also add Gem Hunt, where they find gems hidden around somewhere!
Make a KinzPost. They can send stuff to friends like gifts or a nice little note.
Today's Activities! Make fun activities like giving out coupons, Quick Draws, or games. Activities like ""Orange Juice for 20% off"" is boring! Make the stuff fun!

, For beds, take a shoebox, decorate it, add a fabric blanket and a stuffed fabric pillow. For a sleeping bag, take a long piece of fabric (That will fit your webkinz), fold it and sew the ends except for one end so the webkinz will get inside the sleeping bag and their head will stick out.

, Pop in a popular movie somewhat animal related like ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" or ""Space Buddies.""

, Have a new Today's Activities tab, and give everyone another wheel of wow spin, round on the Wishing well, more gem mining, and another job (if you decided to make an employment office). For breakfast, have whatever, and even have fake food for your webkinz to eat! Before they go, give them a gift bag full of goodies, and have the webkinz say goodbye.

Try to invite people you know in real life and tell them before hand, but if you can't, then try to stick with your Webkinz as the guests.

, A wedding wouldn't be good if they're wearing nothing or in pajamas. Buy the groom a tuxedo from the W shop, and the bride a dress or fancy shirt and skirt.

, Have them sit on the couches or chairs and wait. Whatever you do, don't have the bride and groom together. The groom can stand in the designated room or in a room closer to it but the bride and groom can NOT be in the same room!

, Make it a time for you and your guests to interact.

, Tell all your guests to go home or make your Webkinz stay away, and take the bride and groom into a private, cozy room. Have them sit and watch TV in chairs or on a couch, or have them just sit. Unfortunately, they can't sleep together or talk, so pretend they're talking!

Use the right Eidolon.,

Craft Elixir of Flames.,
Use class party buffs.",How to Complete Infernal Abyss Dungeon in Aura Kingdom," Infernal Abyss is located in Ventos Prairie; it has a level requirement of 55. You can teleport into the dungeon just like you would with your regular dungeon instances.


Infernal Abyss is available during Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, with an 8-hour reset time.
You only have 20 minutes to beat the dungeon floors with your team.
Before starting, you or any party member has to touch the fire crystal start the timer. As long as one of the party member touches the fire crystal, the entire team's flame clock is activated.
If a member is still outside the dungeon after touching the crystal, he or she will unable to join the rest of the party, so make sure that everyone is inside the dungeon before proceeding.;
, To successfully progress through infernal abyss, you need to team up with the right party members.


Have a tank—This is preferably someone with high malice percentage, provoke skills, and strong attack power. This position is usually taken by the Guardian class.
Your tank member also has to deal enough damage output to keep the aggro of the boss.
Have a Bard—A Bard with high speed stat and strong health from equipment is preferable.
Have boss DPs—These could be a Gunslinger, Duelist, or Katar; the latter is preferred, but a Sorcerer can work as well to debuff Zaahir for faster kills.
Have an AoE ranged DPS—One or two Wizards is good. If only 1 Wizard is available, you can add 1 Grenadier or 1 Ravager.
If anyone in the party has high-level gear to survive Zaahir's attacks, they can act as a tank as well.
The key to this fight is to have at least one person alive to prevent the boss from resetting its health.

, The best way to reduce the damage you receive is by wearing a fire elemental armor. It can reduce the amount of fire damage taken from mobs. Since Infernal Abyss is filled with monsters that inflicts fire, equipping a fire element will halve the additional damage to low.


Tanks should also consider wearing the HP orange gear for both top and bottom as their roles are mainly supportive.
DPS should consider wearing defensive gear for the top set and offensive gear for the bottom.
Use full-damage sets during the first couple of floors to quicken the pace and then switch them to defense at a later time to avoid one-shot kills.
EVA equipments are found useless in this dungeon since Zaahir is reincarnated every 5 floors, which can make him much higher level than you. So no matter how much your EVA is, the boss still lands hits on you.

, Blue weapons are the best weapons for this dungeon. They can have stats buff that deal an additional 30% damage to certain elemental monsters.


You can consider using a subweapon with the enchantment that deals +30% to flame monsters too. You can buy this from auctions at a cheap price.
Secret Stones is one of the best way to deal additional damage. It will give you 6% crit damage + damage % toward flame monsters.
If you have a Beirut Card, a boss card obtained from the Beirut bunny boss in Other world: Port Skandia, this lets you deal an additional 18% damage toward flame monsters. Use this card to your costume hats.

, Eidolons will help you clear dungeons faster. Your team should have at least 1 of the following Eidolons while the other two can be random.


Tigerius Caesar is a good choice since it increases the move speed of the party members. Keep in mind that we're racing time here, so an additional speed is a plus.
Bel-Chandra or Uzuriel gives Crit Damage buff, which adds additional damage to your attack.

, In the game, you can use food or drink for additional buffs, and the best buff to get for this dungeon is the one that deals double or triple damage against the enemies.


One of the keys in reaching the highest level is to dish out as much damage as you can to clear the dungeons fast. Movement speed food is ideal to cut the wasted time on walking.

, Elixir of Flame deals additional 10% damage to flame attribute targets for 20 minutes. The potion requires 5 Crest of Flame and 1 Alchemical Powder to make.


Keep in mind that you need to be level 60 or higher to use this potion.

, Each class members can cast their class party buffs, which will buff the entire party. Coordinate your party mate to make sure that no one will cast overlapping buffs.


Note that you need to recast the party buff every time you pass the next hall after defeating Zaahir, since the buff disappears every time you go through the portal.

Focus on opening at least one path to the Core.,

Always be aware of enemy respawn times.",How to Come Back from Behind in Heroes of the Storm," The first and most important thing you need to do is to pull yourself and your team together. It is one thing to admit defeat against an enemy team that totally outclasses you in terms of skills. It is quite another to just hang up your hands and start pointing fingers against everyone. Stop raging, avoid blaming, focus on what you can do, understand that there are many ways to stage a comeback, and you will find yourself in a state of mind that will help you win the match.
, Standing behind walls, towers and forts is a good idea when the enemy is aggressively ganking your team. The simple fact that the enemy cannot so easily kill with impunity will help rebuild player confidence while soaking up experience to catch up in levels., Even if the timing is off and capturing the camp will achieve very little in the match, the act of assembling your team and defeating mercenaries and then capturing the camp can help shake off the feeling of defeat and rebuild morale., Being around one another and fighting together can help build confidence even when you’re one, two or even three levels behind. Don’t stick around too much though, as you will eventually need to split up to soak experience, push lanes and capture mercenaries., A single clean kill will do wonders in restoring team morale as well as granting a lot more experience when you’re behind in levels., Heroes of the Storm has a comeback system where the team falling behind will gain significantly more experience when they kill a hero from the opposing team. The larger the gap, the larger the experience boost. Even a handful of kills can be enough to equalize the difference, which makes ganking especially beneficial when you’re trying to catch up from behind.When you’re ready to come back, form a hit team with one hero dealing burst damage and another hero for controlling the target. This roaming team’s job is to hunt down enemy heroes that are pushing their lanes too aggressively or are hanging back and trying to capture mercenary camps. Each kill they make will serve as a large leap forward to help your own team catch up to the enemy in terms of levels.

, Focus your attention on these isolated heroes to take them down and weaken the enemy team. Even if you lose the engagement, killing enough heroes in these engagements has the potential to grant significantly more experience to your team than the enemy team., If you are really far behind in levels and have a hard time dealing with all five heroes on the enemy team at once, it would be a lot better to focus on ambushing enemy heroes as they are on their way to capture map objectives. This is especially true when capturing the objectives will yield no immediate downside, like the first or second tributes in Cursed Hollow, killing shamblers in the Garden of Terroror capturing a well-defended point in Sky Temple., When teams have a large level advantage, they tend to clump up and use their combined level advantage to press the attack. You could try to engage this “deathball” head-on, or you could punish the enemy team for sticking too tightly together all the time.

Certain specialist heroes like Azmodan, Zagara, Gazlowe, Sylvanas, Sgt. Hammer, and The Lost Vikings can be talented in a way that makes them brutally effective at pushing unguarded lanes. These heroes can zip off to a distant lane to start pushing it while the rest of the team skirmishes but does not commit to fighting against the enemy team. Your opponents will now have to make a choice: weaken their lineup by forcing one or even two heroes in the fight to deal with the specialist, or ignore the specialist and risk losing a fort or even a keep.

, Do this right before engaging the enemy deathball, and these mercenaries will help force the enemy team to face the dilemma mentioned earlier: ignore the mercs and risk damage to their base, or sacrifice at least one hero while weakening their team composition. The talent “Bribe” will be especially useful in these situations, as it allows you to instantly capture mercenary camps. This in turn lets you join the team fight much quicker than if you stayed around to engage the mercenaries in combat., Zeratul’s Void Prison, Zagara’s Devouring Maw, Tassadar’s Force Wall, Stitches’ Gorge, and Leoric’s Entomb are excellent tools for splitting apart deathballs. If cast correctly, they can isolate individual enemy heroes and prevent their allies from aiding them. This makes it much easier to deal with enemy teams that stick too close to one another and rely too heavily on synergizing their abilities., The one last thing you remember when you’re trying to come back from behind is to always make the most of mistakes that the enemy team makes. Many a lopsided game was turned around because the dominant team became too complacent, lost all five heroes at once and opened the way for their otherwise beleaguered opponents to rush forward and blast down their Core., There are usually two or three lanes leading to the enemy core, but you only need to demolish one in order to reach it. If your team is not faring so well against the enemy team, aim to push down one lane whenever you have the chance. This will make it possible for your team to focus down the enemy Core should your team manage to gain a victory, especially in the later stages of the game where heroes take around 50 to 60 seconds to respawn. Do this enough times, and you pave the way for destroying the enemy core when the opportunity presents itself., If the enemy heroes will respawn in less than 30 seconds and you don’t have clear access to their core, do something that will present a clear and immediate threat to them once they return. Break down a fort or keep so they can’t extend far without exposing themselves. Capture a Boss Golem camp. Capture multiple mercenary camps. Capture the objective. Give something for the enemy team to deal with once they respawn, and they will have a much harder time dealing with your own team as you go about the business of clawing back up from the bottom."

You can use Japanese erasers for the food, and try to make the restaurant have a theme such as cowboy or jazz.

, Carnivals should come every so often, these are very fun to make, so try to make it as fun as possible for the Webkinz! Also, since you are having police, firemen, and doctors, have your Webkinz become ill, be robbed, or their house catches on fire. This way these jobs won't be useless! Clothes for the Webkinz can be made out of socks (or cloth if you're good at sewing).

, Pick your favorite Webkinz and a teacher then let your mind loose and pretend there is a teacher, try to teach the Webkinz what you learn in school that way you will be learning everything all over again!

Take it from there!",How to Build a Space Station in Kerbal Space Program (KSP)," You simply cannot build a space station without any knowledge of docking. Because of the weight of the entire thing, you will have to send it up in stages and this will require performing an orbital rendezvous and docking.;
, How big will it be? What will you use it for? Will it have short-term and/or long-term accommodation for Kerbanauts? Will it have refuelling facilities? Where will you put it? Bear in mind, it is best to build your first in Kerbin orbit as this does not require as much fuel as it does to go for, say Duna, but it will require more than a plain ship does.

,


As mentioned above you will have to send your space station up in stages. Something like this: 1st Stage, command module (manned), accommodation etc, 2nd Stage, command module (unmanned), refueling post, docking port/s on side for spacecraft to dock to, 3rd Stage, anything you want! Try to make sure that there is only one Kerbal aboard the station while it is being built (like Jebediah because he is always happy), also, when you send the refueling post make sure it is empty and then send up a Supply Services ship to your space station with more Kerbals and fuel to transfer - this is what the SpaceX Commercial Supply Services flight to the ISS do.

, Think: if your station will greet spacecraft coming from other missions then you will want it around 100 kilometers (62 mi) - that way you can transfer the crew to the station while they wait for another ship to take them home. Alternately, put it in a lower orbit at about 80 kilometers (50 mi) for refueling because then both arriving and departing ships can benefit

, Well done, by now you should have you starting module in orbit around your chosen body. Now you need to finish it: send up some fuel tanks, extra accommodation, research facilities - whatever you can think of! Once you are happy with your station then think about sending a flight up every so often - to refuel it and take Kerbals home and/or send up new ones - or find a mod the requires you to send up food and oxygen every so often.

Build cities.",How to Build a Classy Evony Account," When starting out, you want to build 500 cav or post ""Help train some Horses"" to Facebook so your friends can give you cav, and get some for themselves. You can receive up to 2000 cav from a single post. However, 500 cav is enough to take a freshly-taken level 10 NPC or any other undefended city that someone gives you, but you have to make your basic city first. Alternatively, you can build from scratch completely.;
,, From your inn you want one high Politics hero and one high Intelligence hero, the other 3 being space for heroes with an attack base of AT LEAST 60. Don't redistribute them just yet, and don't increase them past level 9 until much later. Evony effectively adds 10 levels to heroes that are under level 10 to give new players a break, so you should wait until you can raise them to level 20 before raising them beyond level 9.

, The game doesn't give you enough time to really be able to defend yourself before you can be attacked, so it comes down to luck. For this reason, have multiple accounts right from the start on a new server, and don't get upset if you lose some., The ultimate purpose of Evony is to be a maxed player. You don't need to have nine cities to play as a maxed player, but you will want to have more than one eventually. You will pick up cities naturally over time, so don't worry about that one too much. You will always be building cities until you have 9 stripped down, maxed out cities, so get used to building.

, If you're not researching, you're wasting your life.



Money - You can't use money to play the game unless you print your own money. Sometimes you need to buy medal packages. When the $5 packages come up, buy them!

Farming - The passing of time by itself will not improve your account. Instead think of the passing of time as farming. You should be farming every second you are playing, even if some heroes are out attacking cities, unless you are about to tele a city. If you are not getting bigger, you are getting smaller.

Heroes - Your heroes are the most valuable thing you have. When you are a new player, or get a new city, farm some heroes from the inn. Just keep buying and dismissing heroes until you get ones with a high attack base. If you feel you must have one high politics or intelligence hero, that's your decision but I wouldn't bother, just go for high attack. Inn should be level 3 max, if it is higher bring it down. Keep buying and dismissing heroes until all your heroes have a base attack of at least 60. So if you have a level 1 hero, attack should be at least 61. This takes time. You will kick yourself later if your heroes are up to 170 attack and could have been 200 already. If you have a 170 attack hero with a low base, don't worry, he is nearly ready to farm l10 npcs. You will lose heroes sometimes. If you attack a city and the fight goes more than 100 rounds without winning, and the red city has an empty hero slot, you will lose the hero.

Food - What do you get for 1 million food per hour?

8k catapults = 1 mil food
20k rams = 1 mil food
40k ballistas = 1 mil food
66.6k transports = 1 mil food
58.8k cataphracts = 1 mil food
125cavalry = 1 mil food
250k archers = 1 mil food
333k swords = 1 mil food
333k pike = 1 mil food
500k scouts = 1 mil food
1mil warriors = 1 mil food
1mil workers = 1 mil food



, If you farm 5s twice a day, you can afford a food bill of 2.25 million per hour. As you can see you want to be farming at least 3 times per day.

, That's a million archers per city, with room left for scouts and meat. With 10 cities, that's 10 million archers. It's a hell of a food bill if you miss a day farming. To do this you would need all your heroes with attack over 300, so that's playing for 1-2 years, and never losing heroes. You will lose heroes.

, Get someone to give you a captured L10. Beats building your own, just build it in reverse. You still need to do your research though, but that should be easy in your new Level 10 Academy.



Iron - needs 10 cottages. Very useful to have a city that only makes iron. Makes 750k iron per hour. Handy.

Lumber - needs 6 cottages. That's an extra 4 barracks. Makes 750k lumber per hour and the prices are the same, which is better?

Food - a captured L10 is full of farms. Helps the food bill a little, gives no resources though.

Players-one city A one city account is the most useful thing in the world. Looks small, but makes an awesome launching pad that you can't lose. Good for scouting and attacking from in relative anonymity. Has to use its own troops though, you can't attack with reins lol.

Players-optimists Will attack anything that moves with their last 20k warriors. More cities than they can hold, but, can make troops faster than you to hit you back with if you do take one. Often group cities together. If they lose a city they will be upset, but will take one from someone else next day.

Players-pessimists Try to hold onto cities whatever the cost. Don't like being scoutable, or anyone getting a report on them. Only attacks with troops they can afford to lose without affecting points one or two. Problem with being pessimistic is they are trying to do the impossible, which is not good for their health. Need to learn to relax and have fun.

Scouts - stop scouting people. If you get bad news, you're gonna be attacked anyway so you may as well attack first. Also it drives people nuts to be attacked without being scouted first, makes people think they have a spy.

Attacks - Since you've stopped scouting people, how do you attack a city blind?

Mechs - A well tuned alliance will have some players who volunteer to feed reins, while that player is building Catapults, Rams and Ballistas. A hit of 30k Catapults, 10k Rams, 20k Ballistas, 20k arch, 10k cav, 5k Sword and Pike, will give you a pretty good idea what the other guy has. Sure beats conventional attacks. Hit with mechs, recall your archers from the person feeding them, and zero that sucker. To avoid wasting food on big long hits, use a war ensign and throw in 25k transports as an incentive against him closing his gates ;)

Conventional Attacks


Scout Bombs - kills some troops with the highest aggregate hit points. (ie: if opponent has 1mil warriors, and 300k archers, the scout bomb will hit the warriors. If the opponent has 500k archers and 500k warriors, the scouts will hit the archers.)

Arch Rainbow - kills layers and eventually archers and mechs (standard way of attacking someone. 99k arch, 333warriors, 333sword, 333pike 1cav)

Cav Waves - Expensive and wasteful if used incorrectly. If the target has lots of warriors, the cav will die hitting them. To effectively use cav, ensure that all traps, defensive trebuchets, and abatis are gone prior to attacking. This will ensure that the battle starts close enough to allow the cav to get hits.

Choose a material to make your mask out of.,
Measure out how much fabric you'll need.,
Cut out the mask.,
It's completely optional, but you can embroider closed eyelids or something else on if you want.,
Rub any chalk lines out and pin (use safety pins if you don't have sewing pins) the two fabrics together.,
Get your straps.,
Sew the eyemask like it is a pillow (there are many tutorials for making pillows).,
Once it has dried or has all the pins out of it, try it on your Webkinz and go on being fabulous.

",How to Create a Webkinz Sleeping Mask," Felt is easy to work with and typically cheap, so it's most likely the best choice. Cotton, flannel, and tee shirt fabrics can be hard to work with since they stretch and aren't stiff at all.;
, Tracing around a spool of thread or other small, circular object twice and connecting the circles into a peanut shape usually works pretty well. Draw the lines in chalk or thin pen that won't bleed through the fabric and draw on the ""wrong"" side.

, Leave a small border on each side if you wish to sew the garment together. Cut out two of the shape and make adjustments if it is too big, leaving the extra border if sewing.

, Use embroidery floss and make sure you're embroidering on the right side of the fabric.

, Pin the wrong sides out if you are sewing, put the right sides out otherwise.

, Elastic is best by far, but ribbon will do. Measure it around the pet's head with the eyemask, adding a bit extra. Pin the ends of the ribbon inside the eyemask unless you are sewing, in which case tuck all of the strap inside your eyemask and leave the ends hanging out.

, If glueing, use either stripes of glue from a hot glue gun or use Tacky Glue or fabric glue. School glue or a glue stick won't stick well.

, After you've got some cash, look in the store for either collectibles or holiday items. You could choose a collectible item then holiday ones, but collectibles cost more. So if you are low on money, buy holiday rares.

, Put the rarest or newest items in your main room so more people can see the best items you have. If you have loads of rares and they all won't fit, put them in your 3 main rooms. Every time you go to your profile, people see your main 3 rooms, and they will be looking at the items you have.

, This will give you a bigger chance to make you look more rich, and they might give you help on your journey to growing wealth.

, To grow your wealth, you need to be aware to look at how much wealth the items give you. Collectibles give a lot of wealth, so they are very important. Don't over - due it, though. It can make you look like it's all about the wealth. But it is more important about rares.

, This is a very important step to becoming rich. All of the rarest items on MiniPlanet are mostly worth this, so this is a big recommendation. Buying clothes and accessories worth gold also will make people think you are rich.

, This is a good idea (unless you hate people) because they can gift you. It's fun getting gifts from friends because everyone is usually broke or gives their credits away to other people for customizing their avatars, which is usually expensive. You will run into some haters and mean people, but you can't please everyone so you can just block them.

, If you have seen other people's profile and pics they look awesome, that is because their AVI pictures were either edited, their profiles are DIV layouts, etc. Search Google for DIV layouts. Websites should be listed that do them for free and already give you the code. They look difficult to read but they are not. Look up some YouTube videos for editing AVI pics. Try downloading GIMP.

AP is Access Pass and is for people who are 18 years old or older. It’s usually pointless, but you can do things a guest couldn't do like buy sexual things, poses, etc. Age Verification is basically what it sounds like: changing the age of what your profile says. VIP is Very Important People, who have different poses and other things everyone else wouldn't have, including making more than one chat room.

, You can't really get "" better"" at IMVU. IMVU is a chatting source, first and foremost. The IMVU avatars can surely look more ""better"", but you can't really get better at IMVU, the game itself. Always remember to just be yourself. Ignore all those haters who may call you a ""noob"", they were probably a noob (that's why they may call you a noob). Also remember that there are no ""noobs"", just new people with different tastes than other members who have been on IMVU for quite some time.

Enter Wally's Castle.",How to Become an Arc Tracer in Elsword," Just like the rest of the class, you will have to go through two kinds of job quests. First one is for the path to becoming a Tracer to open up the two possible job changes which is Arc Tracer and Psychic Tracer.


To start off, make sure that you're qualified for the quest. You need to use Add and should be Level 15 or higher. Otherwise, the change job quest won't be available.;
, The first part of the quest will be killing the Boss named William Phoru. Any difficulty is acceptable, with or without party members, but keep in mind that you need to kill William twice in order to complete this quest.


You don't have to worry about killing this boss under Hard Mode, just make sure to dodge his slashes using Jump.
William also uses Guard so make sure to use stun skills to make his defense open.

, The next part of the arc requires you to defeat Boss Nasod Banthus which can be found in the Underground Waterway. You're only required to kill him once but must be done in Hard Level or Higher; you can do this with a party as well.


Nasod is easy to defeat, especially if you're in a full house party. However, keep an eye out when his health reach the red as he will be using Awaken.
Under Awaken status, Nasod will receive an attack boost which can be painful if he uses his laser skill.

, After killing the bosses, head back to Elder Village and talk to Echo. Echo, found at the upper right of the village with her beloved alchemic tools and candies, is an Alchemist with white hair, standing a few steps away Myu and Lenphad.


Echo will take a greater role within Add's storyline in the later future - let’s leave that aside. Talk to her to start the next part of your Job Quest.

, Wally's Castle is the last level for the Elder Village Dungeon. Enter the dungeon in any difficulty to kill monsters.


This requires you to collect monster drop which will be picked up automatically by your character. There are chances that it'll take awhile before the quest item will be dropped; most players suggest to clear the level under the Very Hard Mode. Not only does it has more floor levels compared to the lower difficulty, monsters drop rare items, too.
After completing the quest, return to Echo to have your job changed to Tracer.

, Any player has the right to choose between Arc Tracer or Psychic Tracer. For this guide, players need to choose Arc Tracer when it comes to choosing the advance job quest.


Quests can be found on the bulletin board of any town but can also be seen in your Quest Log. After accepting the quest, players will be given a set of tasks.
Add must be a Tracer in order to proceed to the class advancement quest.

, Quest for the Arc Tracer are still done in Elder Village's Dungeons. Your first quest requires you to enter Banthus Cave and gather 4 Quest Items from Bats monsters.


These quest items are easy to obtain even on Easy Mode. Quest can be done with or without party.

, The next part requires you to kill Nasod Banthus in order to obtain a certain Quest Item in any difficulty level of Underground Waterway.


However, this Quest Item may take a lot of tries before it drops so joining a party during dungeon raid is highly advisable. Per dungeon run ends quickly if you have a full party raid.

, At this point, you have two quests left; one requires you to kill Wally No. 8 to obtain a Quest item under Hard Mode or higher. Next, you have to clear the Wally's Castle twice under Very Hard Mode.


Instead of doing the quest separately in different difficulty, it's best to finish both under the Very Hard Mode.
Full party is advisable. If you have friends that are higher level, it's better to ask for their help to clear up the dungeon quickly.
After completing all the quest, return to the bulletin board to complete your class advancement. Your Add is now Arc Tracer with its complete new skills!

Kill 9 Jangos.,

Take the Sword Taker quest.,
Meet Lenphad.,
Fight the monsters in Wally's Castle.,
Practice the Dash Launch.,
Use the Slash Uppercut.,
Execute the Finishing Combo.",How to Become a Sword Taker in Elsword," In order for you to become a Sword Taker, you must be using the character Raven with a base level of 15; otherwise, the quest for the Taker path won't appear in your Quest Log.


Raven has the special ability to inflict great damage against enemies within a short period of time. Such skill becomes more powerful after you successfully finish the class advancement chain quest.
After reaching level 15, you will receive a special quest for the class change. Accept it and then head out to complete the task.;
, Enter the Suburbs of Wally's Castle to kill 9 Jangos.


You can enter any difficulty for this part of the quest, and this can be done with or without party members.
There is also no time limit.
If you're unable to kill 9 Jangos in one dungeon run, you can enter again to kill the rest.

, Go back to Elder Village after killing 9 Jangos and meet Echo the Alchemist. Echo is the white-haired girl found at the upper-right part of the map, standing a little to the left from the Blacksmith.


Echo will explain something to you regarding your next set of quests. Accept the quest and then head out to enter another dungeon for two more tasks.

, Under the Very Hard difficulty, you need to clear the Suburbs of Wally's Castle once again to obtain a Secret Letter from the boss and kill at least 18 Bomber Mong.


There is a chance that you won't be able to complete the quest in one dungeon run, so keep on entering the same dungeon under the same difficulty.
Keep in mind that you can complete this task while within a party, which is far more easier than doing solo.
Right after you have obtained the Secret Letter and killed 18 Bomber Mongs, return to the Elder Village and report to Echo; she will reward you and change Raven's class to Taker.

, Right after you have completed the Taker chain quest, you will be given three choices for your very first class advancement: Sword Taker, Over Taker, or Weapon Taker. Choose the Sword Taker.


If you make a mistake, you can cancel the quest by simply opening your Quest Log, clicking on the first class advancement quest, and then choosing “Withdraw/Cancel.”
The Sword Taker is one of the fastest class in the game. Even the Elsword, who has great speed and attack power, cannot match the Sword Taker's quick movements and speed.
Aside from fast movement, the Sword Taker has decent HP; this increases their ability to survive in every battle.

, After accepting the quest through your Quest Log or taking it from the Elder Village's announcement board, you will be asked to meet Lenphad in Elder Village. You can find him right next to Echo, working as the Blacksmith.


Lenphad will give you a set of tasks before he can change you to a Sword Taker. All the quests will be collecting quest items rather than killing monsters. All items can be obtained from one map.

, To complete this last leg of the quest, you have to enter Wally's Castle under Very Hard difficulty. You must kill Wally's Guardians, Soldiers, and the mini-boss Vergnert in order to obtain the quest items listed at the right-hand side of your screen.


You may enter the dungeon multiple times without losing your progress, and this quest can be done while in a party.
There's no time limit or required grade, so it's best to enter every floor for monsters, which may give you rare item drops as well.
After you have completed the quest, return to Lenphad and he will turn your character into Sword Taker.

, This is the most useful combo for the Sword Taker, especially in PvP. Players tend to spam this because of its quick movement as your character launches toward the enemy, but in a very small range. Compared to your first combo while being a Taker, this gives more hits and higher damage.


To execute this combo, press arrow key toward your enemy twice and then press Z three times to slash. (L, L or R, R. Z, Z, Z).

, This combo is mostly used against the Elsword class. Because of the Elsword's speed, PvP players tend to jump to avoid ground melee attacks. This uppercut will hit them by surprise.


The first part of the combo will bring your Sword Taker to hack and slash on the ground, forcing enemy characters to jump in order to avoid; however, at the last part of the combo, the Sword Taker will jump and hit your enemy down. They will be vulnerable to attacks at this point, so you can add more combo attacks.
To execute this combo, press Z three times to attack, followed by arrow Up pressed together with Z. (Z, Z, Z. Up + Z).

, This last combo gives 200% more physical damage during your first two attacks. This is where the real speed shows in combat. You need to press X twice followed by a Z. These first three will make multiple fast hits; right after that, you can smash the Z key to spam more combos until the finishing blow ends (X, X. Z. Z spam).


Keep in mind that during the “Z” spam, you should not use any skills or the combo will be completely canceled.
The damage of this combo will reach more than 200% physical damage if done correctly.
The Sword Taker has higher speed compared to Elsword, but lower attack damage; this combo will certainly compensate for that.

If you have already done the Taker quest, proceed to part 2.
The Quest Log can be opened using the shortcut key, Q.
You can also open the Quest Log by clicking the exclamation point (!) at the lower-right side of the screen. A window will appear with a list of on-going and available quests.
When you open your Quest Log, make sure you're in a city or town to avoid being attacked by monsters.;
, Just head to Elder Village and enter the Suburbs of Wally's castle under any difficulty.


There is no time limit. The quest can also be done with or without a party.
If you're unable to kill 9 Jangos in one dungeon run, you can enter the dungeon again to kill the rest.
To get in a dungeon, simply press the Dungeon tab found on your screen. This will open a window, showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter and then press Start Dungeon, or hit F8 on your keyboard. This will automatically assign you to a party, but if you're already in a party, choose “Start with current members” instead.
To change the dungeon’s difficulty, after choosing the dungeon you want to enter, look at the menu to your right where you can see the description of the dungeon and the dungeon difficulty. You get to choose from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level.

, Go back to Elder Village and meet Echo the Alchemist. Echo is the white-haired girl found at the upper-right part of the map, standing a little to the left of the Blacksmith.


Echo will explain your next set of quests. Accept the quest and then head out.

, Under Very Hard mode, clear the Suburb of Wally's Castle to obtain a Secret Letter from the boss. You must also kill at least 18 Bomber Mongs.


There might be a chance that you won't complete the quest in one dungeon run, so keep on entering the same dungeon under the same difficulty.
Completing this task with a party is far more easier than doing it solo.

, Right after you have obtained the Secret Letter and killed 18 Bomber Mongs, return to Elder Village and report to Echo. She will reward you and change Raven's class to Taker.

, Now that your Raven is a Taker, you can choose for your class advancement. Like other characters in the game, Raven gets 3 class advancement. Choose Over Taker from the three.


The quest will appear in your Quest Log.

, Get inside Wally's Castle and defeat Wally's Guardian under any difficulty.


It is recommended to choose Very Hard mode, as this will give more experience and better drops.

, Return to Elder Village and talk to Lenphad. You can find him at the upper-right part of the village. He will give you your next quest.

, At the last floor, kill the final boss, Wally No. 8, for the Control Chip (quest item).


Keep in mind that quest item may or may not drop during your first run, so you might have to do a few dungeon reruns to complete the quest.
It is recommended to do this quest with a full party or with higher-level players.

, Return to Elder Village and give the Control Chip to Echo. You can find Echo next to Lenphad.


Echo will then turn your class to Over Taker.

, Over Takers are very effective in PvPs because of their devastating physical damage. One of the most used combo in the game is the Nasod Spikes, where the character summons sharp spikes from the ground in front of them, sending their opponent into the air, making the enemy vulnerable for upcoming combos.


To execute this, simply press X twice while facing your enemy, then Down arrow key, followed by X, to summon the spikes (X, X, Down, X).

, Attack your opponent by pressing the arrow key toward the enemy twice, then jump by hitting the up arrow once before Z, and X twice to dive down and slam the opponent. This will cause the enemy to cancel their skills and even immobilize them, making them vulnerable to another set of combos (Right, Right or Left, Left, Up, Z, X, X).

, This combo inflicts more damage compared to the other two. By pressing X twice, your character will start punching its opponent, pushing them back with each hit. Follow this attack by an arrow key toward your enemy and X three times. The third punch will inflict a complete knock-back (X, X, Left arrow or Right arrow, X, X, X).


This skill will not stun your opponent for more combos, but it still renders huge damage.

, A VIP membership is essential to becoming well-known on Zimmer Twins. VIP allows your new movies to be published to the Watch A Movie page for everyone to see, comment on, and/or rate. This also gives your movies the opportunity to become a Crowd Pleaser, or a Must-See (an award given specially by the website's moderators).

, Instead of saying ""hay eva, im getting us a kitten"" you should say ""Hey Eva, I'm getting us a kitten"". This makes your movie more pleasant on the eyes and more easier to watch.

Have your sheep try them on it might take awhile get them to fit but it's worth it. Just make a body suit for your sheep PJ's. And try to make a sleep mask just get a ponytail holder then cut out a small bit of cloth tape them together and you have a sleep mask! Also if a scarf would be cute! Just get more material and tie it around your sheep's neck and there you have a scarf!

, Stick your sheep's head out and there! They like to go everywhere you do! But only take them if they promise they will behave!

, A Midnight snack! The dreamy sheep specialty!  

,, cosines parents aunts and uncles sisters brothers grandparents! A whole family!

,, Have your sheep take a bath just get a towel rub it around your sheep's body. Put on the Pj's you made for your sheep then read more and go to bed! If your sheep is to hyper then rock them gently to sleep. If rocking them doesn't work then sing them a nice bedtime song.

, Maybe spiders, the dark, not knowing where you are.

,, How old is your sheep? Is she 8? Is he 6? Put them in grades based on age!

, What you did today what you think about people! They won't tell!

, If they get 70 out of 100 on the test they did don't say You can do better! Say Good Job! You might hurt there feeling if you say they did bad!

, Dreamy sheep's are not called dreamy for nothing! If your animal looks tired maybe it's time for a nap! Can they barely stay awake? 3 hours is perfect! Are they yawning a little? 2 hours will be fine.

, Or if they really are sick then just go do the checkup right then. Check for fever sore throat and belly aches. First see how hot they are. If they are hot that means they have fever. Then have them swallow water. If their throat hurts that means they have a sore throat. Push their stomach gently. Does that hurt? If it does they have a belly ache.

, They need a lot of sunlight to survive!

, Like, Are you on a medication? Maybe you want your sheep to also. (Get little beads and color them with paint any way you want.) Do you have brothers and sisters? I bet your sheep would love some company!

, Things like that.

Meet Echo.,
Choose Code: Exotic.,
Enter the Wally's Castle.,
Become Code: Exotic.,
Use the Spear Launcher.,
Use the Spear Dash.,
Defend using Spear Riser.",How to Become a Code: Exotic in Elsword," Eve can choose one of the three classes when she reaches Level 15 and each classes holds different kinds of skills, combat combos, and weapon type.


In order for you to take the quest, you need to reach Level 15 or higher in order for it to appear on your Quest Log. Simply accept the quest and then proceed to completing it.;
, You are given three dungeon quests where you get to kill monsters and gather quest items.


First, head out to Suburb of Wally's Castle and clear it under the Very Hard Mode. This will complete two of the quests in your list which is completing the dungeon run and killing 15 Bomber Mong and the leader, William Phoru.
If the kill quest isn't completed due to the lack of monsters in each floor, you can do rerun anytime as the kill count won't reset to zero every after you step out from the dungeon.
You can do this quest with party members as well and there is no time limit. Checking every floor will be advisable for mini bosses which has a chance to drop rare items.

, The next quest requires you to get quest items from White Ghost Magicians. These monsters can be found in the Underground Waterway.


Make sure to enter the dungeon under the Very Hard mode, otherwise the quest item won't drop. Party members can help you with gathering the quest item as well. You can do dungeon rerun if quest item isn't complete. Leaving the dungeon without clearing the run won't reset your item count either.

, Now that you have completed all three quests, head back to Elder Village. Talk to Echo, the Alchemist, to complete the quest. You can find her at the eastern part of the village, next to the blacksmith.

, After completing the first leg of the chain quest, you can now choose one of the three Eve advance classes which are Code: Exotic, Code: Architecture and Code: Electra. For this quest guide, make sure to choose Code: Exotic using the Bulletin board or in your Quest Log.


Eve uses Drones as her weapon. Meanwhile, in her advance class which is Code: Exotic, she will be able to obtain a new weapon which is a spear.
From mid-range attack, Eve's range will decrease to melee but her magic attack and physical defence increase dramatically. Aside from higher PDER and MATK, her health doubles which gives her higher chance of survival compared to Battle Magicians.

, You will be given four quests which will be done within one dungeon, the Wally's Castle. This is the final and last dungeon to be completed in Elder Village before you can proceed to the next level.


The quest in this map contains 3 item gathering and time limit dungeon run. First, enter the dungeon while in the party and make sure that the difficulty level is set to Very Hard.
Kill Wally's Guardian and Little Soldier in order to obtain two of the required quest items. For the third quest item, you will have to kill the final boss, Wally No. 8. Items may or may not drop during your first try but you can do reruns without worrying about your gathered items to reset.
During your dungeon run in Wally's Castle, make sure you're able to complete the Very Hard difficulty within 15 minutes, once. This will complete the 4th part of the quest.

, After completing your quest, head back to the Elder Village and click the Bulletin board to complete the quest, or simply click the quest log, found at the bottom right of the screen. After handing in your completed quest, Eve will become Code: Exotic.

, This is commonly seen in the PvP ring, especially when you come face to face with a good Code: Exotic user. This combo will release the new class weapon, which is the spear, along with the magic that lunges the enemy into the air before striking them down with spear.


Due to the short combo and energy ball that throws enemy in mid air (making them vulnerable), Code: Exotic players tend to execute this repeatedly. To do this combo, press the arrow button twice towards your enemy to run and then press X for the magic ball, followed by Z that unleashes the spear and then repeat. (>> or <<, X, Z)

, Now that you're enemy is accustomed to your Spear Launcher, they will either try to attack ahead then jump into the air to avoid the energy ball. You can counter this using your Spear Dash where you get to run towards your enemy and then unleash the spear right away.


This attack will send your enemy back, knocking them down and give you a chance to connect it with your Spear Launcher combo. To use this, dash towards your enemy and then press 'Z' three times. Per tap, the spears grows bigger and so does the magic damage it causes. (>> or <<, Z, Z, Z).

, It's unavoidable to have your 'Z' combo canceled because the enemy either found an opening or managed to escape. Spear Riser prevents your opponent from canceling your moves, and on top of that, you can end it with either the two combos mentioned above, depending on the situation.


When you press 'Z' three times, Eve will use her normal combo, but when you press down, followed by two 'Z', Eve will unleash her spear from the ground that will send her enemy flying.
The spear will surround her so even if the enemy manage to jump above you, by the time they're about to land behind, they'll be greeted with a spear. Once hit, the enemy will be thrown in the air where they become vulnerable for another set of combo. (Z, Z, Z, Down, Z, Z).

It will show your character on a car explaining the plot of the other two games (being stranded on a house in the middle of the forest, fending off endless hordes of zombies), you crack a joke about how that looks so much like a game, and just as you are explaining how you ended up in that forest, a zombie with a rocket launcher blows up your car. You are the only survivor (unsurprisingly), and you must get yourself ""out of this godforsaken city"", the game states as being your main goal.;
, There, you can save your game and upgrade your weapons, as well as buy ammo. You may want to save you ammo and use your knife, by pressing the space bar (QWERTY layout). Keep your distances , you must keep walking backwards if you don't want to be attacked. Practice this technique after you get to the garage, and don't fight any hordes bigger than four zombies with your knife. Another tip for saving ammo: avoid missing.

, Then, just get $500 to purchase a better armor, going from 150 to 200 HP (HP means hit points or health points). Then, don't follow the arrow to the Police Station. Just keep killing zombies until you get $2500. See ""Tips"" for how to get more money.

Gather enough points to buy transmission modes.,

Watch your disease spread.,
Wait for more evolution points to build up.,
Buy up your symptoms in one big blitz.,
Sit back and watch every region become forsaken.",How to Beat Pandemic 2," Parasites and bacteria aren't as environmentally dependent, but they evolve super slowly. Instead, pick a virus and just buy environmental resistance traits as your bug evolves.


Parasites are for the long con. If you have time to walk away from the computer for 5 or 10 minutes at a time while your bug accumulates points, it's not a bad way to go. For more immediate gratification, though, stick to the viruses or bacteria.;
, What you name your bug shouldn't matter — some people claim naming it a certain way will lead to starting in Madagascar, but these cheats are far from 100% effective. Instead of spending a ton of time on naming cheats, focus on where you start.

, Where the infection begins can make or break the success of your game. Here's what you need to know:


Try to start in a small or isolated area. Argentina, Peru, Indonesia, Greenland and Madagascar are all ideal locations for starting.
Brute force your way into Madagascar. A common Pandemic 2 strategy is simply restarting the game until you luck out and start in Madagascar. It can take some time, but it ensures you won't miss out on infecting the island.

, As soon as you're happy with where you're starting, open up the Disease tab and unload whatever symptoms you started with. This makes it so your bug can fly under the radar and accumulate evolution points.


Note that it does cost evolution points to sell your symptoms right away, but it's worth it. Don't worry, you'll buy up better symptoms later!

, Wait a few minutes to build up some evolution points, then look at the transmission modes.


Waterborne and airborne are the most important modes to buy.
You can buy rodent and insect, but they're more noticeable and not as effective. However, if your disease isn't spreading as quickly as you'd like, go ahead and buy them.

, Look at the climate where your bug started, as well as the bonus resistance you got from the beginning. This will help you choose what to buy.


Don't buy another level of the resistance you had when you started. Focus your points on upgrading the others.
Buy what's related to the country where your disease started, as well as the places where the ships and planes from your country go. Here's a basic rundown of each region:Cold: Russia, Canada, Greenland and West Europe.
Heat: Mexico, Brazil, Africa, Australia, West Europe, Madagascar, India and the Middle East.
Moisture: Cuba, Peru, Argentina, Indonesia, Japan and Australia.



, You should be able to see different regions become infected with the disease now.


Notice when the ports shut down. If difficult areas like Madagascar, Greenland, Argentina or Indonesia close down all access before your bug infects them, it's over. Start again.

, When you've infected every area, sit back and let the evolution points build for a little bit. Once you have around 50, move on to the next step.


Pay attention to vaccine development. Click the World tab and check on the vaccine progress. If you notice that a vaccine is less than 30 days to completion, and more than half of the hospitals are working on it, buy a drug resistance level. Keep checking up on it every so often and just buy another level every time it's getting too close. When enough hospitals shut down, you won't have to worry about it.

, When you're ready to unleash total destruction, buy all of your terrible symptoms at the same time. For maximum annihilation, wait for a big natural disaster to strike, then move in. Here are some symptoms that work well:


Sneezing and coughing: Spread your disease around faster.
Fever: Increases lethality
Hemorrhaging and kidney failure: These ones are expensive, but deadly.
Don't bother unlocking Tier 4. It costs too many points, and you can do just as much damage with the symptoms in the first three tiers.

, You've won!

During the game, researchers will frantically look for a way to cure the virus you unleashed, sending groups of people to other countries to uncover the secret in order to eradicate the worm. Whenever there are researchers, blue bottles will appear.
Catalytic Switch is very effective during the middle and later part of the game.;
, For this genetic code, choose Aquacyte. This gene will increases the chance of the plague to spread by sea.


Most of the countries have ports, especially countries that are difficult to infect such as Greenland and Iceland.
With this gene, infection spreads through water; this includes ships and will be more effective than normal.

, This will give you the choice of changing the value per evolving and devolving your Neurax Worm. For Brutal Mode, choose Ionized Helix. This will give you bonus DNA when devolving


It’s fine if you insert other genes here as long as it does not affect the cure progress rate.

, These genes will let you change how your plague mutates. It can either increase the chance of mutation or decreases it. In this mode, use Darwinist.


This increases the chance of your plague mutating and will be helpful since you will be focusing on spreading the worm later on.
You can also use Genetic Mimic; this gene makes your plague harder to cure. The chance of mutating doesn't require DNA points.

, This is where you can find the set of genes that can influence the behavior of your Neurax Worm in different environment. In this mode, Extremophile is much preferable since it gives your worm a minor bonus in all environment.

, This is vital. You need to choose a country that has a poor health system in order for your Neurax Worm to spread quickly and effectively.


Choosing a rich country will delay the generation of your DNA points, which will affect the outcome of the game.
It's advisable that you choose India as your starting country because of its warm temperature; it's granted that your Neurax is used to hot climate. Furthermore, having China as a neighboring country will boost up the spreading of your Neurax once it crosses the border.

, Transmission affects the infectivity of your Neurax. To successfully win this mode, evolve Egg 1 first. The egg will make Neurax Worm produce eggs, which will eject from the host brain in the thousands.


This is effective in crowded countries such as China.
This will also unlock the three key transmissions in this mode. Upgrade each: Bird 1, Insect 1, and Rodent 1 to have the Neurax travel in different living creatures to hasten the infectivity.

, Concertina Locomotion, found under the Transmission tab, has the ability to grip onto portions of the body while pulling or pushing other sections, allowing faster movement outside the host and increasing the infectivity of the Neurax.


This will unlock Undulatory Locomotion. Undulatory Locomotion has the ability to propagate flexural waves along the length of worm, increasing the infectiousness.
If you have enough DNA points, evolve Undulatory Locomotion after Concertina.

, Evolving Undulatory Locomotion will unlock two additional transmission gene: Air and Water. Evolve these. The Neurax will start spreading to other nations, and the number of people infected grows.


If you don't have DNA points at this time, go back to the game and pop bubbles. Once you have enough points, evolve the Air and Water gene.
Air can make your worm dehydrate to become lighter, allowing them to float in the wind, which is useful in countries with arid condition. This also invades planes, which can help the migrate to other country.
Water gene makes your Neurax develop flexible cell membranes, allowing them to survive at a range of depths. This also affects people's water, infecting them if they drink straight from the tap. Effective in poor countries.

, Thanks to the passive gene we chose before starting the game, Neurax is evolving Symptoms without the need of DNA points. Now that we have spread to other countries, it is best to strengthen Neurax by evolving the Drug Resistance 1. Your worm will become resistant to class 1 and class 2 drugs, increasing the ineffectiveness of the drugs in wealthy countries.


If you have enough DNA points, evolve Cold Resistance 1 and Cold Resistance 2. Since our Neurax is already used to hot climate, it's ideal to focus on Cold Resistance instead of Heat Resistance. This evolves the Neurax to withstand cold temperatures and climates, increasing its infectivity in northern countries.

, Go back to your game and have Neurax spread. Pop all the red bubbles. As the Neurax spreads, the world will start focusing on creating a cure. Evolve your Air 2 and Water 2. This will unlock a new gene, Air 3. Evolve it.


If you still have enough DNA at this point, go back to Abilities and evolve the Drug Resistance 2 and then return to your game and watch the Neurax spread across the country.
Pop any bubbles, including the blue.
Trojan Planes will appear more. Use those planes to spread Neurax in countries that aren't affected by the worm yet, especially Greenland, Iceland, Sweden, the Caribbean, and Madagascar.
If your Cure reaches 25%, open your Disease window, click Abilities tab, and then choose Genetic Reshuffle 1.

, World Cure is now in progress, and every country in the world is now infected with Neurax. You will now focus on infecting all the people and leave no one healthy.


First you need to evolve the Genetic Swap.
Evolve Mutative Regeneration 1 and Mutative Regeneration 2.
Since there are only few or no dead people yet, Corpse Feeder 1 is useless. Mutative Regeneration, however, increases the chance of mutation.

, This increases the control over the host’s brain.

, Tendrils will mesh with the frontal lobe, the conscious thought-center, and gain the ability to mentally manipulate the host.

, Hormone production will be altered, lowering maturity and the levels of hygiene, and increasing the infection of Neurax.


This will unlock the next gene, which will lead people to losing their minds—this will direct you to the mind control gene later on.

, Mania Excess Serotonin production triggers manic episodes, leading to increased contact with others and the inability to focus.


This also affects the productivity of people in creating a cure.

, Severe damage to orbital cortex triggers OCD—forcing the host to be obsessed over a specific worm-related take. This increases infectivity and severity of Neurax.

, Surges of Dopamine and Serotonin compel the host to constantly think about the worm and trigger intense rushes of pleasure.

, Overdose of oxytocin and vasopressin forces the host into a permanent state of worship or acceptance, treating the Neurax Worm as an eternal god. People who are infected will halt their research for the cure.

, This will have the infected people focus on spreading the worm to citizens that are yet to be infected.


The game will soon end after 400 days or more with the humanity worshiping an ancient worm.

Launch the game.,
Open the 64th level.,
Focus on gathering the flowers.,
Collect water droplets.,
Gather suns and carrots.,
Make sufficient moves on the bottom of the grass.,
Utilize Boosters.",How to Beat Level 64 in Farm Heroes Saga," Farm Heroes Saga can be played on your smart device or from the Facebook website.


For Android and iOS, look for the game app on your home screen. Tap it to launch the game.
On Facebook, on the News Feed page of your account, look for the Apps heading on the left panel. A list of your app’s will be displayed here. Click the Farm Heroes Saga link to launch the game.;
, Once you’ve finished level 63, level 64 of the game will be available for you to play. Tap on the level from the game map to open it.

, In order to gather flowers, you need to make them bloom by making matches next to them. Utilize your first few moves on blooming and gathering the flowers.


It will be a great bonus if the matches you make next to the flowers are the ones in the requirements (water drops, suns, and carrots).

, Gathering water droplets can make your game a challenge since there are water buckets on the board. If water buckets overflow, it will cause water droplets to randomly appear on the board. The randomness might create problems for your planned matches; however, it will help you gather water droplets.


If water droplets don’t appear on the board, make water buckets overflow by making matches next to them. Water droplets will randomly appear on the board, replacing other cropsies so you can try to make a match.

, In between making water buckets overflow and flowers bloom, it would be a good idea to match suns and carrots to reach the goal. Try to make matches next to flowers to help them bloom and buckets to make them overflow; this way you can get all requirements in just a few moves.

, The best moves you can make is at the bottom row of the grass. This is where you can use the flowers and buckets to your advantage.


This will also help you trigger cascades, allowing you to gather enough suns, carrots, and water droplets to beat the game.

, Boosters are very useful when you can’t make fruit matches. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters every 5 to 10 hours. There are three kinds of boosters in Farm Heroes Saga.


Magic Shovel Booster: This allows you to remove one crop. You can use this booster when you only have a small number of moves left and you badly want to collect one crop to complete a level.
Bonus Reward Booster: Every required cropsy will get +1 bonus on the board when applying this booster. So when you need more points to win the game, apply this booster. It will give your score the boost it needs.
Tractor Booster: This booster will remove a full row of cropsies by driving over it.

Once at the Arcanists site, go to character creation.,
In a battle, don't use the same spell over and over.,
Don't use arcane attacks when someone has an Arcane Tower on them.,
When someone has a Flame Shield, they still can be hit by Fire Attacks etc.,
Don't hide all the time.,
Don't waste attacks that you have limited use of.,
If an attack is rechargeable, make sure you can hit the person with it.,
Spray the battlefield with Napalm, or Napalm Bomb.",How to Be Victorious at Arcanists," Pick a good look, but most importantly, good spells. It's important to have a variety of defensive and offensive spells. Members can have all of the spells, but non-members only get the first two books. A few spells I highly recommend are: Arcane Flash; Arcane Arrow; Arcane Tower; Arcane Gate; Arcane Bomb; Fire Ball; Lava Bomb; Flame Shield; Napalm; Rain of Fire; Fire Arrow; Rain of Arrows. You don't have to have these. I've just had good experiences with them.;
, Use variety if possible.

, It'll heal them.

, Most of them get repelled, but you get a good fire ball or napalm in if you're close enough. If you can, get below them, Fireshields don't come into effect from below. If you're a member, you can use ""Blast from the Past"" to deactivate their shield (not visually).

, That shows you're a coward. Yes, if you're low on health or want to get your defenses up, hide. But come back out into the heat of battle.

, But, don't be hesitant to use them, if you do, you will have wasted spells.

, It's a pain in the rear if you miss and have to wait for the attack to come back.

, Try it at your enemies as well as plain land. If you do a good job, the enemy can't move!Napalm can shoot through thin walls, so if there is a thin wall blocking you from your enemy you can shoot Napalm through and hit them.

Get involved on the commons.",How to Be Successful on Equine Ranch," Try to chose a unique and memorable player/ranch name.;
, There are many ways to do so:


Go to Horse Acquisitions and import a horse in Import Foreign Stock; or
Go the Classifieds and purchase a horse; or
Go the auctions and bid on a horse.

, Whenever you register a horse, you can choose to put the brand on its shoulder. Your brand should be distinctive as it will set horses owned/bred by you apart from other horses.

, Choose the color you think suits your horse best. Sometimes having your horse get a DNA test will help you figure out its color. If the name you wanted has already been used, change it slightly. Add an extra letter, number or punctuation.

, Every single real life day equals one month on the game. With every passing game month, you will get 30 game days. Days can be accumulated. This means that if you don't have time to train one day at all, you will have 60 game days on the next day. Or, if you only manage to train 20 days, you will have 40 games days the next real day.

, Learn about horse personalities and burnout to understand what affects training speed. Make sure you leave a little energy on the energy bar everyday, because if you don't, your horse will be exhausted. This means it will lose some health and its energy bar won't be full for three real days. Horse training is a very sought after skill on Equine-Ranch. People are always hiring trainers for their horses and they pay very well for an honest trainer.

, It is full of extremely important information that will help you get a grasp on the game.

, Equine-Ranch is a sandbox game and you will need to set goals for yourself. There are no objectives that will be given to you. Answer questions such as these:


What breeds do you want to concentrate on?
What do you want to breed your horses for (color, competition, etc.)
What discipline will you breed/train your horses for?

, It will make your life easier because you won't have to remake your ranch page from scratch every time you have an update. Keeping a ranch blog is also encouraged.

, This will help you produce some extra money gain show points. If you show your horses with enough consistency, they will earn titles. Titled horses are a lot more valuable and they bring fame to your ranch. They also earn you a lot of personal points which can be collected and then used for prizes.

, Try to breed them to titled horses only. You are much more likely to get a quality foal this way. If you're going to cross-breed, make sure it is a recognized cross-breeding as any other cross will produce a Grade foal. Also, if you use frozen insemination to breed, there is no risk of injury to either horse but settling rates are higher with live covering so you have to weigh the risk against the rewards. A foal-trained horse is less likely to cause or sustain an injury during live cover than an untrained horse that doesn't know what a halter or lead is, for instance.

, Will you offer stud, frozen semen, boarding, training and/or brood services?

, Pasture puffs are horses sitting around on your ranch, doing nothing. Maybe somebody else will give them a job to do. Retired show horses do not count as pasture puffs as they have lived a full life and deserve to live a pampered life in their old age.

Upgrade to Flash Player 10 and download gamebooster.,
Make a room called ""Noobs Only."",
Enter a map.",How to Be Good at Stick Arena Ballistick," It will make the game run very smoothly. Use a brand new ""easy-to-use"" mouse that fits in your hand with appropriate sensitivity. It is very vital because you will be the only one that won't be lagging.;
, Practice with them.

, Once you spawn, immediately pick up any weapon, if you don't run into anyone, pick up a better weapon.


Melee Weapons can defeat ranged weapons from up-close. With melee weapons, find cover when you run into a ranged weapon. Wait until the enemy gets closer for you to run and strike. If your enemy doesn't get closer, get farther by a little, then your enemy will get closer and so will you.
Ranged Weapons. If you run into a melee, shoot immediately. If a melee runs up to you, run backwards and shoot at the same time. Ranged weapons defeat melee by a distance.

There are 6 basic weapons in the game.


Your fists. No pros, you just run faster than any other weapon but sword.
Sword. Very mobile, very fast attack rate, very likely to strike, but weak damage. The secret to this weapon is to run at random directions while slashing your enemy while your enemy tells you to hold still, especially when fighting a sledgehammer. Do not fight a bat. 8 hits to kill.
Bat. Normal mobile, normal attack rate, very likely to strike, good damage. Defeats sword. 4 hits to kill.
sledgehammer. Heavy mobile, slow attack, somewhat likely to strike, instant kill. Defeats any melee weapons if used accurately. 1 hit to kill.
Double-Barrel. Heavy mobile, slow attack, likely to strike, good damage, close ranged. Do not shoot at the glock from far distance. 3 shots to kill.
Automatic. Normal mobile, fast attack, somewhat likely to strike, normal damage, normal ranged. Defeats double-barrel from farther range. Do not fight glock from far ranged. About 6 shots to kill.
Glock. Light mobile, fast attack, unlikely to strike, normal damage, far ranged. Defeats all ranged weapons from far range. 5 shots to kill.

Understand the story behind Wolfteam International.,
Understand the type of game it is.,
Understand what the humans have and the wolves have.,
Learn the ranking system.,
Don't hide out in a sniping bunker/room thinking people can't see you.,
Don't go around calling people that have a General rank a noob while you're not even a private(the private is the 2nd rank; they will own you.,
Use the rocket launcher, stationary machine gun (when holding you move very slowly; very good gun if your playing wolf conquest though), grenade launcher, red line grenade, shotguns, snipers and that's mostly it.

,
See how realistic this game is.,
When sniping with an assault weapon, just aim and shoot at the person, don't point at their head exact, just shoot when you got him/her locked on.

,
When you aim try not to be stationary.,
Try your best use wolf when at about 5 meters (16.4 ft) because you can deal them a lot of damage when you jump and right-click.

",How to Be Good at Wolfteam International," A number of people with similar base arrangement to wolves have been discovered in the process of antidoting DNA of mankind of near future.Many of them are found mainly among people with superb physical performance like athletes or mercenaries and they have prominently shorter life spans than others have. A multinational medicine-manufacturing conglomerate ""Pfien"", witch developed a new medicine ""Epoxyn"" for a disease ""Diewolf syndrome"", also develops ""Anti-Epoxyn"" that has opposite effect in profound secrecy and supplies to the France military. The France military establishes a special force ""Wolfteam"", also known as the 2nd foreign legion, and recruits unit aiming worldwide.;
, Wolf Team is a free-to-play first-person shooter that pits humans against wolf-human hybrids. Players may choose to play as humans with access to high-tech weapons and team-coordination or wolf-humans that have the ability to transform in wolves at will and kill a man with their bare hands.

,


Humans have access to anything from medieval weapons to futuristic guns. Wolf Team features a WP equipment system. Basically, this means that the damage objects and surfaces suffer is affected by the distance from the weapon and what the material it's made out of.
Wolves have differing abilities depending on their character and wolf features. Wolves may also gain new abilities and enhance previous ones.

, Wolf Team also features a ranking system for players based on experience points.

, Being in a sniping bunker doesn't help; someone throws a grenade in you're pretty much screwed so like most people tell you shoot and run from the spot!

, And you don't want a general on your rival list.

,, Not just because of the graphics, but also the bullet damage depends on how far you are. Also you won't die from like... let's say 27 bullets! One shot and boom! your practically dead. You get 200 Hp but don't let that fool you! One bullet can do a lot of damage (snipers 150 damage maybe, assault rife 50s range, rocket launcher 999, stationary machine guns 30-60 but they fire fast, grenades you're lucky if you survive, red line grenades take a lot of health but don't kill you most the time)

,, Don't take too long to aim or they will just shoot you.

Learn times to spray and not Spraying shouldn't be used all the time in matches.,
Don't give up.,
Play on private servers.,
Learn from the pros.,
Never install hacking programs.,
Practice.",How to Be Pro in Gunz," Recoil gets high, bullets are wasted, and more penalties to your accuracy is done. The time to spray is when you're ambushed by K-stylers, or people who are hot on your tail. It's a resort to save your life. Sometimes, it might rack up a few kills for you, and remember this.. who can dodge a WALL OF LEAD COMING RIGHT TOWARD THEM!? If you waste precious Ammo, you're gonna regret it. A better alt. to spraying is Bursting, It's firing your guns for a few seconds and stopping, it lowers accuracy penalties.;
, K-Styling is extremely hard to learn, and can take many weeks, maybe months to learn. You can always try D-Style, which is ""Dagger Style"". Dagger Style is a useful method for getting around, but it can be easier, since less timing involved with it. The reason why most users don't use it because It's all Flanking and Harassing.

, Private servers give you access to premium items, such as headgear, body gear etc. K-Styling on Private servers isn't as frustrating, because you have access to different maps, and you also believe it or not, level up faster due to increased exp rates. Although you may want to reconsider, as private servers are not officially licensed by MAIET and therefore are illegal, and chances are you can be downloading a virus. Remember, private servers are made by average Joe's like you and me! and one more thing... Since Private servers can be edited, It will be more prone to hackers, It's not a good place to learn at if you new also. Most of them are more aimed at K-stylers more than D-stylers, and most of them will be biased like hell based on that, on top of that.. Game Mechanics can be messed up, i.e Your Butterfly might be faster on the Private server, yet in the real GunZ your Butterfly might be not as fast.

, Learning strategies is crucial. You can look for demos on the gunz website. You can also watch commented Clan Wars on youtube.

, It makes a rather large learning curve, It's unethical, and chances are high the hack will get patched, so therefore you'll have to keep on looking for a hack, hacks enclosed in .exes and .rar + .zip files are often Keyloggers, You expose yourself to being hacked, and a whole bunch of trouble. Seeing the dismay of users on the game itself might be fun, and believe us, It'll bite you back.

, As they say, practice makes perfect. K-Styling/D-styling cannot be learned in one day. Start watching tutorials on YouTube, or search up things on Google about K-Styling and D-styling. You will be more likely to get a lot of information from there than trying to find out for yourself.

Ignore it when Brandy (who should be sitting at the side of the screen) giggles or says ""You just got lucky!"",

Make a new world.,
Mine.,
Find a recipe.,
Mass produce your items.,
Check the price.,
Sell your items for a world lock.,
Thank the players who bought your items.",How to Be a Good Growtopia Player1," You can do that by typing in a new world name where no one has entered before. You'll see nothing but dirt, lava, rock, and cave background when you make a new one. There will also be no locks so everything can be broken by anyone.
, To mine, select the fist (it's in you're inventory) then tap or click on the block you want to break. You don't have to mine everything in the world. What matters is that you get the seeds of the resources found in the world. It's best to get as much rock seeds as you can because rocks don't drop lots of seeds., You need to splice or mix your seeds to make something new. The reason why is because you need to earn a world lock or any lock you can get. (World lock is the best you can get.) Some good worlds to find recipes are WIKI, RECIPE, and INFO. You may skip this step if you want to try to sell you're seeds as they are but not many people buy those because they can be found in new worlds., You'll be needing lots of those. To mass produce, simply follow the recipe you got and harvest the trees. Then, break your item to get their seeds and plant it again! If the number of seeds you get is decreasing then you could just keep splicing without mining or choose a different recipe., Before you sell, you always have to know the price or people could trick you into selling it for a cheaper price. You can check the price in the Growtopia wiki or BUYMASS. You have to make sure the price is not out of date. You could get fooled., Some good trade worlds are BUYMASS and BUYFARMABLE.   It may be hard because some people don't like new players and call them ""noobs"". You'll be able to sell it at some point. If you think no one will buy what you made, then switch to another recipe or try other trade worlds., Even though they probably won't remember you, still be polite. Remember that you're talking to a real person and not the game."

Prepare a world where you can farm your farmables.,
Buy your farmables.,
Break your farmables.,
Plant the seeds.,
Repeat.",How to Be a Good Growtopia Player2," Your farmables need to be protected from being stolen. So world lock a world and block the white door. It's recommended that you use house entrances so that if you ever die, you can go back easily even when there are people on the white door. Another way is to buy a signal jammer and place it in your world. It should have

A lot of space to plant your farmables
A break area
A storage space

, Go to a vend or trade world and buy the farmable(s) you want. It's up to you what you want to farm. I suggest using Venus Guytrap or Blackrock because you can farm them everyday and drop lots of gems. If you choose to farm Pinball Bumpers or Chandeliers (Chand) then I suggest having another farmable you could mine while waiting for those to grow., Go to your world's break area and place the farmables. Once it's all filled, start breaking your farmables. Remember that after each batch you have to get the gems and seeds or else it will only drop gems and you'll end up losing your farmables. Keep breaking until all of your farmables are gone and all you have are the seeds., Select the seeds and plant them in the space you made to plant them. It's okay if you didn't get 50+ seeds from mining all that. The good thing about farmables are that they drop lots of gems and lots of seeds so it's unlikely that you'll run out of it., The key to getting lots of gems is to repeat the process as often as you can. You'll notice that you'll need to break a lot more of the farmables you bought but don't skip a day of breaking your farmables. If it's too much, hire workers and pay them a world lock for breaking a certain amount of farmables. Another solution is to sell a bit of it but not too much. Who knows? Maybe the person who buys them was just like you!"

Share your items with others.,
Help others.,
Compliment others.,
Teach others.,
Don't scam or play drop games.,
Be polite to others.",How to Be a Good Growtopia Player3," Even if you only have a few items because you just started your worldlock, give away stuff that you don't need anymore but that other players need.

Don't let greed take control. Think of others, not just yourself. What you can do is to support others. Like for example, if a player's farm in GT is scammed, give the player a little pep talk. For example: ""You can do it man. I know you can. You got there before! Get there again!"" And after you give the pep talk, go to their farm and help them for a bit.

, Try to tell other players what you know about what they need to know or how to do stuff that they think are impossible to do. Only the few things you know., Sometimes other players get teased, bullied, hurt, abused, or banned from a world. All they need is a helping hand. For example, tell them that they did a great job, or maybe if they start on something new, tell them something like ""nice house, man!""., Even if you are a beginner, teach others what you know. Help a new player to learn what that another player has taught you., If you do, not even one player will trust you. Scamming is like hacking someone's server. And that's not good. That's because you only think of yourself, not that player's server., Even if they are saying ""Ha! You are a noob!"", don't act badly toward them. Remember, you're just starting a new life in Growtopia. Don't you act as if you know everything. Just tell them something like: ""Stop that. You are not being polite. You may lose friends."" Then ignore them. Also, all chat are logged in Growtopia, so developers know if you are rude to others."

, Take care of them by changing, feeding, playing, and burping them. Even take them on walks. All of these actions earn you ""care points"" which are points that show how much you care about your baby.


To earn extra care points, play games to earn coins. After you earn enough coins, go to the ""Store,"" there will be baby supplies for your infant's needs.

Focus on staying safe and alive.,
Build for healing.,
Prioritize heals to aid those that need them the most.,
Strike a balance between conserving mana and healing your teammates.,
Remember to use your other supporting abilities.,
Keep paths of retreat open for your teammates.",How to Be a Good Healer in Heroes of the Storm," Your team will love you for being a great healer, and the enemy team will want to melt your face at every opportunity possible. This is why it is very, very important that you stay at a safe range. This allows you to toss out heals from a safe distance, keeping your teammates alive while staying well away from the enemy team. In the event that the enemy team dives to focus you down, well, they’ve just walked right into the gaping jaws of your waiting teammates.


This is also why it can be worth picking talents that increase your survivability. If the enemy team decides to focus you down, they will be in for a nasty surprise when they discover that their risky gambit has been shut down because you’ve got a trick up your sleeve to keep you alive. Talents like Spell Shield, Stoneskin, Ice Block, Imposing Presence, and other survival-oriented talents thus come highly recommended against enemy teams with a high damage output.;
, All support classes have talents that greatly impact their non-healing role on the battlefield. These shiny, interesting talents have their place, but not for dedicated healers. If you want to be a good healer, stick to picking talents that improve your ability to heal allies. Leave the killing to the experts and focus on keeping your team alive.


If you have more than one support on your team who can help share the burden of healing, you could explore other talents that add to your utility in the game. If you are the sole support in your team, however, then these healing-oriented talents can help keep your team alive.
The exception to this rule is when you notice that the enemy team is hurting you more than you’d like. Sacrificing a healing talent or two will be worth it if doing so means you stay alive long enough to keep your team supported.

, Watch the flow of battle, and heal whoever is being focused down by the enemy team. For example, your team’s warrior could be taking the hits and needing your heals, or the enemy team could be ignoring your tank and is pushing past him to take down your team’s assassin. Time and practice will teach you when to chuck out those crucial heals, but it’s always a good idea to heal whoever’s taking the hard hits as you see them coming.


This is especially true for heroes that have heals with relatively long cooldown times, like Uther, Rhegar, and Tyrande. The flow of battle could shift in as little as two, three seconds, and the last thing you want to do is watch in horror as your team’s assassin is shot down because you healed the tank, which the enemy is now ignoring.
The hero being hit with a disable is a good sign of someone being focused down by the enemy team. People tend to focus their attention on whoever is slowed, stunned, or rooted, giving you a very visible sign of the guy or gal who will most likely need your precious heals.

, Mana is the lifeblood of healers. If you run out of mana, you will not be able to keep your team topped up. On the other hand, holding back on heals will leave your injured allies weak and vulnerable. They will then be more likely to perish if they get caught in a surprise attack or get hit by a global spell. So at the end of the day, it all boils down to your judgment on when to go whole-hog with heals or to hold back and wait until they are needed the most.Some heroes, like Kharazim and Brightwing, can still heal even when they’re completely out of mana. Not as quickly or as effectively, but they can still keep their teammates topped up without spending mana.
It may sometimes be a smarter idea to just teleport back to your base to quickly recover both health and mana. This is especially important when objectives are about to spawn and your healing fountain is still cooling down. Better to be a few seconds late with full health and mana than early with half your health and barely any mana left to do anything.

, Just because you’re a healer does not mean that you should ignore your other abilities. Supportive buffs, offensive debuffs, scouting abilities—these are absolutely great when you use them at the right moments. Granted they won’t be as effective if they’re not talented, but they can still help depending on the situation.

, One last thing: try not to block your allies whenever possible. You don’t want to kill your teammate because you were blocking his escape route, which is an annoyingly common occurrence when fighting in tight quarters. This is why you should aim to position yourself off to the side of your teammates during a major engagement. This will give both you and your allies a straight path of escape if you find yourselves in a bad situation.

There are many different methods of scams, and some might not be the most clever and are easy to detect as a scam, while other scammers are very good at covering up the fact they're a scam. Some common scams include (some scams are not listed because they are no longer possible, such as the World Trade Scam):

Drop Games
Vending Machine Scams
Trust Tests
""I Quit"" Scam
Growtoken Scams
Casinos, Treasure Chest, and other games that require you to bet.;
, If you are being asked to drop something, especially when it's something specific that you're wearing or if your asked to drop rare items, it's safe to assume that you're in a scam world. So if you're being asked to drop things, do not drop anything! The scam host is just going ban you and steal your items. Dropping items is a method used in Drop Games, Trust Tests, and betting games.

, Scam hosts sometimes go on other accounts or ask their friends to help them in scams. This method is very common in Drop Games, especially. The way they help is by dropping rare items, leading them to winning the prize (which gets given back after the game has ended) so that the game doesn't look like a scam. To identify a helper, the most common way is by looking at the flag. If the flag matches the host's flag and they continue to win over and over again, there's a good chance that they are working together.


If the world is not world-locked, but instead has something like a/many huge/big/small lock(s) covering the area where the players play the scam, there is a good chance that someone is working with the host. When you have access to a huge/small/big lock, your name doesn't appear as green. It remains white, like any normal player. Scammers use this method by accessing the helper and having them seem like a normal player of the scam, but as soon as someone else drops their rares, they kick the player and take the items. It won't seem suspicious while a player is on BRB or suddenly stops moving/talking/etc. because they aren't the host, so it won't seem like they're about to kick someone.
When you're in a Drop Game that is covered using something that doesn't completely lock the world and you're unsure if it's a scam or not, just ask every player to punch the wall. If it doesn't crack and makes a ""clink"" sound, that person is not accessed. But if it cracks at all and makes a breaking noise, that person has access to the lock and is attempting to scam. If someone doesn't punch the wall, it's probably because they're trying to cover up the fact that they're a scammer, so it's safe to assume the world you're in is a scam.

, If the prize looks too good to be true, it probably is. In scams such as Drop Games, the host often asks for rare items, making it fair if you win the prize (that means it isn't too good to be true), but in Growtoken Scams where the world is a mini-game world (e.g. ""finish this 10+-minute parkour for a rare prize!!""), the host often places a ridiculously easy-to-get prize.


For example, you might have to finish a short parkour, then go into a door, which leads to a super long extension made of dirt where you have to run through it, then you receive your prize. However, you never actually receive the prize, and you just get taken to another world, or it ends with something impossible (e.g. a password door labeled 0-1000).
The host scrapes in Growtokens by using this method because for every hour people besides you and your admins are in your world, you receive a Growtoken. So by having you do a long run for the prize, they get time added to their timer, having the owner of the world get things without having to do any work because the players are doing it for them.

, This technique is exactly what it sounds like- it is not possible to earn the prize. This is used most often in two types of worlds: Mini-Parkour worlds (talked about above) and game worlds such as Fashion Show, Spleef, Dice Game, etc. In Mini-Parkour worlds, the way they use the trick is told above (it never leads to the prize in the end or requires a lengthy task such as a password door labeled 1-1000). When used in game worlds, the players get to play, but never actually win the prize.

, Pay-to-Play worlds are equally scams and equally non-scams, so detecting whether it is or not is a tough task. Pay-to-Play worlds are exactly what they sound like: in order to play, you must pay items (usually locks). There are 2 types of Pay-to-Play scams:







Game world scams - In game worlds, you often don't need to pay at the start, but there is usually an offer that you receive whenever you're about to die: ""P or D?"". This stands for ""Pay or Die?"", which means the host is asking if you want to die and drop out of the game, eliminating your chances of receiving the prize, or pay an item that the owner likes (usually a small lock) to receive at least one extra life. Though this is very often not a scam, sometimes the owner will end up just kicking or banning the player after they pay, or putting them back in the game but end up still eliminating them, no matter how well they did in the game, making them ask ""P or D?"" once again.

So if you are being asked something like a small lock or an item you don't care about or an item of low value, feel free to give it away for extra lives, but if it's something of high value, such as a World Lock, it's probably better to just ditch the prize unless you have so many World Locks that you don't even care if you lose one.



Betting games - In betting worlds, such as Casinos, Treasure Chest games, and other luck-related games, you have to pay before you can play. There is a slight difference between Casino betting worlds and non-casino betting worlds. In Casinos, you drop your bet and play against the opponent until one of the player's lives run out, and once all the lives of that player runs out, the player who is still alive takes both their own item and the other player's item. However, sometimes the bet is specific (e.g. ""Bet = 1WL"") or the player will bet a rare item without knowledge that the host is actually about to scam them. In the end, there's a chance that the host isn't actually going to let you play casino and will just take your items.

In non-casino betting games, such as Treasure Chest games, you have to pay for each ""turn"". Still using Treasure Chest games as an example, you usually have to pay one World Lock or more for each search you do in the game. In Treasure Chest game worlds, there will be several closed treasure chests or something that behaves as a treasure chest, and if not a scam, it will include prizes inside. The prizes inside determine whether it is a scam or not (rare = high value/good item and non-rare = low value/bad item): if it includes different rare items in all the chests, it's not a scam. If it includes some rare and some non-rare items, it's still not a scam. If it has only one rare and the rest are non-rares, it still is not a scam. But if it's all non-rares, it's a scam. Sometimes there won't be any item in a chest, and sometimes there won't be any items at all. As long as there is at least one rare item, it's not a scam, there just isn't much luck with it and it's more likely to upset you because you got a bad prize. Sometimes you'll pay only to be banned. So there's an equal chance of getting scammed or not, but it's best to avoid games like this unless you're extremely rich.



, They are uncommon but possible. These kinds of scams include the Trade System scam and the Vending Machine scam. They require you to do a double-take in order to avoid them.






Trade System scam - In this scam, a player will trade you an amazing deal. For example, the price of an average weather machine is usually approx. ten World Locks. In this example, the trader will offer something like a hundred World Locks instead, but keep quickly changing it between one and one-hundred. While you keep pressing the ""accept"" button, they'll land on one upon pressing ""accept"", resulting in you receiving just one instead of one-hundred. To avoid this, make sure you look at the quantity of the items you are trading!
Vending Machine scam - In this scam, there will be several vending machines, usually 3-6, and it will be in a giveaway style (door gets unlocked, you rush to the item). Each machine will be separated by a locked door. If there are three vending machines, then the first two will be normally-/low-priced items that you wouldn't usually see for sale. For every e.g. ten seconds, the next door gets unlocked and the players rush to buy it. However, after the first two, the final vending machine will have it extremely high-priced, or have an item of lower value for sale for the same price as the previous machines.

For example, let's say three Moon Weather machines are for sale for very low prices. The first machine is opened, and it costs two World Locks and quickly gets bought. The second machine is opened, and it also costs two World Locks and also quickly gets bought. The third machine is opened, and it costs twenty World Locks for a Sunny Weather machine. It quickly gets bought because the numbers ""2"" and the words ""Weather machine"" are seen, but they actually got an item worth only 1-3 World Locks for twenty. The owner ends up with extra money in the end, and the buyer ends up with a drastically lowered amount in the end.


World Trade scam - In this scam, the player selling the world will have a chest full of what they claim to be a good item. For example, they may say that thirty World Locks are in the chest. They'll try and prove it to you by opening the chest. When they open the chest, it will appear that thirty World Locks are in the chest, and they will quickly close it back up. However, once the buyer buys the world, they will open the chest and find that it is actually one World Lock behind thirty Amber Glass Panels.

, If you come into a world that is a scam or you feel it's a scam, you should report it so it gets nuked (when a world gets permanently banned to the public) and/or the owner/host gets banned from Growtopia., It will then ask you if you're sure you'd like to report the world. Accept it. Upon accepting it, you have successfully sent a report to the moderators so the world can be seen later and nuked if moderators ever successfully get to the world and determine if the world is fine or if it should be nuked.

, To do this, first check which moderators are online by typing the slash command ""/mods"" to view which ones are online. If none are online, use the ""/report"" method, instead.


If there are any mods online, type in ""/msg "". Please do not send fan-mail to mods or spam mods with useless messages as this just makes their job harder.

Keep an eye on the minimap.,
Contribute to accomplishing map objectives.",How to Be a Good Teammate in Heroes of the Storm," The single most important thing you can do to be a better teammate is to learn what your job is and then stick to it.


Warriors fight on the front lines while protecting their teammates and disrupting the enemy formation.
Assassins will focus their efforts on finding the right position to kill enemy heroes as quickly, efficiently and safely as possible.
Supports will hang back, heal the wounded and generally lay down a whole host of abilities to help friendlies and cripple baddies.
Specialists focus on dealing sustained damage against enemy heroes and taking down towers, forts, and keeps as quickly as possible.;
, You will not be able to control the allies that you’ll be teamed up with in Quick Match mode, but you can react in game modes that support drafting—most notably Ranked Match mode. Obtaining and mastering at least one hero from the four types available will give you the versatility to meet the needs of your team as the need comes up. Nobody wants to pick a warrior to tank or the support to heal? No problem. Nobody is picking assassins or specialists to deal sustained damage? You have it covered.


It is recommended that you obtain at least two heroes of each type, as you cannot pick a specific hero if the enemy team has picked it first.
On the same note, make sure to run practices matches against the AI if you are using a hero you are completely unfamiliar with. While this is not as effective a learning tool as going up against human players, AI matches will help you better understand what your chosen hero can do while in battle.

, Each hero type has a general philosophy around their role in the game, like tanking damage or tossing down high-damage spells. Choosing certain talent builds, however, can drastically alter your role in a particular match. Look at the heroes that your teammates picked, communicate with them to learn what build they are going for, and pick talents to fill a role that will work with the strengths of your team while covering its weaknesses.


For example, you can build Arthas to be a hard tank that excels at negating bursts of damage, a sustain tank that can weather constant damage by regularly healing himself, a ganker that can deal a surprising amount of damage that can kill squishy heroes, or a controller that can isolate and slow down enemy heroes for your team to focus on. Each build order has its own ups and downs, and it will be up to you to decide which build to pick for your team’s lineup.
On a similar note, make sure to pick talents that can counter the strengths of enemy heroes on the other team. Do they have a ton of disables on their lineup? Pick the “Cleanse” talent to help whoever gets focused down by control abilities. Do you see Nova or Zeratul on the other team? Pick “Reveal” to help prevent their cloaked heroes from catching you unawares.

, The minimap will tell you the position of your allies, your enemies, and important map objectives. It will also display “pings” sent out by yourself or other players that serve to relay useful information, like warning of danger or signaling intent to attack a certain position. This makes it an essential tool for communicating with your teammates when you don’t have voice chat available, which is why you should keep an eye on the minimap to not only identify what the enemy is up to but also to better coordinate with your teammates.


You can send out an all-purpose ping by holding G or ALT and then left-clicking an area or object on your screen. This also works when you click on the minimap.
You can add context to your pings by dragging instead of clicking your left mouse button. This will reveal a contextual menu where you drag your cursor to one area to send a ping with an additional message. Dragging down will call for aid, dragging left will call to defend, dragging right will indicate your intent to move to an area and dragging up will send a ping warning teammates of potential danger. These work on both the minimap and on objects area on your screen.
Pressing V will send a ping telling teammates to retreat. Again, it works on both the minimap and on areas on your screen., The next thing you can do to be a better teammate in HotS is to actually pitch in when map objectives spawn. Granted soaking experience in your lane is important, but these map objectives provide huge benefits to your team, from bombarding the enemy base with rays of lights or explosive cannon shots to summoning a gigantic monster that can sweep aside the defensive structures on a lane and open the way to the enemy core. These benefits far outweigh the meager experience points you get from abandoning the fight for the objectives, so join up and help out when you can.


The only exception to this rule is when one or two heroes from the enemy team decide to stay in their own lanes and push as hard possible with mercenaries or their own innate siege capabilities. When this happens, you now have a choice: go help your teammates for an easier capture or stay in lane to defend it from the enemy hero or heroes. The former is preferred if the hero is weak at pushing lanes and does not have mercenaries aiding the push, while the latter is preferred when you have a siege-oriented specialist assisting a heavy mercenary push.
On the flipside, you could turn the tables on the enemy team by pushing hard while they’re focused solely on the objectives. This works best if you have a hero that can deal a lot of damage to mercenaries, minions and structures (i.e., Zagara, Gazlowe, Tyrande, Azmodan, etc.). This also works best when you have Bribe to capture mercenary camps in the blink of an eye (i.e., Raynor, Murky, The Lost Vikings, Azmodan, etc.). Heroes with the Mercenary Lord talent will do even better since they’ll be boosting the capabilities of mercenaries they’re escorting (i.e., Anub’arak, Sonya, Gazlowe, Azmodan, etc.) Doing so will either force the enemy to pull one or even two heroes away from the objective or risk losing forts and keeps in exchange for keeping five men on the objective."

Find a site.,
Get the correct plugins.,
Start playing games.,
Chose a few, don't play them through.,
Get into the community.",How to Appreciate Online Games," While some online games you download, many are based around a website. These may be funded by major gaming corporations like GameStop, or independent (also called ""Indy"") websites. They are virtually all free, some run on donations or give perks to those who subscribe to a premium account. The sight you chose should be updated regularly and the place you find your games.;
, So, you open a game, and it gives you something like this. It means your browser (the application you browse the internet with) isn't equipped to run the game. It might be missing Flash, Unity, or Shockwave plugins that the game was programmed in. After downloading the plugins, make sure to keep them up to date.

, Look under the genres of games. Most websites have a way to search for particular games, and how to sort categories to find new games that interest you. After you know which types of games you like (there are probably many), you can easily find thousands of games to play.

, This is where the difference between console and online games shows. In platform games, you play for hours and are intent to play the whole thing through, then never play it again. In online games, you play a few games and don't play them at length or to the end. A hardcore online gamer really only completes games in the single-digits.

, Always talk on chat rooms, and reply to messages. Talk about the games you've played. Chances are, they've played them too. Always, if possible, contribute to the community. Make memes, or even new games. There are other articles on those topics, so it'd be redundant to state them here.

Start out with a very minimal amount of Gold.,
Find clothing.At this point, you might be wondering why so many older users look better, and this is really not meant to sound nasty, everyone goes through this phase.,
Build up the gold.",How to Get Rich on Gaia Online1," This is the currency of the site, but you should be able to work your way up to having a few thousand (abbreviated as ""k"", so, for example, nine thousand would be 9k) by just finishing the ""New tank quest"", which you'll be prompted on when you first enter your aquarium.
, Don't worry though, just buy a nice inexpensive outfit, two of the cheaper stores for common clothing are Barton Boutique and Crate and Apparel., You've probably noticed that your gold count isn't very high, and to fully complete any of these following steps, you must make that count to about ten thousand, or 10K. (It will look like Gold Count: 10000) If you already are here, or maybe a little less or more, you're good. Once you are here, you're ready to continue.

Once you have your starting gold, there are two main ways to go about this. One involves real money, the other involves quick reflexes, thinking, and bargain shopping. Others exist, and can be things such as selling art if you are able to draw well.

"
"
Start making money.,
Do research.,
Sell.,
Invest longer term.,
Jump.",How to Get Rich on Gaia Online2," In case you didn't realize, this method is called ""Playing the Market"", and involves no real money. The reason for the name is because it involves the user-based Marketplace. There are several links to this all over the site-check under the shops tab. To begin, keep in mind that in order to make money you must lose money, so don't worry about spending your gold. First, find an item that's in your price range. Make sure that it is not a common shop item, such as anything found in the main clothing shops, but something found in any kind of rare event or Monthly Collectible letter., Once you've found your item, research it a little. This cannot take much time, unless you're willing to do long term investing, so keep a second page open to search. If it seems to be selling about one to two thousand more gold than what the price you are buying it at, pounce on the deal., Once you've obtained this, go right back around and sell it for the average buying price. You will have just made a small profit., Long term investing includes things that seem to slowly rise, such as Holiday Event items, lesser wanted Monthly Items, and certain rare events. This will not give you a quick profit, but it will give you an added item and the potential for a larger outcome in the end. During this do not forget you can still earn gold via games and posting, just not nearly as much. Sell the item you've invested in once you feel it has reached an acceptable price., After making your small profits in increments, you can jump to afford other items, instead of just the few worth 10K. Keep doing this until you have enough for the item or items that you desire. You may continue as long as you feel fit.

Sometimes your favorite item is worth the most, if you sell it, don't worry, if you succeed, you will most likely be able to buy multiples of it afterward.

Use the Cash Shop.,
Purchase Gaia Cash, and it will give you a link to purchase it.,
Decide on your items.,
Once you have chosen, do a little research in the Marketplace.,
Go back to the Cash Shop after doing your research, and see what you will buy.,
Evolve items.,
Sell.,
Note that every day there is a little tree at the top of the page.",How to Get Rich on Gaia Online3," This section will be about using the Cash Shop on Gaia. This is an optional store that requires real money to purchase any goods. If you do not have your own debit or credit card, ask your parents or someone you know with one, and if they say no, do not steal it. Prepaid Gaia Cash cards are sold at Target stores and (some) Rite Aids stores. If you cannot use real money, odds are this is not an option for you. To get items from the Cash Shop, you will have to save up your gold and purchase it through the Marketplace., It comes in increments of $500.00 USD. For your first purchase, the five USD minimum should be adequate. However, if you would like to purchase a Monthly Collectible, which also is a cash based item, and always has been in Gaia's history, those are $250.00 USD, and in this case should be purchased separately, bringing your total Gaia Cash purchase up to $750.00 USD. Other countries currencies will have to be converted., This will give you 5000 Gaia Cash. Decide upon your Cash Shop item. You could purchase two Monthly Collectibles, but as stated before it makes more sense as a stand-alone purchase., See what is selling well and for how much, and how often the price changes. Items in the Cash Shop do expire, but there is a warning before it happens., Make sure you have enough Cash to do so, and if you have any left over after this purchase you can save it as it does not expire, or spend it on common clothing items.

Purchase your items, or item, based on how much Gold you are intent on earning. Items called ""Evolving Items"" are very popular, and take up much of the Cash Shop. These tend to go for the most gold if you are having any issues deciding.

, Evolving Items can be quick sells, where once you purchase it you sell it for gold, or it can be a long term investment. Most Evolving Items become worth more as they age. The same goes for Monthly Collectible items, but they tend to hover around 15k. These could be saved until worth more, but it's not necessary., After deciding if you want to keep the item for value or sell it, carry it out. Sell your item in the Marketplace when it feels right for you, and you can follow this as many times as you want, or until you feel you cannot spend any more real money on Gaia. This wields a higher profit rate than Playing the Market, but it also isn't the most economical for some people., When you click it, it will show an advertisement. After a minute or so, it will give you 1 Gaia Cash. Click the tree until you reach your daily limit, then do it again the next day. You can get about 10 Gaia Cash a day, which will add up quickly."
"
Make a thread in the 'Wanted' forum.,
Take offers.,When you buy the item, sell it on the marketplace around the lowest marketplace price.,
Repeat.",How to Get Rich on Gaia Online4,"

You will want to include the amount of gold you have and the word 'Buying' in the topic title. (e.g. Buying with 150k, 150k | Buying)
In the first post, put whether they should PM you or post in the thread, as well as things you don't want to buy and things you do want to buy.

, When you get offers, take about 10k off of items under 100k, 20k off of those under 200k and so on.

Before you buy an item, make sure it sells quickly.

For example, buying an item that sells 5-6 units a day will sell very slow, however, if the item sells 50-60 units a day, it might sell before you can refresh the page.

Other events,such as seasonal events,can earn up to over 200k (200,000 Gold) and sometimes even millions. One of the best ways to earn gold on 'zOMG!' is to go for the Papa Saw quest in the Bassken Lake map. Join a full crew,and choose the level ""Hard"". Most of the time,Papa Saw regulars will be hanging out around asking for others to join or asking to join. Join them,and fight with them. With enough Fire Rain and buffs,each Papa Saw quest can earn up to at least 6k per time."
"
Since zOMG was shut down Gaia's attempt to replace it came in the form of Lake Kindred.",How to Get Rich on Gaia Online8, You take your pets and fight against other animals in unique settings. For every battle you win you'll earn at least 5k gold but the rewards go all the way up to 1 billion gold and you may also get special chance items which can sell for a lot on the market unopened but the items they produce may sometimes be worth even more. You also get gold for level up your pets and selling items used only in the game like health and damage potions can also get you a lot of gold fast so don't be afraid to spend a while playing this game to really make some gold all for free unless you choose to spend money on it
"

If you answered yes to any of these questions, it's most likely a scam.",How to Avoid Scams on Gaia Online," This goes for everything that uses a password. Gaia administrators will never contact you asking for your password, typing your password anywhere but an official Gaia Online password entry field will result in the password being accessible to unscrupulous users. Do not post it backwards, or in code either. People can figure that out.;
, This also goes for most things. For example, hooray4dolphins is weaker than hooray4dolphins2329438. Also, keep your password different from your username. And never put the word ""Password"" in your password.

, It may be long, and lacking in plot development, but it helps a lot.

, NPC's have red names, admins and developers have orange names, omnimods have green names, global mods have light blue names, dedicated mods have purple names, the people on your friends list have dark blue names, and helpers have no color in their names. Regular users lack color in their names as well.

, Is it:


Written with bad grammar?
Far fetched? (I.E. The ""Ban fish"" scam)
Too good to be true? (I.e. a chance at a mod position on your first day, 10 halos, etc.)
Sent by a user claiming to be Gaia staff?
Asking for your password?
Threatening you with a banning if you do not give your Password, or any of your gold/items.

, If you can manage to jump through before being destroyed then every member of the camp that was attacking you will be unable to follow. Remember that if you return fire or use any offensive modules suck as NOS', webs, or scramblers you will not be able to pass through either.

, It takes two to disable every scrambler used against your ship, and if there's a large group camping the gate they're almost useless. They also greatly ruin your ability to fight back, a fact you should always keep in mind.

, If this is destroyed, you stand a far better chance of escape.

, In case of Disrupting Field (Anchored Bubbles or Interdictor's Bubbles) you should always cloak and try to re-approach the gate (or get out of the bubble and warp away).

uTorrent
BitTorrent
Vuze;
, There are a variety of places you can look for torrents online, but none can be linked to here. Make sure that the torrent has positive comments, as this increases the chances that you're downloading a working copy without viruses.


Try to find a torrent that has a lot of ""seeders"". These are the people that are sharing the files, and the more you can connect to, the faster your download can go (up to your connection's limit).

, Torrent files are very small, and usually download in a couple seconds. This is because the torrent file doesn't actually contain any of the game data. Instead, it lets you connect directly to other users to download chunks of the game which are stitched together once the download is complete.


Most torrent clients will be set to automatically open .torrent files. If it doesn't open in the torrent client, select your newly-installed client from the list of programs.
You can only legally download torrents for games that you own.

Click here for detailed instructions on downloading torrent files.

, This may take a while, especially if the game is very large or there aren't many seeders. Click here for tips on speeding up your torrent downloads.

, Many torrent downloads come in RAR (.rar) format. These are archive files that need special software in order to unpack. The most popular free option for opening these files is 7-Zip.

, There are two main formats that your downloaded game will be in: EXE or ISO. The EXE format means that you can run the setup file and everything will be installed from the installer. An ISO file is an image of a physical disc, and needs to be either burned or mounted on your computer in a virtual drive.



Click here for detailed instructions on burning an ISO file to DVD.

Click here for detailed instructions on mounting an ISO file in a virtual drive.

, Most torrent games come with a text file with specific installation instructions. This is very important to read, as many games have certain tasks that need to be accomplished in the right order for the installation to work correctly. Always defer to the README file instructions over this guide.

, This will vary significantly depending on the game, but generally you'll need to either run the EXE file or mount/burn the ISO file and run the installer from the disc. You can usually run the installer like you would if you had purchased the game, but make sure you're following the instructions in the README file.

, Most games that you download have some form of copy-protection. In order to bypass this, you will need to enter a CD-key or run a crack program. Most torrents should include these with your install files, but the process will vary from game to game. Again, refer to the README file.


Some games require you to replace the main EXE file in the installed game's folder with a cracked version. You'll then run this replacement EXE file every time you want to play the game.
Some games require you to run a key generator program that will provide you with a working CD-key.
Some games have a simple EXE file that you will need to run once in order to unlock the game.
Rarely you may be asked to edit configuration files in order to play the game. You'll find the instructions in the README file.

, Use whatever method the README file dictates to start playing the game. You may have to run the game's configuration program the first time you start to set your graphics options.

Disable shadows.",How to Increase Frame Rate in Yandere Simulator," First, open your phone (not camera phone) within the game. Click the settings option, which will look similar to a gear piece.;
, The particle count is the first option, where you can select High, Low, or None. High is the worst frame rate, low is in the middle, and none is the quickest.


Particle count does not refer to the features of the character; those are called polygons.

, The outline is the second option. Simply turn it on or off. If they are on, it uses twice the polygons, meaning you get a worse frame rate.

, Anti-aliasing refers to the jaggies, or staircase effect, on pixels. The more those are decreased, the better the frame rate. This is the third option.


Post-aliasing is the fourth option, basically the same as anti-aliasing. Turn it off for a better frame rate.

, Bloom is the fifth option. It is basically the lighting of the game; if you disable it, it will not delete all light, so it's worth trying if you want to maximize your frame rate.

, It is the sixth option. This makes the students' whole body (except the hair) change color based on their gender. The fewer the meters selected, the better frame rate.


This removes most details students have, so the game has to load fewer polygons.

, This is the seventh option. You can change the draw distance drastically, going as low as 10 meters. The maximum is 350 meters. The fewer the meters, the better the frame rate.


This might look quite ugly, so enable fog to make it look more appealing to the eye.

, Shadows add extra polygons; similar to the outline, these involve double the polygons.

Install the base game (Age of Mythology) first.,
Insert the Titans CD.,
Choose the destination folder for the game.,
Input your CD key when prompted.,
Complete the installation process.,
Try to run the game.",How to Install Age of Mythology: The Titans1," This is crucial. Titans is an ""expansion pack"" to the game Age of Mythology. Without Age of Mythology installed, Titans can't be played.


If you don't have the Age of Mythology disc, you have a few options. The easiest is probably to buy and download the ""Extended Edition"" (which includes the base game and the expansion pack) online via Steam. See the section below for help with this. You can also try ordering the disc on online retailers like Amazon, etc. However, since the game is over a decade old, availability may be limited.;
, An autorun window should automatically pop up. Click on the ""Next"" button.


If you do not have Autorun turned on or you are using a newer computer, this may not load automatically. In this case, you can try manually running the setup.exe found on the CD. You'll need to browse the CD files with Windows Explorer or your computer's equivalent program.

, This is where the game will be installed on your computer's hard drive. Ideally, this should be in the same directory where the original game was installed.


The default option is almost always the easiest, best choice. Only pick a different folder if you know what you're doing.

, Like many games from its era, Titans can require a CD key to validate your copy. This is displayed on the jewel case and/or the original packaging. It is a 25-digit code made of letters and numbers and separated by hyphens, like this: XXXXX - XXXXX - XXXXX - XXXXX - XXXXX.


If you don't have the CD key for your copy of the game, all is not lost. It isn't hard to find so-called ""public"" CD keys with a simple search in your preferred search engine. This isn't strictly legal, so we won't link to any here, but the game is so old that there is very little interest for the sellers to police this unauthorized usage.
Only one copy of each game registered to the same CD key can play online at once.

, Follow the rest of the prompts. Agree to the license agreement. The game will begin to install. It should finish within a few minutes.


If you are asked whether you would like to give the installation program permission to modify your computer, select ""Yes.""

, Once the installation process is complete, you should be able to run the game from your list of programs or the desktop shortcut. You may need to keep the CD in the drive to do this.


Getting older games to run on modern computers can sometimes be quite difficult. If Titans does not run, see ""Getting AoM:tT to Work on New Computers"" below.

If you don't have a Steam account, get one.,

Pay for the game.,
Let the game download and install.",How to Install Age of Mythology: The Titans2," Steam is an online gaming service and digital store operated by Valve corporation. It's free to sign up for and install and it works on nearly all modern computers. The prices for games on Steam are usually comparable to (or cheaper than) retail prices. This makes it an especially convenient way to find older, more obscure games like Titans.


You can get Steam here. Click the ""Install Steam"" link in the top right to start.Be sure to select ""Mac"" or ""Linux"" on the next page if you are using either of these systems.

, As of April 2015, Steam offers Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, which is essentially an ""updated"" version of the game released in 2014. Extended Edition contains both the original game and the expansion pack, making this a nice option if you don't have either.Extended Edition also has new features not included in the original Titans release. These include improved graphics, streaming integration, and new game modes.
Note that this version of the game is only offered for Windows.

, On the Steam Store page for Extended Edition (available here), click ""Add to Cart."" On the next page, click ""Purchase for myself."" Supply your credit card details and billing information. When you're finished, select ""Purchase."" Your card will be charged and the game will be added to your Steam account.

, If you click the ""Library"" option at the top of the Steam window, you'll see your list of games, which should now include AoM. When the download process is complete, double click the game to start the installation. Follow the prompts.

When it's finished installing, select Extended Edition from the list and click ""Play."" The game should open and run.

Understand the risks of anonymous online downloads.,
Install a disc image utility before you begin.,
Find a reputable download location.,
Download the game.,
Extract the game files.,
Mount the game image.,
Run the installation as normal.",How to Install Age of Mythology: The Titans3," Titans is over a decade old, so it's not hard to locate free downloads of the game online. However, before committing to this method, it's important to understand the two main risks:


First, downloading free copies of a game that was once sold for a profit is a murky, semi-illegal practice. Since the game is no longer being manufactured or sold by the publisher (outside of the new Extended Edition version), prosecution is unlikely, but it's still possible.
Second, it's difficult to know whether game downloads from anonymous sources are ""clean"" (free of viruses or malware)., If, after understanding the risks, you still want to proceed, there's a good chance you'll need something called a disc image utility. The purpose of this program is essentially to ""trick"" your computer into thinking that a disc is in its drive when there actually is not one.


There are a variety of good, free disc image utilities available online — this isn't the part of the process where you have to worry about viruses. One particularly popular option is PowerISO, available here., Now, you want to find a download of the game online that is unlikely to provide a ""tainted"" copy of the game. Again, since the legality of doing this is ambiguous, we won't provide any links. However, there are some general tips you can use to make your chances much better:


Download from a site with a ""Comments"" or ""Reviews"" section that appears legitimate. If the reviews are all positive, you're in the clear. If they complain of malware or other problems, stay away.
Be aware that many download sites have fake downloads for unrelated files or malware before the link to the actual download. You may need to click a button that says ""Proceed to download"" or something similar, even if the first page you see has a download link.
Don't download and run executable files, which have the .exe extension. These types of files can modify your computer (sometimes even if you have antivirus protection). This makes them a preferred format for malicious virus-spreaders. Try to find a compressed .zip file instead.

, Select a location for the .zip file and begin the download. This can be anywhere — it doesn't have to be in the original game's directory.

, If you downloaded a .zip version of the game as recommended, you'll need an extraction program to ""unpack"" the compressed files. Extract the files to the original game's directory.


There are a variety of programs that can unzip compressed files. Winzip is perhaps the most well-known extraction program and, despite its name, it's available for Mac and mobile.7-zip is a great free alternative., Many copies of Titans that you download will require the disc image utility (PowerISO, etc.) that you installed earlier. If you're working with PowerISO, use the following steps — other programs should be similar:Open PowerISO.
Right click on the PowerISO button in the taskbar.
Select ""Mount image to drive (letter)."" This is usually the top option.
Open the rom file in the game folder. There will usually be a readme text document in the folder that tells you exactly which file you need to open.

, At this point, the game should run and you'll be able to install it just like you would if you were using a CD. Follow the prompts to complete the process.


If your downloaded version of the game doesn't require a disc image utility, you may simply need to run the setup file in the extracted folder. Be careful here — this is usually an .exe file, which can modify your computer. You will probably want to have your antivirus software running, though even this isn't guaranteed to protect completely against viruses.

Try the Steam version.,
If you're on Windows 7, try running the game in compatibility mode.,
Use the compatibility troubleshooter on Windows 8.,
If you're on Mac, try using Boot Camp.",How to Install Age of Mythology: The Titans4," The easiest way to get Age of Mythology to work on stubborn new computers is to simply buy the Extended Edition off of Steam. This version of the game was released in 2014 and is specifically meant to update the game for modern computers. Though this requires a purchase, the price tag may be worth avoiding future headaches.

, This feature of Windows 7 is designed to make it easy to run programs designed for older computers. It doesn't always work, but it's certainly worth trying. Use the following steps:Click Start, then open the Control Panel.
Open ""Troubleshooting"" (you can type this in the search bar to find it faster).
Under ""Programs,"" click ""Run programs made for older versions of Windows.""
Follow the prompts. You may need to use the troubleshooter to open the game's setup.exe file.

, This is the same tool that's available on Windows 8, but it's accessed in a different way:Swipe in from the right side of the screen. If you're using a mouse, move the cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen, then move it up.
Click ""Search."" Type ""run programs"" in the search box.
Click ""Run programs made for previous versions of Windows,"" then click ""Next.""
Follow the prompts. You'll either need to select the program from the list or (more likely) click ""Not listed"" and locate it on your own.

, Getting Titan to work on Macs can be extra hard because it wasn't design for Mac use in the first place. Your best bet is probably to use a program called Boot Camp, which allows you to install Windows on your Mac computer.


See WikiHow's own How to Use Boot Camp or the Apple support page for Boot Camp for step-by-step directions.

Farm the World Bosses for gold.",How to Hunt World Bosses in Aura Kingdom," World Bosses spawn at a certain time and date in the same location in the world. Gather up your friends or even guild-mates to do a World Boss hunt with you. Being in a party increases your chance of gaining loot.;
, As mentioned, many players will be taking part in this event which can lead to extreme lag especially if you have low-edge computer specs. To avoid lag and make other players (aside from your party members) disappear from your screen, simply click the “Hide All Players” button found at the upper right corner of your screen—the button with the person icon next to your mini-map.


“Hide All Players” is also useful when going inside Navea, the main city of Aura Kingdom where players gather to sell their equipment by putting up their own stalls.
Since all players in every channel ported to one channel for Navea, it's expected to be crowded and your game might lag. This place is considered as the marketplace of the server.
“Hide All Players” doesn't affect your party members, and that means during PVP, you can't see your enemies as well, so be sure to switch this off if you're about to join the battlefield.

, World Bosses also spawn in all other channels. Evidently, players travel through different channels to hit as many World Bosses as they can instead of killing one boss in the channel they originally play in. Usually players start in channel 1, then switch to channel 2 after killing a World Boss.


If you have a stronger computer, your chances of reaching the next channel before the other players is improved.
If you have a low-edge computer, you can always hit a World Boss once, and then switch channels before the boss is even killed.
Logging off or switching to another channel will move you to a countdown to 10 before your character gets completely disconnected and transferred.
After inflicting damage to a World Boss, you can start the countdown while other players are killing off the monster. Before you get completely disconnected, the boss is dead, and you retrieve your own share. Do this in the other channels until you get the item you desire.

, You first encounter Mac, a World Boss, during your newbie quest. He's the pirate who fell in love with the mayor's daughter, and halted his attack because of it. He spawns at the location behind the portal.


To get through, you need to walk from the fence. Be careful not to go inside the portal for it will take you to a different place.
Mac is located at Helonia Coast on Tuesdays at (x:468,y:652).
The most notable monster drops are the face accessories such as Trendy Sunnies and Glamorous Shades.

, Panther Banksy is found at Candeo March on Fridays at (x:675,y:628). He’s quite easy to kill, but since his spawn spot is right on top of a cliff rock, players in every channel gather up in that one place.


Even if you have other players hidden, the lag will still be notable. To avoid this, keep the graphic settings of your computer low and other apps closed.
Panther Banksy drops Mouth which is why many players in Aura Kingdom hunt him down.
Other dropped items are Quicksilver Tiger, Fire Brand Tiger, and Thunderbolt Tiger.

, Daphne can be found at Triatio Highlands at (x:466,y:308). This female ninja wields fire property and has over 20 million hit points. However, because of the great number of participants, Daphne is easily killed.


Only a few people wish to hunt for Daphne because of the small number of her dropped items.
Daphne may drop Swallowtail Kunai and Ninja Kunai, an orange face accessory.

, Mordecai, also known as Hermit, is one of the more difficult bosses to take down for he possesses huge damage. He can hit more than 6.8k and holds over 20 million health points.


Mordecai, a neutral type of boss but with range attack, can be found at Crescent Hill at (x:523,y:797).
He can drop face accessories, namely White Rose and Red Rose.

, During your World Boss hunting, obtaining unwanted loot, such as face accessories with a three-day expiration or a double of what you already have, is unavoidable. Instead of throwing those away or using them, you can auction them off. There are players willing to buy accessories as long as the price isn't too steep.

, You can actually join the World Boss event just to earn gold. Face accessories range up to more than 100g if sold at the auction hall. With the added bonus, especially the orange face accessories with +1 all stats, such items can be highly in demand and can be traded for high-level crafted weapons.

Know your surroundings.,
Prepare to fire.,
Shoot.,
Reload after a direct hit/miss.",How to Improve as Line Infantry in Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars2," Many modern shooters spawn players in enclosed environments. Mount and Blade is different since it always spawns players on the opposite sides of the map. Nonetheless, the maps are extremely enormous and the terrain of the map is sometimes randomized. This brings a new experience and knowledge of your surroundings is important to survey the land before you, potentially discovering enemy locations.

, Once the enemy is spotted, the player must decide to shoot or not. This concept may be very obvious, however 18th century muskets could only fire a round once and it requires approximately ten seconds to reload before firing the next round. To ensure the player is ready to fire by holding the LMB, the player must stand still and aim for the enemy. Otherwise, moving will give an accuracy penalty and the player will surely miss the target.

, You must adjust his crosshairs accordingly, depending on the range of the enemy. Longer ranges may require the crosshairs to be aimed above the body of the enemy. The enemy are easily spotted if they don't have the ""circle flags"" above their heads. If the enemy is closer aim for the torso since it is the largest part of the body and will kill the enemy instantly if hit. Remember to lead your shots for longer ranges., Unfortunately, muskets are extremely inaccurate and even experts of the game miss their targets frequently with a hit/miss ratio of .33. Whether if luck or skill is on your side or not, quickly reload and repeat the three previous steps again by left clicking after shooting.  If the enemy is charging the player then the player must stop reloading and the player must always fight the enemy in close-quarters combat if the enemies are too close.

When the musket's rounds disappears, melee mode is selected. Click the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to attack and click the right Mouse Button (RMB) to block.

, The player must decide to stab the upper or lower torso of the enemy. To stab upward, move the mouse forward and left click simultaneously. and to stab downward, move the mouse backwards and left click simultaneously.

, Similar to the mechanics of attacking, right click and move the mouse forward to block the upward, right click and move the mouse backwards to block the downward stab and right click and move the mouse left/ right to block the corresponding side.

, Without much practice, a player may have trouble against players and enemy AI. Around twenty minutes of playtime could help significantly in melee combat.

Use buffs/boosts to your advantage.",How to Improve as Line Infantry in Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars4," In many historical battles, if either side has the higher ground such as fortified hills, mountains, etc. The side that has control over that particular area will have a better chance of winning. In this game, sometimes hills require at least two minutes to run to the peak of the hill. The sides of the hills could help any player undetectable from the other sides of the mountain.

, After selecting the first tab labeled “Infantry” the menu below shows several “ranks”. One of them gives other allied players buffs such as an “officer” rank gives an accuracy bonus, etc. Basically if you’re something other than ranker you give speed, melee, accuracy and reloading boosts. The types of ranks are very beneficial and may increase the chances of winning."

Understand the runes.,
Go to sleep.,
Head for the small islet near Hounds Pit.,
Buy from Piero.,
Find the ruins.,
Talk to Havelock.,
Go down the sewers.,
Duel with Lord Shaw.,
Spare Lady Boyle.,
Find Emily.",How to Find All the Runes at the Hound Pits in Dishonored," These runes can be found as early as the first time you visit the Hound Pits or right after your escape from prison (between the missions “Dishonored” and “High Overseer Campbell”).;
, The first rune is automatically given by the Outsider during his first meeting with Corvo.

, As soon as you wake up from the Outsider’s call, go outside and take out the heart (received from the Outsider). Head north toward Samuel’s boat and dive into the water. Head east until you hit the wall, then head northeast to a small islet. Climb to the top and pick up the second rune.


Be careful while you’re in the water, there are fish there that damage you. You can kill them by hitting them with a sword.

, The third rune can be purchased from Piero for 500 gold.

, You can find these two runes between the missions “High Overseer Campbell” and “House of Pleasure.”

, As soon as you wake up, head down to the pub, then outside. You’ll be told that Havelock wants to speak to you. Talk to Havelock, and he will inform you about some strange sound in the sewers. You will receive the sewer key from him.


To find Havelock, head outside, then east until you reach the small staircase. Climb up the stairs and turn to your left. You’ll see Havelock along with Lord Pendelton.

, Once you receive the key from Havelock, you’ll be able to unlock the sewer. Open and go down the small square manhole near Havelock, head northeast toward the first corner, and keep going until you see two Weepers.


Kill the Weepers or knock them out with sleep darts.
The first rune is inside the overturned cabinet in front of the female Weeper.
The second rune is underwater, behind the iron bars.

, Before you leave for Lady Boyle’s party, during the quest “Lady Boyle’s Last Party,” accept the side quest offered by Lord Pendelton. You’ll be asked to find a masked man called Lord Shaw and duel with him. Speak again with Lord Pendleton after the duel, and he’ll reward you with a rune.


Lord Shaw is in the courtyard of Lady Boyle’s mansion; he’s the one wearing a wolf mask. Speak to him to participate in a gun duel.
Stand on the designated marker and he will begin to do a countdown; quickly turn around and shoot him once the countdown ends.
Even if you mess up, Lord Shaw can’t kill you in one hit, but he dies when shot once.
Alternatively, if you’re doing a non-lethal approach to the game, you can use a sleep dart on Lord Shaw.

, Finish the mission “Lady Boyle’s Last Party” using the non-lethal approach, that is, without assassinating Lady Boyle.


The non-lethal approach will only be available after talking to Lord Brisby; he will be at the Main Hall of the Boyle’s estate, and he will provide you with the alternate solution of kidnapping Lady Boyle as well as which Lady Boyle you need to kidnap.
Go to Corvo’s room at the Hound Pits after you’ve successfully kidnapped Lady Boyle and you’ll receive a letter from one of the other Boyles thanking you. You’ll receive a rune attached to the letter.

, After finishing the mission “Lady Boyle’s Last Party,” you can acquire another rune by finding Emily for Callista (the lady that’s taking care of Emily).


Go to the pub and talk to Callista. She will ask you to find Emily.
Emily will hide in random places, but noteworthy areas are Corvo’s room and the side and the base of the tower she stays in (same tower as Piero’s workshop).
You can use the skill Dark Vision to help find Emily.
Receive the rune from Emily after you find her.

, To trick the guards at night, you'll need to make it look like you are in bed when, in reality, you really aren't. A Bed Dummy can be crafted with two pillows and a bed sheet in the crafting menu; press 9 on PC, or UP on PS4, XB1 to open it., Duct tape is arguably the most useful item in the game and can be used to craft lots of useful items. Rolls of duct tape and magazines can be found by searching inmates' desks, buying off inmates, or looting downed inmates., A poster can be crafted with a magazine and a roll of duct tape. You'll need the poster for later., You don't want to accrue any extra Guard Heat, because you're already planning the escape., Using your 4 forks, chip away at the wall until it breaks and drops a wall block. Keep the wall block in your inventory.

, Flush it down another inmates toilet., A wad of putty is used to craft a Key Mold from an unconscious guard, and molten plastic is used to make a Plastic Key. The crafting recipes are:

Talcum Powder + Toothpaste (Wad of Putty)

All 3 can be found by looting, stealing from desks, or buying., Your intellect determines what you can and can't craft. To craft plastic keys, your intellect has to be 80.

Now, unless circumstances forbid, you have an unlimited supply of metal. Put the poster concealing the corridor back as well., These smuggle contraband past the metal detectors. You need a roll of duct tape and foil. Foil can be found by looting inmates, stealing from desks, or buying off inmates. However, Contraband Pouches only last for 5 times before they break., Having the third and maximum tier of tools will expedite your escape immensely. This is why you chip into the Metal Shop!

Multitool (Sturdy Shovel + Sturdy Pickaxe)

Stay alert when moving around the ship.,
Learn to recognize hazardous areas and treat them with care.,
Keep your inventory well stocked.,
Know how to kill your enemies and deal with hazards.,
Aim your weapon when entering doorways and rounding corners.,
Walk, don't run.,
Use light wisely.,
Turn your volume up on your television.,
Alter the game settings.,
Save often.",How to Get Around Safely in Dead Space," Nothing will get you killed quicker than becoming complacent and unaware. Whether it's a necromorph coming through a vent or a hazard you're about to walk into, you have got to be aware of your environment and surroundings. Look around whenever you're moving and be on the lookout for suspicious activity like dead bodies, because they can sometimes just be necromorphs acting dead.;
, Look for open vents or fans on the wall, holes in the ground or ship and terrain features such as gravity panels or open engines; all of these areas can be dangerous and potentially harbor necromorphs. Moving slowly around them and staying alert will decrease the risk of being taken by surprise.

, Your inventory should always have a supply of ammunition, health packs, stasis rechargers and oxygen cans so that you can deal with every situation you come across. The time you run out is usually the time you will need it most, so make your way to a store to refill your inventory or try salvaging some supplies from crates or shelves nearby.

, Note how to deal with each type of necromorph and what damages them - this will help you stay safer and kill them faster. When you come to a hazard, using stasis is invaluable, although there may be other methods of dealing with it. Learn from your encounters as they will help you survive later on.

, You will never know when a necromorph will be standing behind an elevator door or next to a corner, so being ready with your gun aimed will prepare you. Aim your gun slightly lowered towards the ground to maximize damage, as some necromorphs are smaller than others.

, When you sprint in the game, quite often you'll only be running into a crowd of necromorphs or another bad situation. Running has its merits when escaping attacks or if you need to hurry, but generally, walking through the ship will allow you more time to react.

, Some parts of the USG Ishimura are dark and unlit, so you will need to rely on your wits and senses to survive. Aim your gun when in dark areas, so the aiming light will brighten the shadowed areas or use kinesis to carry the torches found in some areas from place to place, lighting your path. Avoid dark areas if you can, but if you use your equipment wisely, you'll be able to make it through.

, Although it may be scarier, turning the volume up on your television will allow you to hear enemies coming behind you or distant dangers easier than if you have your volume turned down.

, You are given the opportunity to change the game brightness and settings when you start the game, so consider enhancing the brightness of the game so it's easier to see and lowering the game music to better hear dangers and necromorphs. This may change your game experience, but you will be safer.

, Sometimes, even with the most alert eyes and the heaviest weapon, things can go wrong. If all else fails, you can always revert to a previous save, so save often. Save whenever you come across one or complete an objective or make a large purchase in the store or clear another room of necromorphs. It'll save you having to retry everything all over again.

Identify the game you are playing.,

Find and note down the cheat that you want to use.

,
Follow the instructions given on the website to use the cheat while playing the game.",How to Find Video Game Cheats Online," Is it a PC, or is it one of the console units (such as Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, or Sony's PlayStation 2/3/4)? Make a mental note of your gaming platform as sometimes the codes are different across platforms, even if they're for the exact same game.;
, It helps to be as specific as possible. For example, are you playing ""Zelda,"" or is it actually ""Zelda: Majora's Mask?"" Make a note of the specific game you are playing. This is especially true if the game you are playing is part of a series. Just searching for ""guitar hero cheats"" may not get you to where you want.

, Type in the name of your game, the gaming platform, and the word ""cheats."" For example, if you are playing ""Halo 2"" on Xbox, type in Halo 2 Xbox cheats. If you want to go one step further, you could also search directly into a cheat website such as gamesradar.com.


For games that are available on more than one console, include the console in your search criteria.

, Choose a site that offers cheat codes for your game and platform. More often then not, one should jump out at you immediately. If it doesn't, there's a chance that there are just no cheats available for your game.

,, If you're really struggling, try looking for some sort of cheat menu, perhaps within the main menu or settings of the game.

Open the radial menu.,
Select the crafting type.,
Check the menu for options.,
Select the item you want to make and activate it.",How to Craft in Dragon Age," Use LT for Xbox360, L2 for PS3, and the Esc key on a PC;
, Dragon Age lets you hone three types of crafting skills: trap-making to help lure and ensnare unsuspecting enemies, herbalism for potions and salves, and poison-making for bombs and poisons that can be used to coat your weapon.


When you select the crafting type, you will need to have the party member with the particular ability active when you do this. For example, Leliana knows basic poison-making when she joins your party, so you can have her craft poisons for Barlin in Lothering.
The skull icon at the bottom left is for Poisons and Traps.

Select the skull and crossbones icon to make poisons.
Select the leg trap icon to make traps.


The leather pouch on the left is for Potions. Select the green leaf icon to open your potion options.

, It will list options with the different poisons, traps, and potions you can make for the active party member.


Each craft requires that you have the recipe or plans to make the desired product. For example, when you talk to Elder Miriam in Lothering, she will give you the recipe to make the Lesser Health Poultice. Usually you will have to buy a recipe or plan, but some of them can be found in your travels.
When you open the crafting skill menu, it will show you what recipes and plans you have already acquired, and if you have the necessary ingredients to make a particular item. Some crafting items also require a certain skill level, so even if you have the ingredients and basic skill you may not always be able to craft what you want. Keep this in mind as you level up your skills.
Herbalism requires a recipe and the ingredients (at least two). You can see on the menu what Restoratives and Enhancing potions and salves you can make, including dog treats. Except for dog biscuits, you will almost always need a Flask to make items, so make sure to stock up on them with nearly any merchant you encounter.
Poisons require a recipe and the ingredients (at least two). Like Herbalism, you will almost always need a flask to make these lethal items.
Traps require plans and several different elements to create them.

, You will know if it’s successful by the pinwheel that appears on the page and the chime-like music. Items are automatically deposited into your Inventory.


Lothering is a great place to start learning how to craft as it basically has quests that require you to use each of the three crafting skills. You won’t need to learn Poisons because Leliana already knows how to make them; just make sure you let her join your party. Morrigan already knows Herbalism, so as long as she is in the party in Lothering you can complete that quest.
Traps are the only crafting skill that no one knows at this point in the game. When you level up in Ostagar, either you or Alistair can learn it to complete all three quests in Lothering.

Elder Miriam gives you a quest that requires Herbalism. She will send you out to get the supplies, but you will need to purchase the flasks either from the scrupulous merchant near the Chantry or Barlin in the tavern.
Barlin gives you a quest that requires Poison crafting skills. He will expect you to either have or purchase the necessary supplies to make them.
Allison gives you a quest that requires Trap-Making skills. You will need to get your own supplies.
All three quests mentioned above require you to make three of the most basic items for that skill, so it is not too difficult to collect or purchase what you need.

Free Roam is a mode that allows you to tour the city and cause trouble without the pressure and distraction of being on a race.


Using the Right and Left Arrow keys to scroll and Enter to select, choose “Career” on the game’s Main menu.
On the Career menu, press Enter to choose “Resume Career.” This is the first option on the menu.
On the next menu, scroll rightwards and select the second option, “Free Roam.” You will immediately be taken to the streets of the game’s fictional city, Palmont.;
, To do this, keep committing traffic violations like driving on the wrong side of the road, crashing into property, and colliding with other cars (use the Up Arrow key to accelerate, Down Arrow key to brake/reverse, Left Arrow key to steer left, and Right Arrow key to steer right). Before long, the cops will start giving chase.


You will know a pursuit is underway when a bar (called the Pursuit Bar) appears in the top right-hand corner of the screen. The Pursuit Bar is marked “Busted” on one end and “Evade” on the other.

, This means that you have to try not to get caught and also try not to get away too soon. Some tips on how to do this are:


Every time the bar fills up towards the end marked “Evade,” slow down and let the cops catch up with you.
Every time the bar fills up towards the end marked “Busted,” speed up and get away from the cops in your immediate vicinity.

, Some of the violations you can commit are:


Ramming police vehicles.
Ramming other civilian cars.
Overspeeding.
Driving in the oncoming lane.
Knocking down signposts and billboards by driving on the curb.

, No matter how good you are at causing trouble with the police, you must get away from them at the end in order to register the points you have accumulated during the pursuit.


When you have had enough of the pursuit, speed away from the police. Use all the tools available to you for this:

Press the Right Shift key while accelerating (Up Arrow key) to activate Nitrous. This will give your an instantaneous speed boost.
Turn sharply at intersections to increase the distance between you and the cops.
Drive in incoming lanes as the cops will be reluctant to follow you there.


Do not stay in one area of the city for too long as this allows the cops time to call for backup.
Keep ramming civilian cars, forcing the cops to stop and help them.
When you start losing the cops, the pursuit bar will start filling up steadily towards the “Evade” end. Keep moving away from them.
The Pursuit bar will soon be replaced by a blue bar called the CoolDown Bar. Once the CoolDown Bar empties, you will have successfully completed the pursuit and the points you have garnered will register.

You can also lose cops by finding secluded areas of the city, e.g., behind buildings to lay low till the cops leave you alone.
The game uses a Pursuit Bar similar to the one in NFS: Carbon. After a while, the Pursuit Bar will be replaced by a CoolDown Bar and the pursuit will end once the CoolDown Bar empties. The points accumulated during the pursuit will then be added to your total.

Start off by world-locking a world.,
Build an outline for the world using a block of your choice.,
Add in the things that make it a parkour.,
Make the ""prize barrier"".,
Make the prize section.,
Let the public come to your world!",How to Earn a Lot of Growtokens on Growtopia1," One of the most common ways of getting Growtokens is by making a mini-game world. Mini-game worlds are exactly what they sound like: a world full of mini-games, usually short park hours.
, Try to use good-looking blocks. Don't use materials like Dirt, as it makes the world look ""nooby"" and will repel players along with lowering the given rating. Even normal Wood Blocks are good, but the most common material used in these types of worlds are the colored blocks (Black Block, Red Block, Blue Block, etc.). Don't forget to add doors at the end of each mini-game with an ID you can remember., Add items like Spikes, Lava, and other items that harm the player. A good idea is adding a Checkpoint at the start of each mini-game so players don't get annoyed by having to continuously respawn and go back to the mini-game they're playing., Make sure the barrier isn't impossible to get through. Some common barriers include:

A ""water fall"" where you have to fall down a large strip of water while dodging objects such as Spikes, Sharks, etc.
A ""dirt run"", a long area made of dirt you have to run through before you reach the prize. This adds time to the Grow token timer. Try not to make it too long, otherwise players might get bored and leave.
A ""password door"" area is another option. Don't make it an impossible answer; do something simple like 1-10, or ask easy questions like ""What's the owner's name?""

, Link the door ID from the end of the prize barrier to a door that leads into a ""hallway"" where players can jump up and select their prize. Make the prizes worth what they spent their time on; don't have a bunch of cargo shorts in the prize area if you have a 10+-minute dirt run., A broadcast can help. By the end of the day, you might just have a Growtoken, or possibly many!"

Figure out where you want to host a giveaway.,
Choose the item(s) you want to give away.,
Place an open-and-close item (such as a Portcullis) at the starting point.,
Drop the item you're giving away.,
Broadcast.,
Start a countdown once you have enough people.,
Once the giveaway is over, don't tell everyone to leave.",How to Earn a Lot of Growtokens on Growtopia2," Players love giveaways, especially when the items being given away are high in value. To host a giveaway, you don't even have to create a new world; you can host it in an already-existing world, such as your farm. Just make sure you block off anything you don't want other players getting into., A good choice is World Locks. If you're going to do this, make sure you stock up on a lot of them, as people will be asking for more giveaways., This is so players can't run and get the item before the giveaway begins. Make sure it's closed to public., If you're giving away multiple items, keep them in your inventory and host many ""rounds"" rather than giving everything away on one ""round"" all at once., Super-broadcasts are better than normal broadcasts (a super-broadcast goes to everyone in Growtopia, while a normal broadcast goes to 100 players). You can also use a custom broadcast, which allows you to choose how many players you'd like it to go to., Keep it under 30 seconds; otherwise people will think you're a Growtoken scammer. Once you reach 0, unlock the door to the public. Once the item is obtained, use the /kickall slash command or separately kick the players until everyone is back at the White Door.

If you have more items to give away, lock the door before you kick the players. After everyone is back at the starting point, repeat this step.

, Let them linger on until the giveaway is over for extra Growtoken time."

Release your world to the public!",How to Earn a Lot of Growtokens on Growtopia3," A Game World is a world that uses a game generator. If you do well, Game Worlds can certainly scrape in a lot of Growtokens., Create an area for each team. The minimum amount of teams you can have is two, while the maximum amount is four. Team areas are often defined by using color blocks that match the team color (e.g. Red Rabbits bases are made of Red Blocks, Blue Bombers bases are made of Blue Blocks, etc.), Go into their settings (using your wrench) and change them so they are set up for their team base., You might need friends to help test out your options if you have no experience with programming game generators., Broadcast it if you'd like to."

Consider going alternative.,
Pick a game to focus your world on.,
Make the outline based on what kind of game you chose.,
Add any extra items if the game needs it.,Place the prize that is being given away in a safely-secured area so you can give it to the winner once they win.,
Broadcast your world.,
Award your prize.",How to Earn a Lot of Growtokens on Growtopia4," Alternative games are worlds that have games in them that are too long to be considered a mini-game but don't use a game generator. The three most common games that belong in this category include:

Fashion Show
Spleef
Dice Game

, You can also put many games into one world., Try to use good-looking blocks as you would for the mini-game world method., For example, if you're making a Dice Game world, add the dice.,, Once you have enough people, begin the game!, Once there is only one final player, give them the prize. You can also choose the host another game so players remain in your world."

Know how to get your items faster.,
Know when to drop out of a group.,
Pay close attention to the cc rating in the course.,
Vote for your courses carefully.,
Know where to place your items.,
Choose the right vehicle, wheels and glider.",How to Dominate Mario Kart Online Racing," In Mario Kart, normally, when you hit an item block, you don't get your items instantly. The items spin like a slot machine, and after it stops, you get your item. This often takes a long time, and can cause frustration. However, you can speed up the slot wheel by repeatedly pressing the item button while the item wheel is spinning. If you do so, You'll get your item in just two seconds, which can be a lifesaver. For example, if you're about to get hit by a red shell, you can get an item box and rush the item, and you can use your banana, shell, horn or leaf to block the red shell.;
, In online racing, quitting a group at the right time can save you, especially in Mario Kart 7 where your VR will give you a special unlock. Generally, there are two things that indicate that you should quit. If the people you're racing with are out of your league in either direction, quit because racing with beginners doesn't give you many VR points, while racing with experts will have you coming last in every race, and you'll lose your rating. If the players are too easy, feel free to keep playing, but it will take a long time to increase your VR. Also, you will risk losing more points from coming 12th-10th (8th and 7th in MK7). Furthermore, if your opponents are frequently choosing highly unskilled courses like Toad Circuit, N64 Luigi Circuit or Mario Kart Stadium, quit. Courses like Toad Circuit, N64 Luigi Circuit and Mario Kart Stadium are dependent on luck mostly, so getting a nice ranking won't happen every time.

, When racing online, ever see the words 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc? In Mario Kart, this number indicates how fast your vehicle runs, with 50cc being the slowest. Although you'd think that this doesn't really matter, it does. When your vehicle is in 50cc, certain stunts in many of the courses don't work. Making jumps over off-road terrain becomes harder, and using mushrooms over terrain or voids becomes more difficult too. Additionally, the cc measurement affects how you jostle with other vehicles, which can make or break you. Generally, in modern games such as MK7 and MK8, you will race in either 100cc or 150cc.

, In online racing and especially in clan wars or tournaments, picking the right courses will give you the upper hand. In Mario Kart, each course has some reasoning behind it. There are a few types of courses out there, which will soon be explained. Also take note that in Mario Kart 8, you will be given a strict choice of 3 predetermined courses, and the selection of the random courses. The random courses will pick a random course, whether it is one of the preset 3 or not.


Front running Courses: These courses are most favored by pros. In this type of course, the route is generally tricky or long with little to no shortcuts, making it easy to get in first place and stay there. Some examples include (3DS) Piranha Plant Pipeway/Slide, Bowser's Castle, and Mount Wario. Take note though, that some courses are front running only in certain Cubic Centimeters. For example, Wii Mushroom Gorge is only a front running course in 50 or 100cc because the gap jump can be used in the other Cubic Centimeters.
Luck Courses: These courses are generally frowned upon by pros. As their name suggests, these courses mostly rely on item luck. Additionally, these courses usually have simple and short lines, making it easy for a beginner to stay near a pro. Courses include N64 Luigi Circuit, Toad Circuit, and Mario Kart Stadium.

, When you get a banana, don't just throw it away the next second. Utilize it. In Mario Kart, the best place to put bananas is probably beside item boxes and on sharp turns, and places such as the Wiggler area in Wii Maple Treeway and the Yoshi Egg area in N64 Yoshi Valley. If you place it right, the banana will block your item, and opponents will drive into it, slowing them down. As said before, if there are no item boxes around, place them on dash panels, ramps, glider panels, blind corners, sharp corners, likely landing places from gliding or in front of a drafting opponent where it's hard to avoid them. Placing these items in the right place can be helpful because it slows down people who are trailing behind you wanting to get ahead of you, and it also creates a gap between you and the rest of the competition.


If you place items in these areas, there is still a chance that all the opponents will miss them. Be careful not to hit them yourself on the next lap if this happens.

, In online racing, this is another one of the most important tips of all time. If you are just beginning to race, consider vehicles that have nice weight, acceleration, and off road characteristics while off-setting drift, mini turbo, and speed. Doing these things will give you a beginner advantage, so you'll be prepared if something bad happens. However, if you're an expert and have had a long playing history, go ahead and choose the best of the best, which have the best speed, drift, and mini turbo while not considering anything else. This way, you can maximize your racing capabilities provided you don't fall off the track or hit terrain.

Get together at a private meeting place where you can set up all of your computers, or you can alternatively use headphone sets to connect with each other over a chat line.
Optional: print out a copy of these instructions so you can have a hard copy to look at the protocol systems when playing this game.;
,


If you do not do this properly, you and your teammates may not all reach the same server.

, It is best to play this game using a computer and not a smartphone because a computer mouse will have a faster reaction speed for maneuvering your slithering avatar the than the touchscreen for your phone.


To increase the speed of your mouse, go to your computer settings or type in ""mouse"" on the search bar from your start menu to reach the ""Mouse Properties."" From ""Mouse Properties,"" click the tab for ""Pointer Options,"" and use your cursor/arrow to click and drag the pointer speed to the rightmost or highest setting.
Another way to increase your reaction time and prevent the game from buffering is to close all of your other idle computer programs.
To increase reaction precision is to the keep the mouse cursor/arrow nearby the eyes of your avatar in order to allow for quick turning.
A final tip to increase your scope of vision is to ""Restore Down"" your computer screen using the button next to the ""X"" button to close your web browser. This will cause the focus to zoom out, and show more of the game's playing field.

,


Click the ""Share on Twitter"" or ""Share on Facebook"" button in the lower right-hand corner to share about the game and to unlock the custom skins.
After sharing, click on the ""Change Skin"" button in the lower left-hand corner of the Slither.io game homepage.
Click the right and left arrows to survey the different types of skins in the inventory.
Discuss with your teammates which custom skin you would all like to use to identify each other by. Choosing the same skin will prevent you from accidentally attacking your teammates when you are playing the game.
It is preferable to chose a unique skin like the ""green snake with one eye"" or the ""bright green snake with the smiley face"" because fewer other players use those skins.

, Each team member must assume one of the following Nicknames: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}. Using the set brackets {} and parentheses () makes the name unique and easy to identify so you do not accidentally attack team members. Using these names also makes it easier to monitor the position of the Commander on the ""Leaderboard"" in the upper right-hand corner of the gameplay screen.


Discuss which Nickname each of you shall choose to prevent repeating a Nickname and to be clear on which Protocol System you will follow.
Once you have decided which Nickname you will use, enter it into the ""Nickname"" bar on the Slither.io homepage and then you can click the ""Play"" button to start the game.

, Larger orbs will make you longer than small orbs. ""Moving orbs"" will give you the most length per orb, but you must sacrifice some of your length to reach them (see Game Rule 3 below).
Don't run into other players. As a Hunter, you must try to get other players to run into you so you may ""kill"" them to gain their length by eating their orbs.
Once longer, click and hold your left mouse button to increase speed. You will lose some of your length as you do this, but it can be helpful when trying to ""kill"" other players by getting them to run into you.

,


In the upper right-hand corner there is the ""Leaderboard."" The goal is to make the Commander long enough to rank as the ""#1"" position.
In the lower left-hand corner ""Your Length"" and ""Your Rank"" are shown.
The arena map is located in the lower right-hand corner of the gameplay page. The light gray speckled areas signify large amounts of colored orbs. Larger patches of light gray speckles are likely to be Bloodbath zones.
Do not go beyond the borders of the arena of the Gray Zone into the Red Zone. Your avatar will be vaporized on contact.
Use the Quadrant System to communicate your location to your team members.

, As a hunter - {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)} - use these strategies:


Length < 100 = Expendable Mode (EM): You may make risky attempts to kill larger players.
Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough.
Length > 200 = Attack Mode (AM): Try to get other players to run into you so you can gain their length.
Length > 300 = Proceed to ""Bloodbath"" Zone: Go to an area populated by lots of other players and try to get them to run into you or wait until they run into each other.
Length > 1,000 = Hunter Mode (HM): You have reached official Hunter status. Your goal is to now trick as many other players into running into you as possible to get longer.
Length > 2,000 = Circle Mode 1 (CM1): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you.
Length > 3,000 = Circle Mode 2 (CM2): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you.
Length > 4,000 = Proceed to Commander (PC): Once you have gotten between 4,000 and 5,000 in length, you must then go to the location of the commander.
Length > 10,000 = 2nd Commander Status (C2): Once you have gotten to this stage, and are still shorter than current Commander, you are the Second in Command. This means, if the Commander is destroyed before reaching the #1 position on the Leaderboard, you will be the next in line to be the Commander. Remember, though, that the Commander remains the Commander until you have reach this stage and the Commander is jeopardized, you have reached the New Commander Status and are given consent to take over, OR the Commander decides to voluntarily relinquish their position outright.
Length > Commander+500 = New Commander (NC): Once you have gotten at least 500 longer than the current Commander, you may – with the current Commander's consent – take the position of the Commander.

, As a Command - {(Commander=1)} - use the following strategies:


Do not proceed to Expendable Mode (EM)
Do not proceed to a ""Bloodbath"" Zone
Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough.
Length > 500 = Proceed to a Quadrant (PQ):
Length > 1,000 = Commander Mode (CM): You have reached official Commander Status. Your goal is to stay away from all other players, eat orbs, and eat team players to increase your length after they have reached the ""Proceed to Commander"" Status.
Length > 5,000 = Remain in Outer Region (ROQ): Choose one outer quadrant (UROQ, LROQ, ULOQ, or LLOQ), enter it, announce entry to team members, and stay at that location.
Rank > #50 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 1 (Bypass CM2): When you have reached a length of 3,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM2 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length.
Rank > #10 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 2 (Bypass CM1): When you have reached a length of 2,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM1 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length.
Rank #1 = Relieve Commander Status: Once the Commander has successfully reached #1 on the Leaderboard, he/she may pass on the duty of Commander to the Hunter with the greatest length.

, To learn how to maneuver to attack other players and to learn how to defend against other player's attacks, the best method is to go into the midst of a highly populated area (normally found in the Bloodbath Regions of the Quadrant System).

,


Enter your Nickname and press ""Play.""
Announce your entry position on the Quadrant System to your teammates. Do this in order: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}. 
Follow the Commander or Hunter Protocol System. The Hunters must regularly update teammates about their statuses in the Protocol System (EM, DM, AM, etc.). The Commander should consistently update his/her location on the Quadrant System so that Hunters can proceed to the Commander to contribute to his/her length when they achieve PC, or are able to carry out Bypass CM2 or CM1.

, You have achieved ""Domination"" when each player can, in succession, become the #1 player on the Leaderboard by following the Hunter-Commander Protocol correctly. Another objective for Domination could be to achieve the most points.

Remove the rib cage.,
Remove the lungs.,
Remove the pink organ.,
Cut the valves.,
Remove the old heart.,
Insert the new heart.",How to Do Heart Surgery in Surgeon Simulator 2013," There are two ways to remove the rib cage:


Using the circular hand saw. Pick up the circular hand saw and touch the outer portion of the rib cage with your tool. You just need to tap it briefly and continuously until they're removed. After cutting the rib cage, pick it up and remove it from the patient's body.
Using the hammer. The hammer does the same job but a tad quicker. To use the hammer, simply pick it up then swing it towards the rib cage. Using the hammer will lead to bleeding, so keep an eye on your patient's status.;
, For this part, just use your hand. Grab the left or right lung then violently move your hand to the left then the right until it's removed.


Do the same to the other lung then drop the organ wherever you want.

, After getting rid of the rib cage and lungs, you can now see the organs underneath it. With your knife, cut the upper portion of the pink tubular organ you see and then the lower part. It will snap free.


Pick it up the organ using your hand and then place it away from your patient's body.

, With the tubular organ out, we can see the heart clearly now. You now need to cut the valves holding the heart. There are two ways to do this:


Using the knife, cut the upper heart valves until it stops beating.
There are four valves, and if you look closely, you can see the creases where you have to cut.
Cut quickly since the blood level will quickly decrease.
Alternative, you can use the cutter or other sharp tool to slice the valves. Some players tend to lose the tools they use because of the doctor's clumsy hands.
Keep in mind to watch the blood level; if it goes down too fast, make sure to inject your patient to stabilize their blood flow.

, After you have successfully cut the valve veins, the heart can be removed. Pick it up using your hand then put the heart aside.


If you can't pick up the heart, check the veins again. You might have missed the upper veins of the heart; cut it with the knife or any bladed tool.
You can tell when the heart has been successfully removed since it will fall deeper into the patient's body.

, The new heart can be found in the container on the right side of the table. Open the container slowly to avoid dropping the heart onto the floor. Grab the heart then throw it into the area where the old heart was.


This will end the game, and you have successfully operated a patient's heart. Congratulations!

What kind of experience do you want it to be? What do you want to get out of the project? These are some important questions you'll need to ask yourself before you begin the process, because the answers will provide the light at the end of the tunnel for this process. You need to know where you're going if you want to get there efficiently.;
, Different audiences are more likely to play in different ways. They are also more likely to prefer different types of games and have different standards for content. Remember, it's fine to want to make a game for a very specific audience, but it will limit the profits that you make. Be realistic.

, Before you get very far into the process, you need to consider what kind of devices you want your game to be on. Mobile platforms are quickly becoming a major player but PC and consoles are still (and will likely remain) strong. The programming involved, and especially the interface and controls, will change drastically with your platform, so it's important to understand what you're going to be putting the game on

, While genres are not completely important, the genre of your game will determine some parts of how it's designed. Is it an FPS? A platformer? An RPG? A social game? There are very few aspects of design that are not influenced by the genre. Of course, you can say ""forget genres"" and just make whatever you want, but this is more difficult to market and you will be forced to be more creative and original: not the easiest way to break into the design world.


One of the things that you'll have to think about when designing based on genre is how you want the UI to look. Different types of games will have the UI more or less visible, depending usually upon the complexity of controls.
Another consideration is that while some genres lack it almost entirely, other game genres have become synonymous with dialogue. Will your dialogue need to be recorded? Will you do it text based? How interactive will it be? Planning ahead for dialogue is important, as you'll have to not only design the system itself but also the dialogue trees.
You'll need to decided on a combat system for many types of games, or find the equivalent if your game does not have combat. Think of this as the ""game"" part of the game. It is arguably one of the most important parts of design and having a model to work from is very helpful.

, As a general rule, you want your players to feel like they have a choice in what they're doing. However, certain types of games have come to be associated with much more choice than others. Adding choices can be very complex but it can also be relatively simple, depending on how you decide to do it.


Some games give the appearance of having choice, for example, but actually have very little choice involved. This can be done well or it can be done poorly.
An example of choice done well would be the Bioshock series or Witcher 2. An example of choices done poorly would be something like Old Republic.

, The serious design work begins next: you need to create your gameplay loop. This is an outline of how your game works. It usually ends with your player's goal and details the challenges they'll have and the goals they'll need to meet. An example would be the first Mario game, where the loop would look like: run, avoid obstacles, hit flagpole.

, No matter what kind of game you're making, you need to give your player a good reason to want to achieve the goals and progress through the whole game. It needs to be proportionately rewarding for the level of the challenge it poses. One great way to do that is by locking levels until you have completed them, that way you feel like you are getting an incentive.

, You also need to make sure that the game isn't too hard, or at least not so hard that it makes playing the game impossible or nearly impossible. Your game should pose some challenge, but not so much that it's going to induce a lot of rage quit. This usually requires some testing, but that's okay: that's what betas are for.

, There are many different ways to do the tutorial and many different philosophies about the best way to go about it. You can hide the tutorial within a story about the player character getting training (aka Fable), or you can simply display instructions (aka Mass Effect). You can even try to hide the tutorial altogether blending it seamlessly into the game or display all of the tutorial all at once. No matter what you do, make sure that it feels natural within your game.

, The world is the environments in which your player will play the game. How expansive will your world be? How challenging? How will you indicate that an area should be explored? That it shouldn't? These are things you'll need to consider.

, These are the internal rules of the game. You'll want to decide on a rule system and make sure that it's balanced and consistent. The best way to do this is to look at what other games do right or wrong in this area.

, The levels are the individual chunks of the game, the ""episodes"" that the player has to get through to make it to the end of the game. The levels should be engaging and just the right amount of challenging. They should also be physically laid out in a way that makes sense.

, You'll need to design all the content, like the items that can be interacted with, the characters themselves, the environmental items, etc. This can be extremely time consuming so plan ahead! Try to find clever ways to recycle things without making them seem repetitive.

, The interface includes things like the menus and UI. You want these to be easy to navigate and natural to use. Take cues from your favorite games but remember that generally the simpler the better. If an 8-year-old can figure it out, you're set.

, Having controls which feel natural are key to players really enjoying and getting the most out of your game. Remember to keep things simple and streamlined. When in doubt, conform to standardized control systems.

, The way your game looks should match the type of game that you're making. Peppy, colorful graphics, for example, can ruin a game meant to have a serious tone. You also want to avoid pixel like 8-bit style if making a game that is meant to come across as modern.

, Charming visuals are an important part of making a game. Bad ones can kill a players enjoyment of the game. Read up on some color theory and, as with most things, remember that when in doubt: take the simple route.

, You can play on cliches to help make your game easier to navigate and play. Use commonly accepted icons and visual cues to keep your player immersed in the world. You can also use visuals to lead your players through a map, by making areas where you don't want them to go look , for example, dark and scary, but areas where you do want them to go clearly lit and interesting.

, Don't feel like you have to make the next Mass Effect to be a successful game maker. Visually simple games can be just as good if the game itself is good. An excellent example of this is Journey or Bastion, which had uncomplicated graphics but were both highly regarded.

, Direct sound effects are things like voices, weapons noises, and item interaction sound effects. You'll want to make sure you have these in and that they make sense within your game. Try to get as many unique ones as possible, since too many of the same makes your game sound repetitive (giving you a bad case of ""Then I Took an Arrow to The Knee"" syndrome).

, Ambient sound effects are background noises, usually environmental. These are important as they help set the scene and make your players feel immersed in the game, so don't neglect them.

, When you're doing the sound work, it's a good idea to try to record as much original sound as possible. You can use a sample library, but people that know what they're doing will notice and it will come across as unprofessional.

, Music is also important to the game and you shouldn't forget about it. Sometimes, a soundtrack is all that's necessary to make a game really stand out, even if it's otherwise an unknown. Hire someone that knows what they're doing and use your soundtrack to help create an immersive player experience.

, A bad concept is one of the things that can really kill a game, so it's important to have this really nailed down before you get too far. Think your concept all the way through and be sure that it's complex enough to make for a rich world, characters, and gameplay.

, Pacing is the speed and intensity with which the plot or game itself comes at the player. Like with a good movie or book, you want the pacing of your game to be spot on. You don't want it to start really intense, for example, and then have the rest of the game feel comparatively boring. Generally the best pacing is to have an overall build to an intense climax, with the build make up of peaks and valleys of excitement and rest.

, Many of the best games make use of classic storytelling techniques. You should study these and see if they can help you in creating your game.


Act structures are commonly used in plays, movies, and books to help get the pacing correct. Look up act structures if you're feeling unsure about your pacing.
Monomyth or the Hero's Journey is one of the most common story-telling philosophies, arguing that most stories conform to an overall pattern. You can exploit this pattern to help it play on inherent human psychology. Journey is one of the best examples of the use of monomyth in games, but it can be found in most of them.

, Tropes are storytelling cliches. Some are better than others and some can even be useful, but generally you should avoid as many cliches as possible. Spend a little time on the TVTropes website and see if you're designing a walking cliché.

, You want your characters to be full and rich, since this makes your players more engaged and invested in the game. This means giving characters complex personalities and faults. If you need help imagining and writing complex personalities, try some character development exercises, by plotting your character on the Myers-Briggs personality chart or the character alignment chart.

, Your characters should change as people over the course of the game. This makes them more interesting. This means that they should generally start off with some major flaws or a generally worse personality than how they end up.

, It's really easy when writing characters to make them do what we would do instead of what they would do. But this kind of lazy writing is often visible to players because it comes across as so unnatural. Focus on what your characters would do and you'll make your game much better.

, Games tend to lack diversity, with characters being vastly more white, straight, and male than people are in real life. This can make games feel samey and boring. By including diversity in your game, you can not only make it more interesting, but also increase the hype for your game by setting it apart from others.

, You'll need some skills in order to make a game (skills we can't teach you here because they are too complex). You might need to go to school in order to learn these skills but it is technically possible to learn them on your own as well. You'll need a good understanding of math, since many games boil down to a series of equations. You'll also need to learn a programming language (usually C, C++, or C#). There are schools for game design, but your best bet is to go to the best school you can get into for programming. This will give you a more diverse skill set so that you can take a general job as a programmer if you don't immediately get hired with a company.

, If you want to break into the industry and start working with major publishers, it's a good idea to start by just making a small but engaging game that shows your skills but doesn't require 5 years to make. This can get someone interested enough to give you a job or give you money. You also just don't want to bite off more than you can chew.

, You don't need to get your game published by a major publisher. You don't have to be recognized by anyone but your players if you don't want to. The indie game market is alive and kicking and right now is the best time to be making this kind of game. Keep this in mind before strongly pursuing official backing.

, If you want to make a great game, of any type at all, you're going to have to get some money. It takes a LOT of money to make a game. Currently, the best way to get that money is to run Kickstarter, which is one of many crowd-funding platforms. Check out some Kickstarters that have been successful in the past to see what they did right, but the main pieces of advice are to have great incentives and communicate constantly.

, Steam is Valve's digital game store and one of the most popular distribution channels for PC games. They are also one of the most friendly distribution channels for indie games. If you're making this type of game, your best bet for success is to get it on Steam. Currently, Steam Greenlight is the channel you will probably have to go through.

, Build a website and an army of social media accounts for your game. Update constantly and let people feel involved in the process. Communicate as much as possible with people who become interested in what you're doing. Having people excited about your game is key to indie success, since interest is often the main factor in things like getting on Steam.

, The indie community is very tight knit and many of them can help you on your road to success. If you want to succeed, it's a good idea to make friends with them, help support them in their ventures, and promote their games. They'll help you do the same if they think you've got something worthwhile.

Look for an opportunity to get airborne.,
Shake the WiiMote as you leave the ground to do a trick.,
Keep under control once you land.,
String together many tricks to keep your speed up.,
Go off of a ramp or jump.,
Use the directional pad as you enter the air.,
Stick the landing.",How to Do Tricks on Mario Kart Wii1," In Mario Kart Wii, you can't do tricks just anywhere. For aerial tricks, first, you need to go off of a jump, a ramp, or anything else that will put you in the air. Usually, there are many opportunities on each track to get some airtime.


The most obvious spots for doing tricks are often the boost ramps that glow with a rainbow color — any of these will give you a chance for a trick. Some tracks, like Coconut Mall, even force you to go off one of these.However, even tiny bumps in the track that send you off of the ground for a second or so can give you a chance to do a trick, so be ready!;
, As you go off of the ramp or jump, shake or flick the WiiMote in any direction. Do this with some force so that the controller registers your motion, but not so hard that you aren't ready to start steering as soon as you hit the ground. If you get the timing just right, you should do a trick! You will feel the controller rumble, hear an audio cue, and your racer will cheer.


Each direction that you shake the WiiMote (up, down, left, or right) should make you perform a different trick. However, the boost you get from each will be the same.

, If you do a trick, when you make it to the ground safely (in other words, as long as you're not hit by a shell, etc.), you will get a quick, small boost of speed — sort of like a mini-mushroom.


Be careful to control your steering when you get this boost. While the boost is great for passing the racers next to you, it can also make it a little harder to dodge obstacles since you'll have less time to react.

, You can only perform one trick per jump, so you'll only get a max of one boost per jump. However, if you can do several jumps in a row and pull off a trick each time, you'll get a significant speed boost. Pulling off lots of tricks in a row without crashing or going off the course can be really tricky, so keep practicing! Once you master this skill, you'll have a big advantage over tough opponents.

, The way that you do tricks on a non-WiiMote controller is a little different — some players even believe that it's easier.To start, go off a jump (just as you would if you were using a WiiMote.)

, The GameCube and Classic controllers don't have motion sensitivity, so instead of shaking them, you must hit one of the four directions on the D-pad to do a trick.The D-pad is the cross-shaped directional button on the left side of the controller — it is not the stick you use to steer.


Note that the D-pad is in a different location on the Classic Controller than it is on the Gamecube controller. On the Classic Controller, it is above the left stick used for steering, while on the GameCube controller, it is below it., Once again, if you pull off the trick correctly, you will get an audio cue and your character will cheer. When you hit the ground safely, you will receive a short boost.


As with the WiiMote, the different directions of the D-pad will cause you to perform different tricks. However, they all give the same amount of boost when you hit the ground.

",How to Do a Lets Play Walkthrough," You will need a video game to play through. You should probably pick one you have beaten at least 1 time but that is up to you;
, If your game is a game played on a TV the best method would be a capture card but a good camera is a substitute. Older video game consoles can be emulated on your computer if a capture card is too big of an investment as well as some handheld consoles. There are fancy pieces of hardware that allow you to record from handheld consoles, such as the Game Boy Player (used with a capture card) or the 4DS Capture Board. And finally if your game is played on a PC the best method is a recording software. There are free ones(eg camstudio) and much better but costly ones(eg Fraps)

, Not all LPs have voice (some don't even have video and are text-and-picture!) but the best ones have voice commentary as it adds to the entertainment value. A lot of bigger LPers use the Blue Snowball or Blue Yeti, but most high-quality mics will work. The recommended program to use to record your voice is Audacity because of the extensive noise removal options. If you want a high-quality video, learn how to use audacity to make your voice sound good.

, Most LPs are on YouTube so it would make sense to upload your videos there. If you already have one you can skip this step. If not go to https://youtube.com and follow the instructions.

, This is their only place that would allow snake to do this.

, If it's a classic controller or Nintendo 64 controller use the D-pad (any arrow) if it's a Wii-mote use A and D-pad (any arrow) if it's a Wii-mote and nunchuck use 2.

, Snake should get in a box for a while then lift it off. If done correctly he will be crouching and kind of nodding. If it isn't working either tap faster or slower. Still not working, run around the map to rest your fingers then continue.

, After that either mei ling, octacon or campbell will talk to you about your enemy.

Push the controller down to end the wheelie.,
Save wheelies for straightaways.,
Reach cruising speed.,
Hit up on the D-pad to do a wheelie.,
Hit down on the D-pad to end the wheelie.",How to Do Tricks on Mario Kart Wii2," In addition to the tricks you can pull in the air, you can also get a boost on the ground by pulling a wheelie. However, this option is only open to motorcycles — four-wheeled karts are not able to do wheelies.

, To perform a wheelie, first, start driving and build up a good amount of speed. When you come to a straight length of road, lift the controller up. The front wheel of your motorcycle should lift off of the ground.When you do a wheelie, you should notice that you immediately begin to go a little faster at your top sped.
If you're using the steering wheel, be sure to keep it level while you lift it to avoid accidentally steering.

, When you want to exit the wheelie and resume normal driving, make a downward motion with your controller. The front wheel of the motorcycle should return to the ground and you should be able to steer normally.

, When you do a wheelie, you'll notice that your steering is affected dramatically. You only have a little control over the direction you go, so even minor turns can be tricky. Because of this, it's best to use wheelies only when you're on a section of track where you don't have to do very much maneuvering. Long, straight stretches are best.


You'll also want to be careful of the other racers around you when pulling a wheelie. If another racer bumps into you while your wheel is in the air, you'll lose control and your speed will plummet., As with aerial tricks, the way that you pull a wheelie with a non-WiiMote controller is a little different than with a WiiMote. Start as you normally would by accelerating until you're near your top speed.

, When you're ready to do a wheelie, press the upper direction on the D-pad (the same cross-shaped pad you used to do tricks in the air.) Your racer should pull a wheelie.

, When you're ready to end your wheelie, press the lower direction on the D-pad. Your racer should drop the motorcycle's front wheel and you should be able to steer like normal once again.

Options: The items in this section are used to change various aspects of how the game runs. These are purely cosmetic and/or functional and won't affect your progress in the game. For instance, the ""Autosave"" option determines whether or not the game automatically saves your process.

Cookies: These items determine how many of each type of cookie you have. Type a number into each of these boxes to set your starting cookie value. For instance, if you want to start with 20,000 cookies, type ""20000"" in the box labeled ""Cookies"".

Buildings: These items determine how many of each type of building/helper you have (e.g. grandmas, factories, shipments, etc.). Modify these the same way you would modify the items in the ""Cookies"" section.

, At the bottom of the Cookie Engine page, there are two small but important check boxes that are easy to miss. One reads ""Enable All Upgrades"" and the other reads ""Enable All Achievements"". Leaving either of these boxes checked will cause he corresponding condition to be true in your new game, while unchecking them will start you with no upgrades or achievements, respectively.


By default, these boxes are checked, so if you'd like a challenge, don't forget to uncheck them.

, When you've set all of the items in the Cookie Engine exactly how you'd like, scroll to the bottom and click the ""Generate Code"" button. The Cookie Engine program will generate a string of save code that contains your specifications. Copy this code to your computer's clipboard or a blank word document.

, Finally, open Cookie Clicker and click the ""Menu"" button at the top of the screen. Click the ""Import Save"" button, which is about halfway down the page. Finally, paste your save code into the text box that pops up and click ""Load"". A new game should load with the exact conditions you selected on the Cookie Engine. Enjoy!


Playing with all upgrades and achievements enabled will not necessarily start you with all seasonal holiday upgrades and achievements.

Save your current game.,
Delete ""%21END%21"" from the code.,
Replace each ""%3D"" with an equals sign.,
Unscramble your code with a base 64 decoder.,
Modify your code as you wish.,
Re-encode your save data.,
Paste your save code into Cookie Clicker.",How to Hack Cookie Clicker Online2," If the Cookie Engine program above doesn't give you the level of precise control you'd like over your Cookie Clicker game, you can also edit your save data manually, though this requires a little more time and effort. To begin, open a game of Cookie Clicker and save your game. You can use a game that's in progress or a completely new game — it doesn't matter.


When you get your save code, copy it to the clipboard or a blank word document.
Before you begin, note that this method can require some basic coding knowledge.

, Now we're going to start tampering with the code manually. To get the code into a form we can work with, we'll need to edit it slightly. First, delete the ""%21END%21"" segment from your code. This should be at the very end of the string.

, Next, you'll want to find every place where ""%3D"" occurs in your code and replace each segment with an equals sign (=). Note that it's possible for ""%3D"" not to appear in your code at all. This is OK — in this case, simply proceed to the next step.


Don't waste time reading through the indecipherable code for each ""%3D"". Instead, simply use a word processor's ""find text"" function to locate all of the instances of ""%3D"" instantly. On Windows PCs, the shortcut for the find text command is Ctrl+F; on Macs, it is Command+F.

, This is where things get a little tricky. Cookie Clicker's save code is written in a base 64 format which makes it basically impossible to work with except for certain computer programs. For this code to be useful for our purposes, it has to be translated to a more workable form. Use an online base 64 decoder to change your save code into workable text. One excellent decoder is the Base64 Decode and Encode tool, which has a beginner-friendly format.


You'll want to use the UTF-8 format for decoding your save code. This is the default option at the decoder listed above.

, After decoding, your base 64 save code should now be a long string of numbers separated by vertical lines and semicolons. Each number corresponds to a specific quantity in the game — for instance, one is the number of cookies you have, one is the number of grandmas you have, one corresponds to the upgrades you've purchased, and so on. By modifying this code, you can custom-tune your game experience.


The process for modifying this code is actually fairly complex. While the process is too involved to explain at great length in this article, an excellent guide is available at the Cookie Clicker wiki's ""Cheating"" page (under ""Save Editing"").

, When you've finished making your modifications, you'll need to convert your save code back into a format the game can read. To do this, use an online base 64 encoding program; most of the same programs that you may have used to decode your information will offer the option to re-encode it. After your data has been re-encoded, don't forget to replace every equals sign with a ""%3D"" and end the string of code with ""%21END%21"".


If you used the base64decode.org program recommended above, all you need to do is click on the ""Encode"" button at the top of the screen to call up the appropriate tool.

, Finally, open a game of Cookie Clicker and use the ""Import Save"" menu option to import your modified code. If you've done everything correctly, a new game should load with your changes in place. Have fun!

"
Open your browser's console while playing.,
Paste a cheat script into the console.,
Run your script.",How to Hack Cookie Clicker Online3," Another way to cheat is to modify the game's code directly with the console feature that is included with most internet browsers. To begin, start a game of Cookie Clicker, then open your browser's console. Note that, for this method, knowledge of javascript is a plus. Below are shortcuts for opening the console in several common browsers:



Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+J for Windows, ⌘+Alt+J for Macs.



Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+K for Windows, ⌘+Option+K for Macs.



Internet Explorer: F12 for Windows.



Safari: ⌘+Option+C for Macs.

, Once you have access to the browser console, you have the ability to cheat to your heart's content. Do this by running commands in javascript to produce the desired effect — simply copy the commands into the console and modify any portion in ""<>"" brackets as you wish. There are literally hundreds of commands you can run in this way (and even more if you're willing to write your own). Below is a selection of scripts to get you started.Be sure to copy and paste the entirety of each script, including the final semicolon.


Change the amount of cookies you have:




Game.cookies = <amount>;







Gain infinite cookies:




Game.cookies = Infinity;<amount>;







Change the cookies per second gained:




Game.cookiesPs = <Cookies per Second>;<amount>;







Automatically click the cookie — note that this can tax the CPU if set too high:




var autoClicker = setInterval(Game.ClickCookie, <milliseconds interval>);<amount>;







Set buildings as free:




Game.ObjectsById.forEach(function (e) {
    e.basePrice = 0;
    e.refresh();
});
Game.storeToRebuild = 1;<amount>;







Spawn a golden cookie:




/*Game.goldenCookie.wrath = 0;*/
Game.goldenCookie.spawn();<amount>;






, After you paste your script into the console, click enter to run the script. If you've pasted the script correctly, your changes should immediately take effect in the game. Congratulations! Have fun.

Your choices will affect starting gear, skills, and money. Answering the top noble choices grants you more money, while picking lower hunter, street picker options grant you bows.;
, After assigning a name, put points into skills that fit you. For attribute points, STR give 2 hitpoints per level, and allows you to increase STR related skills. AGI lets you move faster, plus 10 weapon proficiency. INT gives two extra skillpoints, etc. CHA gives 1 more troop slot.

, This is completely up to you, and if desired you can stick with the defaults.

, You will be attacked by a lone bandit, then approached/tended to by a merchant (if you kill bandit or knocked out). He will give you a quest to find 5 men, then hunt bandits. It is recommended to do this quest regardless of whether you're new or a pro.

, You need to visit villages, which cost 20 denar (currency). you will then return to the merchant, and he will have you hunt a small party of bandits. After interrogating the bandit,  got to the hide out (don't bother returning to the merchant; he has nothing to say).


The hideout shouldn't be that bad itself; the real killer is the walk there. After eliminating the bandits, return to the merchant. He will thank you, pay you, and give you one more quests that takes place in the town itself.

, If you choose to accept the quest, be prepared once you step out side, after a few seconds, the merchant will give the command and you along with some other townsfolk, will fight off bandits and ruffians. Regardless of if you win or lose, the merchant's party will win. He will explain everything to the lord of the town, but is banished. After a talk and goodbye, you will be cast into the world of Calradia.

,, Any recruits are fine, but try to upgrade them as soon as possible. Start with low tier troops to save on money, and work your way up to better units.

, Bandits should not be too hard, although some bandits are stronger than others (such as in the top north shores; that area is very dangerous for beginners).

, Taking jobs from lords, villages, town guild leaders, and kings can net you a lot of money depending on the job.

, If you have enough troops, doing this gets you a considerable amount of money that increases with amount of and tier of troops.

The secret in this game is the intended sliding.,
The following points describe the different types of slides you will need to make everyone (or ALMOST everyone) swallowing your dust.

,
Basic/Beginner Slide - nearly every(including me) player begins the sliding thing with the basic slide i.e.,
Power Slide - The more used slide between the professionals is the power slide.,
Pulsative Slide - This is a very tricky slide.,
Ramstone Slide - What is the Ramstone?,
Slow Slide - This kind of sliding is not very famous among the community.,
Wallbang - This is not a slide but it's another technique to get pro.,
Jump + Slide - Useful when you have a lot of speed, but there is a long or sharp turn right after a jump and landing, and you do not have time to brake.,
These are the most important techniques used by good drivers in Trackmania nations.",How to Get Pro in Trackmania Nations,",, Sliding helps you to get the curves faster. Some may say that sliding is useless because the only thing that happens is that your back is breaking out. Well that is right, but they just didn't try to do it, or don't have the required experience to do so.

,, braking without accelerating. It is needed on really hard curves. You will need very much speed when sliding, so look for a curve where you will arrive very fast. Press your turn button and after that hit the brake. Look to it that you first turn and THEN brake , otherwise the car won't slide. Release the turn when you think it's the right time. start accelerating and shortly turn in the other direction to catch the street grip again.

, It is braking while accelerating. It is the same procedure as the basic slide but don't release the accelerate button. This slide is much longer and of course faster. To use it you don't need to be as fast as in using the basic slide but you will need a considerable amount of speed. It is hard to find the right slide for the right curve, but sooner or later you will get to know what to use where.

, There is not that many curves to do this one, but if there is one, using it would be really helpful. It is a mixture of the Basic AND the power slide. It is not only one Slide. It is a slide consisting of more slides. Start with the power slide and when you need release the brake and go back on it again. The other type of the pulsative slide is the same thing but instead of releasing and pressing the brake button , press the accelerate button. This may sound a bit weird and you will wonder where you have to use it. I can tell you: Nadeo Pro A-1 - The long turn after the second small jump (into the loop parts) you will need a long fast slide to do the first curve and directly afterwards you will need a slow 'n' short one. So you'll start with a powerslide and release the accelerate button when arriving at the harder turn and go back to accelerating after the turn immediately. You will need very very much speed to do this. Important to say is that you can only ""pulsate"" while there are at least 3 braking stripes on the ground visible ( sounds weird, but you'll see)

, It is the small grey stripe that's announcing the borders of a track. If you are too slow to slide but you really want to slide then this slide may help. Drive on the ramstone and start sliding on the ramstone into the track. This one's quite hard because the risk is very high to hit the board when trying it. Not recommended for beginners in rounds mode.

, The intention of this one is to slide when you normally would be too slow to do it. The technique is completely different and you might need a lot of training to handle it. This slide can be done at any speed. The best way to practice it is to build a track that has a 180° turn right at the beginning. Start driving until you reach the turn. Then steer into the turn. Afterwards release the steering key and press the break key (you need to drive straight forward). While you press the break begin steering again. If you did it the right way your car will begin to slide.

, On some U-Turn curves you may arrive too fast and you should brake a really long time to get the curve. So it could be better to hit the board instead of braking and drive through. On some normal curves wallbang is helpful too for example if there's a long curve where you need to slide very much and decreasing lots of speed you could shortly hit the wall and then go full-speed all the way through. Sometimes this is a little bit faster.

, Simply turn just before the jump in the direction you want to slide. It will take some getting used to. Once you master this, try combining this turn with a pulsative or ramstone slide to yield the best results., Try it out and get Pro!

Understand how these games work: in these gesture games the computer will check the shape you drew for certain points, for example:


In this square gesture the computer will check for the points marked with an ""o"" so it won't matter how you draw the shape but it must have those 4 points.,
Find a game that uses these mechanics as mentioned above you can play Black and White or even Magic Touch.

Head to the courtyard.,
Claim your title.",How to Become Viscount in Dragon Age II," Once you start “The Last Straw” you will not be able to finish any incomplete missions. Not finishing some of the party members’ quests could result in them leaving your party.


If you want to keep as many people in your party as possible, work to get 100% friendship with all of them. Only Anders will not stay on your side if you complete all of the companion quests and max out their approvals.;
, After the cut scene where the Grand Cleric dies, you are forced to make a choice. To become Viscount, you must choose “I will support the Templars” when Meredith tells you to pick a side.


You will hear the opinions of most of your party once you make this choice.

, Orsino will tell you to think carefully. Choose “I've already made my choice.” From here on out, everything that happens is a result of the decision to support the Templars, but no matter what you do or who is in your party, you will become Viscount at the end of the game.

, Considering what helping the Templars means for all of the mages in the game, it is actually a very difficult decision to make, but Orsino is not a good man, as you will find out whichever side you take.


You also get Cullen on your side throughout the rest of the game, and consequently the other Templars will help you as you go through The Gallows killing mages.

, If your relationship with Merrill is high enough, she will decide that you are doing what is best under the worst circumstances and will stay in your party. If your friendship is not strong or if you are rivals, she will likely leave your party.

, If you don’t kill him now, you will have to kill him later in The Gallows. You can ask the others what they think before you make the final decision, but you should already know exactly how they feel about this. You can also tell him to join you, but he will refuse.


“Get out of here” allows him to attack you and the party later.
“Then you die” saves you from fighting him later, but he is more than happy to be martyred for his cause.

, If your sibling is a Grey Warden, you will encounter Bethany/Carver after deciding what to do with Anders. You can either accept your sibling into the party or reject the extra help.

, After the first wave of fighting, you will face Anders if you had not killed him earlier. He will apologize for things not working out in response to your telling him you spared his life.


You will also encounter Merrill if she left your side. If you have a decent relationship and you finished her quest, you can persuade her to rejoin your party.

, You will be given the opportunity to spare them.


If you ask for Cullen’s opinion he will bring up what happened in Ferelden, and will say that it was a worse situation, but still mages were allowed to live.
If you say to spare the mages, Cullen will order the Templars to take them away instead of killing them.
It really doesn't matter what you do here as it will not affect your becoming Viscount.

, Meredith will help you kill him after you find out he was helping the man who killed your mother (siding with the Templars isn't as horrible as it at first feels).

, It will be where Meredith will tell Cullen and the Templars to kill you. When they refuse she attacks everyone.

, Once the fight is over, the Templars will bow to you and you will get your title.

Consider starting out as a scout.,
Select starting attributes.,
Invest your points.,
As a scout, you will have access to one unique feat: Uncanny Dodge.,
Use implants.,
You will also get Force Immunity to Fear, Stun and Insanity.",How to Become the Perfect Jedi Sentinel in kotOR," The scout is the most balanced class in the game. While you are well trained in combat, you are skillful in other fields too. Although you are not as strong as a soldier, your agility is the best and can save you in times of peril. Your skills are enough to make you an all rounder in the galaxy. Not all of your companions will be with you all the time (e.g. at the final battle), so you are a person who can do everything all the time by yourself .;
, Optimal starting attributes of: STR :12,DEX :14,CON :12,INT :14,WIS :12,CHA :14. This set up is to make sure all points have +1 and +2 modifiers.

, In the game, you will have 5 bonus point so invest it in Strength in early game and Wisdom in late game. This makes you a very versatile and balanced character.

, This increases your chances of 'saving' against grenades. You also get all 3 Implant feats for free, if you level up to 8.

, Implants are the advantage for Scout because implants can make you a different person depends on which implant you use. Some can change your attribute, some can give immunities and some give HP regeneration.

, Although you will have a low attack bonus, this Immunity is worth it and can save you when facing Dark Jedi late-game. You also have less Force Points than Jedi Consulars, but that is because they are terrible melee fighters.


The rest is up to you because this game is an RPG meaning it is up to the player to choose. However, I recommend you to choose more neutral powers than light side powers and dark side powers. Neutral powers are universal in usage, and aren't effected by alignment changes. After all, the goal is to make your character balanced :-)

Once that is done, go and beat up all the guys, then get Robin or Nightwing's magnet suit on and go up the magnet thing on the left side of the screen. Punch all the windows and the trash cans and build the grapple thing. Go up there and beat up the guys. NOTE: It is better to have two people playing for the next part.;
, Use your Batarang and hit it. Have the other person playing be someone with one gun (ex. Harley Quinn, The Penguin, Mad Hatter). You will see these penguin things rise up. If there are more than one, hit the others, until you have just one. If there are no penguins, go to another purple thing. If there are no penguins at all, retry the whole thing.

, Go up to the middle part of it, and have player one punch player two once. Then start changing characters. If it works, the penguin should jump up onto the window and start changing into characters.

, Just remember, the guy chasing you WILL blow up if you touch it. So be careful!

The town of Helonia itself hosts four conversations within the borders while the other locations of the area hosting conversations are Bella’s Orchard, Silverash Shores, Windmill Cottage and the Emeralden Mountains.


Bella’s Orchard, due northwest of town, has two.
Silverash Shores, otherwise known as the beach south of town, has one.
Windmill Cottage just north of town has one.
Emeralden Mountains, in the furthest part of the map due north-east, has one right beside the portal to the next town.;
, You know how some NPCs have those large symbols floating above their heads? Usually, those symbols mean they have specific functions. A large potion bottle symbol means that they sell potions and alchemy items, a chef’s hat means they sell food, etc. NPCs with pre-programmed conversations have a large yellow speech bubble with an ellipses (...) in it hovering above their heads. Look out for them.

, Now, once you’ve found a conversation to eavesdrop on, click on the people and watch the scene unfold. You can’t earn the achievement until they finish the conversation, and sometimes, when your Internet connection is choppy or if someone else initiated the conversation, you won’t get the achievement at all and you’ll need to try again. Try and stay really close to the NPCs while watching the conversation so you can receive the achievement.


You’ll get some Loyalties from each conversation you eavesdrop on, which is one of the available currencies you can use to buy stuff from the online stores.

, Once you’ve listened to all of these conversations, your character will shine with the light of achievement. Notifications will also pop up in a red border, signalling that you received an Achievement and a Title.


For eavesdropping in all conversations, you will be awarded the “Helonia Beach Bum” title. This grants you +3 EVA (evasion) when you equip it. For those that like getting up close and personal in battle but dislike the ensuing pain, this boost would be small, but definitely appreciated.
Achievements are merely bragging rights, but Titles carry bonuses to your stats! You can equip titles through the Character menu, symbolized by a head wearing a helmet in your menu bar. Click the “Personal Title” tab and browse for the title you want to equip.

, Hidden Quests are special side quests where you have to deduce what to do when you trigger them. Also known as Oddities or Easter Egg Quests, you don’t actually have to finish them to get through the game, but completing them gives you a title per quest and some loot. Normally, you can spot them on the area map as green exclamation points. While you can repeat the quests, you won’t receive the quest rewards again, though some quests let you keep the resulting easter egg items.

, When exploring the beachside, you can find a conch shell on the ground. Pick it up, and head towards the northern exit of town. You’ll spot the Child King Ralph. Click him to initiate the conversation, watch the ensuing scene, and receive the “Pirate King” title, which grants you a +12 DMG (damage) bonus, letting you hit things harder!

, While you’re at the beach, head a bit north from town until you see a small house with a single lady in blue there. Talk to her and she’ll ask you to bring a silver coin.


Run northwards until you get to the pirate’s lair, then search for the Jar of Pirate Junk in the middle area of camp. Click on it, run back to the witch, and after a scene, you’ll be forced to battle.
It’s a pretty easy battle, and once you win, you get the title “Cursed Seafarer”! This will add a bonus 15 points to your HP, which lets you take a couple hits more than usual!
Make sure you’re around level 20 before you tackle the area, or be really good at running and escaping. All the pirates there are extremely aggressive and attack you on sight.

, Back in the beach, you’ll encounter a letter in a bottle at the furthest northern section of the beach. Run back to town and give it to Postman Gavin, who can be found in the middle “circle” of houses in town next to some NPC merchants. He’ll tell you to approach the old man Loma, found at the west of town, just below the exit. Loma is the old man in the green robes.


After talking to Loma about the letter, run right to Auntie May, a middle-aged lady in purple and yellow found near the southeastern exit to the beach. Talk to her about the letter, and you’ll be directed one last time to the Solitary Woman, who is a very old lady living in a small secluded house in an alcove east of Auntie May. Give her the letter, watch the scene, and receive the title “The Mail Carrier.”
This title awards you with 3 points to your CRIT (critical hit), giving you a higher chance of hitting much, much harder than you normally should!

, In town, you can spot an older man with the telltale green mark above him. He’ll ask you to measure the wind in the three exits of town and hand you an Anemometer to measure with. Place the Anemometer in your hotbar, then right-click or press the corresponding number to move automatically towards the three places and trigger the action. Once you’ve done that three times, run back to the old man, hand him the data. You’ll receive the title “Aerologist,” which gives you +3 EVA!

, At the southernmost part of the beach, there’s a box of fishing nets. Grab it, then run to Isaac, who is found near the western exit of the town, near Loma. Talk to him, give him the net, and congratulations, you now have the title “Extreme Fisherman,” which also gives you +3 EVA!

, If you head northwards from town, you’ll come across the Windmill Cottage, which is surrounded by bandit-looking people. One of them, differentiated by his color and his title of “Undercover Pirate,” is the one you’re after. He’ll tell you about his mission, and tell you to grab a costume from the box beside him. Take one, right-click it, then walk back to town. Enter the northern exit of town, speak to the Sneaky Villager, then run back to your undercover friend. After a quick scene and a painfully easy battle, reap your reward and receive the “Private Eye” title! This title will grant you an additional 12 DMG!

, Remember the lair you infiltrated for some coins? Head back up there, and at the innermost part of camp, around the northeast, is an Inconspicuous Box. Take the map inside, and right-click it. It will lead you to an area near the huge whirlpool northeast of town. Right-click the map again, and you’ll trigger a battle.


After beating your opponent, you’ll receive a small treasure chest. Open it, get your treasure, and congratulations! You now have the “Indiscriminate Looter” title! This title will grant you an additional +12 DMG.

, Back at the lair, near the middle of the camp, is a box of Crab Meat. Grab some Crab Meat, and head over to Bella’s Orchard and give it to Bella. After a short scene, you’ll get some Crab Meatballs.


Now head over to Perry, who is somewhere to the east of the orchard or directly west from the Windmill Cottage, and hand him the Meatballs. He’d greedily gulp it down, and after a short scene, you’ll receive the “Gourmet Chef” title, granting you a bonus +3 CRIT upon equipping.

, Head to the lair. At the east of the entrance, you can find an Empty Box. Grab it, click a “Catseye Parrot,” then right-click the Empty Box in your inventory to capture the parrot. Afterwards, run right back to Perry and a short, funny scene will play. Afterwards, you can now equip your brand-new title, “Best Buddy”! This title grants the player an additional 15+ HP.


Congratulations, you’ve completed all the Hidden Quests of the area!

, This last title involves being able to hunt down and defeat 4 powerful boss monsters found in the area. They have a unique icon in the map: a grayish purple horned head that vaguely resembles a dragon. The boss monsters are basically bigger versions of the usual monsters of their area, as well as more powerful. If you meet them head-to-head at the same level, you’re bound to win! Though it will be a bit challenging, they’re not as difficult as they seem.


You can keep beating these boss monsters and receive the reward multiple times, but you can only get the achievement and the title once. They respawn somewhat randomly upon being beaten, but they can always be found in their respective areas.
You don’t actually need to prepare anything special before fighting them. Players can normally beat them, regardless of Job Class, once they reach or pass the level of the boss. It is advised though to keep up-to-date with your level’s equipment restrictions and to carry Potions with you, just in case you’re hit by a critical or feel somewhat wary of them.

, Kalna is found at the beach, a little ways northward from town. He’s a huge red hermit crab with a brown shell and covered in green algae. When you’re at level 12, he proves a bit of a challenge, but it’s doable to beat him even at a slightly lower level, if you’re prepared.

, Next up is Beita! He’s a huge beetle found northwest, north of Bella’s Orchard. You should be at least level 14 to beat him, but like with Kalna, you can try and have a go at him if you feel sufficiently prepared.

, Wade is a massive golem, even more gigantic than the usual golems you find in the road just directly north of the Windmill Cottage. You can take him on at level 16 with only a little difficulty.

, Sloar is a massive purple slug found at the middle of the beach, and he’s the most powerful of the group. You should at least be level 18 before tackling him. However, like the other three, he’s not as challenging as he seems and can be taken down with only a little difficulty.

, After beating one of the boss monsters, you need to take the ensuing crate or urn containing them, then go to the northern exit of town and speak to the Town Guard, Chris. He’ll give you a reward chest, which you can open with right-click.


Note that you can only drag one urn or chest with you at a time, so you can’t treat it like a boss rush and beat all of them at once if you want to get the rewards. When you manage to hand Chris all four of these monsters, you’ll get the “Helonia Hero” title, giving you a +6 DMG boost when equipped.
Also make sure your inventory has at least one slot free to tote the urn or crate around, and that you hand it over to Chris before the 30-minute time limit on the urn or crate expires. What this does is remove the cart following you, and therefore, you’ll be unable to hand it in to Chris. While some of you won’t mind if you just repeated a battle with any of the four, it still means you’ll miss out on some items from the rewards.

Wait until he finishes singing verse one.,
Listen for when he starts his long note.,
Wait for him to start the second verse.,
Repeat the first two steps until you reach a cut scene where he begins another verse, and Conker gets to speak a few lines.,
Finish him off with a final roll.",How to Beat the Great Mighty Poo in Conkers Bad Fur Day," At this point, he should begin throwing poo balls at you. You need to try to avoid them as best you can, however you also need to stand near the C.S pad, but not on it. If you need to, get some chocolate to help out.;
, When this happens, he should have his mouth open for you to throw the toilet paper into his mouth. Make sure you're standing on the C.S pad when this happens. If you miss, he'll restart the verse somewhere else and you'll have to try again.

, When he begins, run to the nearby uncovered C.S pad where the sweetcorn was before. Do exactly what you did last time and stand on the C.S pad when he hits a long note to throw it in his mouth.

, This should happen after you have put two toilet paper rolls in his mouth. At this point he will begin to sing his third and final verse. There should be a big gap for you to jump, and then use the last C.S pad. You'll have to be pretty accurate and fast because he'll speed up. Do this as quickly as you can.

, After you get three toilet paper rolls in his mouth, he'll sing a very high note and break the glass. This is when you toss in a final roll.

Beat the Smelter Demon.,
Proceed to the Shaded Woods.",How to Beat the Early Bosses of Dark Souls 2," This is Dark Souls’ tagline, and it is that way for a reason: you will die a lot in this game. That being said, there’s no shame in seeing that “Game Over” message across your screen repeatedly. Dark Souls 2 requires patience and learning to beat it.


Make sure you find each of the area’s bonfires. Bonfires are Dark Souls’ save points.
Use your acquired souls a soon as possible since dying twice without retrieving your souls makes your souls gone forever.;
, Facing the bosses of Dark Souls 2 means going head to head against some of gaming’s toughest bosses. You’re well-advised to study each boss’ movements and patterns. You should also equip weapons and spells appropriate to the boss you’re facing.


Upgrade your armor and weapon if you have souls to spare.
Level up and improve your stats so you can increase your chance of beating the bosses.

, If you have friends online, you can ask for their assistance. Meaning, you can summon them up in your game, and actually join you in your adventure.


You can invite assistance from friends or other players by using an item called the summon sign. Simply use it on the floor, and players can join you from this point.
Without actual friends online, make sure to summon AI players to beat bosses. Summoning AI players requires summoning signs and you should be in human form.

, This is the first boss that you will encounter in Dark Souls 2. Well, at least the one you are supposed to beat first. He’s a huge tree-like creature with a powerful swing. He will also attempt to stomp on you, but you should be able to dodge that easily.


The primary technique to beat the giant is to stay close to him. His stomps may intimidate you, but just roll away from them.
Strike his feet with your weapon and just watch out for the stomps. He will occasionally reposition himself, but no worries, just get close to him again.
Be aware of the battle area. Make sure you don’t to get cornered by this giant.
Once you manage to lessen the giant’s health to 50%, it will remove its arm and use it to hit you. Just the same, keep close to his feet, and you should be fine.
There are times when the giant falls down. Take this opportunity to hit him while he is caught off-guard.

, You will have the chance to battle this boss early in the game on the plaza of the Forest of Fallen Giants. However, that is just an optional battle—you will battle him for real at the top of a nearby tower.


This boss employs speedy attacks, and can really deal serious damage, so watch out.
You can use striking attacks plus lightning for this boss is weak against those.
In order to deal a large amount of damage to the Pursuer, align him with the ballista and fire away. Keep in mind though that he can destroy those ballistas so use them early.
His thrust attacks are unblockable, so don’t bother using your shield against it.
A safe tactic is to just keep your distance, allow him to attack and after he sways his weapon, dodge and counter-attack. It might take a while, but this technique can kill him eventually.

, The Dragonrider is found at Heide’s Tower of Flame, at the base of the tower. Get ready for a close-combat surprise.


You will be fighting the Dragonrider in a small enclosed area, so keep on moving to avoid his attacks. Watch out for the pit surrounding the combat area. One slip, and you’re dead.
The Dragonrider’s weapon is its Halberd. He will continuously lunge at you with it, so do a sidestep all the time. When you’re almost facing his back, that’s the time to attack.
You can summon the AI player Masterless Glencour to assist you just outside the tower’s entrance.
Just keep on circling around this boss, and you will soon beat him.

, Still from Heide’s Tower of Flame comes another boss, the Old Dragonslayer. This boss is just like an upgraded Dragonrider with one difference. This boss can use a few dark magic spells.


You can still use the assistance of Masterless Glencour to beat this boss.
The Old Dragonslayer is susceptible to poison, so use those poison bombs away!
The Old Dragonslayer’s weaknesses are lightning and magic, so when at a distance, you can actually try using magic projectiles towards him, but that’s if your chosen class has access to magic.
This boss is really aggressive, so move a lot. You can also sidestep him, and try to hit his back.
Use your shield to block his sweep attacks.
If playing on Scholar of the First Sin version, watch out for the dragon at the entrance to the arena. Tackle this boss after Mytha so you have a higher healthpool.

, This boss can be easily beaten if you have already mastered how to handle melee-based bosses like the Old Dragonslayer and the Dragonrider. The Flexile Sentry is another melee-oriented boss with two sides; he can employ close- to medium-range attacks.


Use magic on your weapon because it will slightly increase damage dealt to the boss.
You can summon the AI player Lucatiel of Mirrah to assist you in beating this boss. She can be summoned inside the building just facing the stairwell that leads to the left portion of the docks.
Flexile Sentry has two sides: one is a double-sword wielder, and the other one uses clubs to attack you. The club side is way slower than the sword wielder, so use this time to deal damage to him especially after he lands his giant slam at the end of his combo.
While he is recovering from the slam attack, get close to him, and attack with all your stamina. Once he regains his fighting stance, just roll away from him, and recover your stamina. Heal if needed using your Estus Flask.
Watch out for his switching since the sword side of this enemy is more challenging. Good thing your AI companion can keep him busy while you attack the boss’ blind side.

, Don’t be fooled by the Ruin Sentinel, it should actually be “Ruin Sentinels.” You will face not just one but three Ruin Sentinels in the Lost Bastille. These sentinels have pole arms as weapons.


Initially, you will just fight one sentinel, but right after defeating this sentinel, two more sentinels will awaken and fight you simultaneously.
Fight the first sentinel on top of the platform, and just move around until it makes an attack. After attacking, that’s your cue to attack back. Keep your shield up when blocking.
The sentinels are weak against lightning and can be vulnerable to magic, too.
It is almost a requirement for you to summon an AI player to aid you with this difficult boss fight. You can summon this phantom inside a cell just along the corridor towards the boss battle area. The phantom is a magic-type character, so it will help you a lot in defeating the sentinels.
Unlike the previous bosses, getting close to the sentinels all the time is not always a good idea. Since there will be two sentinels going after you, you need to keep your distance where you can see both bosses.
Ranged weapons can be handy in defeating the sentinels. You should just focus your attack on one sentinel and then the next one. Never attempt to finish both sentinels at the same time.
Once you finish off the second sentinel, the third one will be an easy one. If you still have the phantom around, this should be a walk in the park.

, The Lost Sinner is another melee-based boss found at the bottom of Sinner’s Rise area. It wields a great sword and will aggressively attack you when able.


This boss has no elemental weakness, so you need to defeat it with melee-based attacks, too.
The Lost Sinner might be aggressive in her attacks, but equipping a large shield should protect you from her attempts.
Just like how you dealt with the other melee-based bosses, just circle around this boss, and you should be alright. Remember to heal up if she, for some reason, damages you.
This boss is very agile. In times that you are having a hard time landing attacks, you can switch to your projectiles or ranged weapons.

, This boss battle is a riot. You will be faced with multiple gargoyles in a not-so-spacious rooftop. Not only do you have to deal with the gargoyles’ melee attacks, they are all fire-breathing as well. They can also float, so this makes things even more difficult.


These gargoyles are weak against lightning and magic.
Whether you are a melee- or a ranged-attack-oriented player, this boss battle is going to be tough. Enter the battle with lots of estus flasks.
Initially, you will be facing just one gargoyle. Take advantage of this moment because after a few seconds, the other gargoyles will start to awaken.
Expect a lot of running on your part. The idea is to isolate one gargoyle so you could damage it without any distractions from the other gargoyles.
Ironically, when there are lots of bosses in your face, there’s no available AI assistance for this one. Sorry.
If you are a caster type, it will somehow make this boss fight a little easier, but don’t expect it to be easy. Patience and proper movement will win you this boss fight—with a little luck, of course.

, This boss fight is kind of unique. The battle will take place inside the Undead Purgatory in a circular arena. It will mostly be a dodging game, while the other half of the battle is an actual battle with the chariot’s two-headed horse.


The enemy skeletons in this area are weak against fire and slightly against magic. Same goes to the boss himself.
The first part of this boss battle is a matter of dodging the boss’ chariot, and at the same time kill the skeletons that are in the arena. Target the necromancers since they are the ones summoning these undead creatures.
There’s an option for you to roll under the chariot if you are light enough. The timing is a bit tricky though, so you might just want to stick to the conventional way of dodging.
Defeating the horse is somewhat easier compared to the earlier bosses that you have faced. It has a limited number of attacks, so you will get to predict its attacks in no time.
If you have a fire resin, attacking the horse with a fire sword will make the boss fight even easier. Keep this up, and you will end up victorious.

, Technically, you will face three bosses in the Huntsman’s Copse. One lord will be using pyromancy, and the other two are melee attackers.


This battle seems easy at first because of the spacious battleground, but since the Skeleton Lords summon skeleton minions, it makes things a bit complicated.
The skeleton minions seem to be just a nuisance to the boss battle since they are very fragile and easy to beat. They’re just too many!
You can use an item called Alluring Skulls so these pesky skeletons will stop bothering you from finishing the Skeleton Lords.
You can also use this moment to heal up if you are badly damaged.

, You can find this boss inside the Doors of Pharros. Like the Skeleton Lords, this boss also has minions to aid it against you, but rats this time.


The boss and the rat minions are all weak against fire. On the other hand, avoid any poison-based attacks since that’s the rats’ main ability. Needless to say, they are immune to it.
You should clear the area first of rats, so that when the boss jumps down it will be just between you and the Giant Rat.
The Giant Rat only has two distinct attack patterns: the swipe attack, and the jump attack. Both can easily be dodged in a one-on-one.
The best way to inflict damage to the Giant Rat is to its belly, so lock onto the belly as your target. You can roll over under him so you can get more access to its weak point.
Watch out for your stamina. If you’re caught under him with zero stamina, you will take a large amount of damage from it.

, The Covetous Demon is a giant slug that is weak against fire. Magic seems to have an increased damage effect to this boss as well.


The Covetous Demon is mainly a melee-type boss so your strategy is to run around him while attacking whenever possible. Counter-attacking can also be effective.
You can use the pots around the fighting arena that you can smash freeing some undead. This will lure the Covetous Demon to the undead leaving himself open for attacks.
Dealing damage to the Covetous Demon from afar with ranged weapons or projectiles will make this boss battle easier.

, Another boss found in Harvest Valley, she surrounds herself with poison making it almost impossible for you to defeat her as is.


This boss’ ultimate weakness is fire, so better use fire-based weapons or spells to quickly finish the battle.
There is something you must do first to defeat this boss with ease. First, go to the Central Earthen Peak bonfire, and turn around. Just straight ahead is a ledge. Walk right on this ledge and burn the windmill by using your torch. This will eliminate the poison mist in the Baneful Queen Mytha’s lair.
You can summon the AI player Doors of Pharros near the queen’s lair entrance.
Without the poison mist and with AI assistance, this boss battle won’t be that hard to finish off. She will occasionally cast magic, but all of her attacks can be blocked.

, This is one boss who’s a real tough guy. His built is enough to intimidate you, and what more with his flaming personality. This boss can be found at the end of the Iron Keep area. He has close melee attacks and some ranged ones, too.


Because of his built, this boss pauses after every major attack. Use these precious seconds to land attacks, and then back away.
Watch out for his slam attack which also spreads fiery projectiles. Make sure that you are away from him when he employs this attack.
Good thing is that he is vulnerable to attacks after this slam stance. Approach him, and give him a good amount of damage before he goes back to his feet.
You can trigger this slam attack if you get close to him, so just repeat the process until you defeat the boss.

, This marks the last of the early bosses in Dark Souls 2. Another boss in the Iron Keep, but he is an optional one. Meaning, you can move forward in the game without beating this boss. Well, that’s if you don’t want delicious rewards that you can acquire after beating this boss.


This boss is resistant to fire, but can be a bit weak to magic and lightning.
The Smelter Demon will damage you a lot, but since his attacks are mostly fire-based, it is advisable that you wear an armor that is strong against fire.
You cannot be consistently near this boss either since by just being near him you actually lose life. It is called proximity damage.
This boss often cool downs after every huge attack. Use this downtime to your advantage.
Keep your shield up when he does his deadly sword swing.
The best shield that you can use in this battle is the Gyrm Greatshield. It blocks physical and fire damage up to 100%.
With all the boss’ attacks seem powerless, the only thing you should do now is to deal damage to him and beat him.

, After defeating the optional boss, at this point your character is now a fully grown character with strong stats and ready for the next level. Go forth to the Shaded Woods to start on the second set of bosses that are on a higher bracket of evil."

Google a map of the Slender forest on the Internet.,
Start the game.,
Obtain the note in the bathroom at the centre of the map first.,
Take a circular route around the map going out from the bathroom.,
Remember that Slender Man gets faster and faster.,
Be on super alert after the 5th note.,
Don't look behind you when you have 6 pages (unless you have the guts to do so!,
After you collect all 8 notes, stand around until the game ends.",How to Beat Slender: The Eight Pages1," Since you're already on this page, one can be found here. Memorize it till you're certain you'll be able to navigate your way through it. There are 10 unique landmarks, and 8 notes spread randomly amongst them.


There being 10 locations ensures a different game each time. Not finding a note where you expect to find one (if you've been counting on it) is the easiest way to lose the game.;
, Slender Man will not appear before you attain the first note, so use this to your advantage. Turn off your flashlight during this period to save the batteries. It will eventually shut off if you take too long. You may like to spend this ""down time"" checking out the landmarks beforehand to find out where the notes are positioned.


However, you're not allowed to dilly-dally as long as you please. The longer you take between pages, the harder the game will get. You'll know when this initial grace period is over when you hear a stomping sound in the background.

The same sound is heard when you do collect the first page.



, This, in theory, saves you from being ambushed or trapped by Slender Man later. If it's not there, simply continue onwards.


Getting the center out of the way is your best bet. That way, you don't have backtrack at all throughout the game and can work on the outside of the circle. Slender Man can only kill you if you look at him and he is always behind you. Never turn around, never see Slender Man. Simple as pie.

, This reduces the time it takes between notes. Following the main path is a good way of keeping your bearings.


The game will be measuring your sanity level and stamina. Sprint too often, your stamina goes. Lose your cool, your sanity level drops, and the game will be over. Eliminating time between notes and going as quickly as possible doesn't give your levels time to drop in the first place.

, His stalking grows more frenzied for every note you collect. You'll want to keep the flashlight on after about 3, so if and when you turn around, you can immediately double back as soon as you see him.


The music in the background will get more and more intense as you collect notes. To get around this, just hit your mute button. It can be awfully distracting (which is the point).

, If you do see him, line his face up with an object, so you can only see his arm or leg. When he's on the screen, he won't move. Then back away until you're out of range. Then get outta there!


After about 5 notes, he will be right on your tail almost constantly. Peeking at him when he is so close will get your character 'scared' and allow you to sprint very fast. Use this to dash towards the last note/s, but know that it will wear your character out.

,).Slender Man will be right behind you and if you turn around, he will kill you. So keep sprinting until you find the last note.


This is why the bathroom is such a pain in the rear end. If you leave it for later, you'll be constantly turning around, trying to get out of it. You're as good as dead.

, Depending on your version of the game, you will have unlocked a different mode -- a cruel, circular hell for the non-existent player in the game. ""Beating"" the game is sort of a misnomer; you simply get out of the level you were in before.

Unlock ""daytime mode"" in version 0.9.4.,
For version 0.9.5., unlock ""MH mode."",
For version 0.9.7., unlock Marble Hornets mode first.",How to Beat Slender: The Eight Pages2," After collecting all the pages from the first mode, you'll ""wake up"" in the daytime. It probably sounds easier, but it's not. You don't have to worry about your flashlight, but everything else is just as intense.


After ""daytime mode,"" unlock ""$20 mode."" Again with version 0.9.4, if you beat daytime mode, you'll reemerge after the credits once again in the dark. Beating this mode is no different from the standard version except for the fact that you'll hear 20 Dollars by Ron Browz playing in the background.

The reference to this is that some believe that if you give Slender Man $20, he won't kill you. Cheap date, huh?
You can select these modes in the options screen and you can play both simultaneously, if you'd like.



, This will run like a video from Marble Hornets on YouTube, using the entry format. The music is slightly different, the static is more prominent, and it runs like a prerecorded video. Once you get past this, you can then move to daytime mode and $20 mode.

, It's only a slight name change (MH is one in the same, really). $20 mode was removed due to copyright infringement.You also have the options of using a crank lantern and a glow stick. What's more, you can pause the game as long as there isn't static on the screen. The more and more pages you collect, the less you can see. Fog will start rolling in, too.There are also more links in the menu, leading to forums and extra resources, etc.

Deliver a beat down once the counter sequence is over.",How to Beat Slade in Batman: Arkham Origins," It’s not recommended to attack Slade first; he is a skilled fighter and will counter most of your attacks and leave you open for his counterattacks.


Wait for Slade to attack you with his staff, and counter (△ button) him when he does.
Be sure not to spam the counter button. Unlike previous battles and common thug battles, if you press the counter button at the wrong time against Slade, your counter will fail, leaving you vulnerable to his attacks.;
, He will also occasionally attack you, and it will lead into a sequence where you need to press the counter button that will actually appear on-screen. This is the perfect time to attack him.

, If Slade gets too close to them, Batman will throw him towards a different direction, and you'll lose your opportunity to deal some damage.

, After you deal some damage to Slade, he'll throw a smoke pellet and disappear. He'll then attack Batman from the air, and you'll be required to mash the triangle (△) button to counter him.


After successfully countering his attacks, Slade will be left open for a beat down.

, Mash the attack (▘) button; this will continuously deal damage to Slade until Batman knocks Slade’s mask off.

, Do not recklessly attack Slade after mashing his mask off. He will be more dangerous than before, and he also won't let you attack him anymore. Any attempt to land a combo without countering will end up in a counter sequence beneficial to Slade only.

, Eventually, you will be able to land a few hits on him.


Don't be too greedy with damaging Slade though. This battle is pretty long, and he isn't an easy opponent to beat, so it's better to conserve your HP.

, Once you've dealt enough damage, Slade will start using a gadget similar to the Batclaw. Once he fires it, it will attach to Batman's chest, and the other end will grab a canister of gas.


Use the counter button at the right time to send the canister flying at Slade. Quickly run up to Slade and attack him.
If you fail to send the canister to Slade, he will start shooting at you with his gun, so try to send the canisters back as much as you can.

, When Slade’s HP reaches a certain low point, he'll once again throw a smoke pellet and attack you.

, This time, Batman will take Slade's staff and break it in half. In retaliation, Slade will now use his sword.

, Attack Slade first when you get the chance, but be on your guard for possible counters.


Slade will deal a lot of damage to you with that blade, so be careful.

, Other than Slade changing combos and a much more dangerous weapon, the overall feel of the battle won’t change so much, so just continue to counter him while occasionally attacking him yourself.

, Once you drop Slade’s health low enough, he'll drop another smoke pellet and attack you with his blade. Counter like you did with the staff.

, You'll damage Slade enough to end the battle.


A cutscene will then play ending in Slade's defeat.

Admit you are stuck.,
Know what type of game your dealing with.,
Take a break.,
Think back.,
Use the in-game tips.,
Go back.,

, Horror and puzzle games tend to be quite logical and are solvable by just using your head. Adventure games (and most Japanese games as well) lack this kind of logic. For example, unscrewing screws with an owl even though you have a screwdriver in your pocket. (really) As soon as you know what type of game you're dealing with, you can think in that kind of logic.

, If it's a game from a series, think back (if you've ever played the previous games) how the puzzles were like. Also consider what the puzzles were like in the game itself.

, Sometimes the game gives you tips itself. Don't refuse to use them. If a game gives you tips it means it is a hard part and everybody struggles with it.

, If possible, go back or use a previous save. Sometimes, signs and conversations that seemed meaningless at the time, now reveal something important to finish a puzzle.

Impede the cure.",How to Beat Fungus Brutal Mode in Plague Inc," Fungus can be an extremely difficult level, especially on Brutal, so you'll want to choose the proper genes to help you get through. If you don't have the following genes available, choose anything else that you prefer or which is close.









DNA Gene - Metabolic Hijack or Cytochrome Surge. Metabolic Hijack will automatically pop red and orange bubbles. This is useful as all the red bubbles show up immediately when using the fungus’s spore abilities. Cytochrome Surge will give you more DNA from orange bubbles.
Travel Gene - Suppression. This helps the gene cross country borders. Don’t boost planes or ships as the fungus gene is hard to transmit through these methods.
Evolution Gene - Patho-Stasis. This gene stops the increase of DNA costs which you will rely heavily on.
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic or Creationist. Both of these options will make it harder to cure the fungus.
Environment Gene - Extremophile. This will allow the fungus to get a bonus in all environments, helping it spread on land. If you don't have this option, pick the boost that will most benefit your starting country.;
, There is a lot of debate as to the best country to start in for the fungus level. China seems to be a popular option as the dense population will allow the fungus to spread faster. 








China seems to be the most reliable option due to its large population, ports, and large land mass.
Other countries you may want to consider starting in are Madagascar or India. Other guides suggest starting in Norway to make infecting Greenland and Iceland easier.
Saudi Arabia and South Africa can also generate a win.
You want to pick a country with a high population and ports.

, If people start to notice symptoms with fungus, a cure will quickly be developed and you will most likely lose.









The key to surviving is to devolve any symptoms that randomly mutate before the symptoms can raise awareness of your fungus. You will need to devolve symptoms throughout the game. The fungus will automatically develop new symptoms, so keep an eye out to quickly devolve.
You may want to consider the Translesion + gene if you are having difficulty with costs to devolve. This gene stops cost increases when devolving.

, At the beginning of the game, your focus should be on improving the resistances and transmission properties of your fungus. Evolve the following abilities and transmissions in order to help spread your disease: 








Water and Air Transmission 1.
Bird 1 can also help due to the fungus in bird droppings. But this transmission isn't always necessary.
Drug, Heat, and Cold Resistance 1.
After you’ve updated these to level 1, focus on your Spore Burst abilities before continuing to level 2.

, Spore Burst is the fungus' special ability, and can make spreading the fungus to other countries much easier.









Keep evolving Spore Bursts until you get the Spore Hardening ability.
Each time you purchase a Spore Burst, a new country will be automatically infected.
Save a few Spore Bursts for the end of the game to infect any hard-to-reach countries. Saving a few bursts can help you get Greenland if you haven’t infected it yet.

, At this point, you will be essentially waiting for the fungus to spread. The Spore Burt ability should be doing a lot of the infection work for you, so you just need to focus on improving the fungus' resistance. Evolve the following:









Drug, Heat, and Cold Resistance 2.
Environmental Hardening.

, Now that your fungus has been hardened, you can improve the transmission abilities so you can infect other countries easier. Evolve the following transmissions:









Water and Air Transmission 2.
Extreme Bioaerosol. Once you’ve upgraded Air and Water you will have the ability to upgrade to Extreme Bioaerosol. This boost allows the pathogen to bypass air/water filters, increasing the likelihood it survives overseas travel. , You still need to keep your fungus hidden. Immediately devolve any symptoms that appear while you are improving the fungus.









If you haven’t infected the entire world, any symptoms which are found will immediately destroy your chances of winning. Because your fungus has infected people but isn’t killing anyone yet, a cure is easy to reach.

, This is especially useful for difficult countries like Greenland, Iceland, and Madagascar.









You can now use your remaining Spore Bursts to infect these countries without having to wait for the fungus to spread naturally.
Try to avoid using your Spore Bursts until the likelihood of these countries being the targets is high. You may have to be patient as you wait for natural infection to other regions first.
Keep an eye on symptoms until you can use Spore Burst and Spore Eruption to infect each country.

, Do not start evolving symptoms until you receive the message that “No one is healthy” and the world has been completely infected by the fungus. If you start evolving symptoms too early, the research for the cure will quickly overtake your fungus.









Wait until you get the “No one is healthy” pop-up before evolving any symptoms. If your world looks red and the infected counter stops moving, but you don’t see the pop-up, it’s likely a natural disaster killed some people.

, As soon as you receive word that your fungus has spread to every person, unleash your worst symptoms upon them. Aim to evolve the following symptoms for maximum lethal impact:









Coughing.
Pneumonia.
Necrosis (optional if you have enough points).
Pulmonary Edema.
Pulmonary Fibrosis.
Total organ failure.
Coma.
Insanity.
Since everyone is now infected, don’t waste points or time on symptoms which are aimed at spreading the disease. Focus on those symptoms which lead to casualties. Your plague should be as fatal as possible.

, As you wait for the population to die off, spend some of your points to keep the cure at bay. Evolve the following abilities:









Genetic ReShuffle 1, 2, 3.
Genetic Hardening 1 and 2.
This can also help you to get a higher score as you will win with a lower cure percentage.

, (This is automatic), Fairly straightforward. To get the sapphire, take the steps up, and jump onto the somewhat hidden platform at the top of the screen. You won't be able to see yourself, but make a blind jump and try to land into the gap between the spike and block. From here it's a mad rush to the exit to get the 7 second sapphire., To get the sapphire on this one, simply wait for the row of spikes to pass by, and go off-screen to the right. From there, try to land near the exit., Just avoid all the drugs, and keep going right. Don't press the left key. This may take a few tries because drugs are spawned randomly from the right side of the screen., This is more puzzle than it is action. To get the sapphire, you'll need to make it all the way to the platform directly under the finish line before the first line of spikes passes by. There, hit the bottom of the finish line, in order to get a time boost to reach the 6 second sapphire.
, This is very hard, it will take a few hundred tries at least. You'll need to make it to the bottom and time your drop before the first row of continuous spikes pass by (five spikes in a row with no gap), from there, rush your way up to the exit. There's no need to jump up to the single platform on the top-left, as it will waste your time. Find the best way and be efficient here for the sapphire., At the start of the level, drop left and hold right. This will save you two jumps, which is needed for the sapphire. There's no need to rush on this level, because the achievement is not for time but for the number of jumps. If you do everything right you should have exactly five jumps., Don't rush to the right at the beginning. You won't make it. Instead, wait for the blocks to switch into spikes, and jump to the right before the very moment that the spikes turn back into blocks. This should give you a ""boost"" or a few blocks advantage. Getting the star here is relatively easy., There are no shortcuts to this level. Make a route to the star, and to the exit. It IS possible, trust me on this one. There are hidden platforms under the star., The timing for the sapphire is much more forgiving on this one. Otherwise, it's pretty straightforward., Keep running right. In a few tries you should understand how it goes. In order to get the sapphire, which requires you to never let go of the right arrow key, just hold the left arrow key when you want to stop. Basically, instead of releasing the right arrow key to stop moving right, hold BOTH the left and right arrow keys to stop., Again, pretty straightforward. It all goes down to the timing here to see if you are fast enough to get the star (and the sapphire), The weak point of the boss is the flashing thing on its head. To get all 5 stars, collect the first 4 before you trigger the lava (it is triggered by attacking the boss for the first time). Using the platform that falls down when you attack him for the first time, the fifth star should be accessible. Attack him again, then again, and the goal should finally appear. (With some really fast rising lava!)

Make a rule that any website that seems like an MMOG needs to be looked at first.,
If a site looks bad, ban it.,
If it looks good, allow it.,
If it says age group not allowed, they can't play!,

Decide on a budget.,
What games will you play?,
What do your friends have?,Understand what type of gaming you will be doing, console is fine for console but a more hardcore gamer may wish to go with a P.C, most E-sports takes place on P.C

",How to Choose Between PC and Console Gaming," An Xbox 360 costs roughly $300, and more for accessories. A PlayStation 3 will cost you the same price. This is obviously a lot cheaper than going out and building an intense gaming rig! If you've got a lot of money, go crazy with a gaming computer. Not so easy to let go of your hard-earned money, and buy yourself a console.;
, Consider what type of games you enjoy. If you enjoy MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft, Aion or Age of Conan, you want a PC. If you want to play RTS games such as League of Legends or Starcraft 2, go for a PC. If you want to play FPS games, I recommend a P.C for tactical shooters, a console if you want to only play Call of Duty. Want to play sports games? Go with a console.

, If all of your friends have a PS3, well, go buy one! But if all of your friends are talking on Steam and enjoying PC gaming, go that route.

Read the character info in the game guide.,
Choose a powerful class that you think fits you.,
Get recommendations from other players.,
Pick a class that is beneficial to your team.",How to Choose a Good Class in an MMORPG," Usually this will give you a summary of what it's like, such as what weapons the class uses, or its dominant skills. Do this first, because you can usually get a feel for what you think you like the best and what you definitely do not want to play. The game guide could also tell you about the skills and attributes of the class.;
, Don't be a warrior just because the graphic looks so awesome. Play your strengths, such as your team skills. If you are used to playing a mage in the other MMORPG's, then play a mage. You will be more familiar about what fits a mage. If you are usually a warrior, and you pick a mage, you might think that your character can take more hits then it really can.

, This can be done by going to the forums, or asking a friend if he plays. Sometimes the classes are unbalanced, and one class is superior to another. Get reviews from multiple people, because what one person thinks may be different from another.

, If you have a team, and they have a warrior, rogue, and berserker; you may want to pick a mage or archer because that team needs a ranged attacker. If the team is rogue, rogue, rogue; pick a healer because there is already high damage, but low defenses=more damage to them. The classes are below:

Warrior. These are the high defense, medium strength type. Usually used for tanking, they can withstand high hits and protect a team from dangerous monsters. The use a sword and shield, as well as metal armor. They can go solo, which means a team isn't necessary. Good for solo people, or confident/experienced players.






Mage. These are the ranged attackers that have high attack, but low defenses. They are used best with a tanker, so it doesn't get attacked. This class also usually has Area of Effect and Damage over Time attacks, which help destroy opponents. They use staves and wands. This is best for team players that want to do some damage.






Healer. Also called cleric, they are the healer and usually buffer (giving boosts to stats for a period of time) of the team. They really need a team to play with, because they have okay defense but minimal attacking skills. The use maces, bows, or small magic attacks. This class is great for team players that want to help other people.






Archer. These are also ranged attackers. However, they sacrifice a little damage for more armor; meaning that these can also solo if you kite (run away, then attack, and repeat. You get hit a few times through this). They use bows and crossbows, and sometimes throwing items. This is best for the new player, because you are relatively safe from monsters.






Rogue. High damage, low defenses. The melee version of the mage, you need a lot of money to maintain this guy due to the need of health restorers. He is good if you have a tanker, and you want to destroy the enemy nice and quick. This class uses darts, throwing items, daggers, and bows.






Berserker. A slightly more armored rogue, this class dual-wields axes and swords. Good for chopping down an enemy's health, and then letting a tanker take over. More experienced players should use this, as this guy is sort of hard to handle.

Decide on demographics.,
Strongly consider the Wii if you're energetic.,
Choose your budget.,
Decide how big of a library you need and what kind of games you want.,
Compare features.,
Weigh the importance of watching next-generation DVDs.",How to Choose a Game Console," At the risk of overgeneralizing, Nintendo has traditionally targeted kids and families, Microsoft's Xbox is a ""guy"" console, and Sony's PlayStation caters to a variety of crowds.;
, Nintendo's new motion-sensing controller provides the most physically active experience of the three consoles.


If you want a family console, Wii is definitely the best choice.

, Here at the dawn of the 7th generation of console gaming, Sony PlayStation 3 costs $400, Microsoft Xbox 360 costs $250, $300, or $400 (depending on equipment), and Nintendo's Wii is the low-price leader at $250. Traditionally, the winner of the previous generation of consoles lasts into the next era, so the $130 PlayStation 2 should also be readily available for a few years.

, As in past years, PlayStation is predicted to have the greatest number of titles, and thanks to backward compatibility (not present in all console versions) also has an enormous back catalog of games from PlayStation 1 and 2. The Wii also brings back the retro-games with it's ""virtual console."". The Xbox 360 has great online features and exclusive games like GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned, The Halo series, and many other Xbox exclusive games.

, Nintendo's lack of a DVD player and hard drive account for much of its lower price; Microsoft and Sony add things like storage capacity and better cables at their more expensive price points. But, with broadband Internet connection, the Wii can go online with Opera and even to sites with Flash 7! Currently developing WiFi technology will also allow more multi-player play.

, As Blu-Ray compatibility is a key selling point of the PlayStation 3, it also accounts the most for the large price. The Wii is still developing it's DVD system, but it might be released only within Japan.

"
"
Consider what value each console has to you and if the price can be justified by it to you.,
Consider which most of your friends have in case you want to play online with them.

,
Consider the systems exclusive or extra features.For example the PS3 has Blu-Ray capabilities, a user upgradable hard drive,and Cross Platform compatibility with PlayStation Vita, while Xbox has SmartGlass, Backwards compatibility with most original Xbox titles, more ports and AV outputs, and official support for transportable game saves.

,
Consider which would be better for you: Xbox Live or PSN, Xbox Live is a Premium Service where most features are inaccessible if not active, while PSN offers a PS+ service with its own benefits for $10 less.

,Consider which motion control platform would be better suited for you or your family

,Consider the track record of the manufacturer and any previous experience with them or their consoles, also remember to consider reliability issues with either console

,
Consider which has more of what you want, whether it be features, games, exclusive content, etc.

The DS is a portable gaming console made by Nintendo. It features 2 screens in a clam shell design, the bottom screen being a touch screen. It has a 67 MHz ARM946E-S processor, a secondary 33 MHz ARM7TDMI co-processor, and 4MB of RAM. It can utilise Wi-Fi connections. It uses GBA cartridges and DS game cards. It has a D-pad, A B X and Y buttons, Start and Select buttons, 2 triggers, and a power button. It has two separate 3 inch (7.6 cm) TFT LCD screens, each with a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels. DS game cards can currently support up to 128MB of data, with a little space left for saves. The system is theoretically capable of rendering 120,000 triangles per second at 30 frames per second.






The Playstation Portable (PSP) is a portable multimedia console made by Sony. It features a standard design with a D-pad, an analogue stick, the PlayStation face buttons, Start and Select, and 2 triggers. Unlike the DS, it only has one screen. It features a 43 inch (7.6 cm) TFT LCD screen, with a 480×272 resolution, and capable of 16.77 million colours. It has 32 MB main RAM and 4 MB embedded DRAM. It is is supposedly capable of rendering 33 million flat-shaded polygons per second, with a 664 million pixel per second fill rate. The PSP uses UMD (Universal Media Disks) which can hold up to 1.8GB of data. It has a MagicGate Memory Stick Duo slot for save games, movies, music, and photos.






GamePark Caanoo is mostly used for retro-gaming. Its an open platform, great for homebrew and emulators.





;
,


The PSP's games are usually popular games that may be specially made for the PSP or ports of popular PS2 games. They usually take advantage of the PSP's superior processing power and media.
The DS has many games appearing only on DS, many utilising the DS's touch screen, microphone, and/or dual screens. They are mostly simple and user friendly, offering new gamers a chance to start. They are also mostly child-friendly.
The DS's games mostly use interactivity and uniqueness to make up for its less powerful specifications. This is good if you're a new gamer, or you're buying a portable console for children. Games continue popular series' like Zelda, Pokemon, Mario, and Advance Wars.
The PSP's games most often try to take advantage of its 1.8GB UMD disks, and its CPU that is 3 times more powerful than that of the DS, and it's memory, which there is 8 times more of. Many games use the full extent of the PSP's processing capabilities for graphics rivalling that of the PS2, however they do suffer on interactivity.

,


The PSP has good, but unofficial support for homebrew (homemade games). There are many homebrew applications and games that can be accessed by placing them on a Memory Stick Duo and running them from the PSP.
The DS also has support for homebrew, but one must first purchase a flash cart in order to use it. However, it does not have such a striving homebrew community.

,


The PSP has some good multimedia functions. It can play mp3 and mp4 files placed on the Memory Stick Duo, as well as show images in several popular formats. You also have the option of setting a background.
The NDS also has potential for multimedia, but one must also utilise a flash cart.

Aim for killstreaks.",How to Become Better at First Person Shooter Video Games," Most likely people who are more experienced will kill you more frequently, but that's all normal. Take time to get used to how they play, get used to your surroundings as that can be crucial if you are going to survive in any FPS games. Get to know your weapons and how each will fire, what rate they will, and the distance it's best used at.

Play the single-player campaign. This will help familiarize yourself with the guns, environment, etc.
Play online. You will only get better if you play with real opponents, as opposed to AI's. The more you practice, the better you will become. Remember, it's okay to be ""bad"", as long as you know you're improving, that's the key!;
, This is very important. Shooting, crouching, reloading, etc. Knowing these inside and out is imperative., Familiarize yourself with the surroundings, vantage points, chokepoints, and other features (depending on the game). It's very helpful to have the know-how on these maps as when you can navigate them easily, you can get the drop on the enemy. Additionally, experiment with different routes that will help familiarize yourself. You'll know where you're going, which is always to your advantage., Different players have different playing styles, and some find them more quicker than others. Find yours as quick as possible, whether it be going defensive or offensive, and you'll more than likely have fun, killing others.,

Sometimes, however, you will need to vary your weapon usage, e.g if your weapon runs out of ammunition and you must pick up an enemies... so it's good to be familiarized generally with different weapons.
Additionally, in most FPS games usage of a weapon (x amount of kills, x amount of headshot kills) will reward you with extra XP points, so it is a good tactic for quick leveling up!

, Certain roles demand different qualities... if you play with an SMG (Submachine gun) you may want to employ a perk which allows extended running times (Marathon, Extreme Conditioning, Lightweight), for example. Knowing what suits you will really help your ability! Experiment with different classes, weapons, and explosives, depending on what's available., Grenades are great for picking up kills and clearing objectives, especially in game modes where the enemy is capturing somewhere, throwing a grenade in can get you a nice amount of kills! Stun/Flashbang grenades are also great for incapacitating the enemy, creating an easy kill, especially if somebody is 'camping' (staying in a certain given area)., The best times to reload is when you find cover. If you're in the middle of a battlefield and you're low on ammo while your opponent has full ammo, use your secondary, run to the nearest cover you can find, and reload there. It could be the difference between life and death!, KDR (Kill/Death Ratio) is only a minor part of an FPS match. Always stay with the team, and you can be able to ambush the opposing team. The best tactics are that you always have an attacking section and a defensive section. Even if you're either one of them, always try to communicate with others. It could save your team, and yourself., Learn about where you were killed and why. Was it because you were in open space and was shot by a sniper? Next time, walk in an irregular pattern so that your movements are unpredictable and makes it harder for the sniper to kill you. This is one of the best ways to improving your FPS skills.

When you're killed, or do something that gets you in to a bad situation, reflect upon it. 'What could I have done to have averted this?' Then put that into action. Learn from your mistakes and do not blame others for them.

, You can often adjust the buttons on your controller to suit your play style. After you are more comfortable, you may want to change the sensitivity so that you can turn quicker., If you manage to get a certain amount of kills without dying, in some FPS games there are rewards. Within the gaming realm of Call of Duty, these are 'Killstreaks'. Try to use team-helping killstreaks such as an enemy locator (UAV/Spy Plane)."

Sit properly.,
Be hygienic.,
Remember that confidence is key.,
Ensure your eye fixations are in good condition.,
Keep skilled through practice.",How to Become a More Focused Gamer," While playing a video Game, it is best to sit down in a nice sturdy chair. The best posture is sitting down, with both feet on the ground, at a 100-degree angle. This takes pressure off the back and helps with comfort.;
, Take a shower, even if it's a quick three-minute navy shower. Wash and dry off your hands and face well, dry and comb your hair, and wear comfortable clothing! It makes a big difference. Another good tip to get your reflexes nice and jittery is to wash with some sort of mint body wash. Mint leaves a nice cooling sensation on the body, which generally leads to good comfort.


Avoid having greasy hands by any and all means. This may become difficult if your hands are moisturized; in that case, go and do something else until they feel wet without actually looking wet. Dry off with a hand towel, and see if they are still greasy. If they are, just wait it off-maybe go to GameFAQs to get/give some help!







, And of course, the next logical step would be to be confident. And make sure to write ""gaming"" on that list you're making! Don't just be generally confident; be gaming-confident., If you wear contacts, make sure they are not dry. If you wear glasses, make sure they are clean.

, Finally, have a lot of fun. There's not much one can say on either, except that just keep doing what makes you tick.

Brainstorm a list of features you might want in your own game.,
Write a Business Plan where you answer these questions:


What is my game?,
Get on a MMOCC (Massive Multiuser Online Communities) forum to keep in touch with specialized coders and graphic designers.

,
Hire a team of coders and designers to make your idea real.,
Put a limit date to the release of your project, to allow your team to start coding and designing, you will have to coordinate that well if you want to keep things going smoothly.,
Check some tutorials about ""how to lead a work team"" and related stuff.,
Buy a domain name and a hosting service.,
Find users that will give life to the community.Advertise, and consider offering some type of prizes to the first users.

,
Start conquering the market.",How to Create a Virtual Community," Don't worry about the difficulty of programming your idea or designing it, just write. Watch other communities to get inspired and try to analyze what community users need, to feed them.;

Know what kind of programming language you want to use (Lingo, ActionScript, etc.)
Compile a list of objectives you wish to complete within certain time periods
Team members (which will be accomplished with the next step)
Competitors and brief information about them.

,, You can do this by:


Paying them.
Persuading them that your project rocks and creating a partnership with them.
Finding investors through donations, family, venture capital investments, etc.

, WARNING! ++this is the most difficult step++

, Remember that if you don't lead the project, nobody will lead it for you.

, If your community is for a big scale, then rent a Virtual Private Server (5k users online). Also don't forget about starting announcing your game on different forums, blogs, through messengers and email. Keep in mind that the best advertising is the ""tell a friend"".

,, At that time you will have some capital from the payment methods, so you will be able to pay for marketing campaigns.

Know the level earlier.",How to Become a Master Gamer," As with any game it takes just as much practice. Although, it does take less physical action.;
, Your game should be something you will not easily get bored playing. It has to keep you interested. Remember you will be advancing beyond the low levels of the game and that it might take a while to accomplish. Remember, try to choose a game which has online capabilities so you can show off your skills and get better at the game. Online is harder than single player in most cases so you will improve even more online. Games like Call of Duty and Star Wars Battlefront 2 have this.

, If it is a computer game and you are using a keyboard and mouse, know which keys perform which functions. Usually the game manual or help will give you this information. If it is a console game or you are using a control-pad or joystick, know all the buttons and what action they accomplish.

, If you can't make it through the single player, chances are you won't last long in multiplayer

, Begin the game on the beginner level. When it becomes too easy move to the next level.

, Don't get frustrated if you do poorly at first. Figure out what you are doing wrong and fix it. When you reach the highest level, return to the lowest level and move up to the highest again just to make sure you got it.

, If there are any, they can save a lot of time.

, Impress your friends by showing them up in head-to-head or just round play. Also if you're under the age of 17 and you're playing an M rated game, prepare yourself to be the main target of everyone in the game, because you're not supposed to be there.

Self respect for yourself and others during online play

, The last thing you want is to be totally obsessed with a game. Also, playing a game too much can lower how well you play it.

, Know the story of game before playing. It will give ideas about game.

, Look for what to do in the game. Every game has that and is displayed on the screen while starting a new game (At most times) or in the pause menu some games have it there too.

Play a multitude of games.,
Choose a gaming platform.,
Determine a genre of game that you excel at.,
Determine if you will entertain or compete.,
Research popular techniques and tactics.,
Watch videos of professional games.,
Talk to other players.,
Practice playing the game.,
Join a team.,
Join a gaming league.,
Compete in online tournaments.,
Go to LAN tournaments.,
Try to get sponsorship.,
Build up your online profile.,
Stay respectful and centered.",How to Become a Professional Gamer," Unless you already excel at a game, you'll have to find which types of games that you enjoy playing. Some of the most popular kinds of games that exist include first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategies (RTS), multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBA), card games, and fighting games.Try out different titles and determine which games you like the best.


Popular MOBAs include League of Legends, DOTA 2, and Heroes of the Storm.
A popular real-time strategy game is Starcraft 2.
Popular competitive FPS games include Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, and Overwatch.;
, Certain games, like Super Smash Brothers and Counter-Strike, are only available for one gaming platform. Possible gaming platforms include the Wii U, Xbox, Playstation, or the PC. Decide if you like to use the controller or a mouse and keyboard. Look at various titles for different platforms and choose a game on a platform that you like to use.

, Once you've played a variety of games, you'll have a good understanding of which games that you're best at. If a game comes naturally to you, or if you really enjoy playing a particular style of game, continue to pursue that specific genre. If you're good at micro-managing a lot of units on the screen and have a strategic mindset, you should play an RTS. If you have really good game awareness and aim, try playing an FPS. Figure out what game genre suits you and pursue that game.


If you have a good understanding of sports strategy, you could play sports games professional like FIFA.
If you're really good at a control, look into different fighting games like Ultra Street Fighter IV and Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3., While ""professional gamer"" typically refers to people who compete in tournaments for money, the term has evolved over the last decade. Some people now make a living broadcasting their gameplay and interacting with fans as streamers. While not a professional gamer in a traditional sense, being a streamer is a way that you can make money professionally by playing games. Consider being an entertainer or streamer rather than a professional competitive gamer if you can't find a game that you're good at.

, There is a multitude of different content on the internet that helps prospective pro gamers work on their techniques. Look on websites like YouTube for video tutorials on how to do popular techniques and read articles about different tactics or strategies that you can use. The more knowledge that you have over all aspects of the game that you play, the better you'll be at the game.

, A great resource for knowledge in professional gaming tactics exists in professional tournaments and games that you can watch online. Find recently recorded content and pay close attention to lead players in games from around the world. Watch their strategies and try to extrapolate what they do in your own play style.

, Build your network of friends within the community that you're in. Talk to gamers that play the same game and try to pick their brain about skills and tactics that they use. If you're particularly impressed by a player, talk to them to get an understanding of their mentality and strategy and try to incorporate their tactics into your own gameplay. Be open to criticism so that you can improve.Use in-game chat and friend lists to communicate to players that you play with in the game.
You may also be able to contact other players via social media or on message boards.

, Becoming a professional gamer isn't a part-time hobby. Many players have reached the peak of efficiency and have played for thousands of hours. This often translates to muscle memory that can't be duplicated with natural skill. Professional gamers typically stay on a regimented schedule, practicing anywhere from 6 to 12 hours a day. In order to stay competitive, you'll have to be able to stick to a similar schedule.Challenge yourself and play against people who are at your skill level or above your skill level to improve.
Other than playing the main game, there are often mods for games that allow you to drill specific techniques. Take advantage of these mods when practicing.

, If you plan on playing a team game, it's important that you begin to play with a set group of players. Look at online message boards or use chat programs to friend other players. Make sure to use a communication device like Discord, Teamspeak, or Skype so that you can talk about strategies and tactics. Start to play regularly with the same players so that you can get used to their play style. Sometimes individual skill matters less than good team chemistry.


Even if you are playing a single player game, like a fighting game, being able to converse and communicate with other players who want to help build your skills will help you improve dramatically.
Playing with a set team will help develop your communication skills and will give you valuable experience.

, Gaming leagues allow a team to compete in a seasonal competition that leads up to a tournament for a championship. There are also other features that some gaming leagues have, like the ability to find other teams to practice or ""scrim"" against. Look online for a gaming league that has a season for the game that you like to play and register for the upcoming season.


Popular leagues include KeSPA, ESL, ESEA, and MLG.

, The reward for winning an online tournament is recognition and sometimes a cash prize. Find tournaments for the game that you like to play online and follow the registration process. For some games, there will be an entry fee that you may have to pay to compete.


Popular gaming tournaments include the League of Legends World Championships, Intel Extreme Masters, and Heroes of the Dorm., Going to tournaments in-person is the next step in becoming a professional gamer. Once you consistently win online, the natural progression is to compete in live tournaments. Start off with smaller local tournaments until you increase your skill so that you can compete at a higher level.


Even if you don't qualify or can't register for LAN tournaments, attending them as a spectator can give you insight into the environment of a LAN tournament.
The largest gaming tournaments include The International, Smite World Championship, LoL World Championship, COD World Championship, and the WGL Grand Finals., Getting sponsored by a company means that they will pay you a fee or give you free merchandise to advertise their product. Advertising could include having links to their products in video descriptions, live-stream feeds, or wearing their merchandise when you're in the public eye. Sponsors typically require a conversation or presentation about how you bring value to the brand, how many viewers or fans you have, and where and when you can advertise their brand for them. Contact different brands and talk about sponsorship opportunities to get started.If you join an established gaming team, they will already have some sponsors for their players.
Great sponsors for professional gamers include clothing companies, energy drink companies, hardware companies, software companies, and computer accessory companies.

, The more that other players and fans of the game know you, the more likely your name will be thrown around in gaming conversations. Be available and present and build a profile online. Update your Twitter regularly and let people know when you're streaming your gameplay. Network with fans and other players via social media and be willing to do things like photo shoots and interviews.


Try to talk to popular players for the game you're trying to specialize in by reaching out to them on social media.
Meet with other players and fans at live tournaments and LANs.

, Being a professional gamer means being somewhat of a celebrity. That means that everything that you say or post on social media will most likely be saved forever. Bad comments or behavior like cheating could get you banned for life and ruin your career. Always stay humble and aim to learn as much as you can from your peers and competitors. Avoid getting overly angry when you lose and try to center yourself and concentrate even when you're under a lot of pressure.

Find your groove.,
Be tricky.,
Pick your targets.,
Crunch the numbers.,
Pay attention to damage efficiency.,

Handicap yourself for practice.,
Don't camp or repeatedly use ""unfair"" advantages, such as vehicles.,
Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for tips from your fellow gamers.",How to Beat Your Friends at Video Games," Whether you are shooting Nazis or scoring touchdowns, you need to be able to see everything that is going on around you. Learning maps helps with this, but the best way to maximize your view of the field of play is to have ""shifty eyes"". You don't need to keep looking at your character; trust me, they will be there when you look back at them. Look around. Watch for people sneaking up behind you or trying to move around to the side.;
, Take a few hours to learn all the power-ups, the location of items, and how to do special moves and combos. Being able to do even one complicated move could be the difference between victory and button-mashing defeat.

, There lots of clearly stated, observable, or calculable rules that have a bearing on play. A good example is weapon balance in Halo games. It takes exactly 8 Battle Rifle shots to the body to kill an opponent with depleted shields and full armor in Halo 2. These little nuances are the most important part of building a strategy quickly in the middle of a game.

, Memorize where buttons are on the controllers; pressing the wrong button often leads to defeat.

, Only attacking an opponent will leave you vulnerable. Likewise, only defending will prevent you from ever defeating anyone. Sometimes, it is good to hide or run away, even though it might be more fun to try to pull off that amazingly difficult winning move.

, Chances are you and your friends won't all like the same characters, teams, weapons, et cetera. Find the one that works for you. Most games have enough choices that you will be able to find one that fits you perfectly.

, If the ""expected"" thing to do would be to run right in the front gate, then do the unexpected, try finding a side entrance or laying a trap, unless the unexpected is expected, then you do the expected and walk through the front gate!

, Don't make a move at every opportunity; the best players are hunters, not waiters.

, Learn how much damage you do with each hit in a set amount of time, and how many hits you can get off safely whether it be ammo in your gun or punches from your fighter. Learning your DPS (damage per second) is crucial when you want to get good with a game. It is the difference between playing more defensively when you're weaker or full out aggression when you can ""Tank n' Spank"" your way to victory.

, Have that really strong attack that takes a couple seconds to pull off? While that single attack might be impressive and flashy it isn't the optimal way to play. Weaker but quicker attacks may not be flashy on their own, but they will be a lot easier to chain together. The look on your enemies face will be worth it when you have them ""Perma-stunned"".

, Just learning what the mechanics are isn't all of it. You need to learn every single detail of the game. Have an attack that missed your opponent, but it seemed like it hit? He might have learned that he has some invulnerability frames during that time, or you might not realize that FPS you're playing is ""hit-scan"" rather than projectile based. Mastering these under the hood mechanics will surprise your friends and make every game you play an entirely different experience.

, No one can play a game for five hours straight and maintain a continuous level of focus and skill, especially when you are training on your own. Make a sandwich. Write a poem. Just do something that does not require you to look at a screen at least a few minutes every hour.

, Try to beat the hardest boss on the hardest settings only using your worst weapon. When playing multiplayer games where you are part of a team, volunteer to join the team that has the highest chance of losing. Eventually, your friends won't be much of a challenge at all.

, While you might end up with the highest score at the end of the round, it takes no skill to get in a tank and blast away; it does not make you a GOOD player, just a lame one. Camping just leads to annoyed friends and less invitations to play.

, Most players are more than willing to share their strategies. Read strategy guides online. There are several free websites with plenty of good advice.

Know what kind of RPG games you like.",How to Choose the Right Role Playing  Game," For example, do you like the RPGs that make you take turns, or are you more of real time attack kind of person?





 

First Hand Shooters are awesome. A good first hand shooter to play is Metroid Prime: Hunters on the Nintendo DS. In fact that's is another thing to consider...






Console or Portable? This question will be a big help. Are you of the on-the-run kind of gamer, or are you more of a must-concentrate kind.






Grid based RPGs can get pretty boring, but if you like this type, by all means get it.






Adventure RPGs always get a lot of rave, so you might also consider getting this one.;

Keep your eye on the processor.,
Keep an eye on the PC's memory.,
Get the right graphics card associated with the PC.,
Consider a few extras.",How to Choose the Best Desktop for Gaming," The processor in your desktop is going to have a significant impact on your computer's performance. If you're looking for a processor that has a lot of bang for the buck and won't completely empty your savings account keep your eye open for Intel's i7 six-core line.


If you really want to pull out all of the stops you can take a step up and go with an AMD processor that touts as many as eight cores, but be aware that you're looking to spend quite a bit more if you take this route.;
, Titles like World of Warcraft, Diablo 3 and most FPSs put a lot of pressure on a system's memory. Eight GB of ram should be the lowest you want to go, with 16 being the benchmark. If you're looking to overclock the PC, then keep an eye out for DDR3-2133 memory.

, While integrated graphics will get you by for you lower end games, such as most things of the Google Play or Chrome store, anything above that demands a higher quality card.


The top quality graphics cards on the market right now sit with AMD and Nvidia. For a mid-line graphics card you should be okay with 1 to 2GB such as a card from the AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce Gt series.

, Most computer setups you get from a retailer will come standard with a keyboard and mouse, but these are often your basics and aren't designed with the gamer in mind.


Mechanical keyboard are going to give you the best response rate and come with a really tactile feel that gives you assurance that you're hitting your mark.
Noise cancelling headphones can also be a great thing to keep in mind to get the most out of all those water ripples, gun shot re-verbs and background ambiance.

Use your resources.,
Once you get a decent collection, organize them!,
Enjoy your collection!",How to Collect Video Games (Teens)," You can make a list of the producers of the consoles then list all of their created systems, then choose to or not to pursue them at first. For example, Microsoft has probably the smallest amount, at 3 console including the Xbox One. So, use your resources (if you're a gamer, you should be resourceful) and look around for the consoles of your choice.;
, If you chose the PS2, maybe GTA or God of War are some good starting titles. Xbox, choose Halo: Combat Evolved or Halo 2, both great games. Nintendo systems, any Pokémon, Mario, Zelda or Metroid game will work. Your game library is just as important as your console passion.

, Research your desired console then evaluate prices. Gaming and collecting are arts, don't become the slob of the gamers.

, As stated earlier, if you are in fact a gamer, then you should be resourceful. Ask around your school, look on various web sites, go to yard sales, thrift shops, etc. to see if anything is available. Your friend might have a rare console like the Virtual Boy and would like to sell it for a good price. Use caution when going on web sites like eBay. Amazon turns into eBay when looking for used items. Look for the full console at a cheap price unless it is cheaper to buy a $20 console with $6 hook ups. Try to find the limited consoles like the Pikachu Game Boy Color. It goes for fairly cheap.

, Take all your consoles, games, and accessories and set them all in one place. Find a sturdy shelf, or make your own. Organize them however you like. I took a shelf and put all Nintendo on one, Sony under that, and so on. You can organize them by release date (NES first, SNES next, ect.) or by alphabetizing them. Try to display the accessories in a way that isn't messy. wrap your controller wire around your controller, and take the hook ups and wrap them around your hand, forming a circular wrap.

, Show it off! But don't be too cocky.

To clear every part of the game is simple. All you need to do is entertain customers, make them the drink they ordered, serve, and then interact as they enjoy their cocktails.

, Before we jump into making drinks, let's start first with welcoming the customers. In the game, you will be put in a first person view. You will be standing behind the bar and the customers will come and sit on the stool in front of the counter.

, Now that you have a customer, get that customer to take their order. They won't tell you their order just yet. You have to slide the coaster toward them first, letting them know that you're going to take their order. Simply slide your finger over the screen.


If you ignore the customer, the green dot will become yellow and then red. If you keep on ignoring them, they will eventually leave the bar.
Your customer(s) leaving may or may not give your bar a bad reputation, which in result, decreases the number of customers in the future.

, There are instances when customers will arrive at your bar already drunk but will want to buy more drink. You will be given an option if you want kick them out or let them stay to have more booze.


Keep in mind that letting them stay may cause problems to other customers.
If the drunk customers will cause problems, either your good customer may leave without paying or the drunk customer will trash your table and chairs.
Kicking drunk customers out will only give less penalty compared to accepting them. Best to avoid trouble than letting it happen.

, Time doesn't flow when the dots on the bottom left-hand corner are not shown. Customers won’t leave while you're making drinks, so take your time to get your drinks right.


Customers also won't come in the bar while you're mixing, so take this as if the game went into pause whenever you open the Drinks menu.

, There are hundreds of drink recipes in this game, each one has different descriptions and complete guides on how to make it.


As you progress in the game and unfold the stories behind those smiles and making new friends, new recipes will unlock. You will also get new kinds of drinks, from the famous brand of vodka to whiskey. The possibilities are wide, which makes this game more enjoyable.
All recipe in the game are real—a very useful in-app reference, especially for players who enjoy cocktails.

, Now that you have slid the coaster, you're ready to take your customer's order. Some customers will muse on what drink they want to try out while others will seem to be in a hurry.


You can take multiple orders, but there are chances of mixing the drink, so don't forget who ordered what.
After taking the orders, slide your finger across the screen (down to up). This will make your character look down at the counter.
The Order Sheet will be highlighted; this means that you have acquired an order. Tap on the Order Sheet to bring up the list of drinks.
Scroll down until you find the drink ordered by your customer, then tap the name to start mixing.

, Right after you tap on the drink, the menu will be brought up. Take note of the picture of the drink, such as the texture and the glass used. Scroll down to see the recipe to know what type of alcohol is needed.


Once you're ready, tap on the arrow button at the bottom right of the screen to start.
You are now facing the shelf. Select the glass needed from the shelf; make sure it’s the same as that in the picture of the drink.
If you're unsure or forgot the steps and recipe of the drink, you can check it by pressing the square button at the lower left of the screen. You will notice that a glass, drink, and other things needed are now highlighted. Simply tap on those and then press + sign to add it in your inventory.
If you checked the recipe while in the mixing process, this will decrease the quality of your drink. However, you may still achieve excellent results once done properly.
You don't have to worry about the customer while you’re preparing and mixing your drink, as mentioned in part 2; customers won't leave or come in the bar while you're mixing drinks, so take your time.

, With the items you need added in your inventory, you can start mixing. Press the arrow button at the bottom right of the screen. Now slide your finger over the screen (bottom to top) to bring up the bottle and then tilt your device side ways to start pouring drinks.


Take note of the maximum amount to pour, which can be found at the upper-right of the screen. Once the amount reach the desired number, hold a finger over the bottle's mouth then tilt the device back to vertical.
There are drinks that require a lemon squeeze. To do this, simply place your thumb on the other side of the lemon and your pointing finger at the other. Slide both finger closer as if you're squeezing the lemon.
If you have to add sugar or salt, simply tilt your device toward you.
Now that you have added all the ingredients, you will be required to mix them. All you have to do is to face your device in front of you, then tilt your device on either side, moving in circular as if stirring. An “OK” will appear if you have stirred enough.
Your drink is now complete! Serve the drink by sliding it toward your customer.
If you're unhappy with the result of your mix, you can also make a new one. Just dispose the one you made by tapping on it.
Now that you're all set, keep on making drinks and pleasing your customers with your bartending skills.

Establish the age of the players.,
Know your platform.,
What vehicles do you want to race in?,
Decide on the type of racing.,
Choose the type of gameplay.,
Do you want arcade-style or a realistic-simulation?,
Do you want multiplayer?,
Do you need support for special controllers such as a steering wheel?",How to Choose a Racing Game," Age restrictions apply to video games and it is illegal to supply video games to players younger than the advertised minimum age. The Grand Theft Auto series (one of the most famous game series) was meant for adults and is highly unsuitable for children, while the Disney Cars series will be suitable for them.;
, What platform are you using? The Forza series is exclusive to the Xbox, the Gran Turismo series is exclusive to the PlayStation and the Mario Kart series is exclusive to Nintendo platforms. The Ridge Racer series is a cross-platform.

, The SSX series enables you to race in snowboards. The Xtreme Xpress enables you to race in trains. Karting games enable you to race in karts. MotoGP enables you to race on motorbikes. Tour de France enables you to race on bicycles. Need for Speed enables you to race in real cars. Racing games which enable you to drive in trucks are available too.

, Where do you want to race? Do you want to race off the road, on the track or on the street? WRC and the Colin McRae series are played off-road, the F-Zero series is played on the track and the Burnout series is played on the street.

, Do you want open world gameplay? Sometimes in racing games, this is referred to as free roam. The Need for Speed series has this in Underground 2, Most Wanted (2005), Carbon, Undercover and Most Wanted (2012). The Midnight Club series and the Burnout series always had this. The Test Drive series introduced this in Unlimited, while the Disney Cars series has open world gameplay.

, The Forza series and the Gran Turismo series are realistic-simulations. The F1 series is arcade-style, but F1 All-Stars isn't. Some games offer both arcade-style and realistic-simulation as options.

, Is online multiplayer important? While most racing games feature multiplayer, most karting games focus on multiplayer with the split-screen option on a single console (ideal for parties). An unpopular racing game won't find many users keen to play against each other online.

, Not all games support steering wheels, especially street racing games such as the Need for Speed series. Track racing games with realistic-simulation are likely to support steering wheels.

Talk to the shop assistants.",How to Choose the Right Gaming Console for You," This is an essential step. By blindly wandering into a store and saying, 'I'd like to buy a games console' isn't helpful for you or the shop assistant. Check out what's available at the time - right now, the three hot shots are the Xbox One, the Sony Playstation 4 and the Nintendo Wii U - all of them are completely different!;
, If, for example, you're interested in racing, sports and shooting games, and want a console with HD (high definition) graphics, the PS4 is for you. But, if you'd like to play a wide variety of games for all ages, from shooters for adolescents to games you can play with your gran, the Wii U is more up your street.

, As outlined in the previous step, different games suit different platforms. A good idea is to see if you can play on a particular console to 'get a feel' for the games. Be aware, of course, that not all games are available on all platforms. For example, you will never find a Mario game on a Playstation.

, Websites such as Play, Zavvi, GAME and even Asda have good bundles (addresses for these can be found in the 'Tips' section).

, They're specially trained to answer your questions, and will be able to offer advice on which console best suits your needs, and can tell you about any bundles you might be interested in.

Protect your farm.,
Avoid stepping on plotted land.,
Use a torch.",How to Farm in 7 Days to Die," You need a gardening hoe to start farming; it is a multi-purpose tool for it can also be used as a melee weapon. It can be found randomly around the world but can be crafted as well. To make a Gardening Hoe, you need two items: Iron Ingots (2) and Sticks (3).


Press “I” to open your craft window.
At the right part of the craft window, search the list for Gardening Hoe; click the name to activate the pattern of the tool you're about to make.
Following the pattern, place 2 Iron Ingots at the upper right block and the 3 Sticks horizontally from the lower left of the block.;
, You need seeds to plant. There are 3 kinds of seeds you can obtain and plant in the game (Potato, Blueberry, and Corn); to get their seeds, you need to gather the plant first.


Potatoes can be found throughout the map and can be eaten raw to decrease hunger, but are more advisable to use for cooking (i.e. Venison Stew, Rabbit Stew) for it gives more effects in health, thirst, and hunger. Blueberries are scavenge-able food and can be gathered from Blueberry Bushes. Corn can be found anywhere too, and there's a farm land with more than 400 corns planted in the northwest of Diersville on Coronado Road.
You can now craft them into seeds; 1 plant is equivalent to 4 seeds.
Press “I” to open your craft window and simply place any plant in the middle of the window.

, You need to water the crops to continue growing. To make a bucket, you need 7 Forging Irons which can be obtained by putting Iron Ingot in your craft window.


Open your craft window. Find and click the Forging Iron name on the craft list to activate the pattern.
Grab the Forging Iron from your inventory then place it over the pattern, forming a “U”.
To turn Iron Ingot to Forging Iron, just place the Iron Ingot in the middle of your crafting window.

, For a good farm field, search for a place with flat land that is close to your home or a short walk away from your underground tunnel exit. This way it will be easier for you to reach your farm for a quick check for any harvesting.

, Using the Gardening Hoe, right-click on a dirt block to fill the land. Remember that farming in the game is the same as farming in real life; you cannot plant if you didn't plow the block, so make sure to have everything covered.

, Crops take approximately 2-3 days to grow but will give you constant food supply, especially if you planted many. Plant some crops every day to have them harvested continuously.


To plant, hold the correct seeds then right-click the center of the tilled land.
If done correctly, there will be a small green plant on the dirt.

, To make farming easier and have your plants grow faster, adding a source of water close to your farm will be useful.


Grab your bucket and look for a lake to fill it with water, then go back to your farm and start digging one block near the tilled dirt.
Fill the dug block with water. This will moisten the dirt including the tilled ground near it. You may add more water source surrounding the farm.

, Zombies, and even animals, can destroy your crops. Place traps around the farm, such as spikes; this will prevent them from reaching your plants.

, It is best to leave one row apart from the other plotted line; this will give you more room to walk around your farm without stepping on your plants. Keep in mind that stepping or jumping on the tilled land will kill your crops, flatten your land, and will have to be tilled again.

, Zombies move faster during nightfall. To avoid zombies from breathing through the traps, add torches to decrease their movement.

Explore everywhere and use your common knowledge from the books.",How to Find All of the Portrait Passwords for the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix PC Game," If you want to find all the passwords to the portraits, you'll need to look everywhere and talk to everyone. Read the book, finding the passwords sometimes goes along with what happened in the book. If you're still having trouble, here's where to find them;


Fat Lady (Grand Staircase <-> Gryffindor Common Room): The Prefects of Gryffindor, Ron and Hermione, are told on the train, but as you (Harry) and Ron confront the Fat Lady, you will discover that Ron has forgotten the password. Ron suggests that you ask another Gryffindor student. The Gryffindors are the students with red stripes on their uniforms. Just ask one of these students and they will tell you that the password is 'Mimbulus Mimbletonia', such as in the book.
Basil Fronsac (Grand Staircase <-> Second Floor): Basil Fronsac, a scholar and a supporter of Ravenclaw, has a password also easy to require. Basil will instruct you to ask a Ravenclaw student where Rowena Ravenclaw came from. Ask any student and they will tell you that she was from the glens. Return to Basil's portrait and give him the information. He will then tell you that the password is 'Studious Success'.
The Owl Wizard (Library <-> Fourth Floor): The Owl Wizard, painted with a white owl and a green pointed hat, has a password that's a little difficult to require. When confronted, he will ask you to get the current Daily Prophet and tell him the headline. Once prompted, he will suggest looking in the Great Hall, where owls go in and out with newspapers. He doesn't know how to make the owls give you the newspaper, so you're basically on your own. Go to the Great Hall and to the owl reading stand at the front. Preform the Accio charm on it and it will go to a cut scene showing four owls swooping down, one of them (presumably Hedwig) dropping a Daily Prophet on the nearest table. Pick up the newspaper and Harry will read the headline out loud. Then return to the Owl Wizard and give him the required information. He will say that the headline is boring (despite the fact that it is a death) and tell you that the password is ""No news is good news"". Please note; The owls will only come down if the sky is turned off using Depluso and the candles are put out.

Giffard Abbott (Grand Staircase <-> Transfiguration Courtyard): This is another useful passageway if you don't want to pass through the Viaduct to get to the other half of the castle. Giffard favours Hufflepuffs, and, like Basil, it is required to ask a Hufflepuff the password. Since you helped Cedric Diggory last year, any Hufflepuff (the students with the yellow stripes on their uniforms) will be happy to inform you that the password is 'Dragon's Egg'.
Damara Dodderidge (Grand Staircase <-> Third Floor/Clock Tower): Damara is starving when you first speak to her, and will ask you to go down to Giffard and tell him that she wants some food sent up. Go talk to Giffard, and he will ask you to tell her that he will see what he can do. Deliver the good news to Damara, and she will tell you that the password is 'Chops and gravy'.
Percival Pratt (Grand Staircase <-> Boathouse): This portrait loves to rhyme, and will tell you to ""Seek the man with faces three"" if you want to know his password. The portrait in question is on the seventh floor, of a black-robed man who also guards a secret passage (but we will speak of him later). He will say that he doesn't know the password, but to talk to Basil. Do so, and Basil will send you to the shepherdess. The shepherdess is difficult to find, but she is on the second floor. Just look around and you'll find her, she isn't difficult to miss because she often shouts out comments to passers-by. Once you speak to her, she suggests that you talk to Google Stump. Google hangs in the Viaduct Entrance, and since he is the only portrait there (he, too, guards a passageway) he is easy to find. Finally, he will send you to Giffard, who, thankfully, knows that 'the password is absurd'. Go back to Percival, and he will gladly lead you to the boathouse.
Nervous Gentleman (Herbology Corridor <-> Fifth Floor): The Nervous Gentleman is in the Herbology Corridor and is across from the portrait of an eye. Anyone would feel awkward being watched by an enormous eye. All you have to do to soothe him is to cast Reparo on the two broken suits of armor on either side of the eye. The eye will be covered up by a Gryffindor banner and the Nervous Gentleman will thank you by telling you that his password is 'Flaming earwigs'.
Google Stump (Viaduct Entrance <-> First Floor): If asked, Google will share his password with only you, and only you. Google instructs you to rid the Viaduct Entrance of everyone around, so just hold you wand up at the students (or if you've learned Stupefy, you can cast that on the students). They will run away. Confront Google again and he will tell you that his password is 'Volo futurus unus' (Latin for 'I want to be one').
Boris the Bewildered (Third Floor <-> Second Floor): Boris has not heard his password in fifty years, in fact he's forgotten it. Now you have to rediscover it by asking anyone who was at Hogwarts fifty years ago to tell you the password. Though Hagrid does come to mind and Dumbledore, it is neither because it is truly Myrtle you have to ask. Since she has a crush on Harry, she will tell you that the password is 'Forget-me-never'.
The Man With Faces Three (Seventh Floor <-> Fourth Floor): This man wants you to find 'himself' in another portrait. What he means his to find the other door of his passageway. This is on the fourth floor and is covered in cobwebs. Burn the cobwebs away with Incendio (if you have not learned the spell yet, you will have to wait until you do) and talk to him. He will say that his password is 'Three heads are better then one'
The Astronomer (Grand Staircase-Dungeon Level <-> Seventh Floor): Hannah Abbott on the dungeon level will not come to the Dumbledore's Army meeting unless you find a passageway to get her there safety. The passageway is simple, since it is nearby and you merely have to ask the Astronomer his password. He will tell you that his password is 'Scurrilous scoundrel'.
The Slytherin Witch (Dungeon Corridor <-> Dungeons): This portrait of a rather nasty Slytherin Witch only lets through the Slytherins and those who know the password. She suggests that you ask another Slytherin student the password. Since you know very well that Slytherins will not tell you something that people outside Slytherins should know, there is only one way to get this password; Eavesdrop. You must have completed Ginny's quest to get the Doxy Venom from Umbridge's office to do this, therefore unlocking the privilege of the Invisibility Cloak. Go get on your Invisibility Cloak and go back to the Dungeon corridor(at the end of the grand staircase). Two Slytherins will be there, discussing how they will be late for potions unless they use the passage way. Follow them to the portrait. Once they are there, they will tell the Slytherin Witch that the password is 'Slytherins are Supreme' then the witch will say and be extra nasty to mudbloods, followed by many laughs. Go take off your invisibility cloak and return to the corridor. Tell the Witch the password, and she will grudgingly let you through.;

The different types of genres can be strategy, action, shooter, puzzle solving, turn based, sports, or a role playing game. There are other genres that are not mentioned here.;
, What kind of individual would you consider yourself to be. Do you like to think a lot, are you the type to not want to think too much. Asking yourself questions may help you solve the question of which genre to step into.

, Once you have decided you are the type that likes to think a lot, you should consider strategy and puzzle solving games. If you consider yourself to be the type to not want to think too much, consider action or sports. These genres allow your mind to engage the computer. It is usually important to figure out if you want to take your time thinking things through or you just want to run through and have fun.

, The genre strategy can be anywhere from battle warfare to building a civilization. This involves thinking but not too much puzzle solving. In battle warfare, missions are usually given to the player and the orders have to be carried out to win. It is usually up to you being the player to decide what strategy to engage first.

, This genre is more intricate and thinking is more involved in these types of games. Puzzle solving is usually written on the back of the box for the game to let the player know they will have to think in order to pass certain levels. The missions will need to be thought out, you can't simply run through and expect to pass the levels. This type of genre wants you to use your head.

, A shooter is a genre where you are put in a 1st person dimension. All you see is your weapon of choice and the landscape. It's fun because you don't use that much brainpower, you just use firepower. You sneak, run, walk around destroying the computer enemy.

, The action genre is usually along the same lines as a shooter, you just don't have a 1st person dimension. It can be 2nd or 3rd person dimension on the screen as you see your character down below moving around. Sometimes you see your character up close from behind as you move him or her along. Typically problem solving is minimal depending if the game states it will require a lot of thinking to pass the missions.

, A role playing game is called an RPG in the gaming world. This means that you are usually responsible for the characters every move. You are given a specific character and you decide what to do from start to finish. Obviously there is an interesting story involved. The player being you gets to decide what items to buy, which land to visit, which enemy to attack and etc.

, If you are a busy person and constantly is on the move and never home. You should consider a game that does not consume too much of your time. There are several genres that will fulfill your tastes and will not consume too much of your time.

, A sports game is especially fun if you are a fan of a particular sport. If you love basketball, then you should consider a basketball game. If you like watching wrestling or cage fighting on the television, consider a wrestling or cage fighting PC game. Any particular computer sports game will in most cases have a PC game for it.

Make your tools.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Create a Science Machine.",How to Defeat Mobs in Don't Starve1," You need a pickaxe and an axe to gather some of the required materials to survive. They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC), tapping and choosing the Equip option (iOS) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC), tap and hold (iOS), or press the X button (PS4) to wear them down into gatherable materials.;
, Now that you have your tools, get going and get gathering! Make sure you chop down some trees for Logs since they’re vital for creating a Science Machine. Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also for other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also vital for campfires and torches.


Rocks can be found scattered everywhere, much like flint, but are less common and are more abundantly found from mining boulders.
Everything initially gathered, save for Logs, can stack up to 40 per inventory slot. Logs stack up to 20.

, You’ll need a Science Machine to create the necessary items for your survival. A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and is the very first crafting station you can make.


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Before you craft a Science Machine, make sure that the area is where you’ll be camping permanently, since once you place the Science Machine, it cannot be moved and carried around.

"
"
Make a Spear.,
Make armor.,
Stock on healing items.",How to Defeat Mobs in Don't Starve2," Spears cost 1 Rope, 1 Flint, and 2 Twigs, and are first crafted through the Science Machine’s Fight tab, which is represented by a crossed swords icon. This is the first true weapon of the game and is rather efficient when it comes to killing early-game mobs. Equipping it is identical to equipping your tools: select your item then equip it with right click or the right direction button.

, You’ll be needing some armor to go with your Spear if you want to survive this ordeal. While armor won’t completely repel damage, it lessens it greatly and would help keep you from losing too much health.The two most efficient armors available early on is the Grass Suit and the Log Suit.


Grass Suits can be crafted at the very beginning of the game and costs 10 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You equip them the same way you did with your tools and spear.
Log Suits require the Science Machine to make the first time, and costs 8 Logs and 2 Ropes.

, Once you’re done arming yourself, take stock of what healing items you can craft and gather so that, in case of emergencies, you can heal yourself if the enemies breach your defenses. Stockpiling Butterfly Wings, Spider Glands, and Mosquito Sacs is a good tactic, but taking some Jerky with you, cooking food in your Crock Pot, and making Healing Salves will be better off in the long run, as long as you have the right resources.


Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock, and 1 Spider Gland. It heals for 20 Health, compared to the 8 Health healed by the Spider Gland.
To make Jerky, you'll need to make a drying rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button, tapping the screen, or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption!
Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the trees. Each burned tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal.

Know the mob types.,
Observe before you attack.,
Get to know their attack patterns.,
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.",How to Defeat Mobs in Don't Starve3," Now here comes the fun and dangerous bit! There are three major kinds of mobs in the game: Passive, Neutral, and Hostile. Hostile mobs are the most dangerous, since once they see you, they will start attacking you. Neutral mobs tend to fight back if you attack first, and Passive mobs run away if you get too close and don’t fight back at all.

, Each mob has their own individual behavioral patterns. For example, Butterflies and Rabbits are both passive mobs, but Rabbits are harder to kill since they don’t stray from their homes and flee quickly. Butterflies just flutter around faster than you, but are easier to kill because they settle on flowers for a few seconds, leaving them open to attack.


Beefalo and Bees are neutral mobs, and they both attack in groups once you attack one of them. Beefalo are stronger and have certain days where they are extremely hostile, signified by their inflamed red bottoms.
Spiders wander around at dusk and night, and are somewhat neutral until you’re much too close.
Tallbirds are persistent, and Hounds spawn every couple of weeks. There’s a lot more here to discuss, but as long as you keep an eye on Mob behavior and stay cautious, you’ll fare off better when you decide to attack.

, Different mobs have different attack patterns and quirks— Frogs knock things out of your inventory, Red Hounds explode after death, and Tall birds are highly aggressive, walk fast, hunt you down longer, and peck hard enough to kill weaker characters. Some mobs pause for a second before they attack, some can’t be stun-locked, and some kite around you while they attack. Time your hits well, observe your target’s attacks and abilities, and you’ll be able to outsmart and outfight them.

, Hostile and Neutral mobs tend to attack you as a group if you agitate them too much, which can spell death even for the most prepared players. There are many tactics to avoid being mobbed by Mobs, but as long as you play it safe and play it smart, you won’t die from being attacked by ten Beefalo at once.


Try and lure individual targets away from the group by hitting only one of them, then running as far away as you can. The one you attacked will follow you long after the others do, and if you lead them far enough away, you won’t be in too much trouble.
Smaller mobs, when attacked, can be “stun-locked” when you attack continuously. Stun-locking is a game phenomena where a mob stops moving for a few moments after they are attacked and tend to stay still for each consecutive attack, and is extremely exploitable that way. Simply holding auto-attack (F on PC, square on console, the fist icon on the iOS version) will ensure that you hit fast and continuously to take advantage of this function.
Kiting is also a great way of killing mobs. Also called the hit-and-run tactic, this tactic involves running around or away from your target after hitting it, giving you ample time to heal or equip new armaments while keeping the damage coming. Normally you can kite by either running away before every attack then returning, running around the enemy to confuse them and then attacking, or leading it away, waiting until they stop attacking, then coming back to attack and lead them away again.

Before starting, be sure to have:


600 energy (not any less).,
Once you have these things, drop as many master builders on the blocking totem as you can.,
Once the totem is dismantled at 2%, the heathens from the mausoleum will move in on your builders in order to ""repair the totem"".,
Keep dragging villagers to the group of orange masks in order to lure them away.,
Once the heathens reach the food bin area, use the lighting power on them again.,
Repeat the process of dragging unoccupied villagers to the orange masks, using the lighting power to scare off the heathens, and keeping their master builders on the task of dismantling.

,
Once the blocking totem has been completely dismantled, your villagers will celebrate and be able to restore the mausoleum freely.

",How to Dismantle the Blocking Totem in Virtual Villagers 5,"
The Lightning Power unlocked
3-4 or more Master Builders
Unoccupied Villagers.;
, The Blocking Totem can be found on the lower left hand corner, in the area where the heathen master builder is (or once was). It is recommended to have the heathen master builder already converted; that way, he can help with the dismantling process.

, As soon as they start moving towards it, use the lighting power on the heathens to scare them off. The blue and red masked heathens will proceed to hide in the bush. The orange masked heathens, however, will become distracted by other villagers along the way, and will quickly return to the totem...

, In the meantime, keep your master builders on task and do not use any energy for other powers. Lure the orange masks to the other heathens in order to group them all together.

, By having them grouped together, it will ensure that all the heathens run off. (If one were to not be affected by the lightning, this whole plan would not function properly).

, Once the game loads, you will have to choose the game mode between Standard and Party. Click on the “Play” button under the Standard mode.

, Before you begin the game, you will have the option to equip up to three boosts. The boosts are displayed below with their respective costs in coins.

, To have the Detonator available on your game board, you can buy it pre-game and equip it for use. This boost costs 3000 coins.

, When you’re ready, click the “Play Now” button to begin your game. Your game board will load and you can find the Detonator at the lower left corner.

, Play your game, and don’t mind the Detonator at the start. You won’t need it during the early seconds of the game.

, If you have matches to do near the Detonator, don’t be afraid to do so. The boost won’t go away even if you explode a Flame Gem adjacent to it.

, Don’t use these right away. Collecting them and using them at the right moment can hugely impact your score.

, There’s really no perfect moment to use the Detonator boost. You just have to use it when it’s most impactful. Since the Detonator acts like the Last Hurrah event, you will need some multipliers, Power Gems, and Hyper Cubes on the board to feel its force.


If you’ve collected enough from Step 3, go ahead and use it. Click on the boost to detonate, and watch your game board as it explodes gems on screen.

Shoot the last Flesh Lip until it dies.",How to Beat Flesh Lips in Silent Hill 2," When the battle starts, run towards the other side of the room and take out your shotgun. Their attacks do medium to high damage; keeping your distance is advisable.;
, You will get 1-2 shots at best; don't be too greedy or they might get close enough to attack you.


Getting attacked while shooting at medium range is worse than getting attacked at close range, as their medium range attack deals more damage than the close one.

, Once they get near you, run towards the opposite end of the room; this way they'll never be able to catch you, but be careful when running to the opposite side. Make sure you don't walk directly underneath them or you might get caught by their feet.

, Do this until one of them dies. It takes around 8 shots of the Shotgun and 24 shots of the Pistol to kill one of them.


Shotgun is advised when you're up against two of them as the shots will cause damage to both of them.

, Once you've killed one of the Flesh lips, start using your pistol to shoot the second one until it dies.


Using the pistol will immobilize the Flesh Lip and halt its advances towards you. However, this will not work when there's still two of them because the pistol can only target one enemy at a time, leaving you vulnerable to attacks from multiple enemies.

, After the second Flesh Lip dies, another one will fall down from the roof, get away from it and start shooting it with your pistol to immobilize it.

, Since the last Flesh Lip will be alone, you should have no problem killing it. Once it is dead, you'll be treated to a cut scene.

Understand the importance of stats.,
Understand the “hidden stats” like stability and poise.,
Use a shield.,
Upgrade your weapon.,
Assess the effectiveness of armor.,
Understand equipment load.",How to Be Good at Dark Souls1," Hand to hand combat is inevitable in Dark souls. That’s why Vitality (health) and Endurance (stamina) are the two most important stats for any player. Stamina is used for all actions by your character including striking, dodging, and blocking, as well as managing equipment load. Points into these stats early is always a safe bet.


Endurance has a hard cap at 40 for stamina, meaning you won’t receive any more stamina bonuses after that point. However you can continue to increase it for greater equipment load.
You can increase your damage by increasing the stat with which your weapon scales, but the benefits early on will be minimal. This is best saved for later in the game.;
, Stability is a rating for shields that determines how much punishment your shield can take before your guard is broken. Poise is a rating for how much you are staggered when you get hit. A higher number for these stats is always better.


Having your guard broken leaves you very vulnerable to counterattack. Avoid it at all costs.

, Although optional, proper use of a shield can be an invaluable defensive option for beginners. A shield is much easier to time than dodging and some enemies may even stagger themselves when striking against it.


Your stamina will regenerate faster if you do not have your shield up. This means it is best practice to raise your shield before you are hit, then lower it before the next strike, if you have time.
For beginners, find a shield that has a 100% physical defense rating. Otherwise you will still take some damage, even when blocking attacks.

, Reinforcing a weapon at the blacksmith will give you the most immediate increase in damage, especially compared to stat increases. Neglecting to upgrade your weapons will make the game significantly more difficult.


If you don’t plan to use a weapon much, it may be best to save the materials for something you will use more frequently.
Almost all weapons in Dark Souls are viable. If you keep your starting weapon upgraded, it can carry you through the entire game.

, Enemies inflict a lot of damage with each hit in Dark Souls and the amount negated by armor is finite. It is important to strike a good balance between equipment load and poise.


Lighter armor will give less poise but a faster roll via lower equipment load.

, All armor and weapons weigh a certain amount. Your equipment load is the percentage of the combined weight of your equipment compared to your burden stat, which is determined by Endurance.


It is important to keep your equipment burden below 100% or you will be unable to run or or dodge roll.Lower equipment load (50% or below) will increase the length of your roll invincibility.

Time your attacks.,
Learn when to block, dodge, or parry.,
Learn when to use the target lock.,
Exploit elemental weaknesses.",How to Be Good at Dark Souls2," Attacks in Dark Souls are deliberate, slow, and cannot be canceled. This is true for both you and your opponent. The best time to strike is following a heavy attack that leaves your opponent open. Your attacks are also slow, so be conservative with your attacks, lest you leave yourself with an opening as well.


It may be advantageous to try and keep your distance for a bit and observe an enemy’s attack patterns to determine when there are openings.
Always keep an eye on your stamina when attacking.

, Some attacks from particularly large enemies may break your guard. In these scenarios dodging is a superior option. Parries can be used once you have gained a sense for the timing of your opponent’s attacks for a critical strike.


Not all attacks (especially by bosses) can be parried.
A missed parry will leave you open to attack. The risk is great, but so is the reward.
Blocking is easier for beginners, but a well timed dodge is a better way to get into a good striking position.

, Lock-on is a tool, not a requirement. Sometimes it can be advantageous, especially against larger enemies, to forego the target lock for better maneuverability and camera control.


You can toggle target lock on and off as many times as necessary in the middle of a fight, but remember that target lock does have a range limit. Stray too far and you won’t be able to relock until you move in close again.

, Many of the enemies in Dark Souls will take extra damage from Fire or Lightning attacks. Often you will need to experiment to discover which enemies are weak to what if you don’t want to look them up.


Using firebombs is a cheap and safe way to check for fire weakness.

Known when to run and when to fight.,
Bait out attacks.,
Fish for backstabs.,
Use the environment to your advantage.,
Summon for help.,
Don’t play by the rules.",How to Be Good at Dark Souls3," If you are invaded while fighting an enemy you have a little time to defeat it before your opponent can to you, depending on where they are spawned. Don’t get outnumbered or let someone catch you in a bad position.


If you are near a boss door, you can pass through it to end an invasion, then teleport home with a homeward bone.
If you want to avoid PVP completely, you can play offline or play through the game hollowed. However you will also lose the opportunity to co-op with other players.

, Attack with a full combo, but leave yourself stamina to roll. You might be able to trick your opponent into thinking there’s an opening where there isn’t. This can be especially effective with a heavy weapon and light armor.

, If you can ever get behind an opponent, take the opportunity for a critical strike. It only takes a light attack and does not leave you vulnerable like a parry.

, Fighting near trees can give you cover from spells. Fighting near cliffs may cause an opponent to inadvertently fall while rolling. Lava is dangerous to everyone - but exciting.


Spear users should find narrow spaces to fight. Enemy swords will bounce off walls.

, Being human is a double edged sword, allowing for invasions and co-op. Take advantage and bring help to fend off invading players.

, In Dark Souls there are no rules. All strategies are fair game, especially when you are the invader. This can mean attacking your opponent while they fight someone else or running away to heal if you’re given an opening.

be stealthy whenever you can, use your silencer, keep your team on 'infiltrate' and set up ambushes and quick kills.,
if your silencer is on then the tangos (terrorist) can't hear you unless your bullet hits something next to you.,
in order to set up ambushes, you need to quietly approach 2 or more tangos with silencers on or off (your choice, i prefer silencer because of the stealth) tell your team to take cover and hold fire then you go around the tangos if possible, if not just stay with your team.,
stealth kills this works with 1-4 enemies with 3 being kind of risky and 1 being safer.,
in some situations you'll be forced into big battles with guns blazing.,
CQB situations, in close quarters have silencers off (gives your weapon more damage and penetration)use smoke and thermal.,
the explosives, smoke grenades etc.",How to Be Good at Rainbow Six Vegas 2,";
, use that to your advantage by killing enemies near each other. NOTE doing this will work if no one sees you or the dead tangos.

, then target the leader/s (if more than two) remember you can only tag two tangos at time.

, with 1 tango, tell your team to stay back and take cover near the enemy then quickly pop out for a quick kill. for 2 tangos, tag each of them and tell your team to open fire to kill both of them instantly. with 3 tangos, target two of them and put your cross hair on the non tagged one, then as soon as you tell your team to open fire kill your tango and if possible kill any other tango they might have missed. this can also be done with 4 but you have to make sure all 4 tangos are killed quick. remember silencers, speed and team work, your guys are accurate.

, in order to survive take cover. and keep control of your team. tag the leaders (the ones with the red hats) if you kill them the rest of the tangos will be confused and not flank and keep their order giving you the advantage of flanking. covering fire works, especially when you don't have your silencer on, giving you the advantage of flanking or sniping them.

, when you pop out of cover and shoot but miss the enemy will shoot back out of cover, get to know his pattern and when he pops out next scoot over or when at a corner pop out up or side. then pop out of a new area and take him out, this tactic is seen in real life and in paintball.

, have good range, use them wisely because you only get a few of them.

If you don't have the stealth equipment, then just wait till nighttime to make your move.,
Stick to the grass and make sure the guards aren't looking directly at you.

Evaluate your team and pick your class.,
Figure out what role each person is filling.,
Establish a leader and stick together.,
Don't get greedy.,
Be prepared to be support.,
Think instead of react.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Be Successful in Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer," At the beginning of every match when you are in the lobby, it shows what class each member of your party is using. Based on the types of classes being used, you should select a role that needs to be filled. For example, are there two rogues, and a mage? You should be a warrior then, to open the warrior doors.;
, Converse with your party and find out who will be doing what. Questions to ask include: ""Are you dealing damage, tanking, or support?""; if dealing damage, ""are you ranged or close?""; if tanking, ""do you want/need barrier support?""; if support, ""do you need a guard?"".

, This is where many teams fall apart. This game is heavily dependent on team work and communication. Have a leader who will be able to survey the field and call out actions for the team (this helps if the team has mics). If no mics are available, utilize the ""rally"" call out when pressing down on the d-pad. Even if your team cannot talk, ensure you stay together.

, People get too caught up in the points and kills than how the team functions. Having the most kills is nice, but that doesn't matter when you are dead in sections 2 or 3. Focus more on helping your party than yourself. If you make that a habit and your party routinely completes dungeons, your stats will increase at a greater pace.

, Not everyone is the damage dealer. Most players want to be the F16 flying around blowing everything up and yes, while every team needs a F16, they don't need three or four! Every F16 needs support, whether it be intel or repairs. Every party should have at least one tank and one support. A tank is a character that can take large continuous amounts of damage and survive so that the enemy only focuses on them. A support is a character that buffs other units or removes negative effects.

, Try thinking two steps ahead. Take your time and plan out your movements, item usage, and ability usage. By taking this time, you can save yourself (and your party) a lot of heartache later.

, Yes, winning is fun and losing does stink but don't let those motivations rule your experience. Enjoy your game experience with some friends or make small talk with your party members. Laugh at things instead of getting mad and learn from your prior mistakes. Do not go overboard with this and just mess around the entire match, because your party will not appreciate it if you are not helping. Just remember this: It is a video game, which is supposed to help you relieve stress––not add onto it.

Just get your silver baller and use them as a human shield, knock them out then take their disguise. Also, conceal the bodies from guards.;
, Make sure that you know your surroundings.

, Guns lower your rating, and take a big hit in keeping you away from the silent assassin rating.

, Even guards. Remember you are paid to kill your target, and only your target. Unless you have to, sedate or knock out civilians or guards, but do not kill them.

, In order to do this, there must be no witness', so your target has to be on his own. Watch and stalk your target. Learn his routine, and find out all the places when he his by himself. There is always a time when your target is by himself, eg using the bathroom, eating his dinner privately, etc.

, These abilities are very useful, when in the open use cloak to get across fast, or when in a firefight, tip the balance in your favor with armor enhancement. Gap in front of you, super jump over it by holding jump. Use these moves to help you and your team.

, The game rewards creativity, you get bonus xp and it looks cool. Jump over walls to get the advantage on 2 guys suppressing your team. This will greatly increase your dominance on the battlefield

, Since the massive maps are both vertical and horizontal, expect to be fired upon from all angles. I flank the enemy from above then drop down right on top of them, very useful.

, Find a clear and level point on a map where you can actually lay for a while , use visor to tag almost every enemy whether close or far away. Do all this in cloak mode.

, The reason for using the ""nano-recharge"" module is in case you failed to armor during shooting and drained your energy, the nano-recharge will help you to fill suit's power quickly, so that you can go in cloak again for little time to shake off your pursuers.

, This means taking out the far guys or close ones. The far guys are best taken out first.

, This is important because crouching stabilizes your aim much better.

, (This is crucial.) Aim your sniper scope and use nanovision to find out where you will the target.

, This is because your suit's power will not drain in armor mode during sniping.

, This whole procedure of ""Aim - Armor - Shoot - Cloak"" should be done in a fraction of seconds.

Observe the enemy's possible route when performing offensive operations. Search for safe areas where you can settle your troops. A good commander doesn't make a move without knowing the environment of his battlefield.;
, A good general never underestimates his enemy. Is the enemy using toxins? Is the enemy good at stealth? Does your enemy have a large amount of tanks in his disposal? What are the strengths of the enemy? How can you exterminate them without a lot of casualties? Determine the behavior and the capability of your enemy before making any operations.

, Defense is important and you are playing blind when you don't know how to set a good defense. Once your defenses are good. You are impenetrable and the possibility of getting defeated decreases.

, Determine their strengths and weaknesses. Know when you are going to use them. Know their strengths. For example, are they good at tank busting? Good at anti-aircraft busting? All units must move by placing them in strategic positions..

, It is good both in offensive and defensive operations.

,, Destroy its defenses to assure minimal casualties once the offensive team arrives.

, That way, they won't go far deep in your defenses.

In the doorway right in front of the stairs, you exit and there you find the merchant on the balcony. If you don't have one already, you will need to buy a bow from the trader for 600 souls and a few arrows, ranging from 3 souls each to 50 souls each.;
, After you pass through the tower the Taurus Demon jumped off, you'll find yourself at an area with the knight Solaire of Astoria to the left and the large empty bridge ahead to the right, with a few Hollows on it.

, If you begin to walk onto the bridge, after a while you will trigger the appearance of the wyvern, who will roar and immediately burn you to a crisp (along with the Hollows on the bridge). Try running back to the beginning of the bridge to avoid dying, although if you're not quick enough, this will probably be inevitable.

, This will trigger the Hellkite Wyvern to begin breathing fire upon the bridge, but you will notice there is a flight of stairs to the right of you leading down from the bridge. If you are fast enough you should reach this area before the wyvern's fire kills you.

, You will now be underneath the bridge and safe from the wyvern's attacks and be in a room with two exits.

, You will notice a series of bridge arches and small paths either side. There is another door to the left which leads back to the Undeadsberg bonfire.

, There will be one swordsman Hollow and one with a spear.

, If you stand on the right pathway in the bridge arch where you killed the two Hollows, you will be able to see the wyvern's tail swinging to the right of the bridge ahead.

, You can do this by entering your character's item menu and equipping them to your character's left or right hands, and by equipping the arrows to your quiver spaces.

, This can be done by drawing the bow and pressing the LB button on your Xbox 360 controller. You will now have a large cross-hair on your screen which shows where your arrow will be fired.

, Because of your distance and the weight of the arrows, you may need to aim slightly above the wyvern's tail to make sure they hit. Also, you will have to time your shots well as the tail swings quite quickly back and forth.

, After you shoot the wyvern's tail, it will fly to the bridge above and try to find you. After a few moments, it will return to its position guarding the bridge and the tail will be in the same spot as before.

, If you continue shooting the wyvern's tail, after 20 or so shots (determined by your weapon damage stats and the size of your arrows) you will see a screen prompt saying you have received the Drake Sword. Congratulations!

During the opening four to five minutes of game play, you'll be most vulnerable to infantry divisions.,
If you end up surviving the first four to five minutes of the game, concentrate on making your base structure defense.,
Now comes the preemptive strike part.,
Create three to four strike groups containing four to five heavy tanks and five to six tankettes.",How to Be a Good Player in Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour2," There will be at most one to two waves of very light artillery/air-raid (if any). Be prepared to meet them by creating a 2:1 ratio of soldier/missile launchers. Since you won't be having enough money to set up array of gattling canons/patriot/missile defenses of GLA, cover entry points with small batches of infantry (better if you can hole up in buildings, but then again, beware of flash guns/toxins). This is your first layer of defense during your first stage of game play., Build an array of (3 patriot/6 soldier units)/(3 gattling cannon/2 bunker with missile launchers)/(2 rocket sites + 5 soldier units + quad cannon). Don't ever keep the units in-line. It's always better to make them in layers, with the strongest deterrent in front. Once you're done (this should take approximately seven minutes), you can rest assured that your base can last long enough (in a worst case scenario) for you to make a counter attack. In most cases, you'll be able to defend even a horde of Overlords, if you've laid out the defense units properly. Also, build patriots/rocket sites/bunker with missile+gun units beside every building. This might just provide you with that extra 30 seconds you need., Whilst undergoing the previous step, create light armored tanks, probe-attack units(humvee/quad cannon/gattling tank/apache etc) in order to preempt any strike. You may get bruised (and battered), but it'll mean a weaker opponent reaching your doorstep - an easier job for your under-construction base defense., Before jumping into the enemy, send in covert units to probe/eliminate(if possible) enemy base defense units. Open up three to four such fronts to make the enemy confused. Always make sure that you are packing the most potent punch possible. Send in strike groups, one after the other, in quick succession, to make a continuous attack. Once you're inside their defense, send infantry and tankettes ahead of you to keep the enemy engaged, whilst you call in back-up airstrike/light armored attack units. Decimate your opponent."

, Before you know it you will be at your first boss, find his weakness. If it rushes you then try to make it crash or dodge/evade to get behind him to check for a weakness, if he fights at a range, fight back or destroy what he's standing on, you get the idea.

, Sooner or later you'll hit your first puzzle, not like a jigsaw puzzle, like a puzzle where you have to do ____ which unlocks ____ so you can get ____ to open the ____. It shouldn't be too much trouble, but if it is I find that writing the elements down and figuring the possibilities out on paper helps a lot.

, The Final Boss/Level is going to be the hardest thing you've yet faced, like I said in step 3 it has a weakness! but usually he goes through a cycle of events, one of those being his most vulnerable time to attack. for example, he might fight ranged so fight ranged back, then he comes closer to attack he goes like this for awhile, then damage him enough and he whips out a very powerful attack which depletes his energy so he rests, that would be the time to go all out, although it can take multiple tries.

Here are some of the most widely used strategies in the games:;
,
The dolphin dive, or just divers, tend to prone all the way down upon seeing you, pumping hot lead into your legs.,
The bunny hop is when people move around you in a circle, frequently jumping and shooting you.,
Rambo: this is kill as many as you can until you're dead, these guys don't pay attention to squad mates and don't offer much tactical help but are pretty amusing to watch and easy to counter: these guys aren't really smart at all, some tactical maneuvers and he'll go down.

,
These tips are for the lone wolf: The Sniper


Don't camp unless you're in a very well hidden spot.",How to Be Useful in an MMOFPS,", This works because some people can't react fast enough to counter this. It's easier to counter this if you know the person is diving frequently. To counter: from close range: jump over/on them and shoot their back. From a longer range: Grenades work or shoot back, then retreat, you can then take them out later.

, This works because they're strafing and they're jumping, making you shoot mostly at their legs. To counter: close range, bunny hop in the same fashion as they are doing, keeping your aiming crosshairs as locked on as possible. If they are hopping towards you, throw a grenade near the ground and retreat, if timed right, and they don't see the grenade, they'll go down

,, Stay in one area, take a few shots and move on to the next spot.
Stay hidden, standing up while sniping will not only give you away. It will also destroy your accuracy.
One shot one kill, try if you can, but if part of the enemies body sticks out, shoot it. It may scare him running away to a medic, or aggravate him and make him try to find you, either way he might have to come out of that hiding spot he's in.
For moving targets, lead your shot, putting your aiming crosshairs ahead of him. How far ahead depends of your weapon and how far he is and how fast he's moving. If you take a shot and it misses behind his head, put your crosshairs a little more ahead.
Have a good secondary weapon, this will save your life in fire fights. Better yet, have another sniper friend close by looking over another area, to help recon and take a few guys that you missed.
Actually recon, your buddies would be better prepared with mines and rocket launchers if you warned them of approaching vehicles.
A good sniper position is somewhere less obvious for longer durations of time, but in most of these positions, you have a terrible view. In obvious places. you have a good view but may not last long since everybody knows that spot, so it's better to have a spot close to an obvious place, where you have a good view, and good cover. Everyone snipes at the roof? How about that little window on the 3rd floor? Then you're looking over the same area without looking too obvious. However, if you can't find an excellent sniping spot, then choose one suited to your skills. If you can get several headshots in rapid succession while covering a large view, then the obvious one might be right for you. However, if you are only able to handle some area without being endangered, you may decide to take a spot with good cover and a less-than-ideal view.
Take your time if he doesn't see you. but be accurate as possible. Snipers taking moving targets is rare, so it makes you look good.

First, consider how long you've been playing up until this point.,
Try going back to the boss battle and fight them again.,
If you still can't beat the boss, consider leaving the area and find other things to do in the game, such as leveling up and additional side-quests that you may have missed.,
If it's available in your game, check your abilities and equipment again.,
Try doing something within the game that you didn't do before because it was difficult.,
After you've spent some time away from the boss you couldn't beat, try to go back into the battle and fight them again.

,
If you still can't beat the boss, then consider putting down your controller for a while and walking away.,
Explore the Boss level.",How to Beat a Video Game Boss," If you just started the game, then take a small break and stretch. If you've been playing for a little longer than a couple hours, take some time to really limber out and consider getting something to eat, or doing anything else you haven't been able to do since you started playing. This quick break is mainly to take you out of the tightening moment of stress and give you momentary relief.;
, You may have needed a moment to adjust and make yourself comfortable.

, Refocus your attention from what you can't do to something you can do to keep morale up.

, Sometimes it's necessary to rearrange, equip new abilities, or stock up in items that you may need in order to defeat the boss. Take the time to really go back through your menu and make sure you have everything you need. If you don't, consider buying more items to heal or help you even if you want to conserve money; it's better to be overly equipped than understocked.

, Sometimes, stress can make you angry and can actually boost your gaming and encourage you to really push through certain stages of the game. If you attempt something you ignored before and prevail, it may boost up your confidence and enhance your reflexes while letting you get use to the game's controls even more.

,, Instead of getting really worked up and discouraged, it's best sometimes to get away from the game and find something else to do until you decide that you want to try again. Video games are centered around being fun, so the instant it becomes too overwhelming it can lose its power to be a fun thing to do and become a hassle.

, All Video Game Bosses have a weakness. Try different tactics and strategies. Also, try to use the level to your advantage.

Distract.",How to Beat Anyone at Any Two Player Game," Say how good you are at playing the game and try to make your opponent think that they are never going to beat you. If you force your opponent into believing this, they are going to play the game in such a way as to give you an immediate mind advantage.;
, If it's an action game like shooting, always get to the good guns first but if your opponent gets the good weapons that's your cue to get a good place to hide.

, If it's a fighting game always block as many of their blows as possible and attack when possible. If it's a close combat/fighting game such as boxing or wrestling always use moves and punches that you can use from a distance so you can easily move off block straight after you attack.

, If it's a racing or free roam game, then look for any maps that may be onscreen, as they can tell you of hiding places or other players.

, Always stay focused on the game and not on anything else.

, Pause the game at crucial moments when you need to. Take the opportunity to regroup and rethink.

,, Distract your opponent as much as you can. If you have a certain skill in which you're able to talk while focusing on the game, do it. Talk about things you know about that person so your opponent is into what you're saying. If you're really low, you can play dirty and wave your hand in front of your opponent's face, or pretend like there's a fly buzzing around. Be warned that the other player may get upset if you damage their controller, or they know that you're intentionally sabotaging their gameplay"

Understand why you need to improvise.,
When you start off in the challenge, go opposite of the actually route as if you were going off road.,
Try not to brake or slow down.,
When you cut through trees when you go off road through your improvised route, try to drive through the open space through the trees so you can successfully make your route and beat the challenge.",How to Beat a Hard Bucket Challenge On Forza Horizon 21," Usually when you do a hard bucket challenge, they give you less time to get to a certain destination. But when you follow the route, you don't make it in time. The only way to beat it is to improvise your own route where it is far away from the route.


When you improvise the route, you have to be careful because depending on if you are in storm island or at the horizon, there are certain obstacles that can come your way like trees, boulders, and walls.;
, That way, you can be able to get there faster. Think of it as a shortcut.


When you do your own shortcut route you have to watch out for trees if you're going off road because it can cause you to obviously crash and maybe even damage your car engine.

, The key to winning a hard challenge is not braking because braking slows your car down and kills time when it comes to doing the challenge.


Instead of braking, try to drift but control the left stick on your xbox controller so it won't rotate the opposite direction. An easy way to drift is to either tap LT and control the left stick or tap A and control the joystick.

,


One obstacle you need to dodge depending on your area in the bucket challenge is big barrels. They can slow you down if you hit them as well so watch out for them.

"
"
Avoid braking.",How to Beat a Hard Bucket Challenge On Forza Horizon 22," When you go through a speed trap, speed zone, or total speed challenge, the key to beating a hard one is to not brake a lot. The braking will cause you to lose your speed and you can lose the challenge especially in a speed zone challenge where your speed would drop dramatically.


One speed zone challenge that is tough is the one in horizon with the Lotus Exige S and you have to try to make it to 68 MPH through the speed zone. One thing that they did to try to make it hard is by adding a sharp turn at the end just by the speed zone which causes you to lose it. That's why it's bad to brake a lot.
If you're forced to brake, brake lightly. In other words, Tap LT only in tiny bits so you won't completely lose your speed.

Get a playable FPS (frames per second).,
Don't worry about gaming peripheral.,
Find a game you like.,
Start playing!,
Learn your maps.,
Listen to sounds.,
Reload.,
Master the recoil.,
Reduce ping.,
Join a clan (entirely optional).",How to Be Good at First Person Shooter Games," Did you know? 30FPS is playable. If your computer can't get that high, you'll probably need to do some upgrades, or get a console. 60FPS is good, and anything above 90 is optimal. The better the hardware, the better your experience will be. If you have anything under 25, you might experience lag, which might lead to you dying quite a bit.;
, You probably should have an optical mouse. That would be enough. Playing with a game-pad is also possible. A surround headphone can help you distinguish sounds from various direction. But don't just buy an expensive headphone until you love the game and wanna play hardcore. Just get along with whatever equipment you have. You will know when it's time to upgrade to a gaming peripheral.

, If you end up playing a game you think is boring or don't even like, you're wasting your time. Less effort or interest will be put into the game and you'll probably end up losing.

, Play on an easy difficulty at first and gradually move on. But remember, if you never move against stronger opponents, you'll never become much better either. Remember, practice makes perfect.

, If you don't know where your enemy spawn or where you are supposed to be going your going to be in trouble. Load up an empty map and explore, or join with friends and try to find the best ways to navigate the maps, the best hiding spots and best sniper spots. Remember the spots where enemies always peek or rush from so that you can get kills. Be cautious around corners because campers can be waiting for you.

, The click of a rifle, reloading or footsteps can alert you of an enemy. Listen closely and memorize certain sounds. (E.g. the sound of a reloaded shotgun tells you not to rush him in close quarters).

, This is a crucial part. Never reload if you have only used a few rounds of your mag, because while you're reloading an enemy might spot you and kill you while you're reloading your weapon. Try to find cover, and then reload. If you have below 40% though, it becomes very important that you reload because those 40% might not be enough to kill your enemy. Remember, switching to Pistol is always faster than reloading.

, Mastering the recoil can be very beneficial, because then you can hit better. Try going to an empty server and empty your mag without moving the mouse. See where the bullets go, and see if you can control that recoil by burst firing or sliding your mouse down slowly as you shoot.

, In multiplayer modes a better ping will send and receive data from server faster. Close other bandwidth consuming application (E.g. downloads) during playing if you find your ping greater than average.

, Joining a clan is most of the time both fun and rewarding, because you can then play with the same people over and over, and maybe later on move over to professional gaming.

Get a standard games system.,
After you have found the correct system, you need to find the correct games to fit your playing type.,
Now that you have your system and games, you must find a good place to play them.,
Now that you have your area set up, you are ready for gaming!,
Now it's time to start looking the part of a real gamer.",How to Be a Real Gamer," You must have one to be a real gamer.


A PC (Personal Computer) is the objectively best game system. You can either buy a prebuilt PC, or build a custom PC, commonly known as a ""rig"" yourself, which is recommended as you can get the best prices for performance. You will most likely be using a platform made by Valve called Steam. PC's are also the most cost efficient as you can build a $300 PC that can perform better than a console and last longer or splurge and spend a $1000+ on a top of the line PC. The sweet-spot for price to performance is usually around $600 - $1000.
An Xbox One is a good game system for gamers, but still below the PC. It has a wide variety of games to choose from and great to play online with thousands of subscribers. This modern-gen console, or it's previous-gen counterpart, the Xbox 360 are great games system to start with, though some critics prefer the Playstation 4, because of slightly better hardware and different exclusives. Pro's: Wide selection of games, good online features. Con's: Could be seen as more of a casual system, online system is subscription based (i.e. you have to pay).
A Nintendo Wii U is a good system for younger appropriate (but still fun to play) games, classics, and some older games. Playing this system has more exercise than the competitors, and contrary to claims, does not make you less of a gamer! Pro's: Contains exercise, can be played with non-gamers, download classic games. Con's: Online is bad, very primitive, a lot of hastily-made software, no DVD player.
A Playstation 4 (PS4) is another viable option. PSN is not free on PS4, but the PS4 could be considered more hardcore than a One. Cons: Some reports of lag online, slightly less exclusives.;
, This would mean war games, racing games, and so on.

, An area where you can comfortably sit for hours on end is a must. Also, you need a place where people are not asking you to quit your important game so they can watch TV.

, When you first start a new game, jump right into story mode so you can master the controls. Sometimes it helps to listen to all the cut scenes throughout the game the first time so you can understand the entire plot of the game. After you have beaten the game on all of the harder levels, you still will be looking for more to do so move to online play and challenge people all over the world. Make sure you master the controls first before going online so you do not get owned/beaten to a pulp by other higher ranking gamers. Devoting time to these games makes or breaks you as a gamer. Hardcore gamers and real gamers spend many happy hours in front of their TV's playing and this hard work really pays off.

, You can show off the games you like by wearing shirts and hats expressing their logos and symbols. Speaking 1337 (Leet) is also very important and very simple. Knowing this will help you to read other gamers' gamer tags and clan tags.

Spawn kill indiscriminately.,
Never be a gentleman.,
Keep your mic on at all times and scream in it.,
Camp until it hurts.,
Focus your rage on one random person.",How to Be Annoying in Video Games1," In most games, there's at least one ""no-skill"" weapon that lets you kill easily without a lot of skill or know-how. This annoys purists to no end, because you're getting credit for brute force instead of delicate artistry. In Counter-Strike Source, for example, it's the P90 with its 50 clip and spam capability. In Team Fortress 2, it's the Sydney Sleeper or Machina for being able to do significant damage regardless of headshot. Every shooter game has a weapon that's easy to use for kills or exploits a loophole. If somebody complains about these weapons, all the better: get that gun and massacre them in illicit style.;
, On the flip side, if you can't find any no-skill weapons yourself, you can make fun of the people who use this tactic. People who make fun of gamers with no-skill weapons are sometimes called scrubs. A scrub is a species of gamer with a bad attitude who's forgotten how to have fun and is known to be a very sore loser. Scrubs tend to complain a lot — pretty much all the time. They complain because they've established rules of fair-play by themselves and deem everyone not following their rules to be cheating.


As most people know, complaining about why something is unfair quickly gets annoying. If you can do your best scrub impression and complain about a skill being too unbeatable, for example, you're sure to be very annoying.

, Whether it's a fully animated in-game taunt or mic-spam, this one works every time. After any kill, make a gesture that involves a single finger. See that ""excellent"" body shot? Make sure to wave! Of course, if you're not a fan of irony or subtlety, you can always just get your mic out and obnoxiously yell ""GET REKT,"" ""2K00L4U,"" or ""GIT GUD SCRUB."" The list goes on. In all caps.

, When a player spawns without weapons or armor, it's sometimes considered polite to give him time to find weapons or armor in order to make the fight ""fair."" If you come across someone who's just spawned, kill them. No one ever said video games were fair.

, If you want to truly be annoying, know that there's only so far you can go without being really insulting. Let's say, for example, you're playing some koth_lakeside in TF2 and see your teammate standing still. /votekick him for idling instantly. Afterward, his friend complains that his mom was yelling at him and he wasn't really idle. You may already feel like a jerk, so why not finish the job? ""Oh I'm sorry.... Here, I can talk to his mom. I've got her on the phone right now!""

, Probably the easiest way to be annoying is to just keep talking. It helps distract other players, and if you are using expletives or saying offensive things, it will really help you maximize how annoying you are. Here are some other surefire microphone strategies to annoy your opponents:


Make ""pew pew"" noises when you shoot your weapon. Bonus points if your weapon is huge.
Scream into the mic in really tense moments of the game when other gamers are concentrating.
Turn your mic on and keep it on for long periods of time so people can hear your awful background noises.
React sincerely to an insincere insult. If someone says ""Shut up. Nobody likes you,"" an excellent response would be ""Thank you for the feedback. I really appreciate it. I'll try to better myself.""
Keep saying the same things in chat or in team speak. Over and over and over again.

, Remain in the same spot all the time and wait for enemies to come to you instead of coming to them. A lot of people complain about campers instead of out-gambiting the camper or simply avoiding the area. Campers have a reputation the world over for violating the spirit of video games.

, Traditionally, FPSs are a free-for-all. Shoot everyone and anyone to rack up the most kills. If you want things to get a little weird — and annoying — you can follow around a single (preferably bad) player and only focus on killing them. It doesn't make sense, but that's what it's so deliciously annoying.

"
"
Demonstrate that co-op doesn't always mean teamwork.,
Quit or join games mid-way.,
Crash games that you are hosting.,
Embrace the role of backstabber.,
Do none of the work and take all of the credit.,
Use the Leeroy Jenkins method.,
Call for help when you don't need it.",How to Be Annoying in Video Games2," Your friend is flying through a portal at high speed when suddenly the portal he was jumping into changes into a pit of flame. Oops. This tactic involves being a ""teammate"" right up until your teammate is truly relying on you to contribute — especially when it involves you ""holding a line"" for him — and then maddeningly failing. From shooting the boomer next to your teammate in L4D to stepping off the button as your friend steps on the platforms across a pit in Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, there are just so many ways you can pull it off.

, This does not mean you actually have to leave the game. Just set the controller down and walk away. Nothing will annoy your teammates more than dead weight that the other team can keep killing.

, When you have high latency and you're the host in multiplayer games, disconnect and start another game. You'll be sure to be hated.

, You walk out of the forest where two other people are aiming down at you. You get on your knees. You say, ""Hey guys, I'm friendly."" They say: ""How can we be sure? Here's a gun. There's some bandits over there; go take them down and you can stay."" They hand you a gun. Two shots later, four bandits are running your way and you're running off with as much food, potions, and ammo as you can carry. Plus, two neutrals are neutralized and are considering rage quitting.


Try playing a game of plasma potato in Halo: Reach. Say your team is one point away from winning. Play hot potato with a plasma grenade, knowing full well that there's a betrayal penalty (say -10). Your plasma grenade kills each team member. If you're in a team of 8 people, you just lost your team 80 points. This is trolling at its most diabolical.
This tactic really only applies to survival games. You just gain somebody's trust, and as soon as they drop their guard, they're dead. Kind of like the ""teamwork"" tactic, just more sadistic. Of course, just killing on sight is fine as well. Just make sure you can win it.
Don't push this tactic. If you overdo it at any time (except for the survival bit), you'll probably be kicked. Do it moderately; make sure enough people find you funny to vote no to the votekicks that come up.

, This one is so annoying because it offends our sense of justness. This strategy works nicely in Mass Effect 3, for example. In multiplayer vs Cerberus, the atlas comes down and you sit behind a wall and camp, waiting for your friends to labor away at taking its armor and health down. Swoop in at the last moment and kill it, taking the kill, the points, and the glory. That's an annoyance.

, Leeroy Jenkins is a now-famous WoW meme: unaware of his guild's intricate attack plans, Leeroy rushes the enemy and unwittingly gets everyone in his guild killed. You, too, can do the same. Especially in FPS games, this method is sure to not only lose the round for your team but also make it very annoying to be in the same game as you.

, Be the boy who cries wolf. If your teammates rush to your ""aid"" but find nothing to protect you against, you can say something like: ""Why did you guys come here? I handled those noobs all by myself. I'm insulted you ever thought I'd need the help.""

Work your way up.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Start off with improving your aim by using handguns or assault rifles.,
Sniping doesn't mean shooting from far places.,
Know what you're aiming at.,
Similar to leading is accounting for drop.,
If you spy another sniper in your zoom, then you should shoot them if they are concentrated on something else.,
Now that you can snipe well, practice avoiding other snipers and enemies while you go sniping.,
Keep practicing until you perfect your aiming and damage.

",How to Be a Master at Sniping in Games," Practice first on easy mode; if it's too easy, then normal. If that's also simple then try hard until you get to the highest level of difficulty.;
, You won't be able to concentrate in games like this if you don't have your full concentration. Also, stretch before playing to help with your reflexes.

, Try to aim for the head when using guns. This will later help with headshots in sniping. Once you can shoot in the head with a handgun or rifle, then you can pick up a sniper rifle.

, It just means shooting from a concealed area. So start off from small ranges. When at a small range in a concealed position, start off with shooting the chest, then neck, and finally the head. Once you can headshot from short range, you should try far concealed places. Follow the same procedure, chest, neck, and then head.

, Follow your target's movement, if the target is moving then you should position the crosshair a little to the left if they are running to the left (same goes with right). This is called 'leading' the target. The faster they are moving and the farther away they are, the more you need to lead them to hit them. Otherwise, adjust it to 'Lock On' effect.

, Some newer, more advanced games include realistic physics systems which include adding gravity to bullets. Therefore, if you find you just aren't hitting a target that's far away, try aiming up a few degrees.

, If they are concentrated on you, you should either move or have a sniper war. When in a sniper war you should shoot then duck so you can dodge the shot.

, Always pick a location that when you crouch your body is completely hidden. This is so that you can reload or hide from enemy fire if you miss and they see you.

Find out the goal of the game.,

Be smart and advantageous.",How to Be a Skilled Player in PvP (Player vs. Player) Matches," Is the goal to capture a flag, or destroy something or kill all players? Knowing various goals will get you where you want to be - skillful and resourceful to your team. Even if you don't have a natural skill for finding out the goal, figure out the goal and make sure you know what you're doing!
, Whatever game you are playing, if you don't have a high level of skill you will never beat those other players. Everyone has gotten upset at least once when a highly skilled player kept beating them. In addition, one should get very strategic - from using falls or other ways to accumulate damage on foes to luring your foe into a false sense of security and killing them when they're unaware that they're being attacked, there's all sorts of strategies, but it depends on the game., It takes time, but It allows you to formulate ideas and tricks you can use against your opponents later. This will naturally go with getting the idea of which strategies work, which strategies don't, and which strategies will get you banned for each individual player or server - try not to use the ones that don't work for that player in a 1v1 game but never use the ones that will get you banned on that server!, A lot of players will use this to their advantage to score extra kills in a free-for-all match, for example - find every camping spot, every weapon, and a lot more., If an advantage is available in one spot, use it. For example, If there's a good vantage point get there and keep an eye out for other players. If there's a hill from which you can snipe, get up the hill and shoot players with whatever ranged weapon you got."

Be respectful when playing online or with friends.,
Play with friends.",How to Be a Good Gamer," There are four main options: PS4, XBOX, Wii U, or PC (computer). There are several pros and cons to each console; research all the information you can before you decide which to choose.

Consoles are a little expensive, so it's important to pick one that you can get the most enjoyment from.



 

;
, There are several types of game genres, including first or third person shooters, RPGs (role playing games), TBG (turn based games) puzzle, fighting, action/adventure, racing, sports, etc. This is a small list. Again, spend some time researching the different genres to decide what you like. If you like a lot of fast paced action that will keep you on your toes, try shooters or action games. If you'd rather sit back, relax, and let a long story unfold, try RPGs. A lot of people are already familiar with the puzzle genre; Bejeweled and Zuma are just two of the many puzzle games.

You may also find you like more than just one genre.







, You should buy two or three when getting the console. Of course, you can just buy one, but it's nice to have a few different games to switch out, in case you get bored, stuck, or mad at one game. If you buy used games, you can get two or three more games than the price of a brand new game. Also, try picking out games of different genres.

, People who have been gaming for a while can skip this step if they want. However, if you're new to gaming, it's best to read the instruction manual fully. A lot of things will be thrown at you very quickly, but you'll pick up the basics in no time.

, If the game has several difficulty settings, start at the lowest. You can always ratchet up the difficulty later if you think it's too easy.

, The more you play video games, the more you will instinctively know in other games. For fighting games or any multiplayer games, you should practice a lot by yourself. Get used to the controls before playing against someone else.

, Very often you will get stuck playing the same level or the same scenario. You'll lose over and over again. You'll convince yourself it's impossible. There might be profanity. Walk away, take a break, and come back to the game later.

, Don't curse, use profanity, or insult other players. In addition to being disliked by your friends, you could be banned from playing online or have negative marks on your profile.

, It can be more enjoyable than just playing alone. If they are a gamer, they also can teach you techniques.

"
"
Sit near the screen, it really helps you to have reflexes and awareness of the game.,
Play everyday, addictiveness isn't a problem that ruins the game play; but don't forget to play for fun most of the times.

,
Work with your teammates when you get the opportunity, they might return the favor when you support them like reviving, healing, supplying, buffing or whatever.

,
Try playing with friends, its funnier and makes more motivation.

,
When in a fighting game, don't button mash that much, do your moves according to each situation, because pro players don't actually button mash.

,
Try not to be afraid of losing the first position, relax and keep it up!

,
Don't be so balanced on an RPG, you have to create the situation X and be good at the situation X.

,
try exploring the ""highs an lows"" of your character, you can kill and you can die, you aren't chuck Norris to kill everyone after all.

,
Great players aren't always the top positions, and the top positions aren't always the great players.

,
Luck will always exist, so don't be angry if you get something too ""unfair"".

,Be sure to use strategy or at least think of what you will do when you are playing a ""slow"" paced game

,
when you are on a loss streak, just don't be angry, your mentality affects the game play too, so be patient and recover what you lost.

,
Respect the defense, camping is a defensive tactic too, it can make you angry but the attack is considered by attempts usually.

,
Have your own game play, don't use a sniper because someone told you, its you who is playing the game and its you who will make the decisions.

,
Make some abdominals if you think you are too sedentary, because the way you feel is very important to the skill.

,
Don't hack or cheat, it doesn't make you a great gamer.

Click your game's ""Save"" button.",How to Avoid Game Lag on a Low End System," The old ""turn it off and on again"" trick isn't the answer to all of your problems, but it will reset the computer's RAM cache, which--when full--can cause performance issues. Additionally, restarting your computer after it has been on for several days is both helpful for system speed and good for the computer's overall health., Having anything running in the background will detract from the amount of RAM and processing speed which your computer can dedicate to your game; this isn't a huge deal if you simply have Minesweeper or Tetris minimized while you're playing a game, but having multiple programs open at once will certainly impact your games' frame rates--especially on a low-end system.You can close background apps and processes on Windows by pressing Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc, clicking a program in the window that pops up, and then clicking End Task.
You can close background apps and process on a Mac by pressing ⌘ Command+⌥ Option+Esc, clicking a program in the window that pops up, and then clicking Force Quit.

, If your computer is outdated to the point that it isn't able to run your games well, updating to the latest version of MacOS or Windows isn't going to fix the games' performance--in fact, it may cause more problems since your computer's processor and RAM will have to dedicate more power to sustaining the operating system.

, If you're just experiencing problems with one specific game--especially if it's a new game that just released--look to see if there's a recommended patch or update for the game. Sometimes, PC games will launch with locked frame rates or other bugs that prevent the game from reaching an acceptable FPS speed.Counter to your computer's operating system, you should always keep your games up-to-date, since developers will often release periodic performance improvements and tweaks.

, If your computer has space for extra RAM cards (or can replace your current RAM cards with better ones), consider taking your computer into a technology department to have professionals add it for you. RAM is by far the easiest (and cheapest) upgrade you can perform, and having more of it will decrease a running game's impact on your computer's overall memory consumption.If your computer's processor is severely outdated, adding RAM won't help prevent lag, as the processor is likely the problem.
Before purchasing RAM, talk to a tech department employee or look up your computer's make and model number to see which types of RAM it supports.

, One way to improve a game's performance is by toning down its graphical settings; while this will noticeably reduce your game's visual presentation, it will also reduce the amount of information on the screen, thereby allowing a faster FPS rate.


If the game with which you're experiencing trouble is an online-based game, you must be connected to the Internet to continue.

, You can typically access game settings from the game's home screen, though you may first have to choose a profile.


This may be called Options, Game Options, or something similar on some games.

, This area is where you can control the game's display. By lowering certain settings in the Video menu, you will greatly increase your game's performance.


You may also see a Graphics option here. If so, some of the settings covered here may be in the Graphics menu instead of the Video menu.

, Some games have an overall quality setting that can be turned down to ""Low""; this is by far the easiest and quickest way to lower your game's graphical complexity and raise your game's frame rate.


Some games don't have this option. If you can't find a ""Quality"" item, don't worry--just proceed to the next step.

, You'll need to lower your game's textures' quality to ""Low"" if possible. Doing so will remove some of the fine detailing in your game, but your frame rate will increase as a result.

, You should turn shadows off entirely if this option is available. Naturally, doing this will remove the shadows from your game, but the positive effect on your frame rate will surpass the negative effect on the game's appearance.

, Anti-aliasing smooths the edges of hard lines and intersecting polygons (e.g., stairs or walls). Especially in newer games, disabling this option won't make a huge, noticeable difference in visual presentation, but it will likely increase your game's performance.

, Few games have the exact same Settings menu entries, but you should look for some of the following items:



Shaders - These effects create a sense of detail and dimensionality. Set any shaders to ""Low"" or ""Off"".

Particles - Things like smoke, sparks, and fire. Your particles should be set to ""Low"" or ""Off"" for best results.

Fog, Draw Distance, View Distance, Horizon, etc. - Any setting which pertains to the maximum viewable distance in-game. Lowering this setting will greatly increase performance on a low-end system, though it might adversely affect gameplay for games like multiplayer first-person shooters wherein other players can see farther than you can.

Water Quality - Pertains to water animations. This may be a setting you wish to leave alone on some games, though it's generally okay to turn down to ""Low"" for first-person shooters and RPGs.

Lighting Quality - This setting often works in conjunction with the ""Shadows"" setting, and is sometimes called ""Dynamic Lighting"". Turning it down to ""Low"" or ""Off"" will increase your game's FPS.

, Doing so will save your changes and apply them to your game, though you may have to restart the game (or your browser if it's an online-based game) before the changes take place. Your game should now be running better than it was before.


If your game runs flawlessly after making these adjustments, you can go back and bump up the settings to add back in some of the game's original detail if you like.

Gather information about what they want.,
Get outside advice.,
Use the ESRB rating system.,
Consider your child, not your child's age.,
Don't worry about what the other children are allowed or not allowed to play.,
Check what system(s) you've got.,
When it doubt, look on the box for the console name.,
Make sure you don't accidentally buy a sequel to a game your child hasn't played.,
Keep the receipt.,
Purchase the game and give it to your child.

",How to Choose a Video Game for Children," Have your kids asked for a specific video game? Then you at least know where to start. If they haven't, don't worry, there are video games made for almost every single interest. If they're into fantasy / medieval movies or TV shows, there are games for that. If they like football, science fiction, or pirates? There are games for all those things. Go with what you know your children are into.;
, Go to your local game store and discuss your children's interests with the local salesman. You'll be surprised how happy they are to help guide you through the process of picking a good game.

, On the box of every video game should be a large letter in a white box. That's the rating for the game. It will help let you know, generally, what sort of negative content is in that game. The system goes as follows;


EC = Early Childhood. These are games intended for young children. If your child is around 3-5 years old, you may want to look into these games.
E = Everyone. As such, this game likely has no blood, little to no combat/violence at all, and no cursing or sex. It's literally acceptable for everyone.
E10+ = Everyone 10 and Older. There may be a little cartoonish combat or fantasy violence, but nothing that is unsuitable for your child.
T= Teen. It might have some cartoonish combat or maybe a few curse words. Perhaps at some point, someone steps off-screen and comes back with their hair in a tussle and a woman walking out the other door.  However, generally, this is just a slightly more edgy version of E and, as such, almost never contains anything terribly unsuitable.
M = Mature. This is the legendary grey area. Being that a person must be at least 17 to purchase mature games, most are given to younger children as gifts. Mature covers many video games and the reason it is rated mature could be a variety of things, from blood to abundant cursing to partial nudity and sometimes all three. If you look closely at the back of the box, in another white box, it should explain what aspects of the game got it the M rating. Consider those before purchasing.
AO = The rare adult only rating has only been given to a very few video games and it means they are so bloody, carnal, or sexy that an M rating cannot suffice. Needless to say, an AO game is virtually never acceptable for children.

, What can your children handle and what is too much for them? Some games may get an M rating because of a single optional instance of partial nudity; if you think your child is mature enough to handle that, then there is no reason not to let them have the mature game. On the other hand, if your child is extremely scared of doctors, even a T game featuring a surgeon may be too much. Just play to your child's strengths and weaknesses. You know your kids; use that.

, Their parents make different decisions and could be right or wrong.


Just because Timmy isn't allowed to play ""Super Smash Brothers"" doesn't mean there is anything too mature about the game for your child to play it.
At the same time, if Timmy is allowed to play ""I have no Mouth and I must Scream,"" that doesn't mean you need to let your child play it too. (And if he's playing ""I have no Mouth"" and his parents let him, his parents are insane.)

, Nothing is more annoying than having to return a game because it's for the wrong system. Know the system you have and what games play on it.


Today, there are 3 major players in the video game console market.

Sony, which makes the PlayStation. The system is generally black, the buttons are squares, triangles, circles, and the letter X. This system marks its games with either a blue or transparent bar on the top that will say Playstation.
Nintendo, which makes the Wii or Wii U. Wii games have slightly larger boxes than the other two and will have a milky white bar at the top with the word Wii in gray letters. Wii U games have a blue bar at the top with the word Wii U in white letters. Nintendo also makes the DS and 3DS, which are smaller systems that have two screens. DS games have a white bar with the word Nintendo DS in black letters at the left side, while 3DS games have a white bar with the word Nintendo 3DS in black letters at the right side; with the ""3"" colored red.
Microsoft, which makes Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Don't be confused by their horrible ability to number things; Xbox One is actually the latest system they've made. Their games will have a white and green bar and will be marked with the word Xbox on them.



, It will always be on there.

, While this is okay for games like Mario Kart or Castle Castlevania, starting off on Metal Gear Solid 2 wouldn't be the greatest idea. Look for numbers after the title and ask the store manager if it is a ""stand alone"" game. That just means you can play it without having to play the earlier games to understand it.

, Nobody is perfect and you don't know if you'll need to return it within a week, so play it safe.

On the bottom of the Dreamcast, look for a number in a circle near the word PAL or NTSC. If the number is 0 or 1 you can play burned games. If the number is 2 or higher, you cannot play burned games.;
, You can find Dreamcast backup files in various locations around the internet. It is illegal to download a backup file for a game that you do not own. To find a game, perform a Google search for ""game name dreamcast download"".

, Many Dreamcast games come in RAR archives. You'll need a program like WinRAR or the free 7-Zip to open these files and extract the actual game files.


You can download WinRAR from rarlab.com/download.htm. The trial version will work fine for opening RAR files. You can download 7-Zip from 7-zip.org.

, ImgBurn is a freeware programs, but you'll need to ensure that you decline the extra software it tries to install. With the right add-on drivers (see the next step), ImgBurn is by far the easiest and most reliable way to burn Dreamcast games.


You can download ImgBurn from imgburn.com.

, These extra drivers will give ImgBurn the support to burn Dreamcast .CDI and .NRG files. You can download the drivers here.When you extract the file, you'll see a setup file for ImgBurn and another compressed file called ""cdi files for imgburn"". You can ignore the setup file since you installed the newest version of ImgBurn already.

, Use your newly-installed WinRAR or 7-Zip program to extract the game files from the RAR file. Extracting the files may give you a set of even more RAR files. If this is the case, start with the .part1 file to automatically join and extract the multiple parts.

, You cannot use DVDs or CD-RW discs. To ensure the best chances for your burnt games, use a high-quality disc like Memorex or Verbatim.

, Alternatively, you can right-click on your file and select ""Open With ImgBurn"".

, If you have a BIN/CUE file, select the CUE file.

, This will give you the least chance of encountering an error during the burn.

, This will verify the disc after burning to ensure that it was successful, but this will add extra time to the process and there's nothing you can do to fix a corrupted disc anyway.

, This is the large button in the lower-left corner. Your disc will begin burning.

, Some users have reported more success if they start with the power to the system turned off before inserting the game.

, If the game had two or more sessions, it is likely a self-booting game, and should start up just like a real game would. If the game shows up as an audio CD on the Dreamcast, you may need to use the Utopia Boot Disc.

, You can download the image file for this disc from most Dreamcast emulation and modding sites. Chances are that the site that you downloaded your game backup file from also has the Utopia Boot Disc.

, Follow the game burning instructions above to burn the Utopia Boot Disc image to your blank CD-R., After the Dreamcast and Sega logos appear, you'll see the Utopia Boot Disc screen., Remove the Utopia disc from the Dreamcast once it stops spinning.

, After a moment the Utopia screen will change and your game will be booted. This may take longer than normal.

Understand what 3D Analyze does.,
Download and install 3D Analyze.,
Run 3D Analyze.,
Select your game executable.,
Use the Performance section to adjust graphics settings.,
Disable textures for a big performance boost.,
Disable lighting for another good performance increase.,
Try running your game.,
Understand the basic process.,
Determine which version of DirectX your game requires.,
Set the appropriate options for the version you want to switch to.,
Try running the game.,
Use 3D Analyze to change your video card information.",How to Change High Graphic Game to Low Graphic Game with 3D Analyze," This tool can be used for older games and video cards (pre-2003). It can lower the graphical effects of a game to help you run it better, and it can emulate DirectX features so that you can run a game that your graphics card technically does not support. Note that this program will not work with most cards made by Nvidia and AMD/ATI, which is the vast majority of the market. This program is designed for 3DFX, Voodoo, PowerVR, and ATI cards made before 2003.;
, You can download this tool for free from here. To install the program, extract the files into a folder where you can easily access them, such as your Desktop or Documents folder.

, A window will appear with a bunch of checkboxes. This is the 3D Analyze interface, and you can use it to make adjustments to your game before playing.

, Click the ""SELECT"" button and browse for the EXE file for your game. You can usually find this is the games folder in the Program Files directory.

, There are a variety of options you can toggle in the Performance section before launching your game. Disabling features may make the game run better, but they can also cause significant problems and stability issues. Games aren't designed to use the features, so the chances of encountering a problem are high.


Remember, this will only be effective on games made in the early 2000s and earlier. Newer games will not benefit from this program, and will likely crash upon startup.
Most Windows games will use the ""DirectX 8.1 and 9.0 Options"" section. Older games will use the ""OpenGL Options"" section.

, Select ""disable textures"" to turn off all textures in your game. Be prepared for a very ugly game, as textures are what give the 3D models details. Everything will appear flat when you force textures off. This will result in one of the biggest performance gains if it works with your game.


If you want to use textures, but still want a performance increase, select ""force small texture (32x32)"". This will load basic textures, but they will be much smaller than normal.

, Dynamic lighting is a popular way to make games appear more realistic, but it can have a dramatic impact on your framerate. Disabling lighting can help you get a newer game running on an older system. Again, this will not work on all games.

, After adjusting a few settings, try playing the game by clicking the ""RUN"" button. If the game crashes or doesn't work like it should, go back to the Performance section in 3D Analyze and try some different settings. It will take a lot of trial and error before you find a combination that works well for your game and your system.

, 3D Analyze can trick your games into thinking you're running a more advanced graphics card. Some of the graphics card computations are then handled by your CPU instead. This can be good if you have a very old computer and want to run a slightly less old game.


This is a very finicky process, and will likely not work for many game.

, There are many versions of DirectX, and if your card is old it may not support newer versions. You can determine which version your game requires by checking its system requirements.

, You can use 3D Analyze to move to the version of DirectX immediately following yours. For example, if you have DirectX 7, you can emulate DirectX 8, but not 8.1 or 9.


DirectX 7 - Check ""emulate HW TnL caps"", ""emulate bump map caps"", and ""emulate cube maps"".
DirectX 8 - Check ""emulate other DX8.1 caps"", ""emulate pixel shader caps"", and ""skip pixel shader version 1.1"".
DirectX 8.1 - Check ""skip pixel shader version 1.4"".
DirectX 9 - Check ""skip pixel shader version 2.0"".

, Test the game to see if your DirectX emulation is allowing the game to run. If you get an error message about an unsupported video card, read on.

, The game you are trying to run may give you a message about your video card being unsupported. If this is the case, you can use 3D Analyze to change your graphics card's hardware ID information so that the game thinks a different card is installed.Look for the ""VendorID"" and ""DeviceID"" fields in 3D Analyze. Find a card listed to the right that is compatible with the game you want to play. Enter the ID numbers listed below the card into the corresponding fields to change what your computer reports as the installed graphics card.
If you need to switch back to your actual hardware ID information, enter ""0"" into both fields.

Start from games you may enjoy.,
Start your gaming collection on one specific console at a time.,
Collect games that has a long line of popular game series.",How to Build up a Video Game Collection," It's always a pretty good idea to start your collections on games you already know you would or most likely enjoy.;
, It would be more difficult to find games for different consoles all over the place. So to save time I would recommend focusing on one console at a time unless if you know exactly which games you were planning to buy.

, Such as Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo, Silent Hill, God of War, Legend of Zelda, Assassin's creed, Mortal Kombat, Star Wars, Etc. Those games series are very popular at the moment and would look great on any games collection.

Keep Watch.",How to Build a Fort in 7 Days to Die," Your fort should be close to supply run locations, but not too close as to attract attention. Ensure that you have good visibility from all sides of the fort. Consider building a tall watchtower if you don't have good visibility in your chosen location.;
, It may be easier to build your fortress if you use an existing structure as the foundation. This can save you some precious materials. A fortress is a huge base that can protect and support the players inside it. Two houses will work as long as they stand close or right next to each other.


A house with a basement is ideal for mining and creating underground tunnel to move around the map.
Make sure to put torches inside the house to keep zombies from spawning.

, You will need a lot of materials to construct a well-protected fort. You'll find this process easier if you have some friends helping you. You'll need plenty of wood and stone, as well as materials for traps and other features.

, Zombies will be swarming your fortress almost constantly, so you'll need strong walls to repel them. Stone makes for the strongest walls, though it is the most time-consuming process. The thicker the walls are, the better.


Remember that Zombies can break stone blocks if they attack it continuously.
Also, there are zombies that can climb up walls if not protected; you need to set up traps around your base.

, This will create ramparts, allowing you to more easily defend the wall from attacking zombies. It will take some extra materials, but your fort will be much more secure.

, Use dynamite to blast a large chasm around your fort. Attacking zombies will fall down the hole, killing them if it's deep enough. Make sure that the chasm goes all the way around your fort.


You can build a bridge with a ladder hanging down to allow you access to the fort. Zombies aren't able to climb ladders.
For best effect, make the sides of the chasm as smooth as possible. This will ensure that the zombies can't break their fall on protruding blocks.

, Your fort needs to be well supplied to survive for long days. To store your rations, you need to build a small chest or simply make use of the house's drawers and cupboards. To build a storage chest, you need 6 Plywood.


Plywood can be built from Wood Planks, not from burnt or old trees.
Press I; click the Storage Chest in the craft list to activate the pattern.
Following the pattern, place 1 plywood per box to finish the process.
Building a farm is a good source of water; you can make an infinite water hole by breaking one block off the ground and pouring water into it. The supply will be infinite as long as you use a glass jar for drinking.

, Wood Spikes are traps used to defend structures by impaling zombies, players or animals. It's best to put wood spikes outside the fort, right next to the walls.


To make a Wood Spike, you need 9 Sharpened Sticks.
Click Wood Spikes on the craft list to acquire the highlighted pattern. Place 1 Sharpened Sticks on each box to craft.
Use about 3 layers of Spikes, or more, to make sure that no zombie can survive before they can reach your fort walls.

, The Trunk Tip is the best trap structure in the game; they make fine traps compared to wood spikes due to the fact that they don't break. However, they do give less damage and require a 2-block deep hole to place them in.


To make a Trunk Tip, you need 4 Wood Blocks; any kind of wood block will do (i.e. Birch Wood, Pine Wood, Burnt Wood or Wood).
Press I; click the name Trunk Tip in the craft list to activate the highlighted pattern. In each box, you put 1 Wood to complete the crafting.
Before placing Trunk Tip next to your walls, make sure to dig 2-blocks deep off the ground since this kind of trap is taller, which count as though zombies are standing one block higher.

, A Barbed Fence Wire is a craftable item but can also be scavenged around the world. This is commonly used to fortify a perimeter or to block breaches in walls during the night.


To make a Barbed Fence Wire, you need 2 Sticks and 1 Barbed Wire. Barbed wire can be obtained by crafting 3 Forging Iron; as a result, it will give you 15 barbed wires.
Open your craft window. Make sure you have the requirements inside your inventory. Click the Barbed Fence Wire name to activate the pattern.
In the middle, put 1 barbed wire then put 1 stick on either side of it.

, Make sure you have completely locked down the place. Block up any entry; place torches around your fortress, and then grab any range weapon you have.


Zombies die because of the traps you set up earlier. There's no need for you to use your gun. Save your ammunition as much as you can and only use your range weapon for emergencies.

Learn the Mage class basics.,
Open the Deck Building Screen.,
Choose the Mage Class.,
Examine the cards available.,
Choose your strategy.,
Start with Mage-specific cards.,
Add in neutral cards to fill out the rest of the deck.,
Play your deck against the Innkeeper.,
Play your deck against players in Play Mode.,
Fine tune your deck.",How to Build a Mage Deck in Hearthstone," Before you begin building your Mage deck, it is important to take the time to really understand how the Mage class works. The Mage class has a couple of roles that they can take on:


The Mage’s hero power is the ability to do one damage to anything on the board, including minions or heroes protected by minions with taunt applied. It can also be used to remove Divine Shield on an opponent’s minion.
The mage deck has some of the most powerful direct damage spells in the game. For example fireball will do six direct damage to a player or minion and only costs four mana crystals.
The Mage deck is perfect for the beginner because it is considered a mid-cost deck. This means the cards available usually cost between 2-5 mana, but are powerful enough to combat both the decks that fill the field with lots of minions at low cost and those that focus on minions with high costs and powerful abilities. You can create a powerful Mage deck using only the cards granted to you for free simply by playing through the tutorials and leveling up the hero.
The mage class is also considered a control class. The Mage can effectively control the board by using spells to systematically take out the opponent’s minions and do direct damage to the player, leaving the opponent no way to block your own minion’s attacks.;
, Click the My Collections button on the bottom of the opening screen. You will then be taken to the create a deck screen. On the right hand side choose New Deck.

, This will take you to the next screen where you will be able to view the mage class cards and neutral class cards.


At the top of this screen you will see either a drop down menu on the mobile platform or tabs on the PC version which allow you to switch between the class specific cards and the neutral cards.

, It is vitally important that at this point you take the time to carefully look at the available cards. A good strategy is not only to look at the cards you have available right now but also to click the crafting button at the top of the screen to see all possible cards that you could get or craft for that deck. This will show you how you can enhance the deck you are building in the future.


Take the time to note how the cards you have interact with one another. For example, using a minion card with a plus to spell power ability will enhance the damage of your spells according to the number listed on the card.

, Choosing a strategy is important before you start building your deck. Do you want to deal copious amounts of damage? Do you want to attack your opponent’s minions or the player directly? Do you want to focus on defense? The choice is yours but keeping this in mind when building will help you build a solid deck.


A direct damage deck deals primarily with high-power spells like Firebolt and using the hero power to do damage directly to the player. As you increase in power and gain more Mage cards, you will incorporate spells that wipe the board of most minions (including your own). Once the board is clear, use the spells in your hand to take your opponent’s hero down to low health in a single turn.
A defense deck uses cards like Ice Barrier, Frost Nova, and Vaporize to incorporate a game-play strategy called turtling. Turtling is where the player uses high defense abilities to make it difficult to attack them. This strategy is not recommended for new players because it is easily defeated by players who have more experience with the game and is often seen as a tactic used by inexperienced players.
A summoner deck focuses on creating minions and overwhelming the opponent. Unlike the direct damage and area of effect decks, the summoner will strive to keep minions alive. You must consider the abilities of minions and complement them with spell card choices. An excellent example is playing the Ethereal Arcanist and a secret in the same turn.

, Now that you have a strategy in mind, start building your deck around that strategy. Choose cards that focus on your goal but remember to keep a good balance.


If you chose to go the direct damage route, be sure to add in minions to block the attacks of your opponent and buff the spells in your hand. Some good choices are: The Dalaran Aspirant, a few Mana Wyrms, the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, and the Fallen Hero.
If you decided that a defensive strategy is best for you, be sure to add in some damage spells as well. Blizzard and Cone of Cold are excellent additions to a defense deck.
With a summoner deck be sure to complement your minions with spells and abilities. An excellent example is playing the Ethereal Arcanist paired with a secret card. Each turn you have a secret in effect at the end of your turn, the Ethereal Arcanist will gain a +2 to health and damage. This will continue to increase as long as you have a secret.

, Once you have added the Mage class cards to your deck that work with your strategy fill out the following slots with neutral cards. The cards you have available to you will depend on how many you have unlocked playing the game. Choose cards that will work well with the mage class. Some good choices are those with a bonus to spell power or have the ability to increase your hand size by drawing cards.

, Now that you have built your deck, you will want to get in a little practice with it. Try taking on the Innkeeper in Practice Mode. You will be able to test out your deck against all the classes in this mode and see what it is strongest against. While playing in this mode you will have the opportunity to level up your Mage class and possibly unlock new Mage cards.

, Once you have a good indication of how your deck plays against the different classes it is time to take on other players. While the AI in Practice Mode will give you an indication of how the deck plays against the standard strategies of the other classes, playing against players will show you how it holds up against advanced tactics. Playing ranked matches will also increase your player skill using your new deck.


These matches will be against players of similar rank and skill, and as your rank increases so will the players’ ranks you play against. These modes also will grant you XP with your class and unlock additional cards as you continue to play.

, After you have played both the AI and other players with your deck, return to the deck building screen and fine tune your deck. By this point you should know the strengths and weaknesses of your deck and how it plays against different classes. You may have unlocked new cards while testing and should look them over to see if they would be good substitutes for cards you found were not suited to your strategy.


A common mistake for new players is constantly switching out cards before matches. If you do this you will not have a good idea of how your deck works and may find yourself with a bunch of random cards that do not complement one another well. Resist the urge and wait until you have played a few rounds before returning to work on your deck, it will benefit you in the long run.

, The Quest Log can be found at the bottom right-hand side of your screen (the exclamation point icon). A window will appear showing a list of on-going and available quests.


When you open your Quest Log, make sure you're in a city or town to avoid being attacked by monsters.
The Quest Log can also be opened by pressing Q on your keyboard.

,, Head straight to the Underground Waterway, under Very Hard mode, and kill 7 Mickey the Mice.


This can be done in a party. If your party member kills a Mickey, that too will be counted.
To get in a dungeon, simply press the Dungeon tab found on your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter and then press Start Dungeon, or hit F8 on your keyboard.

Come up with a theme.,
Vary your content type.,
Purchase and use high-quality recording and editing equipment.,
Post your videos consistently.,
Promote your YouTube videos on social media.,
Ask users for their feedback.,
Play high-profile releases.,
Interact with the community.",How to Become a Famous YouTube Gamer," Before you film your first YouTube video, you'll need to know what your channel is going to focus on. All content produced on your channel should follow your established theme from day one.For example, you might decide to stick with a horror theme, or you might gravitate more toward titles in the first-person shooter genre.
You should name your channel something memorable that reflects the theme.;
, While your channel's common theme should connect all of your content, that doesn't mean all of your content needs to be identical. In fact, you should find a way to weave your channel's theme through different types of content.


For example, you might specialize in doing ""Let's Plays"", but you could also add a review component to your channel.
Similarly, you can always add a challenge-based series of videos to complement your standard walk-throughs or Let's Plays.
If you focus on competitive multiplayer, try analyzing your own footage in a live stream or giving other players tips.

, If your videos aren't high-definition with decent sound quality and proper editing, even loyal subscribers won't spend long periods of time watching them. Common equipment you'll need in order to ensure high-quality videos includes the following:A capture card - The equipment you'll use to record your on-screen content. These tend to run around $150.A microphone - Having a dedicated microphone will ensure that your audio is both live during the play-through (rather than added in later) and clear. You can usually find these for between $15 and $120.Video editing software - Even giving your videos a cursory edit to remove awkward or boring parts will do wonders for your video quality. ""Wondershare Filmora"" is a great intermediate video-editing software option for both Mac and PC users.

An external hard drive (optional but recommended) - Since you're going to be recording and editing high-definition video files, having an external storage unit for your footage will ensure that your computer's long-term performance won't suffer from storing too much data. Backing up your videos to an external hard drive also means you won't have to worry about them being lost if your channel goes down.

, Whether it's once a week or once a day, establish a posting schedule and stick to it. Your loyal YouTube subscribers will look forward to your next post date, so don't keep them waiting!If you have to change the time and/or date at which you'll be posting, address it in a video.
Consider writing down the time and date that you'll post your next video in the description section.
There is such a thing as posting too frequently--you don't want to over-saturate your subscribers' home pages.

, If your YouTube video is only available on YouTube, you're limiting the demographic that will find and view your video. Posting on Facebook, Twitter, and other high-profile social media sites will immediately increase the number of people who stumble across your video.You can also promote your videos on their relevant subreddit.
YouTube-specific sites like ScrewAttack tend to feature up-and-coming YouTube gamers.

, Doing so will both help you improve your channel in a way that the majority of your users will appreciate and demonstrate that you care about you fanbase. Feedback you'll want to look for includes the following:



Games to play - Ask your subscribers for a wishlist of games they'd like to see in the near future.

Commentary style - The way you speak on camera will affect how well-liked your videos are by your subscribers.

Additional content - As mentioned previously, you'll want to vary your content. However, you should run your additional content ideas past your subscribers first.

General feedback - Give your subscribers a chance to tell you what they like and what they don't about any aspect of your channel and presentation.

, In addition to playing the games that your subscribers want you to play, you should also play any newly released title that fits your channel's content theme. You'll at least want to do this in the early stages of your channel since the number of people interested in a high-profile new game is usually going to be higher than the number of people interested in watching you play or review a classic.


The easiest way to process user feedback on which new releases you should play is to use a Google form.
You can usually preorder a copy of the new release in question and receive it the day of its release.
Live streaming your first few hours with the game is a good way to change up the pace of your videos.

, Outside of asking for suggestions or answering questions related exclusively to the content on your channel, you should find ways to engage your subscribers by replying to their comments and contributing information to their analyses.One easy way to do this is to download the YouTube app to your smartphone and respond to comments on-the-go.
Game analysis is often something in which YouTube users partake in the comments section. You can contribute to this analysis or provide one of your own.

Buy a car with good all-around stats.,
Choose which control setting that you feel comfortable with.,
Know every shortcut road on every track.,
Play in Multiplayer mode.,
Show off your racing skills to get more nitro.,
Upgrade your car's performance.,
Play aggressively.,
Keep practicing in the game to become a better racer than before.",How to Become a Good Racer in Asphalt 8," You will start the game with the Dodge Dart GT (a Class D car), but you must buy better and higher class cars to remain competitive and progress through Single Player mode.


Buy a car that has good acceleration and handling so you can get a head start in races by knocking down other cars and finish the race without wrecking many times. If you're a beginner, make sure that your car has at least 1.200 for handling. If you're a pro that can control your car, you don't have to worry about your car's handling.
For beginners, it's a good idea to buy the Audi R8 and E-tron and Tesla Model S also for Class D.;
, Start a race in Single Player mode, start knocking down other cars, and try to complete all levels with flying colors.

, Some shortcut roads are short while some are long. To find the shortest shortcut road on every track, just go across the road without using nitro.


Please keep in mind that you should always use the short way unless your nitro is very fast. For that, you have to explore places. Great Wall have nearly 6 routes. There is a good chances for you to find shortcuts.

, Racing with players from around the world is harder than you think.


When playing in Multiplayer mode, remember shortcut road, plan your strategy and your way to go across before the race starts.
The higher your level is, the more money you get.

, Try doing a Barrel Roll, Flat Spin, and other driving techniques to gain nitro and gain precious seconds.


Barrel Roll is easy, but the trick to a Flat Spin is to just drift when you arrive at a ramp and you will automatically do a Flat Spin.

, If you have enough credits to upgrade your car's performance, take the opportunity to do so. This will give you greater results during the races.


Be clever. Remember that Acceleration and Top Speed alone will not lead you to victory. Upgrading your Handling lets you have more control and avoid crashes during a race.
Acceleration can push your car faster! Upgrade your car's Acceleration if you need some extra speed.
Upgrade to maximum speed! Do this to upgrade your Speed and Acceleration.
Have Nitro. It is the most powerful thing and must-have if you want to win the race. Upgrade it so you can cut another racer easily, and knock down another racer easily in Single Player!

, Don't worry about other players, because aggressive play is needed in Asphalt 8 to burn down your friend's (or enemy's) position. It can also lead you to victory.


Knock down as many cars as you can! To knock down other racers, hit up your Nitro and ram or hit them. Try to knock down all of them.
In Multiplayer mode, it's hard to knock down other players. Gameloft just changes their game knockdown mode to balance so everybody can safely play the game. However, this is not bad news. To knock down other racers in Multiplayer mode, flank them from the side and push them to the wall as hard as you can. This will automatically knock them down.

Alternatively, you could simply hit up a maximum 100% Nitro with a Top Speed nitro (more than 35km/h nitro speed). Hit them from their back to knock them down!


You can also use the Death From Above tactical strike to knock down other racers. Ram them into a ramp, and hit them from the skies.

,


Practice drifting perfectly without crashing or being hit! This will automatically refuel your Nitro. When on the straight road, try to do some small drifts; however please note that drifting can slow your vehicle.

Hit the enemy with Melee.",How to Become a High Magician in Elsword," Just like the rest of the characters of the game, you are required to go through a qualification quest before you can choose one of the three advanced classes.


In order for the quest to be available for you, you must use Aisha and must be level 15 and above; otherwise, the quest won't appear in your Quest Log.;
, Do this quest first before anything else. Enter the Underground Waterway under Very Hard Mode to collect 10 Dead Tree Branches and 30 Runic Power Crystal from the Ghost Magician and White Ghost Magician.


The task is fairly easy, especially if you're in a party for a quick raid.

, This can be bought from the Potion NPC in Elder Village.

, This area can be found in the Elder Village map.


The rest of the qualification quest can also be cleared in the very same dungeon.
To complete these quests quickly, enter the dungeon under Very Hard Mode instead of clearing it at low-level difficulty.
You must kill 14 Jangos and 14 Kid Phorus.
You must clear the dungeon with a B rank.
You must collect 3 quest items from Bomber Mongs and 1 Special Nut from William.

, As stated above, you must complete the Magician Quest in order for you to open the next phase of the chain quest. After completing the Magician Quest, you get to choose either of the three classes for Aisha: High Magician, Dark Magician, or Battle Magician.


Each higher class has different kinds of specialties, sets of skills, and combos.

, You can alternatively accept it through your Log Quest, which can be found at the lower right-hand side of your screen.

, For the first part of the quest, you need to enter Suburbs of Wally's Castle to hunt for the boss William. Kill him and obtain a quest item (Necklace) under the Very Hard Mode difficulty.


Most of the time, you have to do reruns before this item drops from the boss.
Being in a party is highly recommended to clear up monsters quickly in each level.

, The rest of the quest requires you to enter Wally's Castle, the last dungeon found in Elder Village, to collect 2 quest items from Crossbow Soldier and then clear the dungeon without taking more than 50 hits. Otherwise, you have to rerun in order to complete it.


Before you enter the dungeon, make sure you have set the difficulty to Hard Mode.
A full house party is recommended for this.
Keep your distance away from the mob, and use any of your AoE skills to protect yourself, especially when you reach the boss level.

, After completing all the quests, head to Elder Village to see Echo the Alchemist. She's a white-haired young lady found at the northeastern part of the village, just a few steps away from the East Portal. Talk to her to complete the chain quest.


If your class didn't change after talking to Echo, log off from the game and then log in again. This can happen when the server is too busy, especially if there are a lot of players online.

, Every time a character of Elsword successfully changes his/her class, a new combo skill will become available for the players to use. One of the four new combos for High Magician creates an explosion, which can cause more than 200% Magic Damage to enemies within the range based on your character's Mag DMG rate.


To execute this combo, the player must press X on their keyboard twice, followed by the Down arrow key and then X two more times. Execution must be done quickly, without being hit by the enemy, which cancels the combo.

, Fireball is mostly used in PvP because of its no-MP use and the ability to stun enemies, which enables High Magicians to follow their attack with combos or cancel the enemy’s combo attack. Tap X on your keyboard twice and the Left arrow key (if your enemy is at the right side of the screen) or right (if the enemy is at the left side of your screen), then press X again.


This skill can be spammed, especially if you can execute the combo continuously.

, This is a simple Fireball Dash compared to the Fireball mentioned above. Instead of throwing two small fireballs before a larger one, Fireball Dash requires you to run then throw one large fireball.


This skill is great for escaping from melee players, especially from classes that use Grab.
To execute this combo, dash by tapping the Right arrow key twice, then X twice.

, The High Magician is not just a class for mid-range; they can also do close combat. Expert players use this quite a lot to stun and even juggle enemy players. Tap the Z key twice to attack in close combat and to stun your enemies, and then tap X twice to throw Fireball.

, This adds 3 points to Sora's strength.

, This gives Sora +25% damage reduction to all elements.

, Damage from all elements are reduced.

, These are essential in the battle in case you need to restore HP and MP.

, Zexion transforms you and your party members into books.


This attack is unavoidable, even if you try to break the books, so you'll just be missing out on precious combos that you can hit Zexion with.
Every time Zexion turns someone into a book, he'll leave you a small opportunity to land a combo on him, so stay close!

, While in the book world, books will fly at you.


This attack is blockable with Reflega

, Books will attack Sora in a certain sequence.


You can dodge this attack by gliding (while in the air, analog + □) around the area.
This attack is the best way to spot which book is Zexion.
Zexion will always be that one book that's not in sync with the others.

, Zexion manipulates your attack panel, turning it into a book.


Press ∆ to shuffle the pages and find ""Release,"" ""Sneak Away,"" or ""Regain.""
Also, you can use words such as ""Treasure"" or ""Heal"" to get some HP balls.

, You'll see 3 spotlights, 2 red and 1 blue. If you manage to step on the blue one, you'll be spared from the meteor shower, and you'll be able to find Zexion quickly.

, Donald and Goofy will get turned to books, leave them as it's unavoidable. Your goal here is to land a combo on Zexion after he turns either Goofy or Donald into a book.


You'll have about a second to land a hit on him during that time, so be quick.

, This will help you avoid the damage from his first attack and lock on to him. Zexion will be that first book that attacks you.

, Press ∆ when it appears.


Zexion may try to attack you; all of his attacks can be blocked with Reflega without a problem.

, This will be your only way of dealing damage on him, so don't let it slip. After a combo Zexion will once again pull you into the book world.

, Depending on how much damage you dealt Zexion, he may use his desperation move. A good way of guessing where the blue light will go is by counting to 13 and jumping on the spot that you predict will turn blue.

, Sometimes Zexion will use shuffle and turn your command panel into a book; just look for ""Sneak Away,"" ""Release,"" or ""Regain"" to dispel it.

, Once you get to where there are blocks, just jump onto them.

, Just keep jumping.

, This part looks a little confusing at first, but you can jump-drop-jump-drop or just jump four times. Then, you have to drop under the next platform, and jump out of the hole so that you don't smack the wall.

, However, for the last block you have to drop to avoid a spike.

, To do this, you tap/press/click to go upward, and release to go downward. Going up or down gives you upward/downward momentum.  

, If you can mostly stay in the middle, you are pretty much good to go.

,, You have to fly up a bit to avoid this one.

,, Then there will be a staircase. If you jump three times, then drop twice, or jump twice, drop, and jump, then you will get a secret coin. Secret coins unlock icons, colors, and even two levels.

, Jump all the way up; then there will be a downward staircase type section with gaps that you have to jump over.

, Once the background turns red, things get a little trickier. You have to jump twice to get on to a platform, drop, jump twice, drop and immediately jump.

, The three spike jump will require a great deal of precision; try to jump as late as possible without dying on the spike.

, There will be a couple of one spike jumps, a staircase, a downward staircase, another jump, a place where you can't jump, another pretty easy jump, and another platform staircase.

, If you jump onto the top blocks, you will get a secret coin. Be careful, on the last of those blocks (below the secret coin), there is a spike you have to jump over. Otherwise, you can just drop.

, It may look confusing, but three jumps should do the trick.

, Then, you'll jump three times, drop twice, and jump twice, wait a tiny bit, then jump until you get to the purple/pink portal.

, There, you go between two obstacles, go above one, go below one,  and go between three more. If you want to get the secret coin, you fly straight up right before the second obstacle, and there will be a hidden path in the top part of the obstacle. Then, you have to go through a complicated and difficult sequence to get the final secret coin.

Purchasing a console or upgrading your computer is a big expense, and it's best to get some experience under your belt so you know how to make the right decision. If you can, play some games on a friend's platform before you make the decision yourself.


A computer (PC) can play a wide variety of games, but playing the latest and fanciest requires expensive hardware upgrades. Desktops are much better for gaming than laptops.
A console (typically an Xbox, PlayStation, or Wii) is a cheaper option if you don't already have a computer, and requires no technical know-how at all to use. You'll have a much more limited selection of games, and every few years you'll need to buy the next generation console if you want to play new games.
If you have neither of the above, you can play on a smart phone, tablet, or portable gaming device, or you can play real-world games described at the end of this section.;
, There are many recommended games below, organized by the type of person they appeal to. You probably already have a good idea what sort of experience you like, even if you're not much of a gamer yet, so skim through and start with the recommendation that sounds most appealing to you. A quick online search will often lead you to the developer's website where you can download or order the game, and where you can find out which devices the game can be played on. If you're not sure whether to buy it, search for a demo or a YouTube play through to find out more.


For computer games, download the free software Steam. This is a hugely popular place to buy games, and the constant discount deals and community discussions are a great way to find new recommendations as well.
Most of the recommendations below were released in the last few years, and may still be available at brick-and-mortar game shops.

, These are great for passing the time or taking your mind off stress, and are typically easy to learn. This category is loosely defined, and sometimes insulted by people who consider themselves ""real gamers."" However, that attitude is becoming less common. Try looking in the following places if you've never played a game all the way through before, or if you're not sure what appeals to you:


For a huge variety of options, try a mobile app store, or a large game collection website like Kongregate and Armor Games.
Most Nintendo games are designed to focus on fun and enjoying yourself with friends, including Mario Kart, Wii Sports, or Mario Party.

, If you enjoy fast finger movements and fast-paced challenges, there are many game genres you might enjoy:


Platformers involve navigating an obstacle course of blocks and enemies. Play the classic Super Mario, challenge yourself with Super Meat Boy, or add story and fighting with the Ratchet & Clank series.
For pure, fast-paced finger-tapping, try a rhythm game like Dance Dance Revolution or its keyboard version Step Mania, or a shoot 'em up (""shmup"") like Ikaruga or Radiant Silvergun.
Sports games are typically re-released each year so you can play as famous athletes. Pick your favorite sport and you can probably find a video game version, such as Madden or FIFA.
Fighting games like Super Smash Bros. or Guilty Gear are competitive games that reward reflexes and muscle memory.

, Just like a real sandbox, these games give you tools you can use to create your own fun, or even your own world. If you're good at setting your own goals and getting pulled into your own project, these could be for you.


Minecraft is by far the most popular of these games. If you're looking for something with less blocky graphics, try Spore.
Sandbox games don't have to be ""casual."" Dwarf Fortress has sent thousands of ""hardcore gamers"" running due to its incredibly complex world, displayed entirely in text.

, Dim the lights and get ready for your adrenaline rush. These games are for people who want maximum excitement:


If you love action or adventure stories, play the hero in games like Prince of Persia or Assassin's Creed, or the famous (and family-friendly) Legend of Zelda game.
If you enjoy horror films, find out what it's like to be in one with Silent Hill or Resident Evil.
When you just need to let it all out, pick up Saint's Row or Grand Theft Auto and embark on a ridiculous crime spree.

, Games can immerse you in a story in a way that no other art form can. Role-playing games (RPGs) are a popular example, although the genre is extremely broad. Here are a few famous examples, any one of which can provide dozens of hours of gameplay:


A few of the most famous RPG series that focus on story and player choice include Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Final Fantasy.
Unusual, strange settings are shown off in the Bioshock and Dark Souls series, while the Elder Scrolls series gives you an enormous, classic fantasy world to explore.
On the extreme end of the scale, games that have incredibly in-depth stories include Planescape: Torment, and every game from Spiderweb Software.

, Many games have the option to play competitively, but some of them are dedicated to testing skill as much as possible. The following genres have so much complexity that many gamers choose one and play it almost exclusively, training to become better over dozens or hundreds of hours:


First-person shooters (FPS's) are mostly known for their online multiplayer modes, in which players compete as enemy soldiers fighting in a complex environment. Call of Duty and Battlefield are good introductions to the genre.
Multi-player online battle arenas (MOBAs) are team-versus-team games, usually with a fantasy theme. Compares to FPS's, overall strategy is more important and short-term reflexes and tactics somewhat less so. Try Defense of the Ancients (DoTA) and League of Legends (LoL).
Real time strategy games (RTS's) involve clashing civilizations, building cities and armies and waging all-out war with your opponents. Starcraft is focused on extremely rapid decision-making, while the Total War series is on the other side of the spectrum, emphasizing long-term strategy and careful tactical planning.
Massively multiplayer role-playing games (MMORPGs or MMOs) have you play with hundreds of other players. You've likely heard of World of Warcraft, but also consider Star Wars: The Old Republic or Guild Wars 2.

, Not every gamer plays video games. While most mass-market board games don't develop a following in gamer circles, there are exceptions. Some of these even have major tournaments with cash prizes:


Famous, deeply strategic board games such as Settlers of Catan or Dominion are easy enough to play with non-gamer friends, but can require hundreds of hours to master.
Tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder let you tell a story with your friends.
Collectible card games (CCGs or TCGs) such as Magic: the Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! let you combine hundreds of pieces to let you play the style of game you most enjoy. These tend to be more expensive compared to other gaming hobbies, but your local game store may run cheap events for new players.

, Most self-identified gamers have strong opinions about their favorite games, and are willing to talk and argue about them for hours. This passion sometimes causes ""gate-keeping"" from a fan who suspects you don't match his idea of a ""real"" gamer. This can be tiresome, but it will happen less and less as you develop friends in the gaming world, and they see you playing games and talking about them.

, You won't always receive it yourself, but the mature players will respect you for keeping the atmosphere friendly. At the end of a game against a stranger, tell your opponent ""good game"" or ""gg,"" and offer a handshake if playing in person. When playing a team game, don't criticize a player who's not doing well, unless he's actively sabotaging your effort.


Against your friends, light-hearted boasting and insults is usually expected, not handshakes and formality. If anyone gets angry, take a break so he can cool down.

, As gaming has become mainstream, many communities have grown more diverse and welcoming, but there's also been backlash from sexists and people who consider themselves ""true gamers."" Light jabs and mockery are best ignored, but any actual harassment or bullying should be reported to a moderator (mod) or administrator. Often, you'll find people willing to stand up for a new player if you speak up. If no one does, don't hesitate to find another forum, guild, or even an entirely new game with a better culture.


Most games have a block or ignore function that prevents a player from contacting you.

, Each genre and even each game develops its own slang, which can be bewildering for a newcomer. There are a few terms that are used all across gaming, to one degree or another, so use this list as a head start.


A newbie is a player who's just started playing the game. ""Noob"" is a somewhat rude synonym.
Afk means ""away from keyboard"" — the player is taking a break.
gg means ""good game,"" something polite to say after the game ends.
1337, l33t, or leet all mean ""elite,"" or highly skilled. This is old school slang, now often used as a sarcastic or self-deprecating joke.
When someone is pwned, they're losing horribly to an opponent.

, Even a fun night of gaming with friends will hone your abilities, but putting in concentrated effort to improve your weak points will lead to faster improvement. The best way to learn, if your pride can stand it, is to play against people who are better than you. Watch what they do, and ask about the reasoning behind their decisions whenever you don't understand.

, Playing your favorite games is one of the best ways to improve your skills, but past a certain point it may be helpful to focus on one talent in particular. Regardless of the type of game you're training for, a rhythm game like Step Mania can train your fingers to move fast.

, An honest understanding of what happened is required if you're going to be competitive. If you always blame luck, a slow internet connection, or other factors beyond you control, you’ll never focus on the things you can improve. If you're too worked up after a game, make a mental note to ""replay"" it in your head, and think about whether there were any decisions you should have made differently.

, If you love to play the newest multiplayer game on the best graphics setting, you could be facing $1000 or $2000 in computer upgrades, but that's the extreme case. There are many cheaper accessories that can make gaming life easier, and that's all you should consider if you tend to play older games, games with simple graphics, or games that don't require reflexes.


A gaming mouse and ergonomic keyboard that comfortably fits your hand is invaluable for many games. If you're playing on a laptop, any external mouse and keyboard at all is better than your track pad and built-in keyboard.
A headset will let you communicate with allies in multiplayer games, without having to spend time typing.

, A very small percentage of gamers ever earn money from the hobby, and even fewer earn enough to call it an income. If you're serious about this goal, you'll need to pick a game played by millions of people, preferably with a competitive scene where players can win thousands of dollars in tournaments. Some of these, such as League of Legends, are called ""e-sports"" because of the serious, international competition.


Even if you want to make money reviewing games or entertaining fans by recording yourself playing games, you'll still need to focus on new and popular games, especially when you're first starting out, or no one will be interested.

, Choose something memorable and easy to spell. Use this name for all games and game-related work you do. This can even be your real name, as long as you use it consistently enough to gain some recognition. A good example of this is in the anime, Sword Art Online, where the main character, Kirigaya Kazuto, used his name and combined Kiri' from Kirigaya and to from his last name to make Kirito.

, Find a way to record video or set up a web camera, and show people your gaming or your game reviews on YouTube or Twitch. If you can build up a fan base, you can earn a steadier income through donations or sponsorships than you would earn through tournament prizes.


Post a link on the game's forums or social media accounts to advertise your channel.
A few games, such as Magic: the Gathering, also make it possible to earn money through writing strategy articles and publishing them on a website. This is mostly true for collectible card games, since secondary retailers want to attract people to their website to purchase product.

, If you want to become one of the few people who makes a living off tournament winnings, be prepared to dedicate six hours or more each day to gaming. It's work that everyone

Since you can't touch the landscape, you'll have to build around the trees, which can be nerve racking. In addition, you're not allowed to raise or lower the land/water level, which will make constructing underground rides in this scenario much more difficult.
, The first step to completing this scenario is to begin building small, compact rides that don't take up a lot of space. Your best bet is to set up thrill rides and shops on both sides of the valley. If you're adding any scenery, be careful, as the restrictions also count towards any scenery placed in the park. Even if you can fit a ride somewhere, you'll have to make sure that you can build a pathway there., Consider putting Steel Roller Coasters in this scenario, and be super careful about where you put them.

Take a few tries of a chapter to learn the enemy patterns and how strong they are.",How to Beat Lunatic Mode in Fire Emblem Awakening1," Since access to the preparation screen isn't available until a few chapters into the game, it's vital to check every enemy on the first turn to see their stats, weapons and skills (if any). You don't want to lose a unit because you didn't know that they had Counter in their skillset. This becomes especially vital on Lunatic+.
, This also applies on lower difficulties but is necessary on Lunatic mode when enemies are extremely strong early in the game. You are also able to put your cursor over an enemy and press A to mark that specific unit's range in red, which overlaps the pink danger zone that you get with X. This can be useful if you're using a flier like Sumia, and want to keep her out of an archer's range but move her in to attack a soldier. It's vital to keep healers and dancers out of enemy range since they are often extremely frail with weak attacks (or can't attack at all, in the healer's case).



 

, Frederick is your Jeigan-type character, meaning he is a pre promoted unit that you get in the beginning of the game. He is the only unit you have in the beginning who can take more than a few hits from any given enemy, so be prepared to use him a lot in order to get through the first chapters without any units dying. However, do not simply throw him into a group of enemies and expect him to live; he, too, can easily be killed on Lunatic mode if you aren't careful.

, While killing every unit in the first chapters with Frederick may seem like a good idea, it's not going to be of much help later in the game when Frederick starts falling off and your other units are extremely under leveled. While Frederick is going to be handling the majority of enemies, take every opportunity that you can to weaken enemies just enough for Chrom or Robin to safely get the kill., Awakening is known for its Pair-Up system being extremely overpowered, and supports will further boost the stats gained from having a Pair-Up. For example, try pairing up Chrom and Robin whenever able to get them to a C support, making the boosts they get in combat increase greatly. This can be vital to survive as you progress in the game, as the enemies get much stronger fast.





, Don't be afraid to use L+R+Start to soft-reset the game in a chapter in order to look at enemy patterns, and how your units stack up. Try, try and try again with different strategies and unit formations to see what works best. For example, Chapter 3 is generally considered to be the toughest chapter in Awakening Lunatic mode for a variety of reasons, and it might take a while to determine the best way to complete the chapter without a unit dying. Ask yourself questions as you go along. Which units can handle certain kinds of enemies the best? Should I split up my army or group them? Are there enemies that I need to take care of immediately? This can help you figure out a plan."

Catch XD001.,
Defeat Greevil.,
Get maximum tempo in every single room in the purify chamber.This is the difficult part.,
Put XD001 in one of the rooms.,
After doing so, purify XD001.",How to Purify XD001,"  Buy loads of timer and ultra balls!

Like any other Lugia, it has a minuscule catch rate of 3/255. In perspective, the chance of catching this at full health with a Poke Ball is less than 5%.
Lugia has Shadow Blast, Shadow Down, Shadow Storm, and Shadow End. End, Blast, and Down are all very powerful Shadow moves that threaten your Pokémon. Shadow Storm harms all Pokémon that are not Shadows, so be careful.;
,  He has a team of all very powerful Shadow Pokémon, including the the legendary Kanto Birds.  Be prepared for a rough battle.,  There are many ways of doing this.

ChuggaaConroy has a video on doing this.  (Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness - Bonus 5)
Since the Trade Center is open post-game, you can trade in all Ghost-types or Dragon-types, since Ghosts and Dragons are weak to themselves.

, The game text will show that it is ready to be purified.,  It will know two exclusive moves: Psycho Boost and Feather Dance.  It will also learn Earthquake and Hydro Pump."

Take a look at stats and classes.,
Know the calculations for damage.,
Take bonus damage into account.,
Know how much speed you have and how much speed an opponent has: this affects whether or not you can double them.",How to Beat Lunatic Mode in Fire Emblem Awakening2," As stated previously, checking the stats on an enemy can be crucial to determining what unit to use to defeat them. However, the class of an enemy should also be taken into consideration. For example, enemy Mages and Dark Mages are dangerous because your units have a nearly non-existent Resistance stat unless they are a Mage or Pegasus Knight. Therefore, using one of these classes is the best way to deal with them (Dark Mages have good Defense while normal Mages do not, so defeat them accordingly based on these differences). A Knight has extremely high Defense but low Resistance, so magic-based weapons or tomes are the way to go., If you want to know how much damage a Fighter does to your Chrom but he's out of range, you can do a simple calculation to determine how much damage he does, excluding skills and damage modifiers. If a Fighter has 9 Strength and he's wielding a weapon with 5 Might (Mt), then simply adding the two together comes out to 14. This is the amount of damage he would do to a unit with no Defense. However, your Chrom probably doesn't have 0 Defense, so subtract his current Defense from that 14. If Chrom has a 7 in Defense, then 14-7=7 total damage. This can be useful if you want to know how much damage a potentially dangerous enemy could do to any given unit, and know what to expect., If you calculate an Archer doing 6 damage to Sumia, it's highly unlikely that is the actual number. Bonus damage is x3 the actual number of damage a certain weapon will do to a unit. A weapon that can do bonus damage will have a little icon next to the name of it. Chrom's PRF (personal weapon) is Falchion, and it does bonus damage to wyverns based on the green dragon icon on it. Bows do bonus damage to flying units, Rapiers and Armorslayers do bonus damage to Knights, and so on. Make sure to watch out for these weapons. The damage output in the battle forecast will be highlighted in green if your unit is being attacked with a weapon that does bonus damage.





, If you have at least 5-speed points over an opponent, you can double them and do the same amount of damage twice, or vice versa if the opponent has 5-speed points over you. This is incredibly important to know and is crucial in the early part of Lunatic, as doubling an enemy means you will be able to deal with them faster and gain more EXP."
"
Know the Weapon Triangle.,
Keep an eye on durability.,
Forge when necessary.",How to Beat Lunatic Mode in Fire Emblem Awakening3," The Weapon Triangle is the Fire Emblem version of Rock, Paper Scissors with the three main types of weapons. Swords beat axes, axes beat lances and lances beat swords. Having the WTA (Weapon Triangle Advantage) can influence your damage output and accuracy, so make sure to incorporate it into your strategy. Magic and bows are neutral in the Weapon Triangle.





, A weapon or stave can only be used so many times, indicated by the two numbers next to the name of a given item. The first number is how many usages a weapon, stave or healing item has left, and the second number is the limit of how many uses the item started with. For example, Bronze weapons start out with 50 uses. If you use a Bronze Sword ten times, the durability will read 40/50. Once the durability reaches zero, the item will break or disappear. Always make sure you have weapons with enough durability to last you the chapter.





, You can forge at any shop in the game after the first chapters, and it can really save you in a pinch if you need a powerful weapon for certain enemies. You can increase a weapon's Might, Hit and Crit to influence how powerful it is, it's accuracy and critical hit rate. Forges can get expensive later in the game with Steel and Silver weapons, but forging for Bronze and Iron weapons is cheaper and more worthwhile earlier in the game.

Use DLC if necessary.,
EXPontential Growth features a bunch of Entombed who will run for the exit on the other side of the map, and won't ever attack you.,
The last DLC map in the bundle is Infinite Regalia.,
You can also check out the Bonus Box in the Wireless feature on the menu when you're in the World Map once it's been unlocked.",How to Beat Lunatic Mode in Fire Emblem Awakening4," There are three DLC maps that can be purchased in a bundle at the Outrealm Gate: The Golden Gaffe, EXPonential Growth and Infinite Regalia. The Golden Gaffe features several enemies holding 1,000, 3,000, 5,000 or 7,000 Gold depending on their power levels. Defeating them will give you that Gold, so with enough units, you can earn a large amount of gold to buy new weapons, staves, seals and so on. Keep in mind that the Outrealm Gate menu cannot be accessed until after Chapter 3, so you're on your own in Lunatic mode until then.

, They give out a lot of EXP when killed, making them a good grinding source. However, there're only four turns maximum each time you play this map, and you'll have to waste a turn running up to the Entombed, so grinding off this map may take a while. Additionally, watch out for the Entombed with 65 HP, as they have Counter in their skillset., It features several units wielding weapons that were in previous games in the Fire Emblem series, and you can earn these weapons by getting them through chests in the back of the map. These weapons include Armads, Gáe Bolg, Luna and so on. Be careful, though: the enemies on this map will actively attack you if you are in their range unlike the Golden Gaffe and EXPonential Growth., Through this, you can obtain items from other games (such as the ones listed above), recruit units from past games, add Paralogues to the map to recruit units and more. If you're really stuck on a chapter and need a new item or unit, then this menu can be very useful. You can get the items for free, and recruit units from past games by either buying them with Gold or fighting them and defeating them.

, This is near the ""System Software Update"" option., You'll find this close to the top of the Network menu., Your options include the following:

""Use Wi-Fi"" - select this if your console is connected to the internet via wireless. If you're on a wifi network, you'll have to select the network you want to set up at this point.

, From here, you'll need to change your PS4's max transmission unit (MTU) settings., This step comes directly after selecting ""Next"" post-DNS setup; the Manual option begins the MTU setup process., You can enter a new MTU value here., ""1473"" is the official value proposed by PlayStation.

You can also input ""1450"" if ""1473"" fails.

, This will take you to the diagnostic test., If the test is successful, you've successfully changed your MTU settings!, This will take you back to the home screen., After altering the DNS and MTU settings, you should see an increase in your PS4's download speed!, The problem may be with your internet service, not the console itself; for example, if you aren't approved for download speeds above 10 megabytes per second, your downloads will routinely take a long time to complete.

Upgrading your plan or switching to a better Internet Service Provider may fix this problem.

, Cheap modems tend to distribute limited amounts of bandwidth; just because you're paying for a certain amount of megabytes per second for your download speed doesn't mean you're getting it. If your modem supports less bandwidth than your internet service allows, consider upgrading to a better modem., If you're trying to download something on the same network as another device--be it computer, phone, or console--your download speed will slow down as a result.

To solve this problem, try downloading when there's no one else in the house and no extra devices on your network.

, While the PS4 has a competent wireless internet suite, plugging your console directly into your modem will always increase your internet connection speed. You'll need an Ethernet cable to do so.

One end of your Ethernet cable should plug into the square port in the back of your PS4 while the other plugs into a similar port marked ""Internet"" on your modem. Ethernet cable ends are interchangeable.

, You'll be prompted to install this firmware automatically when you connect your PS4 to the internet.

As a general rule, you should always update your console as soon as possible to prevent issues such as slow download speeds.

, This is the download equivalent of turning off your computer and then rebooting it. If your download is taking a long time to initiate or proceed, pausing and then resuming it may increase the download speed."

Once you’ve removed the screws, apply some pressure and pull the back panel off to separate it from the front panel of the controller, revealing its circuit board and battery.

, Underneath the battery tray is a screw that holds the circuit board to the front panel of the controller. Use your precision screwdriver and remove the screw. Once the screw has been removed, disconnect the flat cable that sits on the top right corner of the board that connects it to the front panel. Once the screw and the cable have been disconnected, you can now separate the circuit board from the front panel.

, Turn over the circuit board to reveal the analog sticks. Pull out the analog sticks to remove them from the board. They’re not glued to the board itself, so the sticks should pop off easily.

, Take the replacement analog sticks and push them in place on the circuit board. The replacement sticks should fit in on the board with only a little amount of force.

, Turn the circuit board facedown and place it back to the front panel the same way as you removed it. Put the screw back in on the middle of the board and plug the flat cable back in at the top right corner of the board that connects the circuit board to the front panel.

, Press the battery tray back onto the circuit board, and it should snap back it with little effort. Afterwards, place the reset button back to the hole on the top right corner of the battery tray.

, Place the battery back on the tray and plug in the white connector on the left-hand side of the board that connects the battery to the circuit board.

, Take the flat cable running from the back panel and plug it back in on the white port found on the right-hand side of the circuit board.

, Press the back panel to the front panel of the controller and the two should snap back together easily. Re-insert the four screws you removed from the corners of the controller and the controller should be back in one piece.

Find out what the problem is.",How to Troubleshoot a PS21," Without knowing what the problem is, how will you know what to troubleshoot? If you're not quite sure what the problem is, find out now. This will save you a lot of time in the long run. If you're not sure how to find out what the problem is, try all of the tips below.

Make sure the wires are properly connected.,
Make sure the wires aren't broken.,
Make sure the main power button is on.,
Try turning on the console now.",How to Troubleshoot a PS22," Make sure that all the correct wires are hooked up to the correct slots. Also, make sure that the wires are pushed in all the way. Sometimes, if a wire isn't in properly, the console will not work. Check all of the wires by pushing them in to the slot. If one turns out to be loose, that might just solve the problem.;
, If the wires look bent or used, they might be broken inside. While you won't be able to check the inside of the wires, you can still look for evidence on the outside of the cover. Evidence of a broken wire includes broken, chewed up or cracked casing. The actual metal plug part might also show these signs.

, The main power button can be found at the back of your console. Without the main power, the console will not work. Make sure that the button is flicked to the on position. If it was off, that might have been the problem. Still try everything else though, just in case it wasn't.

, Chances are, the wires were loose or the main power switch was turned off. If the console still isn't turning on, try disconnecting it all and starting all over again. If re-connecting the whole console still doesn't do the trick, the PS2 is probably useless now. Either get rid of it or buy a new one. You can also sell it for spare parts.

Make sure the wires are properly connected.,
Make sure the wires aren't broken.,
Make sure the slots aren't clogged.",How to Troubleshoot a PS23," Like the actual console, the wires need to properly connected. Make sure that your controller is plugged into slot number 1. Also, push it in all the way. It might not be working because the wires are not pushed in fully. Make sure they are before continuing to the next steps.

, If the wires look bent or used, they might be broken inside. While you won't be able to check the inside of the wires, you can still look for evidence on the outside of the cover. Evidence of a broken wire includes broken, chewed up or cracked casing. The part where the wire goes into the control is most vulnerable to breaking.

, It's very easy for dust and grime to clog up your console's controller slots. This might stop the wires from sending the correct signals to the PlayStation. To fix this, gently clean out the controller slots with a cloth wrapped around your index finger. Also clean the wires connected to the controller. These too might be clogged up with dirt and dust.

Clean the disk.,
Try another game.,
Use a cleaner disk.",How to Troubleshoot a PS24," The disk might have specs of dust on it that is stopping the console from reading it correctly. It might also have fingerprints and general dirt on it. By cleaning the disk, you might be saving it from being thrown away into the dustbin. Try to keep the disk in its case at all time to avoid this happening. Oh, and don't touch the bottom of it!

, This can help determine what exactly is the problem. If the other game is working but the one that you want to play is not, you know that the disk is the problem. If both the games are not functioning as they should be, the console might be permanently damaged. This is more unlikely than the disk being the issue but it means that the console is now useless.

, These types of disks are very easy to find. They are designed to clean the small eye that reads your game disks. Simply put them into your Ps2 and let it run. They shouldn't run for more than half an hour but if that's how long the disk is, let it finish running. After you've used this cleaner disk, try playing your game. If it's still not working, something might be wrong with the actual console, not just the eye.

Restart the system.,
Gently move it with your finger.,
Open the console.,
Finished.

",How to Troubleshoot a PS25," It might just be that the game tray got stuck that one time. Before you go prying it open, turn the console off. Wait for about ten seconds for the console to cool down. When you're happy that it's completely turned off, start it up again. Wait for it to fully load before clicking the open button. When it has loaded, open the tray again. If it opens, great! If it's still stuck, move on to the steps below.

, If the game tray is stuck on one side and cannot open, gently pull it to the opposite side with your finger. You may have to use two fingers or your thumb if the tray is stiff. Hopefully, this will get it open so that you can get your game out. If you can't move it with your finger, try to pry it open using some sort of tool. This will, however, void the warranty. When you do get the game tray open, remove your game but don't use it again. You might not get it open next time.

, If you can hear something blocking it from the inside, open up the PS2 and remove your game that way. If there's no game in there but you're good with the console, feel free to try to repair it yourself. This may include removing and replacing certain parts, like the game tray itself. Keep in mind that even opening the console will void the warranty.

To get there, warp to the Lock and exit through the only door in the area.;
, You'll need ethers because you'll be spamming Thundaga a lot.

, Ultima's unique ability MP Hastega will be very useful for this challenge since you'll need to regenerate your MP faster.

, It's Thunder Boost ability will help you deal more damage quicker and will help you take out mushrooms faster.

, Thundaga will be your main killing skill since it's long-ranged and has a wide area of effect.

,, It will spawn more mushrooms.

, This will wipe them out quickly, but depending on how far you're standing from them, you might not be able to attack them, so make sure you're in the middle of the area.

, Make sure you use it when it's low, not when it's already empty. This will help you lessen the time needed to charge your MP since ethers can't heal Sora's MP entirely.


Use ethers after killing the mushrooms, not after they've spawned. This will help lessen unnecessary waiting time.

, Using the Thundaga method will give you at least 39 seconds on the counter.

, Make sure that the game is sitting properly inside the tray before you close it. To check that the game is in there properly, gently move it around with your hand. If it falls off of the tray, it wasn't in there properly. If it stays on the tray, you can close it. If you close it while the game isn't on the tray properly, the game can get jammed inside the machine and break.

, The game tray can be closed by pressing the same small blue button on the front of the console that you used to open it. If you just push the tray shut with your hand, you can damage it and it might stop working. Also, don't push the tray to make it shut faster, that can break it too.

Practice hard to use it wisely as it is the key to conquering the game. Keep your left finger on the L1 button at all times and practice being in a block at all times.;
, You may have noticed that not all of your enemies' moves can be blocked. The second best thing to do is to learn how to dodge effectively and accurately. Not only is this a great defensive move,it is also a faster way to move so as to avoid traps.

, Not all types of magic drain at the same pace. Powerful magic tools drain faster, so you have to select your magic based on the situation you are in.

Medusa gaze - short range, single enemy

, Combos give you experience but make you vulnerable to attacks by ignored enemies. Often you may end up killing one enemy but the other may attack you.

, Control camera angle with your body. If an enemy has long range attacks, try to keep him out of sight. In this way you will be able to ignore him for some time.

Get the Swap Magic 3.6 software suite.Swap Magic 3.6 is software that allows you to play copied PlayStation 2 (PS2) games on a regular PS2 or a Slimline without having to install a modchip.,
Get a Slide Card.,
Arrange your workspace.,
Turn on the PS2 and press the Eject button.,
Power off and unplug the PS2.,
Bring the unit to a flat, well-lit surface and flip it upside-down.,
Unscrew the screw on the DVD tray.This screw attaches the cover (which you’ll be removing) to the DVD tray.,
Separate the cover from the clips which hold it in.,
Replace the screw in the tray.,
Flip the unit back over and turn it on.,

Insert the copied game into the drive.,
Slide the Slide Card back beneath the tray facing the same direction as before.,
Press the X on the game controller.",How to Play Copied PS2 Games," Swap Magic is commonly found at independent gaming or computer repair shops. You can also purchase it online, but make sure you buy it from a reputable place, such as Amazon.



 


You’ll need to buy CD/DVD copies of the software, as burning your own copy will not work. Any site that demands payment for a download of Swap Magic is likely a scam. Only buy software from sites you trust.
Swap Magic 3.8 also allows you to play games that are not rated for your country. Make sure you know the laws before playing games that aren’t designed for use in your area.;
, Swap Magic removes the need for modchips by working in tandem with a Slide Card. The Slide Card, a small plastic device, is designed to open your PS2 while a disc is spinning so you can swap out games. Swap Magic 3.6 and up almost always comes with a Slide Card (and Slide Cards are universally compatible), however, if you find a copy that doesn’t include one, you can almost always order one from the same place you found Swap Magic.





, You’ll need a small Phillips-head screwdriver, a small flathead screwdriver, and a well-lit flat surface on which to work. You’ll only need to remove the front cover of the PS2’s DVD drive, which doesn’t involve taking the whole machine apart.

, The DVD tray will slide out, which is the position you’ll want it to be in when you remove its cover.

, Use the power switch on the back of the unit, as the front switch will close the drive. Unplug the unit from its power source.

, The screw you’ll need to remove is located on the bottom of the DVD tray.

, Using a small Philips-head screwdriver, remove the screw at the lower right corner of the tray. Keep the screw nearby, as you’ll be screwing it back in shortly.

, The cover is the front of the DVD drive, and it’s held in by two small clips on the left and right edges of the drive. Using a small flathead screwdriver or a pin, gently separate the cover from each clip while pulling the cover toward you. Don’t use too much force or else you’ll break the plastic. But if you do break the plastic, you can repair it with super glue.

, Use the Phillips head driver to gently reinstall the screw.

, You’ll need to plug it back into the power source and reconnect it to your television.

, Swap Magic 3.6 comes with 2 different discs: a CD and a DVD. If the game you want to play is burned onto a CD, insert the Swap Magic CD. If your game is burned on a DVD, insert the Swap Magic DVD.





, Once the PS2 loads the Swap Magic disc, the words “Insert disc” will appear on the television screen.

, With the arm facing right, insert the Slide Card under the tray on the left side of the drive tray. There should be a 2 centimeter gap between the Slide Card and the left edge of the tray. Once the Slide Card is inserted, grip the DVD tray firmly and slide the Slide Card to the right. The tray will eject. Remove the Swap Magic disc from the tray.

, When the game is inserted, gently push the tray back into the PS2.

, The next few motions are slightly different than the removal of the Swap Magic disc:


Slide the Slide Card to the right once more, but this time, when the tray ejects slightly, release some of the pressure on the Slide Card, then continue sliding it to the right. This slight break in the sliding motion will allow the Slide Card to move around the locking mechanism to ‘catch” properly.
Slide the Slide Card back to the left, as far left as it will go. This will close the tray. You can remove the Slider Tool once the tray has closed.

, This will start the game. You should be able play any copied game.

For your friend, set his shot aiming to ""Manual"", and the Aiming Icon ""On"", just so you can see where the shooter is aiming.
Set the difficulty to ""Beginner"" so the computer won't try to take the puck or body check so often, then take the rules off. You need a flowing game.
Set your controls options and cameras up. When the game itself starts up, pause it, and go to ""Rules & Options"". Check the team you are playing for, but press the square button once to lock the cursor on the goaltender.
For the camera, make it ""Action"" so you run up and down the ice, and if your team is at home, set the home team perspective as ""Always Down"" so that you can see the goaltender and the shot coming towards the goaltender.
Set the control type. Well, it doesn't matter if you are a hybrid or a classic controls, but what matters is the control orientation. Set it as ""Always Up"" rather than ""Screen Relative"" so that you won't have to flick the stick right to go to the goaltender's left if you are going down while the forwards are moving up. In simpler words: To eliminate mirror direction effects.
Now that it is set up, tell you friend to go move the player towards the left corner (goaltender's right). When you see yourself, press L1 & R1 to move across the crease. This is the most basic way to save a shot, too. If you are at the right place, you can deflect a shot off the pads, your glove, or even your helmet.;
, With you covering the near post, flick the right analog stick Up to attempt a save. Your goaltender should make a pad save or toe save. If done correctly, the commentator should say something like ""Turco makes the save"" or ""Osgood stoned him cold"".


Again, same place, aim it high. Most goaltenders will make a stick save. Jose Theodore or Tomas Vokoun will make a glove save because they catch with their right.
Flick the right stick down to see a poke check made.

There are several ways that you can connect your PlayStation 2 to your TV or receiver, depending on the inputs available. Different inputs will provide different levels of image quality. Inputs are typically found on the back of the TV, though they may be found on the side or the front as well.

Composite/Stereo AV - This is the most common way to connect a PlayStation 2 to a TV, receiver, or VCR. Composite cables have three plugs: Yellow (Video) and Red and White (Audio). This cable comes packaged with all new PlayStation 2 models. Newer HDTVs may not support this connection.

Component/YCbCr - This is the best way to connect a PlayStation 2 to modern TVs, as most HDTVs have these inputs. Component cables also provide the best possible picture quality for the PlayStation 2. Component cables have five plugs: Red, Blue and Green (Video) and Red and White (Audio). Component cables do not come packaged with the PlayStation 2. If purchasing a component cable, make sure that it is PlayStation 2 compatible with the PlayStation 2 plug on one end.

S-Video - This input is not very common on newer TVs. It will provide a better picture than composite cables, but not as good as component cables. The S-Video plug is typically yellow and has pins instead of a standard AV plug. The PlayStation 2 S-Video cable has the S-Video plug as well as the Red and White audio plugs.

RF - This is the worst way to connect a PlayStation 2 to a TV or VCR, as it has the blurriest picture quality. RF connects through the TV or VCR's coaxial input (the same input you would use for an old cable box or antenna). Avoid this method of connection unless you have no other options.;
,


If you bought your PlayStation 2 new, there should be a composite cable packed in the box. If you need a different cable, you'll have to order it from Sony or buy one online at a store like Amazon. Make sure that you get the PlayStation 2 version of the cable you want to use, as the PlayStation 2 requires a special plug on one end of the cable.
PlayStation 2 video cables will work for all PlayStation 2 models.

,


Make sure you place it in a location that has plenty of open area so that the PlayStation 2 doesn't collect too much heat. Avoid stacking it above or below other electronic devices. If you have the stand, you can setup your PlayStation 2 vertically so that it takes up less space. Make sure that it's close enough so that the video and the power cables don't have to stretch to reach the TV and outlet.,


All PlayStation 2 video cables connect to the same port on the back of the PlayStation 2. The video port is located in the bottom-right corner of back of the fat PlayStation 2s, and on the right side of the back of the slim PlayStation 2s, next to the power connector. The port is labeled ""AV MULTI OUT"".

,


Make note of the input that you are connecting to, as this will allow you to find the correct input when you turn on your TV. Match the colors of the plugs with the colors on the inputs.
The audio connection (Red and White) may be offset from the video inputs on the TV. If your TV only supports mono sound, just use the White audio plug.When connecting component cables, you'll likely have two Red plugs. One of these is video and the other is audio. If you lay out the component cable flat, the order of plugs should be Red, Blue, Green (Video set), White, Red (Audio set).
If your TV only has component connectors, but you only have a composite cable, you may still be able to connect the two. Plug the Red and White audio cables as normal, and try plugging the Yellow plug into the Green connector. If this ends up resulting in a black-and-white image, try plugging the Yellow plug into either the Blue or the other Red connector.
If you're in Europe, you may need the Euro-AV connector, which will allow you to plug the composite cable into your TV's SCART socket. This connector comes packaged with new European PS2 models.

,


If you have a 5.1 surround sound system, you'll need to connect the Digital Out (Optical) audio port on the PS2 to the receiver using a TOSLINK cable. This is only required if you want 5.1 surround sound and have the necessary equipment. You can find the Digital Out (Optical) port next to the video port on the back of the PlayStation 2.

,


The fat PS2 and the slim PlayStation 2 have different power cables. To connect the fat PS2, plug the ""figure-eight"" side of the power cable into the back of the PlayStation 2, and then plug it into the wall or a power strip. For slim PS2s, connect the power cable to the yellow ""DC IN"" jack on the back of the PlayStation 2, connect the power brick, and then plug the entire cable into the wall or power strip.
Make sure that the cable has some slack so that it isn't straining the connection.

,


Some PS2 games have online functionality, and you'll need to connect your PlayStation 2 to your home network via Ethernet to take advantage of this. The slim PS2 has a built-in Ethernet adapter, but the fat PlayStation 2 requires a network adapter add-on.
You won't be setting up your network on a system level. Instead, individual games will handle the network settings when you attempt to connect.
Many PS2 games that had online multiplayer no longer function online, as servers have long been shut down.

,


You'll need either an official PlayStation 2 controller (called a DualShock 2), or a third-party controller designed for the PS2. All new PlayStation 2 models come with a single DualShock 2 controller. You cannot use a PS1 controller regularly with your PS2, but you can use a PS1 controller while playing PS1 games.

,


If you want to be able to save your progress in games, you'll need to insert a PS2 memory card, official memory cards are 8 MB, which is enough space for lots of saved games. You can purchase unofficial larger memory cards, but these have a higher chance of failing and corrupting your saved data. However, official, larger memory cards do exist in 16 MB and 32 MB. You can store using the hard drive add-on without a memory card, but you need a memory card to install the hard drive software.
You can play games without a memory card or a HDD, but your progress will be lost whenever you turn the system off or change games.
Memory cards are inserted directly above the controller. Make sure that the memory card label is facing up when you insert it.

,


Turn on your TV and switch it to the input that the PlayStation 2 is connected to. If you connected the PS2 to your VCR or receiver, make sure that the VCR or receiver is set to the correct input, and that your TV is set to the VCR or receiver's input.

,


Press the power button on the front of the PlayStation 2. The light should turn green and, if the correct input is selected, you should see the PS2 opening logo animation. If there is no game inserted, you'll be taken to the PS2 system menu. If a game is inserted, it will start automatically after the boot-up animation.

,


Press the Eject button on the front of the PlayStation 2 to either eject the tray (fat PS2) or pop open the lid (slim PS2). Place the game on the tray or place it onto the spindle. Push the slim lid closed, or push the Eject button again on the fat PlayStation 2 to close the tray.
Don't eject a game while playing, or it may quit without saving.
Take care not to touch the surface of the game disc when inserting or removing it. THis will help prevent scratches and damage, and keep your games working longer.

,


If your PlayStation 2 is connected with component cables, you may be able to enable progressive scan (480p) mode. This will result in a much clearer picture, but is only supported by certain games. Press and hold △ +✕ after the PlayStation 2 Logo appears when starting a game. If the game supports progressive scan, you'll see a message from the game telling you how to enable it. There are no system settings for progressive scan.
For a full list of games that support progressive scan and widescreen, see this Wikipedia list.

Wake up around 6 am.",How to Get Married in The Sims Bustin' Out (PS2)," You can't marry any sims who the game created. You can only marry a person from the street, aka a ""free"" person.;
, You are only allowed to be married in places that have the ""Get Married"" goal, and when you get married you must live in your current house.

, Your energy meter must be completely full.
Go to the bathroom. This will help avoid having to dismiss yourself later, when it is imperative that you be with your lover.
Take a shower or bath. You don't want to smell, or the person may not want to hug/kiss you.
Call your lover. Make sure the time is at least 7:00 AM. If its not, then wait. You don't want them mad at you for waking them up!
Serve them a breakfast. Be sure not to burn it. This will require you having at least decent cooking skills. If yours are lacking, read up on a cookbook to raise your level.
Don't do anything. Seems kind of backwards to the plan, yes, but refrain from television, radio, etc. for a few minutes. You may use the bathroom, though.
Greet your lover. This will establish, yet again, good relations between the two of you. It should be about 10 or 11 AM by now.
Go eat lunch. It doesn't even matter if you order a pizza, just eat something. They must be following you to eat.
Go to watch television. Call them to you so that you can enjoy something together. Just make sure that you watch something that they like. Try a romantic show first, though.
Use the toilet if you didn't before. Do this while watching television. When you are done, call them in there.
Leave your lover to use the bathroom. After two meals, they are probably in need of it, too, and you must be considerate!
Go into the living room and call them. This will assure that you don't end up in the bathroom the whole time. This step is definitely optional.
Be sweet to them. Give them a gift, kiss them, dance for them, etc.
Propose to them. They should say yes, as long as whatever you just previously did was well reciprocated. You may have to do other things to get in their good graces if you upset them, however.

",How to Find the First Colossus in the Shadow of the Colossus," You start this game in the Shrine of Worship after you place your beloved on the altar. The first thing you have to do is leave the shrine. Call Argo and mount his saddle. Once you've hopped on your horse, go to either the right or left of the altar and walk down the stairs. You'll be outside in the vast world of the game.


To call Argo, press 'X'
To mount Argo's saddle, stand by his side, facing him, and press the 'Triangle' button
Press 'X' while on Argo to make him move. The more you press 'X', the faster he'll go.;
, The first colosi's layer is directly in front of the Shrine, in an opening in the mountain wall. You can raise your sword and follow the path of light when it centers. Just keep going forward, and soon the opening in the mountains will be clear.  Make sure to stay between the cliffs on that sort of path that they make!


Press and hold 'O' or 'Square' to hold up your sword while on Argo, and the right analogue stick to move it. 

, Once you find the place, you'll know it; there will be stairs leading to a round cut-out in the canyon wall. Walk Argo into this circular area and then dismount as Argo can not go where you'll be headed next.

, If you're still facing the way you were when you walked in, there should be a patch of moss to your right. Go to it and begin to climb it. It's not too tall, so you should reach the top fast. You should now be on a ledge. Yay!


Press 'Triangle' to jump and hold 'R1' to hold onto the moss. You can then press up on the left analogue to move up or press 'Triangle' to jump up faster.

, When you head left, it will slightly curve back around. Be careful: at the end of the curve is a gap between one part of the ledge and the other. Jump over this.

, There is a ledge next to you, and you must jump up and grab this, and then hoist yourself up on onto this ledge. You'll know where to jump and grab for because a part of that ledge is lighter and a little more green.

, If you're at the wooden bridge, then you're already halfway there. Make your way across this and then hop over another gap in the pathway.

, There will be a pillar in your path now. If you try to walk under it, you'll notice that you can't continue. To get past this obstacle, you need to stand back from the pillar a little bit. Once far enough back, face the pillar, crouch down, and then roll forward and under the pillar.


To roll, hold down 'R1' and then quickly press 'Triangle'.

, As you continue straight forward, you'll find another ledge. Keep making your way up.

, Once here, climb up onto the ledge to your left.

, You'll quickly run into a wall, and that's perfect. There is a ledge slightly above you that is perfect for grabbing onto. Grab onto this ledge.

, When you're on the ledge, push your left analogue stick left. You will begin to move left around the wall. Make sure you move all the way onto the other side of the wall.


Make sure you're still holding 'R1' the whole time

, This may sound easy, but it's hard at first. While holding on to the ledge, you'll have to turn around and jump back onto the ledge behind you. Here's how:


While holding down 'R1', push your left analogue stick straight back. You will turn around and face a ledge behind you
Hold down 'Triangle' until your meter shows that you stamina is charged
Left go of 'Triangle'. You will jump towards the ledge behind you. Make sure you are still holding 'R1' so that you can grab onto the ledge when you jump towards it.

, there is no more climbing. Once you reach the end of the path, a little clip will show you that you have finally found the first colossus. Congratulations; now it's time to beat him.

Enter the cheats.,
Play the game with your cheats activated.

",How to Find PS2 Cheat Codes," Before trying to find the cheat codes, you need to know what game you're actually going to cheat on. Websites that have cheat codes will have them for hundreds of games, not just your one. To save you the trouble of searching through that big long list of games, decide what game you want to cheat on in the first place.;
, A big giveaway as to whether or not cheats exist in a game is the menu that actually allows you to enter the cheats. This is usually found in the ""options"" or ""settings"" screen. If your game does not have a section to enter cheats, there's a chance that cheats do not even exist in that particular game. If this is the case, choose another game.

, A good place to start looking is the internet. Simply perform a Google search saying ""cheats for PS2"". Be sure to include the console that you want the cheats on too, the cheats are probably different on every console even if it's the same game. If a website that looks legit comes up when you do your Google search, click it to see if the cheats on there work in the game.

, The most common cheats are ""cheat codes"". These require you to enter an actual code or word into the game. This is where the cheat menu found in the ""options"" or ""settings"" screen comes into play. Simply type in the word and the cheat should be unlocked. Not all of these cheats work but if the code is not working, check your spelling. If your spelling is correct, the cheat may be fake. Don't worry about it, just move on to the next one. Other cheats require you to actually perform certain actions while playing the game.

Characters- There are 75 characters including never seen before in the previous Budokai Tenkaichi-Zangya, Pikkon and many more. There are 120 unique character forms to unlock giving you the full arsenal of weapons to launch your bid to take over the DBZ world in ultimate battle Z. The best thing yet, like in the previous game, you do not need to choose separate characters, they will trans form in the game if you wish to transform.
Battles- In dueling, like in BT3, which is quite expensive, you can do tag battles so for example while fighting as Goku, you can swap places with your other character if you're running out of health. Free battles are 5 v 5 battles, so you swap places with your companions a lot more than in tag battles. Battle settings have been made better such as you can choose your referee such as Supreme Kai and choose the seconds or time you want to battle.
Data centre- Best reason yet, you can create a custom character, this does not mean like choose skills, hairstyle, it means you unlock one of the characters from the Dragonball world and they are way more powerful. For example normal Zangya will be level 8 but unlocked Zangya in data centre will be level 120. You need passwords to unlock the characters, there are a lot of videos which can give you the passwords for specific characters including Uub.
Attacks- Just before your enemy hits you, by pressing o and directional buttons, you can teleport out of the way. Also the attacks has been made more realistic, that is according to the dragonball world. By realistic, opponents will fly out of the way or teleport to avoid attacks. The hard mode really puts you to the test. Your opponent will try crazy moves to dodge out of the way such as back flips and you can do the same as well.
Battlefields- 16 battlefields have been introduced to give you the battle like never before so you can fight in a random planet or in the burning Namek for the first time since BT1.
Dragonworld- You can live the story of Goku and his friends in dragon adventure. You can choose your difficulty and go for it. Also there are extras, if you complete those extra events, you get more rewards. The story mode starts of from Saiyan saga and runs till the Db Gt, also it includes adventures from Dragonball.
Dragon library- Unlike before, you can view the dragon profiles with the voices of the character and fighting stance includes. Also there is dragon text that explains dragonball as it happened. Also there is a playlist of music you can listen to of your choice.
Ultimate battle z- Like never before you can choose which section to fight like in Kakarot road, you only fight the opponents that are Goku's rivals such as Vegeta. Beware you cannot choose difficulty, they will come after you like wolves and eat you alive if let your guard down! There are other sections to explore and eventually the difficulty level goes to very hard.
Z items- Unlike in Bt1, you will have to earn money to buy yourself an upgrade, which can be earned while doing dragon adventure or fighting in dragon tournaments.;
, These include:


Misleading- Such as data centre, it misleads you to thinking that you can create your own characters from scratch, which is not true.
Characters too strong- Some characters are too strong to even challenge on easy mode. Easy mode is to give the beginner an idea of the game but if he or she gets beaten straight away, its useless as the player cannot learn the basics. Also if you do com v com, Zangya always loses to Android 18 so you cannot learn the moves. So when it says loses, that means in only less then 50 seconds or less then 60 seconds.

, Other than the small list of negatives, the game is decent and cheap to buy compared to bt3. It can get you hooked for hours if you get the hang of it.

While playing the single player, practice your sniping. Ideal missions to practice your sniping are: Wake Of The Fallen or Retribution Equip yourself with whatever long range rifles you can, and pick your enemies off like sitting ducks. Beware though, your enemies online aren't as oblivious to your presence as the AI is... until you get good.;
, Do you want to crawl around the map stealthily and patiently with your silenced rifle, waiting for the perfect shot? Or do you want to hang top with the most deadliest sniper rifles in the game and pick your targets off with one bullet at a time? Once you have found a style that best suits you, proceed to step 3.

, The rifles in SOCOM 3 are the M87ELR (SEALS) the M82A1A (TERRORIST) The SR-25(SEALS: Can be silenced) The SASR (TERRORIST: Can be silenced) the M40A1 and the L96AW. The M87 and M82's are the loudest guns in the game. They have a bright muzzle flash and are heavy, but they are the most powerful, having no range limit and killing in 1 shot. The SR and the SASR kill in 2 shots, have unlimited range without suppressor, but with suppressor they are limited. These are the longest ranged silenced weapons in the game. Lastly, the M4OA1 and the L96AW. These are 2 shot rifles, can not be suppressed, but are very accurate. The M4OA1 is arguably the most accurate rifle in the game.

, Log online and join a Suppression game. A few good maps to start sniping on are Harvester, Crucible, Storm Front, Devils Road, and Killing Fields. Go to the armory and equip your ghillie/rifle.Equip a high scopeadd a Bi-pod if your going to be firing from a prone position. In your pistol slot add a Model 18, this is because if anyone gets close to you you can take them out quickly.Add some Ammo and whatever you want in the last slot and get into the action. Once in-game, if you are going for the stealth approach, try to find a few spots that are relatively secluded but have a decent view of moderately to heavily traveled areas. When you see a target, if he has buddies with him, engage them from back to front. This means that if the guy in the back drops, the guy up front won't notice unless he turns around, making him a sitting duck for you. Once you have milked that spot for all its worth, sneakily move to your next one.

, Join a clan, preferably a tactical one. Go to www.TopSocomSites.com and look for great clans, or visit www.Snipers.ws and register there. Their leader is a nice guy named ZiNg. While practicing, constantly seek out new spots from which to snipe, memorize all the maps, learn to use different rifles and scopes, and you will eventually become a well rounded SOCOM Sniper, and a VERY valuable asset to any clan.

, If you miss a shot and a guy gets away, for the sake of all things good tell your team. That guy could make or break the victory for your side. Let them know where he went.

Put magnet on your Quick-select, and equip any abilities you can think of that boost magic strength or lower the MP charge phase. Equip the Experience Boost ability and the keyblade Gull Wing, get your health to critical (health flashing, beeping sound) to further increase experience boost. Once you've done that, you can begin.

, This is the platform where you battle Scar earlier in the game. There should be about 128 Rapid Thrusters flitting around above you. Wait until you have locked onto one (you won't be able to see it, but you'll hear it) and then cast a magnet spell. If MP orbs start raining down on you you're on the right track.As the magnet spell does its work, run around collecting up the orbs to prevent yourself running out of MP.

, As soon as you hear the magnet vortex shut down, cast another one. Within one afternoon you can get to Level 99 using this method. Its also a very easy way to get synthesis items. The only reason you should need to leave the area is to either make them respawn or store your synthesis items with a Moogle.

,How to Train Forms on Kingdom Hearts 21,
"
Use weak targets.,
Use Combo Plus.,
Choose your location.,
Put the smack down!",How to Train Forms on Kingdom Hearts 22," The valor form trains by hits, so for every time you land a hit on something in Valor Form you get one point of Valor Form Experience. To allow you to get an uninterrupted string of hits you should use weak enemies. The Shadows in the World That Never Was are a great and almost endless supply of free hits. Plus, they're almost everywhere in the city, so even if you do run out you'll be able to find some more.;
, Equip as many Combo Plus abilities as you can. This will mean you hit far more times before the combo finisher than you normally would.

, Choose a spot that is adjacent to an area with a save point. While in a form, accessing a save point and leaving the world will restore your Drive Gauge to maximum. While training, keep an eye on your Form Gauge, and when it reaches about 1 bar left, head to the nearest save point. This step is true for all forms, so keep it in mind with the other guides as well.

, When you go into combat, beat your chosen weaklings silly. Do not stop hitting the x button until you need to return to the save point. Fighting Shadows is possibly the easiest thing to do, as it will be very hard for them to hit you. Unleash strings of combos, and very soon you'll be at all seven Form Gauges, and will have the ever handy High-Jump ability.

"
"
Use weak targets.,
Up your magic strength.,
Use Magic.,
Use it repeatedly.",How to Train Forms on Kingdom Hearts 23," As with the Valor form, Shadows are your best option. Head to the World That Never Was to find them in an almost limitless supply. The Wisdom Form trains by defeating Heartless, one Experience point per kill. Weak heartless should be your intended quarry. Also a good place to train is Timeless River. Go back and enter the first window. Use thunder and shoot to clear out the enemies quickly. after your drive gauge gets low exit the window and go back out the door to Disney Castle and your drive gauge will be replenished. Good place to train master as well.

, Use keyblades that replenish increase your MP recovery and have high Magic strength. You'll only be allowed one, so if you have to choose, go with Magic Strength.

, The Wisdom form is all about magic. Using magic in the Wisdom form, although using up Gauge, is a lot more powerful. So that you can use magic more, equip items that lower the time you spend charging your MP, such as the Ultima Weapon. Try Thunder as a spell to use, as it automatically targets enemies, even if they are behind you. It also has a wide area effect in the Combo Finisher.

, Forget about how much MP you've got left, just fire away. The more you use it, the more Experience you'll get, and it doesn't hurt to be quick about it. But be careful you don't waste MP, keep an eye on whether there actually are any Heartless around, or whether you've killed them all.


Another handy tactic that works well is to use Magnet. This will draw in enemies and damage them. Once you've got some enemies circling the magnet, start shooting at them. Or alternatively, use Thunder. Remember to keep an eye on your Form Gauge, and as soon as it runs low go to your save point. Even if it takes a while, remember that Level 7 Wisdom Form comes with Quick Run, an extremely useful maneuver in any situation.

"
"
Forget about enemies.,
Prepare your form.,
Beginning.,
Persist.,
Another good shortcut to this is to use the tunnel above the village.",How to Train Forms on Kingdom Hearts 24," The Master Form gets Experience from picking up Drive Orbs. This makes training easy in that every time you get Exp, you get a little longer in that form. You can conceivably go on training for much longer than any other form because of this. However, enemies are not the best way to get Drive Orbs. Explosive carts are and you can find these in the Land of Dragons. The Checkpoint is the best place to get them. To begin with you'll need to kill all the enemies in the checkpoint. Once you've done that, you're ready to start training.

, Before you actually begin training you will need to equip all of the Negative Combo abilities available to you in Master Form. This pretty much constitutes Fenrir, an extra weapon obtained after the battle with Sephiroth. Equip this as one of your weapons and you're ready to go.

, To start of with, you'll need to know the fastest route to a save point. This is through the Encampment and into the Grove where you first start the level. Once you know that by heart, stand next to one of the three carts in the area. Go Master Form, and the area damage effect will blow it up for you, saving some time. Once you've done this, collect up the orbs and run to another one. You will need to perform a full combo to destroy them from know on, so try not to miss. Once you've destroyed all of them from there switch area and run back as fast as you can, this will make the carts respawn.

, Although this takes time, and there are a lot of factors to juggle (Form Gauge, getting to the save point in time, etc), a bit of practice will mean that you will have Level 7 Master Form in no time. Once you do, the sweet Aerial Dodge ability will be yours.

, There is a save right close by and two carts available. I went from level 3 to level 5 in one single transformation using this spot. Just clear out the baddies in the entrance to the tunnel, prepare FIRE in your quick menu, then leave the tunnel to re-pop the carts. Enter, burn, collect, exit, repeat. With the right options, this can almost self-sustain the drive bar. Plus, when you get to the drive 0 bar, run to the very close save point in the village and go to the world map and return.

"
"
Magic makes thing easier.",How to Train Forms on Kingdom Hearts 25," This is an easy one to level up if you know how to use it. Once you get Riku into you party, go to the room where the doors to the Org. members places are. There your gauge will be maxed out. So basically go Final Form outside that room and go through that room to get your gauge filled up. I would recommend using magic such as Firaga, Thundaga and Reflega against the Nobodies. It makes it very easy and quick to level up Final Form. Once it gets below 1 or 0, go back to that same room and your gauge will be filled and ready to go for another go. Repeat the process from there onward. Once you are done, you will have Final Form maxed out, have Glide maxed out and you will be at a decent level (such as in the 70s or 80s) even before you fight Xemnas for the first time! So you basically get 3 bonuses from doing this.

, Gathering Thunder Gems can also be tricky because few heartless drop them. So:


Warp to Atlantica (Little Mermaid's world) and land at Triton's throne.
Head south to the only exit, which will lead you to Triton's palace.
Head north, and you will see Screwdivers (heartless that carry tridents or three-pronged spears) and an Aquatank (heartless that look like large Anglerfish). Kill them to get Thunder Gems.
Head to the Undersea Gorge, which is directly north from where you came. More Screwdivers and Aquatanks appear in this area. Kill them to get more Thunder Gems.
Once you have 5 pieces of Thunder Gems, head back to Triton's throne and exit Atlantica.

, To get Mystery Goo, you must defeat White Mushrooms, Black Fungi, or Rare Truffles. White Mushrooms are the best option because Black Fungi drop Mystery Goo rarely, and Rare Truffles require more skill and patience to beat.


Warp to Wonderland and land at the Queen's castle.
Head north to the center of the room, then head east. The door there will lead you to Lotus Forest.
White Mushrooms spawn here, about 3 or 4 at a time. To beat them, you must follow their game of ""charades"" and guess which spell to cast. For White Mushrooms that shiver, use fire spells; for White Mushrooms that fan themselves, use blizzard spells. If a light appears above the White Mushroom, use thunder spells. If the White Mushroom is on the ground, use cure spells. If the White Mushroom stops moving, use stop spells. If it floats in the air, use gravity spells. If it spins around, use aero spells.
After you guess the correct spell 3 times in a row, the Mushroom will reward you with items, including Mystery Goo.
Collect 3 Mystery Goo, then go back to the Queen's castle and leave Wonderland.

, The heartless that drop Gale are very powerful, so be prepared:


Warp to the End of the World (the last world you unlock) and land at the Final Rest. This room is the last one before the final boss battle.
Head back to the previous room rather than going through the last door.
This room has 2 types of heartless: Invisibles, which are black, and Angel Stars, which have wings. Kill them and collect pieces of Gale.
Head back to the Final Rest and re-enter the room, making heartless spawn again. Kill them and collect pieces of Gale. Repeat as necessary.
Once you've collected 3 pieces of Gale, head back to the Final Rest and leave the End of the World.

Choose what stats you want to base your Gummi ship on.,
Decide what weapons you will be equipping your ship with.,
Consider special Gummi-Blocks:


Cockpits.,
Decide if you will use your own design, or a pre-built one.,
Gather your parts.,
Build your Gummi-Ship.

",How to Make the Ultimate Gummi Ship in Kingdom Hearts 2," Remember, you have only got a limited number of blocks you can use, so planning what characteristics you want your ship to have will make building go much smoother.


Health. This is shown by the shield on the Stats wheel. It determines how much damage you Gummi-Ship can take before it is destroyed. Increased by Material-Gummis.
Power. Power gives your Weapons additional strength. The higher the power, the more damage you will deal. Increased by cockpits.
Weapon Strength. This is the overall amount of strength that will be dealt by your collective Gummi-Weapons (not counting Power bonuses). The higher this is, the more fire-power you will unleash with each shot. Increased by weapons.
Mobility. This is purely how fast your Gummi-Ship will respond to the 'Spin' command (Circle button). The higher this is, the less time it will take for you to throw off enemies or dodge incoming fire. Increased by Wing-Gummis.
Speed. This doesn't affect how fast you move through the route, only how fast you move around the screen. This is crucial; weapons are only useful if you are actually shooting at your enemies. Increased by engines.;
, Weapons are a crucial element, so choose them wisely.


Lasers. These lock on to enemies while you hold the fire button and then fire on all targeted enemies when you release the fire button.
Cannons. These are staple weapons. The Orange Fire shoot straight ahead. The Gravity set ricochet off enemies, leading to more kills per shot. The Lasers set may be a better option than the actual Lasers, as they lock-on and fire automatically.
Impact-Gummis. These damage enemies whenever they hit you, whether they be Catchers, Adamants or DreadShips.
Slash-Gummis. These fire a slashing attack whenever you press Triangle.

, These drastically increase Power, but reduce speed. Always put a cockpit on your ship.
Shield-Gummis. Block lasers, they can be very useful if you can put them where they can easily block shots, although this may limit the size of your ship, unless you build backwards behind the shield.
Extra-Gummis.

, Pre-designed plans are available from the Recommended Blueprints. These are rewards from Gummi-Routes.

, There are literally hundreds of Gummi-Blocks in the game, all of them with their own effects. You'll need to gather some before you can begin. You can collect blocks even with a bad Gummi-Ship. The earlier routes (Asteroid Sweep, Stardust Sweep, etc) yield fairly high-quality Gummi-Blocks.

Beat Xigbar.,
Get your moogle level up until you have gotten Serenity Crystal as an add on to synthesis items.,
Go to the world that never was.,
Collect dense and twilight crystals, stones, and gems.,
Know what you will need.,
Gather all the torn pages for Pooh's World.,
Obtain your first Orichalcum+.,
Go to the Olympus Colosseum, and then the Underworld Tournament.",How to Get Ultima Weapon in Kingdom Hearts 2," First, if you don't have an action replay for the Playstation 2, you want to wait until you've beaten Xigbar (dude with the eye patch) in the world that never was. Once you have, you're going to start searching for the Orichalcum+. Keep in mind, there's only seven in the whole game. Only get seven, even though it says to get 13.;
, Level up your moogle by synthesizing any and all items you can.

, Equip the abilities of Lucky Lucky to the whole party, and the Lucky Ring accessories, and Sweet Memories for even more drop rate. (if you have it.)

, Shards won't be needed. These can be commonly found by defeating a nobody. Once you've collected about a couple of each, it's time for something a bit more challenging. Serenity crystal is also a syntheses item, not just an add-on. You need about seven of these serenity crystals. Get as much luck as you can get.

, Abilities, items, equipment, weapons, four leaf clovers, horse shoes, and your lucky underwear will definitely help. You can get Serenity Crystals by defeating snipers, assassins, Berserkers, and possibly dancers. Snipers and Berserkers drop most commonly. All these enemies can be located in the world that never was. Once you have the dense, twilight, and serenity items, it's time to hunt for the Orichalcum+.

, These are scattered all over the worlds, so look hard.

, Another one can be found in the old mansion in twilight town. (Must be sora, not roxas) The next Orichalcum+ can be obtained only once when you reach roughly level 53.

, Beat very one, and after beating either Titan Cup or Goddess of Fate cup, you get another Orichalcum+. The next one can be found after getting at least one of every single synthesis material. Blazing, Frost, Lightning, Dense, Twilight, Serenity, Energy, you need every one. You can know where to get these in other walkthroughs and websites by searching Google. The rest of Orichalcum can be obtained by beating worlds and finding rare chests all around the Worlds Dude. You'll also need a few regular Orichalcum, which can be found by defeating any powerful enemies and in chests and after beating certain events.

Level up Valor: The equipment for leveling up Valor, your going to want oath keeper and sweet memories.,
Level up Wisdom: For this you don't have a secondary weapon, and oath keeper has decent magic.,
Level up Master: For this you want oath keeper and follow the wind.,
Level up Final: For this you want oath keeper and ultima.",How to Train Drive Form," Why? Oath keeper increases your drive gauge duration, (makes it last longer) and sweet memories does less damage. The reason why we want to do less damage is because every time you hit an enemy, you gain 1 experience. so, find tough enemies with lots of hp, preferably nobodies from twilight town or the world that never was, such as berserkers, snipers, and assassins. Most people will say to use shadows in the world that never was, but they die in one hit, so it doesn't matter the quantity. The drive gue will be used up by three, so, here's a tip. if your in any form in drive, and you exit to the world map, you go back with full drive. any form is usable, and you should always stay close to a save point.;
, So use that. Now, every heartless you defeat you get one experience. so, your wanting shadows from the very start of the world that never was. Eliminate every heartless in the first 2 sections of the areas, head back to save point, world map, go back, and repeat process until success.

, why follow the wind? Every time you obtain a form drive form orb, you get 1 experience, and 3 for getting the larger ones. Follow the wind will draw them in. To get these orbs, go to the land of dragons, the throne room. Outside will be lots of those spear carrying heartless, which drop various large orbs when defeated.go further and further out and defeat every heartless till you reach the checkpoint. destroy enemies and the crates of missiles. go back to throne room, exit to map, and repeat the process.

, if you don't have that, use fatal crest. If you don't have that, use sleeping lion. if you don't have that,use wishing lamp. The reason you want these is because they are balanced in attack and magic. For final, every nobody you kill gets you 1 experience. Most people say use twilight town because there weaker there, but they are low on quantity. so, use the world that never was. if you are tough enough and quick enough and use thundaga enough, you should make it from brink of despair, (beginning) to proof of existence (suggested finish) zip through using glide and cast thundaga all the way through. once mp reaches zero, use ethers or elixirs. zip through to proof of existence and, exit to world map, start at brink of despair and repeat process.

If playing as Sly, take advantage of his stealth skills.,
If playing as Bentley, be very careful.,
If playing as Murray, be cautious, but don't worry about guards all the time.",How to Avoid Being Killed By Guards in Sly 2," As often as possible, use Sly's Rail Walk/Slide and Ninja Spire Jump/Landing. Stick to the rooftops, where you'll be less likely to get caught.;
, Very, very careful. Bentley's strongest attacks, at first, are his sleep darts and bombs. If caught by guard(s)do not try to fight them, unless you've got an upgrade to help. Bentley swinging his crossbow is not very strong.

, Murray is extremely strong, so he will be able to fight most guards head-on. Just remember: His health bar isn't a bottomless pit.
