The first thing I must recommend is writing down this next list of ingredients:;
,Sora's Ultima Weapon

,Ultima recipe

,Orihalcum+

,Orihalcum

,Mythril Crystal

,Dense Crystal

,Twilight Crystal

,Serenity Crystal

,Energy Crystal

,
Ok this is why I say you need to wait until you are on the world that never was.,Ok now to get the ingredients,

,
First you'll want to have lucky lucky on all of your characters (If you chose the staff at the station of serenity sora won't get lucky lucky till he's lvl 99).,
Sora :sweet memories keyblade: complete the spooky cave (100 Acre Wood)

,
Donald :Meteor Staff: Seadrift Keep chest (Port Royal)

,
Goofy :Genji Shield: Complete the Titan Cup

,
Anyone :Lucky Ring: Complete the Pain And Panic Cup

,
All of this should make it to where items will drop very frequently.

,
Finding the items I will leave up to you because everything except orihalcum and orhalcum+ drops from enemies.

,
Be patient the items only have a 4% drop rate.

",How to Get the Ultimate Weapon in Kingdom Hearts 2,",,,,,,,,,, When you go to twilight town for the final mission the ultima recipe is down in that technological looking basement. Make sure you pick it up otherwise you can't make the ultima weapon.

,, To add additional luck you want to equip the characters with the following:

,,,,,,,"
"
Level up, and gain exp.,
Make sure you level up all your spells, including Cure, Fire, Thunder, etc.,
Level up your drive gauge/forms.,
Now comes the tough part.",How to Get the Best Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts 2," This is done by fighting Heartless, Nobodies, pretty much any enemy you encounter.;
, Buy as many items as you can.

, If you haven't got it already, try to get the Final Form. This form houses the glide ability, which when leveled up to a certain extent, will undoubtedly help you in the battle you must face.

, In order to obtain Fenrir, you must find Sephiroth in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. He is not that difficult if you are at least level 75 or above, have gotten every magic spell leveled up, and have your forms leveled up to an extent. The spinning technique and glide will help immensely here. You will need A LOT of potions/hi-potions/elixirs and equip berserk-this allows you to continuously attack Sephiroth when your magic is recharging. Do your best to avoid his attacks. Occasionally, this is impossible. One of his attacks will sap your health down to a tiny sliver. Use Curaga or quickly use a potion to escape instant death. If you need more help, do some research on how to beat him.

"
"
Go to Twilight Town after it has reappeared.,
Follow the steps to get to The World That Never Was, and reach Memory's Skyscraper.

,
There will be a cut scene, and if you have Final Mix a boss fight, and then it will go to normal.

,
In Final Mix after the boss battle you will also get a new keyblade which increases your chance of going into Final Form.

,Go to The Colosseum and enter the Cerberus Cup

,Simply pull up the drive menu and hit Master Form

,
If you do not get Final Form, simply hit start and hit retry.,
Be sure you've made it to the World That Never Was.

,
Randomly access the other forms, and the final will appear.

",How to Get Final Form in Kingdom Hearts 2,";
,,,,,, This restarts the tournament, and you have a full drive gauge. This eliminates any need to refill you drive gauge, and it provides you a fun environment to get your first taste of final form

,,"
"
These are the abilities you must equip: Action: All except Guard, Counterguard, Explosion, Trinity Limit and Horizontal Slash.,
Use Ethers, Curaga, Reflega and Thundaga to shortcut.,
Before you can go to the Final Form battle, you must defeat 5-7 other battles.,
Don't equip any items, except Ethers and Mega-Ethers, because Riku has the Cure Potion ability which heals you, but also drops his MP.,
Now you can go to the battle Xemnas!

,
Try always to save Ethers.,
After you beat all battles in the final battle, except the Final Form battle read this!

,
Xemnas says ""Anger and Hate are Supreme"" and then use reaction command, but watch out, if you equipped Riku auto Limit!

,
So use reversal and try use action abilities and Riku's Eternal Session to attack him!

,
After you beat at least 3 health bars he use lasers so avoid by using shortcut reflega to.,
After you beat at least 4 health bars, he stops Sora and you must hurry!,
Attack.,
Then defeat Xemnas by using a VERY long berserk combo or using Thundaga and you complete this game!

",How to Defeat Xemnas (Final Form) Battle in Kingdom Hearts 2," Growth: High Jump LVL 2 or higher, Aerial Dodge LVL 2 or Higher and Glide can any level. Support: Scan (Optional), Air Combo Plus (Both), Combo Plus (Both), Combo Boost, Air Combo Boost, MP Rage (Both), MP Haste, MP Hastega (From Ultima Weapon), Berserk Charge (Optional), Second Chance (Optional) and Once More (Optional).;
, Reflega to X, because it's probably easiest to use in X-button.

, (Don't know yet isn't the first two battles real battles).

, So that's why equip only Ethers or Mega-Ethers if you don't have Ethers in a while. You can also buy Ethers in TWTNW Twilight's View Moogle. The last moogle in the whole game.

,, Try to use very little magic and limits. You can also Auto-reload Ethers or Don't equip Any action abilities, save for Cure Potion, Eternal Session, Dark Shield and Dark Aura and of course your abilities.

,,,, He also like stops, but then he uses lasers. Don't attack to his copy. He doesn't have any hp and other.

, This is the only time that you can control Riku, without the cheat codes. ONLY use Dark Aura and move to Sora, before his health goes down to 0. Try to make sora take plenty of damage because then Riku can use Cure Potion and you have more chances to rescue him!. You can also, try to get the another Xemnas hitting Riku's back, which would towards Riku, more closer Sora!

, When Xemnas have very little hp left, he makes his ultimate attack! He summons 1,000 lasers so use both Reflect. The Reaction Command is for Riku and the X button is Sora. To make this easier, turn the controller sideways and rapidly tap the triangle and X buttons to block the lasers.

"
Get to ""The World That Never Was"" for the first time.,
Go to a Save Point in and get in the Gummi Ship.

,
Fly all the way to ""Olympus Coliseum"" and enter!

,

Prepare for the battle beforehand.,
Immediately cast Aero at the start of the battle.,
Lock onto Sephiroth.,
Recognize that in the beginning, Sephiroth follows a predictable pattern.,
After getting hit by a full combo, Sephiroth will vanish in a flurry of black feathers.,
Once Sephiroth's HP gauge reaches pink, his pattern of attack will change completely.,
Once in a while, you will hear Sephiroth say ""Descend Heartless Angel"".,
When you hear him yell ""Power!"",
After a while, he will introduce yet another attack.",How to Defeat Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts1,"


Ensure Sora is at least on Level 60.
Equip a keyblade with a good balance of magic and strength, especially one which boosts your MP (i.e. Spellbinder, Oathkeeper, Lionheart)
Equip accessories that increase your MP and HP.
Equip MP Rage and MP Haste, also equip Second Chance for when he uses his ""descend heartless angel"" move.
Set Aero and Cure as two of your shortcuts. The other shortcut does not matter, as these are the only magic spells you will need.
Equip as many Elixirs and Ethers as you can. Potions will not help very much in this battle.;
, This will protect you significantly from damage.

, Keep this lock on throughout the entire battle.

, He will walk slowly around the battlefield, then leap and attack when he is close.


Don't try to avoid him (unless you need time to heal or cast Aero on yourself). Just try to dodge his sword and get close. If he misses too many times in a row, or if you do not hit him with a full combo, he might say something, then summon a large explosion around him. If you are trapped in it, you will get hit twice. If you are not surrounded by Aero, or cast Cure very quickly, there is a good chance you will die as this attack is fast and powerful.
When you are within striking distance, hit him as many times as you can (one combo will do; more than that, and he will counterattack).

, He will appear a moment later and strike you without warning. So, as soon as you hit him, jump out of the way.

, He will begin to move much faster and erratically, running in an arc and leaping in the air. At this point, it will be more difficult to land a blow on him. It is vital that you keep him Locked-On at this stage of the battle.

, Quickly lock-on and use Superglide to reach him and strike him, at least once to stop the attack. This is a very devastating attack which reduces your HP and MP to 0 (if you have Second Chance equipped, it will only reduce your HP to 1) and will damage you anywhere you are.


If you do not reach him, or you know you will not reach him, quickly use an Elixir once the attack hits you.

, he will go into a sword-swinging frenzy. Immediately cast Aero, and Cure yourself non-stop. If you can, try to dodge away from him. After he's done, he'll bring his sword down and send out a shockwave to finish off the attack.


After he uses his blade flurry, he will usually teleport away and use his ""Descend Heartless Angels"" attack.

, He will momentarily become invulnerable, and summon a swarm of floating stones. As they spin, they will strike you, but they do not cause too much damage. Just make absolutely sure you have Aero cast on you. He will finish off the attack with a meteor. This attack is not particularly bad, but don't let your guard down.

"
"
Be at level 80 or higher.,
Equip yourself with items that boost your defense or your health.,
If you haven't already, get the Ultima Weapon.,
Enter the tournament.",How to Defeat Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts2," That way, if you don't have the ultima weapon yet, you'll still have decent magic and attack power.

, For example, the Second Chance and Once More abilities. Ensure that all of your items slots are equipped with elixirs.

, This will greatly increase your attack power and your MP by 2 or 3. Either way, it's an incredible and invaluable upgrade.

, Follow the rest of the guide in Method 1 above for the combat phase. However, be even more mindful of when Sephiroth begins running in circles. If you're not at a high level, you'll have trouble ending this phase quickly, so make sure you're absolutely ready by the time you start.

"
"
You have to be ready before hand.,
Here are some abilities you should definitely equip; Leaf Bracer, Combo Boost, and whatnot.

,
The second you step into battle, Demyx will summon 50 water clones that must be killed in 40 seconds.,
After you get beyond that, Demyx will start his normal pattern.,
Sometimes, Demyx will say,""Ain't it a blast?"",
More water clones arrive when Demyx is at half his health.,
Soon, Demyx starts using more powerful attacks, such was water columns in random spots.

,
After you deal the final blow, Demyx dies.",How to Defeat Demyx in Kingdom Hearts II," Be Level 30 and use the Hero's Crest keyblade (the weapon you get for killing the Hydra).;
,, This is cake compared to the rest of the fight.

, His main attack is jumping while trailing water columns. Then he'll summon five columns around himself. Avoid this by stepping away from the gush.

, Then he'll run towards you. Press the Triangle button to activate a command. If you don't activate the command, Demyx will hit you for major damage!

, 10 clones in 10 seconds. This is by far the hardest part of the entire fight.

,, You just beat the fudge out of him!

"
Chimeras can only be killed once all of their arms have been destroyed.,
Once you've taken down the legs, there should be a pause when it begins to spasm.,
After a fair amount of time, they will begin launching full scale missiles at you, which will knock you around the screen, leaving you with no chance to shoot back.",How to Defeat Gummi Bosses in Kingdom Hearts 22," To speed things up, use multiple Laser-Gummis. These will simultaneously destroy all of the legs, giving you an open shot at the body.;
, It will then unleash a barrage of lasers too terrifying for words. Ignore them. This sounds stupid, but they don't actually deal much damage. Concentrate your fire on the body, even as it moves around behind the wall of fire. Your lasers should lock onto it, and you'll be able to track it regardless.

, As soon as you see this attack coming, begin Barrel-Rolling with Circle. This will keep you on top, giving you an extra moment to fire back.

"
"
These guys have no ranged weapons, so impact Gummis are key.,
As much as they fly around for no reason, aiming is no priority.",How to Defeat Gummi Bosses in Kingdom Hearts 23," With impact Gummis they will take damage each time they hit you. Equip some Gungnir-Gs for an easy kill.

, They will cross your line of fire regularly anyway. Besides, if you've got Auto-Lock Lasers they will seek it out automatically.

"
"
Joy Riders have one weak spot.,
Because Joy Riders use physical attacks, Impact-Gummis are key.",How to Defeat Gummi Bosses in Kingdom Hearts 24," Their head. Who knows why, but it exposes this as it attacks. Generally it will approach from behind you. Keep your Gummi-Ship low on the screen, so you can note where the head pops up. It generally appears accompanied by a burst of flame, so as soon as you see that, begin aiming. A fast Gummi-Ship is your only hope of reaching the head before it hits you.

, Unless you damage it, it will just keep coming back.

"
"
Whatever you do, don't get fooled by the Teeny-Hunters.,
When a Hunter lays out its punishing beam of fire, duck down.,
Like the Chimera, it has full scale missiles.,
It will grab you and spin as fast as it can.",How to Defeat Gummi Bosses in Kingdom Hearts 25," These are not necessary for a kill. Above all aim for the center. That's where its head is, and that's where it will take the most damage from.

, The beam tends to cross the screen horizontally.

, See the Chimera section for tips on this.

, This deals small damage over a long time, leading to no Medal-Points and a great deal of magic. You can escape using the Circle Roll. This has the added bonus of throwing it off balance, so you can get in and deal more damage.

"
"
Set your rapid fire to Semi-Auto.,
When it begins firing loads of mini-Lasers, quickly roll to any corner of the screen, and move clockwise until you are at the middle of one of the sides.,
Ignore the Teeny-Hunters and the arms, just aim straight for the head.

Press ∆ in order to start the challenge.

,
Don't lock onto the mushroom.,
Keep close to it.,
Quick run (analog + hold □) to grab the orbs.,
Glide (analog + □ while in the air) to get closer if you get left behind.,
Keep repeating these steps until you collect 450 orbs.",How to Beat No.3 of Mushroom XIII in Kingdom Hearts II," The first thing you must know is where Mushroom no. 3 is located. It can be be found at the bridge in Beast's Castle, the same place where you battled with Xaldin.;
, You'll need to equip 2 in order for Sora to draw in orbs that are far from him.

, Equip as much as you can, if possible.

, This keyblade also has Draw ability.

, Beast often gets in the way of Sora's glide and quick run because he's large, so it's better to remove him.

,, Locking on to it will be troublesome when you miss some orbs since the camera will follow it.

, It will start dropping some orbs, but with a lot of draws equipped, you won't have to move much yet.

, Do this when the mushroom moves faster and drops a large number of orbs.


Luckily, the mushroom's movements are linear, so you'll be able to collect all the orbs by using quick run.

, Eventually, the mushroom will move faster and you'll have to glide after it.

, Mushroom no. 3 is one of the hardest mushrooms to beat, so you might have to repeat this a lot before you get it right.

After defeating all the Tentaclaws, wait.,
Keep attacking attacking until Leechgrave wakes up.,
New Tentaclaws shall pop up.",How to Defeat Leechgrave in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days," Please note that the Tentaclaws pop in and out and that they have the added bonus of swallowing you up and spitting you out Leechgrave, which causes huge damage. Magic helps, but doing so or defeating more Tentaclaws will cause pollen bursts from Leechgrave that drain your HP. NEVER attack Leechgrave head on without taking out the Tentaclaws first. If you did, you would have to very quickly dodge the giant claw that comes out of the coffin. And at one point you would lose anyway. Stay as far as you can from Leechgrave.;

Double-jump and glide around.,
Cast Reflega as soon as you hit the ground.,
Leap and glide around if Xaldin uses Desperation Attack.,
Continue stacking up on ""Jump"" reaction commands.",How to Beat Xaldin (Data Battle) in Kingdom Hearts II," This is the key blade you got from Auron. It boosts reaction command attacks. It’s perfect for this battle as you'll be relying on the ""Jump"" reaction command to get through Xaldin's defense.;
, You can also use this for a boost on Sora's keyblade damage or Ultimo Weapon (MP Hostage ) for faster MP charge.

, It equips you with 25% damage reduction, including physical damage.

, It equips you with damage reduction, including physical damage.

, Add up to 3 points to Sora's strength and MP Haste.

, Xaldin is nasty. He has a lot of lances and defenses in his arsenal, and he won’t think twice about using them on you. Being forewarned will work in your favor. Know how he wields each weapon so you can block it and even inflict damage.

, When Xaldin creates and deals you a cannon ball made of wind, easily block it with Guard or Reflega.

, When Xaldin dashes and pierces you with this lance, block it with Guard or Reflega.

, Xaldin will spin around and slice the air with his lance. Block it with Guard or Reflega.

, This makes him invulnerable so you'll have to use the reaction command (∆) ""Jump"" to break this and damage Xaldin.


You can also summon Stitch as his attack will stun Xaldin when he’s hit at the right moment.
Stitch can be a good asset in this battle, as Stitch not only causes constant attacks (although the damage is low), but also keep Xaldin stuck in the air and give you HP recovery balls.

, Xaldin will continuously drop down from the sky, piercing you with his lance. He will eventually send his lances to circle over you and do a stronger Lance Dive. Easily dodge the first few Lance Dives by double-jumping, and then gliding around the area. The last strike can only be blocked with Reflega.

, Xaldin will teleport around the arena. This skill is usually used to move around, but he will attack if you're near enough. Should he attack, block him with Guard (□) or Reflega.

, As a desperate measure, Xaldin will release a barrage of lance attacks before riding his lances into the background. He will then create a large whirlwind to sweep across the arena. As soon as he starts attacking, press □ and wait for him to fly over to the background. Run to one side of the area and cast Reflega when the whirlwind gets close.

, He will be highly intimidating at first. His attacks are quick, he has a huge range, and he deals a large amount of damage. However, he becomes easier to deal with once you've memorized his pattern.

, Because of Xaldin's huge range, it's not advised that you use Dodge Roll, especially against Wind Cannon. It is a homing type of attack and will chase Sora until it hits.

, All Xaldin’s attacks, except the whirlwind from his Desperation Attack, is block able with Guard.

, The ""Jump"" reaction command is a bit special. It isn't a cinematic reaction command. Rather, it's similar to the Lancer Nobody's reaction command where you store it and use it as an attack command.


The “Jump” reaction command can only be stacked a maximum of 9 times.

, Xaldin will immediately use Wind Cannon three consecutive times. If you're able to get close to him, do it! Wind Cannon, when blocked at close range, will make Xaldin fall, and you'll be able to spam-collect the ""Jump"" reaction command.

, Do so until you get some “Jump” commands. When you do, keep spamming it on Xaldin and following it up with an Air Combo once it runs out.

, This is to avoid having Xaldin land a hit on you. Land a few feet away from Xaldin, and wait for him to attack. Block it with Guard when he does, and repeat your combo.

, Remember that Xaldin will always keep his Wind Guard casted, so don't even bother to attack him. Just keep blocking and stacking on ""Jump"" reaction commands to break his Wind Guard.

, Keep blocking and stacking until you cleave 10 to 11 bars off his health. He will then move to a stronger and more furious set of attacks.

, Do so as soon as Xaldin leaps into the air and disappears using Lance Dive. Keep going around the arena until you see his lances swirling around Sora. As soon as you see it happen, land immediately. Don't worry, those lances won't hit you.

, Xaldin will do one more Lance Dive on you. If you do it correctly, you'll have a chance to attack him with a full combo.

, Depending on how much damage you do, Xaldin may go into desperation mode. If he does use his Desperation Attack, leap and glide around the arena to avoid his ground combo, then land on one side of the arena once he goes into the background. From here, there are 3 ways to avoid getting hit by the Wind Cannon:


Double-jump and glide on the opposite side of the bridge. This means that if he's on the right side, stay on the left side and glide all the way to the other side.
Stay on one side, and take advantage of Quick Run's invincibility frames.
Use Reflega three times as soon as the wind gets close.

, Keep doing so until Xaldin falls. You don't have to worry about landing a finishing strike on Xaldin; the ""Jump"" reaction command counts as a finisher and can deal a finishing blow on him.

Put the following spells and items into your customize menu:


Reflect, Reflera, or Reflega

For your weapon if you don't have ultima use Decisive pumpkin, if you don't have that try Oblivion or Sleeping lion.

,
Approach Sephiroth and press .,
Use the reaction command to block Sephiroth's attack.,
Immediately select Limit then execute Trinity.,
Once the attack is over, attack and use either Upper Slash or Finishing Leap to send him in the air, then keep on with your attack, adding a couple Horizontal Slashes along the way.

,
After you use the finishing attack, both you and Sephiroth will drop to the ground, in which he will do either one or two things.,
At anytime after knocking out about 5 bars, Sepiroth will use Heartless Angel.,
After Heartless Angel, he will become more of a threat, running instead of just standing there and gawking or walking around.,
When you get him down to about 4-5 bars of life, He will teleport and turn into his final form, where he is at his strongest and will use a meteor spell to try to kill you.,
The last pinch of life that Sephiroth has will only diminish via a Finishing move.,
After using ""Heartless Angel"", Sephiroth is actually at his most vulnerable.,
Next, counter immediately.,
After you've pummeled him a bit, stop your onslaught.,
Note that if you continue to attack Sephiroth in berserk mode for a very long time, eventually the computer will automatically warp him away so he can attack again.,
This method requires attentiveness to the action command and really good timing, but the results are brilliant, mostly because with a little practice, the whole sequence becomes predictable and easy to use to your advantage.",How to Beat Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts 2," You'll need the Elixirs found on Living Bones and Devastators.;
, Master and Final are most important. While you only require level 3, achieving higher is always helpful.

, You have to at least have over level 53.)

,,,, △ for a short cut-scene.

, He will use this at the beginning of battle, and further into the fight.

, When you are finished with the first strike press △ quickly to attack him again. After, you can still attack him with the ✕ button.

,,


He will stand his ground and attack using his sword. If he does this, jump and use Arial Dodge, then Glide away from him. When you get on the other side, land because you might need to press △ to guard again.
He will teleport and knock you up in the air. If he does this, press □ to use retaliating slash when he reappears, then continue with your combo by pressing ✕ until either he disappears or you finish.

, this attack is one that will summon a halo around your head to bring you down to one HP and no MP (With second chance or Once More) or Auto-kill you. To stop this, attack him before he starts saying ""Angel"". If you do not have the necessary abilities to reach him, and therefore cannot attack him, a well timed cure spell will cancel out the attack, but you will still have zero magic. On top of this, if you do not have the second chance ability, curing will make no difference as you will die before your cure spell has any effect. If you don't stop him in time, he will teleport and use either an attack you will need to block with △ or his regular attack. After this, Sepiroth will continue using Heartless Angel periodically.

, He will not only use his standard attack, but he will use something called Shadow Flare, which is a big fire pillar that sucks you in. Just use Glide for it or if you have the MP, use Trinity. Often there will be dark balls that appear around you. You can either destroy them (it takes only one hit), or use Reflect on them to knock them back toward Sephiroth. The number of balls depends. Sometimes there will be only 3 other times 7 or 8. Also sometimes he will use one of his Flash attacks where you need to press △ . If this happens and the balls are around you press △ and the balls will be blocked too. Also worth mentioning is that aerial dodge can knock the balls away.

, When this happens, double-jump and use glide. Don't stop moving.

, It will still work if you're doing a Berserk barrage. How? You'd have to do a Horizontal Slash or an Upper Slash to ""replace"" the Finishing move.

, Quickly use the reaction command, dodge ( △ ) to avoid his attack., Use the berserk mode to hack away at a ton of his HP (you will be able to make combos infinitely), but be sure to stay grounded. Do not jump into the air, or you will become more vulnerable to his vanish-reappear move., Quickly cast curaga, elixir or hi-potion from the shortcut menu to replenish your health from 1 HP., The second he warps away from the painful end of your keyblade, be sure to heal, or his next attack might kill you. Usually the next attack will be the dark energy balls (""Give into the darkness"") which will give you an extra split moment to heal, but he might also slash at you., Suddenly a dangerous attack will allow you to counter and freely cut down Sephiroth's HP--you can easily eliminate 2-3 of his health bars in one shot with this method."

, Unlike most of the mushroom challenges, no.12 will require you to have longer combos as you do not —absolutely do not—want to use finishers.

, Now you just need to kill 39 more! The problem is the stage. There are too many things that can block your magic shots, and Wisdom Form has a problem with shooting things on high at close range.

, This is to avoid having to dash across when the mushroom appears on the other side. This will also help remedy the problem of pillars blocking your shooting range.

, Don't even try to cast Thundaga to eliminate the hard-to-reach mushrooms. It just won't work, and you'll waste precious seconds.

, If a mushroom appears on top of a pillar, Quick Run (analog + hold □) away from it. You won't be able to hit anything that’s a bit higher than you are unless you create some distance between you and your target.

, Just keep at it until you reach the goal. It shouldn't be too hard once you get used to it."

, Now, depending on how much damage you dealt, Saix will either use his desperation attack or a different attack.

, This is assuming you didn't do enough damage to send him into berserker mode and desperation attack.

, He'll definitely use his desperation attack. Your MP will not be able to survive spamming Reflega, so don't even try to avoid it that way.

, This will make him stop and therefore be unable to use his desperation attack.

, Then do another reaction command on him to get out of his berserker mode.

You'll need to synthesize five each of Lucid Gem, Power Gem, Thunder Gem, and three each of Myster Go,o and Gale. You can do this in Moogle's Item Workshop, kupo.


If you don’t have Ultima Weapon, Decisive Pumpkin is also a good choice since it has the combo boost ability, which increases the damage of your attack with every hit you land on an opponent (combo).;
, Full Bloom+ is an upgrade of Full Bloom. This raises your strength by 3 points and has the ability MP Haste, which, like MP Hastega, increases the speed of your MP recovery.


Full Bloom does not have MP Haste; it must be Full Bloom+. Full Bloom+ can be acquired by upgrading a Full Bloom through item synthesis.

, This can be obtained by completing the Twilight puzzle. Highest Ribbon raises all of your resistances by 25%, including physical damage.

, Sora usually starts equipped with Ribbon.


This item increases all your resistances, including physical attack resistance.
You can also synthesize Ribbon using 5 Blaze Gems, 5 Frost Gems, 5 Thunder Gems, 5 Bright Gems, and 3 Gales.
Ribbon synthesis can only be done after the fourth list is unlocked.

, This is in case you run out of MP at a bad time. One way to gather Ethers is at Moogle's Item Workshop. There you'll have to synthesize three each of Blaze Gem, Frost Gem, Thunder Gem, five of Bright Shard, and one Bright Crystal.

, This is to avoid and deal damage to Marluxia.

, This is to heal yourself in case things go from bad to worse.

, During the beginning of the battle, Marluxia will cast Death on Sora. A counter will appear above Sora’s head, and every time Sora gets hit by Marluxia’s scythe the counter will decrease by 1.


The spell is unavoidable, but if you avoid getting hit by Marluxia’s scythe attacks, the counter will not decrease.
If the counter hits 0, Sora will die.2.

, This is Marluxia’s most basic attack; he’ll slash at Sora a few times.


Block (press □) this attack or use Reflega.
Blocking this attack will cause you to lose the opportunity to increase Sora’s death counter, but it will let you damage Marluxia.
If you avoid this attack, you’ll have a small window of opportunity to attack him with a reaction command that can either stun Marluxia or give Sora some numbers back if your death count is low.

, Marluxia will warp near you and attack you with the scythe, causing Sora to be pushed away or thrown into the air (aerial Warping Slash), then Marluxia will re-warp and attack Sora a few more times.


Don’t try to block this attack; just glide away until Marluxia uses a different attack.

, This attack is troublesome. Marluxia will warp to the center of the arena and plunge his scythe to the ground, causing three large holes to appear around the area.


To avoid it, glide (while in the air, analog + □) around the arena and land on a safe spot. Marluxia will still attack you during this time, so use Reflega.
This attack is strong enough to send Sora’s HP to critical upon stepping on the affected area.

, Marluxia will summon rose thorns to encase your whole party, which deals a lot of damage.


To avoid this, jump and glide around the arena until the spheres explode.

, Marluxia will spin on the ground and follow Sora around, causing damage to Sora and decreasing Sora’s counter.


Run around avoiding Marluxia as much as possible until he’s done spinning.

, Marluxia will possess Sora and float above him; he will then summon small upgraded versions of his Death Hole, which will shoot up from the ground. Eventually he will continue with Warp Slash and a devastating finishing blow.


When he starts floating behind Sora, quickly dodge roll around the arena until he starts moving again.
Use Reflega to block his scythe attacks and keep casting the Reflega until he uses the finishing move
If timed correctly, it will reflect back all the damage and leave Marluxia open for a combo attack.

, Marluxia will stumble back, and you’ll be able to land a combo on him.

,


Depending on how much damage you caused, he may immediately use Thorn Sphere.

, He will use Warping Slash while you’re in the air; but don’t worry, as long as you don’t stop moving, he won’t be able to hit you.

, He’ll start to use Death Holes coupled with Thorn Spheres, and on top of those, he will also attack you; keep gliding around to avoid these attacks.


You can also stay in one spot and repeatedly cast Reflega; however, this is double-edged as he might use his scythe to pull you closer and directly on top of the Death Holes.

, Do this if you’re having a hard time dealing damage to him, although he’s easy enough to beat without these forms.


Invincibility from Limit Form and the Strength Boost from Final Form can be helpful.

, Quick roll around the area for about 5 counts, then spam Reflega to avoid his finishing move.


Marluxia will do Reaper’s Possession when his HP falls to 1/4th.

, Running around may cause you to lose sight of Marluxia and get attacked because of it.


You can also double jump then glide; if you’re high enough, he won’t be able to reach you.

, Marluxia will re-use Reaper’s Possession when he only has 1 HP left. Avoid it the same way as step 6 and land your finishing blow on him.

, Then jump and press □, but don't use the analog stick. This will cause Sora to glide in place and use absolute guard.

, All the magic attacks directed at you will be deflected by Sora's keyblades.


Remember to adjust your position if the mushroom gets behind you; Sora's keyblades will only protect attacks from the front, so your side and back are wide open.

, Absolute guard won't be able to block this due to it being a multi-direction attack. Reflega will be able to block it and send all of it back to the mushroom.

, It will cause you to fall when you use it.


Remember to face the mushroom, or the keyblades won't be able to protect you.

Hit the O in order to win; winning will lower Luxord’s time bar and give you a lot of HP bubbles
If you lose, Sora will turn into a die or a card.

, Luxord will turn into a card and mix in with other cards; you must choose which card Luxord is.


When done correctly, Luxord will be momentarily open for a combo. He'll then turn into a card for 2 more turns, each time increasing the number of dummy cards he mixes in with.
Dummy cards can either be a blank, a bomb, or a Stop spell.
Hitting the Stop spell will momentarily let you damage Luxord in his card version.

Luxord will attack you with cards, then he'll ultimately use a variation of his ""A challenge, is it?"" attack, but this time, you'll have to fill each attack panel with either Xs or Os.
When the screen goes dark, immediately double jump then glide (press ? while in the air) around the arena in a circular motion.

, Make sure you're already good at doing his mini games. You can either practice on his gambler nobodies or just practice on the boss battle itself.

, Immediately glide (while in the air, press ?) away to avoid getting hit by his counterattack. At this point Luxord will send some cards after you.

, These duels will be your main damage dealer until he uses his second challenge.

, You can either target Luxord or target the clock card.


Destroying the clock card will cause the surrounding cards to stop moving, including Luxord's card, and will let you damage Luxord in his card form.

, After successfully picking him out, he'll be momentarily stunned, giving you a chance to land a combo on him until turns back into a card.

, After going around the arena, he'll pull you closer and force you to play a card game. This move is not only unavoidable, it's also necessary in order for you to beat Luxord.


You must arrange the symbols on your attack panel to either all Xs or all Os; there's no easy way to do this.
With each symbol you match up, the attack panel will move faster.

This can be dodged by either using Reflega or Dodge Roll (analog + □) 3 times, with a pause in between.
Dodge Roll out of the way to avoid it.

, Lexaeus will run toward Sora and throw him into a pillar, then throw his tomahawk at him.


This is very hard to avoid. The visual cue for this is similar to most attacks, and it can only be blocked by Reflega. Luckily he'll only use this when his aura is around 50,000 plus.

, Lexaeus will leave the arena and smash down on Sora. He will then summon large rocks from below the earth, which covers the entire area.


Spam Reflega as he's about to come down; you should get away unscathed.

, You'll have a small window frame to do this while Lexaeus power charges. Donald or Goofy might attack him if you don't do it fast enough, and his damage will increase substantially.

, He might attack you with shattering earth. To avoid it, dodge roll as soon as he throws his tomahawk in the air, then dodge roll again after the first rock appears. Pause for a moment before dodge rolling for the 3rd time.


Don't dodge roll too far from Lexaeus as you'll want to be near him at all times to avoid his power charge.

, This is the attack that you're waiting for. Make sure that you're standing close to him when you block so the Reaction Command (∆) will activate.

, After the finisher, wait for Lexaeus to land on the ground and do another combo, but don't use the finisher or he'll retaliate and power up.

, If you do this correctly, it will prevent Lexaeus from ever powering up and using stronger attacks.

, However, if you see Lexaeus turning around near Sora, immediately spam Reflega. Lexaeus will grapple Sora, and it is impossible to guard against this. Only Reflega can protect you against it.

, This means that Lexaeus will use his desperation attack. Wait for him to start coming down, then spam Reflega until your whole screen is taken over by rocks.

Keep moving around the center of the arena and continuously mash on ∆ until the Reaction command triggers.,
Continue blocking and landing combos on Axel.,
Repeat steps 2 to 4 until Axel dies.",How to Beat Axel (Data Battle) in Kingdom Hearts II," This is the best keyblade to use due to its Combo boost ability, which increases the damage of Sora's attacks whenever you hit an opponent.


You can get the Decisive Pumpkin if you defeat the Experiment in Halloween Town.;
, This gives +3 on Sora's strength and is great for increasing damage.


Full Bloom+ is an upgrade of Full Bloom. You can synthesize these items.

, This accessory gives strength boost and is useful in cleaving off a lot of Axel's HP.


You can synthesize Titan Chain.

, These are an alternative for Titan Chain for those who're confident with their damage output. Ribbons will help reduce fire damage and physical damage.


Sora usually starts with a Ribbon. You can synthesize High Ribbon.

, Axel throws his chakrams at Sora; this can easily be blocked with Guard (□).

, Axel will disappear behind the fiery barricade, then charge at Sora with a physical attack. This attack also leads to a Reaction command (∆).

, Although technically it's a stage element, both the floor and walls will damage Sora if he gets too close (wall) or constantly stands on the floor.


Although Axel has more attacks, you only have to watch for the three listed above.

, Axel will immediately attack you with his chakram; after you've deflected his attack, he'll be knocked back and left open for a combo.

, It won't last long as he'll break your combo not long after. He'll then hide behind the fiery barricade that he created.

, Successfully delivering a Reaction command will eliminate the flames from the floor and also open Axel for more combos.

, He'll occasionally restart the flames on the floor. If he does, just keep on running around in circles until the Reaction command appears.

, This boss battle is short and easy, probably because the first battle with Axel is during the prologue.

Keep blocking and attacking Larxene’s attacks.",How to Beat Larxene (Data Battle) in Kingdom Hearts II," Decisive Pumpkin is recommended as you’ll want to deal more damage at a faster rate against Larxene


If you are having a hard time blocking her attacks, switch to Uptamia Weapon for MP Hastega.
Passive skill: Combo boost - the longer your combo, the higher the damage each strike will do.;
, This equipment is very helpful in battles that require you to spam Reflega.


Passive skill: MP Haste - this skill makes your MP recover faster.

, You’ll need this to lessen the damage you receive from Larxene’s physical attacks.


Provides 25% damage reduction for all elements including physical attack.

, This item is very important! It’ll help make the battle a whole lot easier.


Provides 40% Thunder resistance.

, Reflega helps block most of Larxene’s attacks.

, Use this for MP recovery during emergency situations.

, Use this for HP and MP recovery, in case you’re about to get KO'd.

, Larxene becomes shrouded by thunder and summons 4 thunder bolts.


You can stun her by using Reflega; this will give you a chance to land a combo.

, Similar to Thunder, but stunning her will now be by luck.


Use Reflega to stun her during this attack; stunning her will give you a chance to land a combo.
Note, however, that using Reflega may or may not stun her during this attack.

, Larxene sends out a line of lightning, but she will no longer shroud herself in thunder.

, Larxene will dash at you with a clone.


Visual alert for this attack is the darkening of your screen, and Larxene being struck by lightning.

, Larxene dashes toward you, then performs a ground-based combo.


You can block this attack with either Guard (□) or Reflega or Dodge Roll (analog+tap □) away.

, Larxene appears above you and performs an aerial dive.


Block with Reflega or move out of the way with Quick Run (analog+hold □) or Dodge Roll.

, Larxene’s clone splits into two and attacks you from both sides.


Block with Reflega or move out of the way with Quick Run or Dodge Roll.

, This attack will only be used when Larxene has at least 1 clone. Larxene and her clones attack you from all sides, surrounding you in thunder and throwing you into the sky, then dropping you in a giant thunderbolt.

, If Larxene has no clones, she will teleport to the middle of the arena, then summon electric orbs and spins them together, summoning lightning from the sky. She will then create more clones.


Some attacks require a different method of avoiding, depending on the situation, and thus will be listed in the battle guide.

, Larxene will not waste a single moment and will immediately attack you. After casting Reflega, Larxene will be stunned, giving you an opportunity to land a combo.


Remember not to land two finishers on her.

, After landing your first combo, Dodge Roll away from her to avoid her counterattack.


After the first clash, she can either spam you with Thunder, or attack you with clones.

, If she dashes, disappears, or jumps, immediately cast Reflega; and if the screen darkens, get as far away as possible. Getting hit by one of the stray lightning will cause a massive amount of damage.

, Remember to keep your back against a wall to avoid having to look at multiple angles while trying to predict where the clone will attack.

, Occasionally, it will give you an opportunity to use a Reaction command (△), which will eliminate all of Larxene’s clones.

, Larxene will start using new attacks when her HP hits 2/3 of her original HP.

, She’ll also have 2 main attacks: she’ll either cast Thundara or clone herself.

, Remember to Dodge Roll away as soon as the explosion hits her.


During phase II, there is a chance that your reflect will not stun her, and she’ll immediately counterattack.
Don’t avoid her Thundara; she’ll immediately use her Desperation attack, which will be harder to avoid.

, After avoiding four lightning pillars, land beside Larxene and cast Reflega as soon as she tries casting Thundara, then Dodge roll away.


If she gets stunned, Dodge Roll back to her and unleash a combo
If not, then repeat the double jump and glide until she gets stunned.

, If a clone disappears, it will most likely do an aerial attack. Wait a few moments (3–5 counts, depending on how fast you count) before you guard against the attack, then proceed attacking the clone if it’s stunned. You might have to watch for a few things during this part:


If the clone you blocked gets stunned and the other clones are not doing anything, meaning not preparing to attack you, you will most likely get a Reaction command; use it to eliminate Larxene’s clones.
If the clone you blocked gets stunned, but the other clones are preparing to attack you, stop your combo and Dodge Roll away from them.
If the clone you blocked doesn’t get stunned, get away and wait for it to do another aerial attack.

, Occasionally she will summon clones and all of them will disappear instead of only one clone trying to do an aerial attack. When this happens, a synchronized attack will follow. To avoid this go to the middle of the arena and start blocking their attacks.


If a clone gets stunned, attack it and watch the other clones until they stop their synchronization.

, Wait for a clone to try an aerial attack on you, then repeat step 4.


Keep doing this until Larxene moves on to her third and final phase; this happens when she only has 5–6 bars left.

, This time around, Larxene cannot be stunned while using Thundaga. She will also use another type of Thundaga, but this one will not have any visual representation, no aura - nothing - and this one comes out faster than the other Thunder magic Larxene uses.


Spam Reflega to avoid this spell.

, This is an indicator that she’ll use her Desperation attack; just keep gliding until she finishes and all the lightning orbs are gone.


Afterward, quickly face Larxene and block.
There’s a small time frame in between being able to block this attack and getting hit, so be careful.

, If she starts doing aerial attacks, block twice using Guard. If she does a ground combo, use Guard thrice.


When blocked correctly, you’ll be given a chance to do a Reaction command and eliminate Larxene’s clones.

, She’ll go back to spamming Thundaga attacks after she loses her clones; just keep blocking or dodging her until you find another chance to attack.


Keep attacking her until she dies.

Get the Return of the Downtrodden ending.",How to Get the Good Endings in Chrono Cross," You will get this ending by playing a regular New Game and defeating the Time Devourer without using the Chrono Cross.


After the battle, this will simply roll the credits after the Devourer is absorbed into a portal above the Darkness Beyond Time, thus ending the game without any special scene.;
, Opposite to the first one, you will get this ending if you used the Chrono Cross to defeat the Time Devourer.


Schala will break free and quote a long speech concerning the struggle of evolving organisms.
She will then tell your character that she will find him someday; after that, you find yourself awake on Opassa Beach, where your character seemingly loses his memory.

, If you have defeated the Time Devourer before Serge crosses the dimensions, this ending will commence. All the major developers populate Viper Mano, and hilarious exchanges and notes about the game are provided to you.


Regardless of rumors, there is no special key item to be had here, and neither can Kid be ushered to pickpocket a man in one of the rooms.
Kid still changes uniforms to her orphanage outfit under certain conditions.

, This ending is available after you cross the dimensions, but make sure you didn't break into the Viper Manor, and then defeat the Time Devourer. The ending will then commence.


Serge, your character, has become a fisherman in Arni while Kid loses her patience waiting for him. She breaks into Viper Manor alone, takes down Lynx, and receives the Frozen Flame, which is actually the dragon tear in this scenario.
Kid then wishes herself Lord of El Nido and creates the Acacia Empire by vowing to conquer the Kingdom of Guardian and then Porre.

, To get this ending, defeat the Time Devourer after Kid is poisoned and you wake up in Guldove. When Korcha drops you off in Termina, go straight to Opassa Beach and use the Time Egg.


The ending shows Serge working in Termina at Lisa's Element shop, and a biting exchange takes place between Lisa and Leena.
Later, Kid is seen working in Viper Manor as a spy with Norris, who gave her the Hydra Humour.
Afterwards, Solt, Peppor, and Pierre are seen surmounting Fort Dragonia, the latter member of the group afflicted with stomach problems. Before they enter the sanctum, they begin a game of rock, paper, scissors in order to see who goes in first. Pierre loses and complains for a rematch. The game then reveals that they were never heard from again.

, To have this ending, defeat the Time Devourer after Kid's been cured and before you enter Fort Dragonia.


The True Hero is the forming ending, saving Kid in good health; the Korcha marriage dialogue will occur.
Instead of Kid working in Viper Manor, she enters Lisa's Element shop after Leena is insulted for not qualifying for a beauty pageant in Termina.
Korcha enters the shop and attempts to reforge his wedding vows with Kid, but ends up proposing to Macha, who enters as Kid leaves.

, This ending occurs if the Time Devourer is beaten after Serge receives Lynx's body.


In the ending, Lynx now lives in Marbule with Harle and the villagers adore him; the Sage of Marbule then asks him to take his position in a few days.
The ending cuts to Radius, Zappa, and Fargo in the Pearly Gates. They confront Lynx and vow to make him pay for his crimes, but Kid appears and promises that they won't have the chance.

, Before going to Hermit's Hideaway, defeat the Time Devourer right after rescuing Riddel to have this ending.


The Acacia Dragoons are all assembled in Viper Manor, and Viper decrees that they will fight Lynx's army. The Dragoons eventually cornered Lynx, but he nevertheless taunts them with pride.
The scene then cuts to Lynx and Harle, who are still living in Marbule; Kid accosts them at their house, and Harle prepares to fight her.

, This ending will be available after Harle leaves the party. Have Lynx and Kid enter Chronopolis. Lynx proceeds to the Frozen Flame while Kid stays behind to deal with Harle, who is trying to stop the duo.


The scene cuts to Arni, where an old man is consulting the Records of Fate. It turns black, and the old man rushes out to get the chief. The scene returns to Lynx after that, who muses that he can now finally become FATE.

, You can get this ending if you defeat the Time Devourer after Dario is fought but before the Terra Tower rises.


The ending scene occurs in the Viper Manor; the kids of the orphanage stands before the General Viper, who instructs them to work hard and play hard.
An Acacia Dragoon talks to Dario and suggests a Dragoon youth camp; the two laugh as they formulate a plan to provide funding.
Lynx, Harle, and Kid appears as well, arriving in Termina. They enter the Dragon's Tail bar, which is now staffed by the Devas and Lucia. They ordered drinks.

, This is available when you defeat the Time Devourer while the Terra Tower is still in the sky.


In the ending, the Sage of Marbule, the Dwarf Chieftain, and the Dragon God meet at the top of Sky Dragon Isle. The Dragon God instructs them to begin wiping out humanity in El Nido with their respective forces. The Dwarf is eager while the Sage questions this course of action. Nonetheless, it is carried out and demi-humans now populate the islands.
Harle walks around Arni, overhearing conversations concerning how filthy the humans were, and then she picks flowers and lays them on a grave at Cape Howl, Serge's gave to be exact.

Head to the second floor of Midwich Elementary.,
Enter the music room.,

Examine the piece of paper.,
Head over to the piano and examine it.,
Remember that the title of our clue is ""A Tale of Birds without a Voice."",
Play D, or the 2nd white key on piano.,
Play A, or 6th white key on the piano.,
Play Bb, or the 5th black note on the piano.,
Play G, or the 5th white note on the piano.The fourth stanza states that the swan ""sits"" next to another bird, we also know that a swan is white, hence it will be another white key.,
Play C#, or the 1st black key.",How to Solve the Piano Puzzle in Silent Hill,";
, This room is near the toilets and on the same corridor as the locker room.


You should be able to easily find it with Harry's map.

, You'll see a large piece of bloodstained white paper taped on the board.

, You'll be given a clue entitled ""A Tale of Birds without a Voice.""

, You'll immediately notice that you're only allowed to press keys on one octave, and when you try to press the other keys, some don't produce a sound.

, Meaning, for this puzzle we will only be pressing notes on the piano that does not make a sound or are mute.

, The first stanza on the clue states that the Pelican is eager for it's reward—meaning, it didn't fly very far—as well as a mention of white wings, a clue that pertains to the the pelican being white. Therefore, the 1st note you should press is the closest white note that does not have a sound, which is D.

, The second stanza states that the second bird, a dove, flew as far as it can; however, the 7th note produces a sound, and since a dove is white, we will automatically find the farthest white note without a sound, which is A.

, The third stanza states that 3rd bird, a raven, flew higher than the dove. We already know that a raven is black and that the dove already landed on the last mute white key, hence the raven will be the farthest (last) black key.

, At this point, there's only one mute white key that is beside another mute key — it's the 5th key beside the 6th key (dove).

, The fifth stanza states that the last bird, a crow, ""quickly"" stops. We know that a crow is black, and a ""quick"" stop means that it didn't fly far, much like the pelican; hence the key is the 1st black key as it is the nearest mute key to the left.

Paul is one of the most powerful characters in Tekken, but also one of the slowest. Timing is everything with this character. He is also one of the few characters that can counter-attack, making it easy to turn an attack back towards the attacker if you get your timing right.
To win almost any match with Paul, start of with one of the power-attacks that sends your opponents flying. Then start a rush towards him/her and stamp your opponent. If he/she manage to either roll away or get up before you get to him/her, do a low attack which gives you another try to either run over him/her, tackle him/her, or do another power-attack. If you manage to knock your opponent up into the air, continue to hit him/her in the air while he/she is defenseless for as long as possible. It's possible to juggle your opponent for at least 4 hits. Find a basic range of combos and moves, practice timing with different characters and try to keep your opponent as far away from you as possible. With proper timing it's easy to decide when to attack your opponent instead of letting him/her decide when to strike you.

Slide the blade into the palm portion of the controller below all the buttons and cut through the screws (1 on each palm). Do this over a non-slip surface and be careful.
, Once you have the top and bottom separated on the palms, pull them apart and snap the back of the controller. You may have to do it one side at a time, breaking the middle of the controller too. That's fine., Rip out the battery first, then left (L) and right (R) buttons if you can, and the vibrators. Dispose of these and the pieces of the shell you have taken off already. Recycle the battery next time you go to a store that recycles them, such as Best Buy––don't throw it in the trash if you have battery recycling in your area., Pull the circuit board apart. It should break apart in the center so you'll have to pull from each side. The analog sticks will fall out here. Once the board is off you should be able to remove the L&R buttons if you couldn't get them before. Be careful when you remove the rubber backing to the buttons as they aren't secured to anything now. They will fall out and the PS button is easy to lose., Set aside anything you want to use and discard any bits of mangled controller that you don't need anymore. Here's where the real work starts., The buttons have little plastic wings to keep them in place. These get in the way. Use pliers to peel them off.

, (Before drilling you may choose to hollow the buttons.) Use the hand drill to make a hole for the cord. The buttons are angled so be careful of your drilling directions. It's easy to drill at a weird angle on these. Try to find a hand drill with a small enough bit. The smallest bit big enough for your cord is best.

, Use the ""fine"", or more rough side of your sanding sponge to grind the buttons down to a reasonable height. Again, keep in mind the odd angle. If you want the buttons to sit flat, you'll have to sand one side more than the other for a bit to flatten it out. Use the ""very fine"" side of the sponge to smooth the edges of the buttons so that they don't cut your wrist up. And, you're going to create a bunch of colored plastic dust, so be sure to have newspaper down or use an easy-wipe surface to work on, as shown here.

, Cut off about 18 inches (45cm) of bracelet wire. In this tutorial, we tied a small knot at one end to keep the buttons from falling off. You're going be cutting the ends off later, so feel free to knot up all you want., Slide the buttons on in the order and direction you'd like. Leave some room between each button. Depending on your wrist size, you can tie a tiny, basic knot to keep the buttons from all grouping up in one place. If you really feel like measuring, you can tie a tiny knot on each side of every button so they don't slide around at all. This will give the best look, but it's a pain to do., The type of wire used is not good for adjusting, so you will have to either leave it loose enough to put on and take off, or tie it up and leave it on. The best way to knot these is to make two hooks out of the wire, hook them around each other, and twist the ends up like twist ties. This holds well, but make sure you have one of those ""tiny basic knots"" on the ends for when you take it off or if it falls off, so that the buttons don't scatter. Cut off the ends of the wire and you have yourself a new geeky gamer bracelet!

Click Install.",How to Use a PS3 Controller on a PC," To do so, press the stylized ""PS"" button in the middle of your controller.

If your PS3 controller is paired with your PS3, first unplug the PS3 from its power source.;
, Plug the narrow end of the controller's USB charging cable into the controller and the large end of the USB cable into one of your computer's USB ports.

USB port locations vary depending on the type of computer you're using. If you can't locate the USB ports, check the sides or the back of your computer's CPU (desktop) or the back of the casing (laptop).
If you're connecting your controller via wireless dongle, you may need to first install the dongle's drivers. Make sure you follow the on-screen prompts to do so after plugging in the dongle.

, SCP Toolkit provides a PC-friendly interface to which your PS3 controller can connect, which will in turn allow you to use your PS3 controller with PC game services like Steam., It's the first link beneath the ""Downloads"" heading on this page. Doing so will prompt the toolkit to download to your PC's default downloads folder (e.g., the desktop).

Make sure you're downloading the most recent version of the software. If you're on an out-of-date version's page, you won't see the green ""Latest Release"" sticker on the left side of the page.

, Its icon resembles a black PS3 controller., In most cases, this process will entail clicking Install after reading through the terms of use. You may need to install several components of the toolkit separately of one another, so you may have to click Install multiple times.

If the toolkit mentions that you're missing ""prerequisites"" needed to run the program, click Next until the prerequisites begin installing. Otherwise, just click Finish on the first window.
You may need to click Yes on a pop-up window asking whether or not your computer can trust the setup file.

, It's in the file in which you installed SCP Toolkit., This option is on the left side of the driver installer window. Since you're installing a PS3 controller (e.g., a DualShock 3 controller), you don't want to install PS4 drivers.

Also uncheck the box next to ""Bluetooth"" if your controllers are wired (e.g., you aren't using a dongle).
A good rule of thumb here is to uncheck a box next to anything you aren't using.
If you're using Windows Vista, you'll need to check the box next to ""Force Driver Installation"" in the middle-left side of the window.

, This option is on the right side of the window. You'll select your controller from here., You'll see a list of all devices attached to your computer (e.g., keyboards, mouses, webcams, etc.). Your PS3 controller is the option marked ""Wireless Controller (Interface )"" where the number pertains to the USB port to which the controller is attached.

If you're using a non-wired controller, you'll need to select the USB device you're using to facilitate the connection under the ""Bluetooth"" section above the ""DualShock 3 Controllers"" drop-down box.

, It's on the right side of the driver installer window. Doing so will prompt SCP Toolkit to begin installing your controller's drivers, which should take less than five minutes on any compatible PC.

Once the installation is complete, you'll hear a confirmation noise.
At this point, your controller's drivers have been installed and you are ready to begin using your controller with PC games.

Get the high ground. Even if they're on the rooftops go up there. Why? If they're on the rooftops you will find more hard to hit them as rooftops are crammed with cover. If on an opposite rooftop they can't come over to get you which means you have the advantage. If they are on the ground it's a perfect opportunity to use thunderclap.
Take a minute to watch them. make sure to concentrate on any rocket launchers, riot shields etc. Consider sneaking up on them as well. A cool beginners trick is to sneak up on enemies which are perched on the edge of a rooftop and blow them off it with an alpha blast: instant kill.;
, These guys have the most variation, coming in many different types.


Swamp monsters: Don't bother using your powers. Unless you're a higher level character it doesn't have much effect. These guys weakness is the amp(your main melee weapon). When battling these guys take a moment to check out the awesome melee cut scenes that you can get.
Gasbags: The suicides of the monster world. These guys storm around the place trying to give people a cuddle, aah...(IE get close to you and blow you up). The best bet with these guys is to get up on a rooftop and chuck grenades at them.
Ravagers: The next step up. These guys can burrow underground and spray poison. There weakness however is grenade. Wait until it pops up before showering it with grenades. Use the time its underground to restock on electricity.

, These guys are exactly the same as ravagers except they can summon spikers. Spikers are midget assassins who are summoned in swarms. They spray poison and are easy to defeat but in large groups can take you down quickly. Your best bet with these guys is to get on a roof and toss grenades at the hive lord while killing any spikers that jump onto the roof. Once the hive lord is dead kill the spikers.

, These guys are armored, massive and deadly. If they catch you with their tongue and you're low on health, expect to die. Your best bet with these guys these guys is to stay the hell away from them. Tossing cars at them will do some major damage but DO NOT under any circumstances let it get close to you. If it sits on you its an instant kill.

Rinse and repeat.",How to Soul Farm in Demon's Souls," The reaper(s) can be easy to kill, but it's powerful and can be tricky the first few times. Level up a couple times with dexterity and strength and get a good upgraded weapon.;
, Put on the best equipment you have for the fight.

The best weapon. A leveled up long sword works really well, but just about any will do.
A piece of lightweight armor. You need to be able to move fast though, so make sure you can still roll. You will not need a shield.
Ring of magical dullness is a good item for this run.

, (Note: You must beat the first required boss in Shrine of Storms to unlock this. Abjudicator pictured above. )

, Run down the stairs, jump off the ledge, turn around, and run into the area. Grave Robber Blige will be waiting in the tunnels if you wish to buy anything.

There are a lot of storm beasts flying around outside. They go for about 1,000 per beast. It might be worthwhile to stand at the edge and shoot them down before/after. Be careful as they shoot those pesky spears at you. Wearing something to keep from being noticed IE: thief's ring can help out.

, Run through the right or left bridge. Ignore the iridescent mantas, they are unimportant, and will keep respawning so long as their master is alive., Once you get near the shrine, jump down near the reaper., As soon as you hit the ground start mashing the roll button. The Reaper will fire off a death ray that will typically always kill you in one hit, if it hits you. Round around one side of the shrine. The reaper is the guy in black robes holding a scythe; you can't miss him. (The ring of magical dullness will help you out a lot by decreasing the damage. Increasing the chances of surviving a death ray. Either way it will take a huge chunk of HP off though.)

Alternatively. If you can aim it well enough, rolling into the reaper will damage and stun him, but only a little.

, As soon as you come up start swinging the weapon for all you're worth. With a good weapon it should typically take 4-5 hits. Don't stop until it's dead. (He will typically not hit you with a spell if you're close enough, but his melee attack is just as if not as devastating.), Once the reaper is dead all of his minions will fade away as well, but they can still hit you for a couple seconds after. If they kill you (they typically can't unless you're at low health but better safe than sorry) you will not earn the souls., One reaper is worth 4,000+ souls a piece. (Without anything special.) Don't forget to check his corpse however, as he drops Darkmoon stone and sometimes even a war Scythe., Reload the level and do it again. Once you get the hang of it you can earn 10,000 souls easily in just two runs.

If you don't wish to go all the way to the archstone; there are two ledges you can jump off of. One near where you came in, and one on the opposite side of the reaper's shrine. The area where you came in is safer though, so you can touch your bloodstain without fear of getting attacked, and losing all the souls.

, Attach your new drive to the enclosure with the same screws you just removed.


The PS4 will support any SATAII drive of no greater thickness than 9.5mm with at least a 160GB capacity. However, it makes the most sense to replace the drive with one that is larger and/or faster than the factory drive.

, Insert the large, rounded Phillips head screw from step 2 into the aligned holes and screw it in tightly.

If you don't have a backwards compatible PS3, the only way to play PS2 games on it without jailbreaking is by purchasing and downloading the games available on the PlayStation Store.
You can jailbreak a PS3 to play PS2 games. Doing so will void your warranty and can get you banned from the PlayStation Network.;
, All backwards compatible PS3s are ""fat,"" but not all fat PS3s are backwards compatible. If you have a fat PS3, check the number of USB ports on the front of the PS3. If the PS3 has four USB ports, it is backwards compatible. If it has two USB ports, it cannot play PS2 discs., Find the sticker on the back of your PS3.

Open the Settings menu in the XMB and select ""Game Settings.""
Choose your Upscaler settings. This will affect how the image is zoomed or stretched to fit your screen. ""Off"" will display the game in its original resolution, which may result in black bars. ""Normal"" will increase the resolution to match your screen size. ""Full"" will stretch the image to fit your display. Choose ""Off"" if the game doesn't look good when upscaled.

If you haven't purchased or received the game already, buy it.,
Place the inFAMOUS 2 disc in the PlayStation 3, hook up a controller if you haven't already, and select ""inFAMOUS 2"" under the game menu.

,
Wait for the game to load - the Sucker Punch introduction cannot be skipped.

,
Choose to start a new game if you haven't already.

,
Listen to the opening in-game cinematic, more popularly called a cutscene.,
Beat the first mission, in which you have to defeat The Beast.,
Continue beating missions and watching cutscenes to get a feel for the game.,
Once you have a feel for the main story, try completing side missions.,
Collect Blast Shards once you've reached the point in the game in which Wolfe's lab explodes.,
Collect Dead Drops once you're reached the point in the game in which Kuo instructs you to collect the first one.,
If you have access to the PlayStation Network and have reached a certain point in the game, give User-Generated Content a try.,
Just have fun with it.,
Pick a karma - you can choose to be heroic or infamous.,
Once you are familiar with the game, or have beaten it already, try starting a new game.",How to Play inFAMOUS 2," Most video game stores and shops carry this game; it isn't that hard to find.;
,,,, It provides details on the background of the game, such as how the main character got his powers and what he did to get this far.


There will be several more cutscenes throughout the game. These are used to progress the story and make more game information known to you.
Additionally, there may be prompts on your screen that either display a text version of the commentary, give you an objective, or inform you of how to perform a certain action. Pay close attention to these as well.
If you still can't get a feel for the gameplay even by paying attention, give your start menu a visit. You can check the controls there, and adjust the options to better suit your gaming style. New players may want to visit the options to make sure the difficulty is set to Easy.

, The prompts on your screen will tell you how to do certain things (such as shooting lightning out of your hands, jumping, moving, and using the camera), but you will need to use your knowledge of other video games as common sense.


For instance, avoiding physical contact with The Beast or his attacks is a smart strategy. Relentlessly firing lightning bolts at him is also a decent means of progressing the mission.
Once you have defeated The Beast, you will arrive in a town called New Marais. This is where the game takes place.

, You will unlock new powers (which you have to keep track of) as you get closer to the end.

, While the markers for story missions appear as white exclamation points, the markers for side missions appear as yellow exclamation points. Side missions can be useful for unlocking powers and increasing abilities (such as your electric drain). They also give you a lot of experience points, and can prevent enemies from spawning in certain points of the city.

, They can increase your energy storage, allowing you to perform more electrical attacks before going dry. They can also give you experience points, so try to collect the 305 Blast Shards hidden throughout New Marais.

, They provide background information and offer ten times as many experience points as Blast Shards (though there are only 19 Dead Drops).

, You can play missions other players have created, or you can try to create your own.


It is preferable to play missions others have created before you create your own missions.
If you are planning on making your own mission, a basic knowledge of game design might come in handy. You need to have objects, obviously, but you also need to use things called Logic Boxes to dictate how the objects behave. It is impossible to win or lose a mission without logic boxes, and you can even use them to choose the music, civilian density, or time of day in the mission.

, Shoot lightning at random objects and test out your powers whenever possible. Seek out hostiles and attempt to eliminate them as fast as possible.

, Both sides have their advantages.

, You can do this in your start menu under saved games - be sure to save first!

, Each character is difficult in their own way. It will not be an easy fight, especially if you're new to the game. Gather your best shield, weapon, armor, long range weapon, spells, rings, and more. ], Equip the strongest long-range weapon you have. When you're as far away as possible hit them with multiple blasts, and begin backing away more. It will usually take anywhere from 3 or more hits for them to come after you.


Alternatively if you don't have a long range weapon. Walk up to them, and hit them with your weapon as many times as you can, and begin backing away.
Make sure to have a shield or use the roll/parry feature or you will die fairly quickly.

, Use your weapons, parry block, spells, etc to overcome them.

, This can be a good strategy if attacking them hasn't killed them. Now that they want to kill, they will follow you when they see you. Begin to walk up the stairs of the Nexus. (Make sure they are following, if they aren't walk closer and then begin moving again.) Once you reach the ledge, stop and get ready; they are close behind.


Hit them. Begin blasting them with attacks until they fall over the ledge. The fall will kill them, but make sure you don't fall as well. It won't make much of a difference but you will die.

, If a computer isn’t plugged in to your router yet, then make sure that you have one connected via an ethernet (RJ-45) cable. This is going to be the computer that we’ll use for configuring the router.

, Once your computer (laptop/desktop) is connected, open up your browser and type in http://192.168.1.1 on its address field. Press on the Enter key and it should now ask your for a username and password. The default for most routers is admin for both the username and password.


You can technically use any device that supports modern browsers like Firefox, Chrome, or even Internet Explorer/Edge (the latest versions) for this step.
The default username and password for some routers can be found on the routers themselves. This information is usually found together with the router’s serial number.
192.168.1.1 is the default IP address of most routers. There are routers though that have completely different default IP addresses. Before accessing the router’s setup page, make sure to refer to your router’s documentation.

, For this step, you’ll need to refer to your router manufacturer’s manual to look for your router’s network settings (or something similar) option. You’ll then need to make sure that UPnP (universal plug and play) is enabled from there.

, After enabling your router’s UPnP option, go ahead and look for a tab/option called port forwarding (usually found under the Network Settings or Applications and Gaming tab on your router’s setup page)., Once in this port forwarding tab, you’ll then need to indicate the TCP and UDP ports that have to be forwarded/opened. For the PS4, the TCP and UDP port ranges you’ll want to be opened are 80, 443, 465, 983, 3478-3480, 3658, 5223, 6000-7000, 9293, 10070-10080., Once you’ve forwarded the necessary ports, don’t forget to save the changes and close out your browser., To refresh the network settings on your PS4, turn it off and then back on. This will force the PS4 to reconnect to the router’s reconfigured network.

, After restarting the PS4, go to its dashboard and go to Settings. Scroll down and look for the Network Settings option. You should now see your PS4 IP address settings as well as its NAT Type set to 2 or Moderate.

Unplug all of the cords.,
Set the console on a clean surface.,
Use your compressed air correctly.,
Blast away the dust.,
Wipe the console down with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Clean its home and put it back.",How to Clean a PlayStation 41," First, unplug the power cord from the console so no electricity is running through it while you clean it. Then unhook the controllers from the console. Do the same with anything else that may be plugged into it so you have access to all of the console’s ports., If you need to clean your console, then chances are that wherever you keep it also needs cleaning. Remove the console from there and place it somewhere clean and free of dust. Make the job easier by working on a surface that isn’t going to get your console dirty all over again even while you clean it.







, Before you start blasting your expensive electronic device with compressed air, keep in mind that there’s moisture inside that can. Always hold the can upright, since this lowers the risk of releasing that moisture.Also, hold the nozzle at least five or six inches (13 or 15 cm) away from what you’re aiming at, since holding it closer will be less effective.








Read the directions to your particular brand of compressed air for any additional advice or warnings.

, Start by firing short blasts along the indentation that runs around the middle of your console. Then move on to the ports located on its front and back. Finally, blast away as much dust as you can from the remaining surfaces, plus all of the vents.







, Be sure to use a clean, dry cloth to remove any lingering dust, since a wet one can end up harming your console.Wipe down all sides of the exterior to finish up. As you work on each side, always wipe in one continuous direction away the light sensor so none of it ends up in there. Also avoid wiping dust into any of the ports and ruining your work.







, Set the console aside and dust the area where you keep it. Depending on how much has accumulated and how much ends up in the air as you clean, give any airborne dust time to settle back down and repeat. Then set your console back in place.







"
"
Keep your warranty in mind.,
Remove cords, screws, and bottom half of the console.,
Clean the fan and other components with compressed air.,
Let the interior air-dry.,
Reassemble the console.",How to Clean a PlayStation 42," Since the fan is inside your console, you’ll have to open it up to clean it. Understand that this will void the warranty. Typically, the warranty only lasts one year, but even so, expect a voided warranty to affect its resale value if you intend to sell or trade in your console later on.With that in mind, you will most likely have to clean the fan at some point. This should be done whenever it becomes noticeably louder than it was when you first used it. Ideally, this shouldn't happen until a year has passed. If it happens sooner, the fan should be cleaned despite the loss of warranty, in order to prevent the console from overheating.

, Unplug the console from its power source, as well as other cables so they’re not in the way. Then locate the four screws on the back of the console. At least two of these will be covered with warranty stickers, so peel those off. Then unscrew all of the screws with a T8 or T9 screwdriver and remove the bottom half of the console very carefully.







, Now that the internal components are exposed, use your compressed air very carefully to avoid spraying moisture. Hold the can upright with at least five or since inches (13 to 15 cm) of space between the nozzle and the fan. The fan is the most likely to need cleaning, so start with that. If necessary:








Also spray compressed air anywhere else you see dust, except for the disk drive. Doing so will very likely damage it.

, Don’t risk damaging components by wiping them with a cloth as you would with the exterior. At the same time, play it safe and assume that some moisture escaped your can of compressed air. Let the console sit as is for a half-hour (or longer, if necessary) so it can air-dry, just in case., Don’t worry if you didn’t give any single speck of dust out. Go ahead and put the console back together if you’ve gotten rid of the majority of it. As long as you gave it time to air-dry, it should be safe to plug back in and use again.

"
Remove all cables from the controller.,
Blast compressed air over your controller.,
Wipe it down with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Switch to a damp cloth if needed.",How to Clean a PlayStation 43," As with the console, give yourself access to your charger’s ports for a more thorough clean. Unplug its charger cable. Do the same with your headphones if you have a pair of those plugged in, too., Again, as with the console, start by removing as much dust as you can with your compressed air. Focus on the creases between the controller’s body and each button, pad, and analog stick, as well as any other gaps where dust may find its way into the controller’s interior. Be sure to give the ports for your cables a few short bursts, too.







, Unlike the console, your controller is held in your hands all the time, so you may need to clean more than dust off of it. Still, start off by wiping it down with a dry microfiber cloth. See how well that works on its own before using a damp one.







, If a dry cloth wasn't tough enough to get rid of any stubborn grime, use a wet-wipe or dampen the corner of a clean cloth. First, wring out as much moisture as possible so it isn’t dripping all over the place. Then, as you wipe the controller, be sure to avoid wiping near the charger port and headphone jack so moisture doesn't leak inside. Finally, let the controller dry completely before plugging it back in."

Like working with any other piece of sensitive electronics, ground yourself before working on the innards.


You can use an antistatic wrist strap to keep yourself grounded, or touch a screw on an active light switch.;
, Before you open the case, you will need to remove the hard drive. Luckily, the hard drive on the PS3 is fairly simple to remove. Remove the HDD cover on the left side of the PS3. You will need to unscrew a blue screw that is very easy to strip, so be careful when unscrewing it. Pull the hard drive straight out once you remove the screw.


While you are looking at this side, remove the sticker towards the top of the case to reveal a Torx screw. You will need a Torx screwdriver (star) to remove this screw. In the front, there will be four small star screws. For these, you must have a small hole in the screw to get them out due to the metal sticking out the middle of them.
Removing the sticker will void any warranty you have on your PlayStation.

, Once the Torx screw has been removed, you can slide the top panel off of the PlayStation. This will reveal the top shell which is secured by nine screws around the edge. Some of the screws are identified by arrows printed on the plastic. Remove these screws and set them aside.

, There are two tabs that lock in the shell. These can be found at the back of the unit. Push them in at the same time and gently lift the shell up. Be careful, as the top is connected to the hardware on the bottom with ribbons. These ribbons are very fragile.


Gently disconnect the ribbon cable and set it to the side for now.

, Find the plastic tabs holding the card reader in place. Move the tabs, and you can pull the card reader out of the unit. Carefully detach any ribbons.

, The power supply is the silver or black box next to the Blu-ray drive. Remove the five screws that hold in the power supply. Detach the plugs on both sides of the power supply. Pull the power supply directly out of the unit.

, This is located on the same side of the unit as the power supply. There are four screws and a ribbon connecting the card to the unit.

, There shouldn’t be any screws holding it in at this point, but it will be connected by a plug and a ribbon cable. Disconnect both of these and lift the drive out of the PlayStation.

, This is a tiny board located at the front edge of the PlayStation. It has four screws and a tab that needs to be removed before you can disconnect the board. It is connected with a small ribbon.

, There will be seven screws remaining around the edge of the metal plate. Remove these so that you will be able to pull the motherboard assembly out of the case. Once the screws are removed, remove the entire motherboard and back panel.


Grab the back vents and lift up at an angle with both hands. The assembly is deceptively heavy, and dropping it could easily damage the board.

, On the backside of the motherboard assembly, you will see a large fan. Disconnect the cable, and then remove the three screws holding it in. Pull the fan out so that you can clan all of the dust off of it.This is all the disassembly you need to do in order to clean out the inside.

, Once you’ve got the pieces taken out and everything is accessible, you can start dusting. Use compressed air to blow out dust from hard to reach cracks, and suck it up with a vacuum hose. Make sure to get every nook and cranny, as dust can lead to overheating.


Blow out all of the vents with compressed, and make sure to blow air through the heatsinks on the motherboard assembly.
Clean out the USB plugs, as well as dust each individual component.
Thoroughly clean the large fan so that no traces of dust remain.

, If you are really worried about overheating, you can remove the heatsinks from the motherboard and replace the thermal paste. This is not necessary and only recommended if you can live without the PlayStation, as you have a significant chance of damaging it when removing the heatsinks.

, Once you are finished cleaning up the inside, it’s time to put everything back together. Go back through the steps of this guide in reverse order to make sure that everything gets put back in the right place. Make sure all of the components are properly connected so that everything works when you turn it back on.


Be sure to remember to reinsert the hard drive before turning on the PlayStation, or you won’t be able to use it.

Start by looking at what skills you have from the character sheet.,
Next, take a look at your dropsuit fittings.,
Once you have your dropsuit fittings you want to use, you can go into a match.,
During your battle, stick with your team.,
Dust 514 has a form of ""natural progression"" which simply means as you play more, you will learn more about the controls and get a better understanding of how to counter your enemy's tactics.",How to Get a Good Score in Dust 514," Depending on how you set up your character initially, you may start with different skills. What you want to train into for the future will ultimately be up to you, but just starting out you should train the basics first. Shield management, armor upgrades, weapon upgrades all to level V.;
, You will start off with some basic ""militia"" fits that will always be free to use and will never run out. You can use these to get examples for fits and start to learn how you like to play.

, The two main flavors of battle are Skirmish and Ambush. Ambush maps involve working with a team of ""blues"" to destroy the enemy team of ""reds"" who will be trying to destroy you at the same time. The first team to lose all their clones loses. If the time runs out, the team with the most clones wins. Skirmish maps involve two teams fighting for control of certain objectives that help destroy the enemy Mobile Command Center(MCC). The more objectives you control, the faster the enemy MCC will be damaged. The first team to destroy the enemy MCC wins the match. At the end of the match, based on your performance and the amount of time you were in battle, you will receive both money(ISK) and Skill points(SP) which you can use to buy new dropsuits, fittings, skills, and as you progress, vehicles, equipment and other useful things.

, Going solo will get you killed by enemy groups. Getting killed hurts your score and your wallet so its best to avoid death if possible.

, Over time you will decide what you like to do in Dust and you should train your skills towards that specialty. Your scores will start to go up and you will have more fun too in this truly massive online universe!

Get your PS3 all set up, and plug everything in, except the power cord.,
Examine your power cord, the part that goes into the electrical socket.

,
Notice how there are 3 prongs, 2 flat ones, and a 3rd cylindrical prong on the bottom.

Find some sort of chord extension, that has room for the 2 flat sockets, and not the 3rd.

,
Plug it in, and do not have the third prong connected!

,
Turn on your PS3 with no trouble.

Once its out, you should be able to slide the faceplate (the part saying ""PLAYSTATION 3"" on it) off.,, Now we can see some hardware of the PS3, with the PS3 facing towards you laid down, on the left is the power supply (back) and the WIFI Card (front), on the right is the Blu-Ray drive, take these all of by pulling the wires (looks like tape) out of the sockets, and undoing any screws in the way.

This is another layer of the ps3 taken off, but for now, let's focus on the WIFI Card, this only applies for laptops/notebooks. You can see the card itself and a wire leading to a chip with a black cylinder sticking out.

, Once you've done this open up your laptop/notebook (if you are willing) and find your WIFI card.

There should be another slot for the antennae identical to the one on the WIFI Card in the PS3.

, Now find a way of concealing the small component off the antennae in your computer, if not outside.

As I have a notebook I cut the wire of the antennae, poked it through some holes on the bottom of my computer, re-soldered it back on, then got some casing to keep it in. and just for added comfort for it I took out a USB from the PS3 charger (considering you'll no longer be needing it) and dissected it apart to get the USB itself, snip the wires and hot glue it on.

Reassemble the PS3.",How to Reflow a PlayStation 3," There are some simple necessary tools that you will need:


A Philips head screwdriver
A heat gun (300 °C)
Thermal Paste
T8 Torx screwdriver;
, On the side of the unit you will find a panel with the warranty sticker. Once off you will see it is held in place by a blue screw. Remove this screw.


Use the pull tab on the hard drive to remove it out of the unit by sliding it forward and then pulling straight out.







, At the top of the unit there is a rubber tab covered by another warranty sticker. (Yes, you will be removing the warranty sticker and voiding your warranty. You’ve been warned.) Under this cover should be a screw. Remove this screw and the top will slide off.

, Now with the outer shell removed your unit should look like the image above. Remove the screws from the highlighted areas. Now the top support is free. Be cautious as there is a ribbon cable that connects it to the main unit! Remove this part from back to front and then disconnect the mentioned cable. You can now set this part aside

, Now you should start to see the inner workings of your PS3. On the right hand side of the unit is the Blu-ray player with a wire running to the front center as shown. Unplug this wire and gently lift the player. Underneath the player is a ribbon cable. Gently reach under and disconnect this cable and set the Blu-ray player aside.
, Behind where the Blu-ray player used to be you will find a chip, which must be unscrewed.


This chip has a wire which runs down the center of the assembly and plugs into another chip. Unplug it from this chip and set it aside.







, Above the chip that you just unplugged the wire from is the power supply. A set of wire plugs is just between these components and must be unplugged. After removing the 4 screws that hold the power supply down, lift the component straight up. Pins run up into the power supply and you don’t want to damage them. Now you can unplug the back cables from the power supply and set it aside.

, Unplug the ribbon cable from the chip that was in front of the power supply. Four screws hold this chip to the rest of the unit. Remove them and set the chip aside.

, At the front of the unit where the power button normally is found, is a tiny ribbon cable that arches over the metal plate on the motherboard, which we will soon be removing. Be sure to unplug this cable by flicking the tab (closest to the front) forward and lifting the cable out.

,

On the plate that is connected to the motherboard are arrows pointing to screws. Remove these screws.






Four more screws attach two plates to the motherboard. Remove these screws as well and set the plates aside. Be careful from here on out, as the plate will not be attached to the motherboard directly.






, The motherboard and fan assembly should now freely lift out of what remains of the casing, careful though as these come as 2 separate parts.

, Lift the top plate from the front and it will slip out of the back. Set the top plate aside.

, Unscrew the ground wire from the frame. Now gently pull the back plate away from the main unit and set it aside.


Flip the unit over and you will see a little green battery attached to the bottom plate. Unplug this from the motherboard that is underneath. Opposite the battery is the plug-in for the fan running into the motherboard. Unplug this as well.






The HD bay can be seen jutting out from the bottom of the bottom plate. Unscrew this and set it aside.






The ports for the inputs are attached to the bottom assembly as well. Go ahead and remove those and set them aside. The bottom plate should now lift away from the motherboard and take the fan and heat sinks with it. Set it down with the fans on the top side as you will be working on it shortly.

, You can now see your CPU and GPU (the two big squares in the center of the motherboard) with the old thermal paste on them. Using a paper towel gently rub the paste off of their surface, being careful not to scratch them.

Before:





After:






, Do the same for the heat sinks that make contact with the CPU and GPU that are on the back plate that we set aside.

Before:






After:







, Place the motherboard with the CPU and GPU face up and as level as you can manage. Using the heat gun, apply heat to the CPU and GPU. You want your heat gun to get to roughly 300º C and wave it around 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) off the surface of each component. You are looking to melt the solder inside these components so the point is to get them really hot. DO NOT MOVE THE BOARD now that it is hot. Doing so will ruin your PlayStation past the capability of this repair. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes as it cools and the solder solidifies.

, Apply the thermal paste to the heads of the GPU and CPU. Spread the paste evenly on the surface with some sort of scraper, anything will do. (Note previously we put the paste on and then heated the GPU and CPU. This isn’t good practice, so it's not recommended, but it worked out anyway in this example.)

, That’s it! You’re done. Now all that is left is to do is to follow the assembly steps backwards and test it out. In our trials we were unsuccessful with the first try but the second reflow did the trick. Good luck!"

, Your PSP comes with a charger that plugs into a standard wall outlet. Plug the smaller end of the charger into the small yellow hole on the bottom right of the PSP, and the other end into a wall outlet. The PSP may take several hours to charge.

, Many people have not yet joined PSN due to some reasons. PSN is free to join and is in every PSP on the right of the XMB page (the screen that appears when you turn on your psp)


You will need your parents permission and their email address.

, Just push the Power Switch (Located on the bottom right of the PSP) up until the system starts. If you have a game in, it should start. Otherwise, it will load the main menu. If it's your first time using the PSP, it may ask you for time and date settings, among other things.

, Firmware is the version of the software that makes your PSP tick. Every once in a while, Sony issues a new firmware with better features. There are also these things called homebrew games. These games were made by using flaws in the old firmware that allows unsigned code (a.k.a. the homebrew game code) to be ran. Homebrew games cannot be played on newest version of the firmware. Besides homebrew, old PSP firmwares can also run emulators for other game systems. There is another option as well, which is custom firmware. Custom firmware is the ""hacked"" version of the newer firmware. It allows you to run homebrew games, change the look and feel of your PSP's menu system, run ISOs (aka PSP game images), as well as a few other features. Getting custom firmware onto your PSP can be a dangerous process, as messing up the upgrading process results in a ""bricked"" PSP. Here's where you have to make choice: Do you want to play various cool homebrew games and emulators, do you want to have Flash Player, WMA Playback, Camera, MP4/AVC support, and other features, or do you want all of those options and are confident enough that you can complete it without ruining your PSP? The best version for Homebrew or custom firmware is anything below 2.81. You can downgrade very easily if you're using firmware below 2.8. Although, many games require that you have an up to date firmware. If you have 2.70 firmware, you now have access to flash content (ONLY Flash v6.0) and RSS Audio/Video channels using your internet browser. If you have 2.60, you can enable WMA playback. If you have 3.01, you have the PSP Camera Icon, PS3 Connectivity, AVC/AAC (without renaming them to M4V*****), and many other features. But if you update to latest firmware you have to wait for many months for homebrew to become playable on your PSP. The best way to figure out how to get custom firmware onto your PSP is to check out http://www.psp-hacks.com/ and look into their forums. Updating to custom firmware should not be done lightly, but with some research, is quite easy.

, To do that, go to 'Settings'. Scroll down and click 'Network Settings'. You will see two choices: Ad Hoc mode and Infrastructure Mode. Choose 'Infrastructure Mode'. Create a new connection. You can name it whatever you want, but if you have firmware 2.00 or higher. Choose 'Scan' in WLAN Settings screen. Make sure that your WLAN switch is on. WLAN Switch looks exactly like on-off switch. It is located left where the direction controls are, under the analog stick and above your Memory Stick Duo. So, scan for the networks. If you have a wireless network, PSP should be able to detect it. So, choose your wireless network. If it doesn't display any results, move closer to the access point (modem, antenna, or whatever). If you have WEP password set, choose WEP in WLAN Security setting (usually, PSP does this automatically). If you don't have any security settings, pick 'none'. Address setting should be 'easy'. Connection name can be whatever you want it to be, doesn't matter. Finally, you can press X to save settings. After save is completed, click on 'Test Connection'. Usually, PSP will connect to access point, obtain IP address and display the status of the connection. In some cases, you will receive ""A connection error has occurred. Connection with access point cannot be established"". In this case, your network's firewall might be blocking the PSP. If you don't have a security password, do not turn the firewall off. Just, type in your IP address into your browser. You should get a setup screen, depending on your internet service provider. Different ISPs use different setup menus. Try to find settings, or utilities, or utility settings, or anything that can mean the same thing. After a little while, you will be able to find the exceptions list. Enter PSP's Mac address to allow an exception. To find your PSP's mac address, go to 'Settings', 'System Settings', and click on 'System Information'. It should be in there.

, On 2.71 firmware, this is very easy. You just create a VIDEO folder (video should be in all caps) on your PSP Memory stick (USB cable required), usually it's Drive E:\. Create the folder right on the memory stick and NOT inside of the PSP folder (that's what old firmwares make you do). So, This is what you should see when you click on the VIDEO folder in your status bar: e:\VIDEO . E:\ stands for whatever drive your psp is in. Inside the VIDEO folder, paste your videos. Videos can be in MP4 or AVI format. Filenames do not matter. You can also have a subfolder inside of the VIDEO folder. If you make a folder inside of a subfolder, PSP will ignore it. If you are using firmware that's bellow 3.00, you should create a folder MP_ROOT on your memory stick (again, not in PSP folder, just on memory stick). Inside of MP_ROOT Folder, you will make a 100ANV01 folder. Inside of 100ANV01 folder, you will paste your videos. Videos should be in MP4 format. Here, the filename does matter. You will rename your mp4 file to M4V*****.MP4 where each * stands for a digit.

, If you have firmware 2.80 and above, you can just put a music CD in a drive and rip the songs with windows media player in WMA format. To get music on your PSP, create a MUSIC folder inside of the PSP folder on your memory stick (make a PSP folder if it's not made already). You can create a subfolder for a specific album inside of the MUSIC folder. This is what your album folder look like on the status bar: E:\PSP\MUSIC\Album Name\song.wma . PSP will not recognize a folder inside of a subfolder. You can also get MP3s in the MUSIC folder. In fact, if you have firmware that's older then 2.80, MP3 is your only choice. You can rip MP3s using the Realplayer.

, If you have a firmware 3.00, you can create a PICTURE folder on your memory stick duo, not in PSP folder though. Drag images to that folder. Filetypes are GIF, PNG, BMP, and JPEG/JPG. If you have a firmware that's older then 2.70, Create a PHOTO folder inside the PSP folder and put your JPEG/JPG files in there. Old PSP firmware will not recognize GIF, PNG or BMP files. You can also create subfolder inside of PICTURE folder, but you can't have a folder inside of the subfolder.

, You can open up internet by going to the 'network' and clicking on 'Internet Browser'. You are now connected to World Wide Web. To scroll down/up and left/right, hold Square button and move the analog stick, which is also mouse. If you want page to fit on your PSP screen, click Triangle button and go to display mode in the view menu. You will find three display modes: Normal, Just fit and Smart fit.

New Sequence: = Attack.
Voice: Pon Pon Pata Pon.
Enemies: Three birds and four pigs.
You now have a new button sequence, Pon Pon Pata Pon. This makes your Patapon attack in this case throw spears at the wall. You can practice your Pata Pata Pata Pon instead but they won’t move but you can build a fever up by getting 10 combo points. Anyway attack the wall by doing keep on doing it until you destroyed the way you can build up combos with this one too. Remember to do the next one only after the Patapons have finished singing. After you have destroyed the wall do your victory dance by keep on doing Pon Pon Pata Pon four more times in a row after that move on forward with Pata Pata Pata Pon. when you get near the totem pole you will notice that it has symbols but you can't do anything there at the moment so keep on going. if you see enemies like birds and other things don’t stop to close because less advantage for you. attack and try to kill them if you can, sometimes helps if you're in a fever (10 combo points). you do more damage in a fever. the birds you see do run away easily.
You can get combos by doing Pata Pata Pata Pon, and then doing Pon Pon Pata Pon, it doesn’t have to be the same one each time. The more combo points you have the more damage you do. You can get coins from the sunflowers and enemies if they get destroyed while you’re attacking. Move over the coins to collect them. All the enemies on this level run away and don’t attack so don’t be afraid to attack them. Keep moving forward and attacking to get to the flag pillar and the end of the mission. Mission Complete!
On the mission complete screen you will see the Patapons carrying on carts the beasts you killed back to their home.
Another information screen will pop up.

, Talk to the Patapon with the cloak that is standing next to what looks like a shrine. Click on the shrine and this will take you to a screen with the items you have collected like how many spears you have and how much food you have from the beasts you have killed and lots more. Also how many coins you have is on the top right. Press to go back. Click on the big black pillar when you want to go to the world map and the next mission., You might want to build up a fever to do more damage. The 4 Zigotron behind the wall will move right behind the next wall what is next to another wall. A Patapon with a sword and shield will come out of the bush and join your group. Destroy the next wall will your group (your new Patapon is very strong). While destroying the walls watch out for enemy Zigotron. Just keep on moving right destroying the walls and the enemy and collecting the items as you go. Destroy the small black pillar then the small house. After that your new Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly. Pick the items it drops and go through the end of level flag. Mission Complete!

, When you select it, a menu opens up showing the Patapons you can make, how much you have all together, how much it cost to make a specific Patapon, and what items are need e.g. to make a spear Patapon you need meat, wood, and 80 coins. The circles show how many of each Patapon you already have., You need to press circle in time to make the tree shake and drop an item. If you fail you can try again but you need to give one piece of meat again. when you hear the person go for example Pon Pon Pon when he finishes you press circle, circle, circle and so on. Listen to what the person says, if it says four words you have to press the circle button four times but you have to do it in the same tempo as the singer. Once you done that you will get the items you need (wood).
The sequence is: O/O/O O/O/O O/O/OO O/O/OO O/OO/OO O/OO/OO O/O/O O/O/OO
If you get stuck just talk to the Patapon with a cape.
You have to pass the tree mini-game so if you fail it and don’t have any meat you have to play a previous level to collect some meat. You will know that the level contains meat because it will have a meat symbol on the world map. So play the level with the meat symbol and get some meat by killing beasts and completing the level. In this game it’s good to play over the old levels and a lot of the time is required.
Once you have passed and got a branch, make a spear Patapon, you will notice that it is all orange. Then make sure it’s on your team then play the second square on the world map.

, You will have to fight lots of Zigotron now, there not that hard if you have an axe Patapon because it will go up front and take all the damage while you’re attacking with your spear throwers behind. this is probably be the first time you get a proper fever going and maybe the first time a Patapon dies none did for me though. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy and trying to keep the combos going till you get to the end. Destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!
Remember to upgrade your Patapons with better weapons when you can.

, Destroy the first wall, then take out the tower, watch out for the archers on the tower and the other Zigotron patrolling below it once they're all dead and building destroyed a Patapon archer will appear. for the next bit do the same tactic as before and destroy the wall, tower, house and the next tower if you see a green potion pick it up, it restores your Patapons life. If you get fever going it won’t take long to kill them all. The archer you got fires fire arrows which can set the Zigotron a light this makes them run around and not fight back. After you they're all dead and buildings destroyed, move forward. Destroy the black pillar. When you get near the house the bow Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly pick up the items it drops, destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!
You can now make archers.

, This level might be hard if you’re not prepared because of the tough grim reaper type Zigotron you face, it keeps on attacking you with tornadoes which make your Patapons jump in the air and get hurt. In the middle is a Patapon trapped in a cage; you need to save him too so make sure you don’t kill him by accident. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy, having fever is very helpful and picking up green potions. Your probably won't are able to kill the boss here because it will probably run away from you. Mission complete!
To defeat the boss coming up you will need a lot of Patapons so do the second square, the one with the meat icon a few times to build up a bigger squad and use the best equipment you have available. Also do the tree mini game if you need more wood.

,
Go forward and destroy the pillar. You will get a new drum Chaka and a new sequence Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Does the new sequence a few times, when ready keep moving forward. When the fire breathing dragon comes use Chaka Chaka Pata Pon each time, this makes you defend and attack. Only the Patapons with shields defend. If Patapons die make sure you pick up there helmets and just keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. It isn’t that hard if you got the most Patapons you can get at the moment. I had 11 Patapons, 3 axes, 6 spears and 1 archer.
If any Patapons died, make sure you reborn them when you get back to your village. You do this by going to the heart shaped tree.

, If you go past it, you will start burning and dying very quickly because of the extreme heat of the desert. You will need something to cool it down., I don’t know if it needs to be raining for it to work., Basically the same as the last boss fight but a bit harder. Keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Your Patapons might get eaten so watch out for that. Keep attacking if your entire shields Patapons die then attack using Pon Pon Pata Pon. Keep at it and it should die eventually. The boss dragon drops a rain item.

,
New Sequence: = miracle
Voice: Don DoDon DoDon
Do the rain miracle at the start. You have to be in fever to do it. If you can’t do it, practice a lot. After that move forward to the tower. Destroy the tower then keep moving forward. You will see beasts that you can attack also one will have a blue symbol on it, if you attack that one it will turn into a snail. When you get tot he talking sign destroy the rock in front and get fever. Once the rock in front is destroyed use rain miracle then move forward and destroy the rocks and keep on moving forward. you need to try to keep fever going so you can use the rain miracle straight away or if you move forward really quickly and destroying the rocks as you go you can get out the desert with only doing the rain miracle once but you will lose a lot of Patapons this way so make sure you pick up the helmets they drop. Keep going forward destroy the building at the end and go through the flagpole.

,, They will attack in groups and each group has two zigotrons on horses. This levels isn’t that hard if you use all the things you have learned so far like knowing when to attack and charge or when to hold your ground. When they are near most of the time its best to use the defend command. When they are not near use the attack command. Make sure you try to stay in fever for most of the time because this will help you do more damage. Make sure you pick up the green potions they drop. When you get near the end you will see zigotrons hiding in the bushes. Also near the end lots of them will attack if you are in fever and you use the attack command they will run away and retreat. So you don’t have to kill all of them near the end. Destroy the building then go through the flagpole.,, Do the rain miracle at the start. Move forward and you will see a blue beast, hit it and it will turn into a snail now all you have to do is kill the snail. Make sure you are in fever mode most of the time and keep on attacking. If it gets to far make sure you move forward with it and keep on attacking. When it dies it will drop a hat pick it up and go through the flagpole at the end., You will now have a new mini game.

All you need to do is kill all the zigotron that are hiding in the bushes. The easiest way is to get fever going and keep on attacking. A big zigotron will come and attack in the middle of the battle but is easy to kill. After there all dead the grim reaper zigotron will retreat so all is left to do is go through the flagpole.

After your system software is 6.60 you good install a Custom firmware (CFW).

, The best CFW for the PSP is called ""PRO"", No matter what PSP model you have (1000/2000/3000/e1000 or Go!) All work with the same PRO CFW. This is how to install it:


Download the 6.60 PRO-C fix3 CFW. There is a newer version called C2 but it has a bug which makes PSN games unplayable so it's recommended to stick with PRO-C fix3.
Enter USB mode. Navigate to your PSP's “Settings” menu and select “USB mode.” Connect the PSP to your computer with a USB cable and open it up on your desktop. Be sure your empty memory card is still in the PSP. Navigate to the root file of the memory card.
Copy the firmware. The firmware comes with 3 folders (PRO Update, CPL Flasher, and Fast recover), Copy this 3 folders inside the ""PSP\GAME\"" folder of your Memory Stick.
Leave USB mode. Disconnect your PSP from your computer and exit USB mode by selecting the appropriate option. You can get rid of the files on your computer now, if you want.

, Go to your PSP's menu screen and select the “Game/Memory Stick” option. From there, select the “PRO Update” icon. Press X to launch the firmware.


Imprint the firmware. Once you've installed the homebrew firmware, you'll need to either permanently imprint it or know how to restore it so you can use it to play homebrew games. The method you'll use depends on the model number of your PSP.

For 1000-series and 2000-series models, navigate to the “Game/Memory Stick” menu and select the “CIPL Flasher” icon. Press X once it runs to make your firmware update permanent.
For 3000-series and GO-series models, security countermeasures prevent you from permanently imprinting the firmware. However, you can run the PSP's Fast Recovery utility each time you start your PSP to restore the custom firmware for that section.



, Now that everything is up and running smoothly, an Internet search for “PSP homebrew games” should yield plentiful results. Many of these games are emulated versions of older games for other systems, but there are some custom-designed games available, too.

Download PSP games.,
Transfer games from your computer to your PSP.,
Play the game.",How to Download Free PSP Games3," Video game piracy isn't usually prosecuted as viciously as music or film piracy, but that's no guarantee you won't get into trouble. Your risk is fairly low, but the only way to avoid legal trouble for sure is to buy PSP games on the up and up. When you pirate them instead, you're taking a chance.


In the case of smaller releases, you're probably also hurting the bottom line of the game's developer and/or publisher. Think twice before pirating unusual or original games if you wish developers would release more of them.

, There are two basic ways to find PSP game files and download them to your computer.


Torrent game files. You can learn elsewhere on this site, but in brief, you'll need a program for running torrents, a torrent file of the game you want, and some time to let the program collect a copy of the game from other users. You shouldn't have to pay for the torrent or the program.

Use torrent aggregators to search many libraries of torrent files at once. Select the files that have the most positive reviews attached to them, to ensure that you aren't actually downloading something you don't want.


Download games directly. There are a number of websites on the World Wide Web that offer PSP game downloads for free. Keep clicking through until you find a link to a download (typically offsite at a file hosting service such as uploaded.net or mega.co.nz), and click through to activate it.

Generally speaking, the proper file extension for PSP game files is .iso. Make sure that the file you download either is an ISO file, or contains one (in the case of ZIP and RAR archive files). Never run or download any files with the EXE extension.



, Enter USB mode (as described above) and connect the PSP to your computer. Copy game files from your computer to the PSP memory stick folder to load them onto the system.

, Play your new game by going to the ""Game"" menu and selecting the game that you want to play from your memory card.

, After the scan is complete, a list of available networks will be displayed. Select the one you want to connect to. The signal strength for each network will be displayed in the list. For best performance, you want a signal strength over 50%.

, By default, the connection will be named the same as your SSID. You can change this to be more recognizable, such as ""Home"" or ""Office"".

, If you configured your router in the previous steps, you should select ""WPA-PSK (AES)"". If the access point you are connecting to does not have a password, select ""None"".

, This will automatically configure your PSP to get an IP address from the router. Most users can select ""Easy"" without having to worry. If you want more control over the process, or have a PPPoE connection, select ""Custom"". You will be asked to enter your IP address manually.

, A box with the network's SSID will be displayed. You can make changes, but most users can leave this as it. Press Right to continue.

, You will be shown a list of all of your settings. Make sure everything looks correct, and then press the Right button on the directional pad to continue. Press ""X"" to save your settings.

, After saving your settings, you will be given the option to test the connection. Your PSP will attempt to connect to the internet. In the results screen, check the ""Internet Connection"" entry. If it says ""Successful"", then your connection was properly configured.If you can't connect to the network or get a DNS error, return to Step 2 and change your network security to WEP or turn it off completely. After changing your security settings, you will need to run through the connection setup process again. Turning your network security off completely should be a last-ditch effort to ensure that your PSP actually works, as it leaves your network undefended.

MELEE WEAPONS.,
Greatsword: among the most powerful to choose from, but also the slowest - this is a cutting weapon (you can cut tails of the monster for an extra carve) with a lot of power.,
Longsword: the lighter and thus faster version of the Great sword and, by raw power, just as strong.,
Hammer: The ""top weapon"" in many gamers opinion.,
Hunting Horn: a weapon with limitless possibilities and a very good support weapon which can play music to help comrades or yourself.,
Sword and Shield: the easier weapon to learn and use well, it is the weakest melee weapon in the game but it compensates this by its speed,the ability to do quick combos, its high elemental damage, the ability to guard and to use items while guarding instead of having to sheathe the sword, use item and unsheathe again.

,
Dual Swords: they are the fastest melee weapon in the game, with a little more attack than SnS, they lack the ability to guard but they compensate it with great mobility, and the demonization mode which makes them extremely sharp, stronger and faster and be able to do the demon dance which is a very fast combo.,
Lance: the weapon with the most powerful guard along with gunlance, it does both impact and cutting damage good for doing turtle tactics, by being very precise it makes it easier to hit a boss' weak point, but it lacks mobility though.Also doing the lance's charge ability is a good way to knock down certain monsters but uses a lot of your stamina.

,
Gunlance: it is a lance with an ability which lets you fire shells, the ammo is infinite and has a special attack called ""wyvern fire"" which deals HUGE damage but has a slow reloading time of 2 minutes.,
RANGE WEAPONS.

,
Light bowgun: it's a gun, with high mobility, lacks the ability to guard and the power of the heavy bowgun.,
Heavy bowgun: the same as light bowgun but it lacks mobility, however it has better damage and range you can upgrade it attaching a power barrel so it increases the range the power and accuracy or a shield which lets you guard and compensates a little the lack of mobility.,
Bow: the main disadvantage of bows is that in the beginning game they are extremely weak, however their advantages are good mobility, high elemental damage, infinite arrows and the ability to dodge an enemies attack and still aim quickly and do some damage.,
power coating: increases the raw damage the bow does

,
paralysis coating: it can paralyze the enemies after some shots

,
poison coating: it poisons enemy

,
sleep coating: it puts the enemy to sleep, making the next hits damage x3 also and expert using the bow can dodge ALL the attacks making these the best advantage of the bow, they can do this because they don't have to be close to monster like in melee and they don't need to stop from time to time to reload (however they need to stop sometimes to use a coating)

",How to Choose Your Weapon in Monster Hunter Freedom 2,";
, Great sword can charge attacks and hit with devastating blows, but in online play, it's abilities are handicapped due to their tendency to knock other players around. This can be the most powerful weapon when treated right. Unlike all other weapons, you can still kick with the weapon drawn by pressing Select, very good for hitting allies when they are confused. You can guard using a GS but it is recommended to evade since guarding takes out a big amount of sharpness.

, However, they cannot block or charge. To make up for this they have ""Spirit gauge"". The more you hit something, the more the gauge go up. When the gauge blinks, the weapon power has increased. Sharpness also rises, and it won't bounce off a monster; it can actually be summed up as the longsword's demonisation form, you can also make big combos with the spirit gauge at max but they will drain the spirit gauge. This is also a cutting weapon.

, It is THE strongest weapon via raw damage, due to many powerful weapons exceeding the 1000 mark. Hammers can be charged by the R button, but unlike the greatsword, you can move while charging to get yourself in a good position, and can release it at any time, some times making a swinging motion, which deals multiple attacks against a target but you move uncontrollably. The other one is the golfswing-grandslam, which is very powerful. This is the Superpound. The strongest combo, Triple Pound, is easily done, just press Triangle, Triangle, Triangle. The hammer is an impact weapon, so it can't cut tails, but can crush things easily. by triple pounding certain monsters head/body, they will be dazed and confused, and, in the bullfango's case, go on it's back. However note that you cannot block with the Hammer.

, It has many similarities to the hammer. It is often viewed as a support weapon only, which is wrong. It is a good solo weapon as well.

,, But demonization mode drains your stamina. Also for delivering so many hits in a moment, the DS loses sharpness quite fast.

,, The disadvantage of the gunlance over the lance its that using the shelling ability and wyvern's fire you will lose a high amount of sharpness.

,, The advantage of bowguns over other weapons is that you can change its ammo and that there is a lot of different ammo in the game. Some bowguns have the ability to rapid fire with is firing multiple times in quick succession using a single bullet.you can upgrade it so it has more attack, attach a silencer (only good in multiplayer)a long barrel for increased range and accuracy. However, you can only have one of these in a single bowgun.

, You can only attach one of these to a single bowgun.

, The bow can use coatings which there are only four but can change the tide of a battle, these are

(If you already made a character, go to step 6)Let's start by downloading the right programs.,
When you downloaded (or already) have the game, go to the folder where it's installed (most of the time it's c:\games\icytower13),
Locate the folder characters\template.,

FIRST make a backup of the entire template folder, just to make sure.,
When opened up in paint you can edit freely.,These are the basics, now for the advanced editing.,



 NeoPaint

We use NeoPaint for this.,When downloaded and installed, open your Icy Tower character bitmap with it.,





You will notice the color blocks on the left, this is the palette.,
The colors of the blocks are the 16 rainbow colors on the right.,
Once opened up, you will get a window with same sliders and the color blocks.,
Now select the recently edited colors as color 1 and color 2 (Doesn't matter which one first).,
Now press OK. You will see a window pop up first.,
Now let's try the tower itself (!WARNING: This is hard to do, always make a back-up first!),
Go back to your image and your palette.,
You need to experiment.,
Hint: Just as I said at the font color step, just try out a reflected gradient by splitting it in half.,
OK, now we have changed font colors and changed level colors.,
This part is a little harder, because there are about 27 floors.,





Go back to your character and the palette.,
Just do the same thing you did with the rest.,
That's all I know about Icy Tower palette editing.",How to Create Icy Tower Characters (Advanced Palette Editing)," First, you need the game of course. The latest version (1.3.1) is the best to get. You can find the link in the introduction.
,, We're going to work with this one., Then open up the template.bmp file in it. You can use the Paint program for it., Just don't forget to stay within the purple box, don't affect it. If you want a better tutorial for the basics, try this one: ,, It's a 30-day trial, but it's full, not a demo. We use NeoPaint because it has easy palette editing. You can download it here ,, You will also see a lot of light blue blocks. We're not going to use these right now. First we will try the font color., You can edit these by going to Picture -> Edit Palette..., Now locate the rainbow colors mentioned before. I want to make it a black-red gradient. You can do this by selecting the block one by one and dit with the sliders, but you can do it easier. Just press the button in the toolbar, located on the right, to make a gradient from two colors. WAIT, first make the color block located at the top right black, then the last color in the row red (use the sliders for this). Now you can go to the gradient button.

, Now click OK and you will see a gradient in the blocks.

, Choose the first option, then press OK. Now save your bitmap, and open up Icy Tower. Select your character, and look at your freshly edited font colors. If you don't like the results, just change it again. Hint: You can make a reflected gradient by using half of the row black-red, and the rest red-black.,, You will notice a black-white gradient with a trace of blue on the left bottom. This is the gradient for the walls and the background. We want to make... it green. So we will try green. Just go to the edit palette option and edit. But this time it's a little harder, because the 16 blocks are for the walls on the side AND for the background., Make the last color light green, for example. Then make a black-light green gradient. Back-up and save, and try it out. Just experiment with the sliders.,, Now we will try modifying the floor colors., I can show you 3 of them, the rest you need to do on your own., Locate the 4block brown gradient, next to the colors we've edited before (level colors). This is the 3rd floor (the wooden one). Most of the floors only contain 4 colors, so that makes it easier to locate., For example make it green. The other two I know





are for the fourth and the fifth floor. There are others in the palette, just find out and experiment., Check out the tips wrote down in the Tips section. These are really useful(you can find most of them in the steps too)."

Upgrade your ship.",How to Conquer and Get Rich in Sid Meier's Pirates," Your crew is central to all your pirating efforts. You need skilled and brave men to sail your ship, and fight your battles with. The bigger the crew under your command, the bigger the targets you can face, and the more you can afford to lose.


You get to have a 40-member crew at the start of the game, and the first thing you have to do is to recruit more. Keep in mind to have enough space in your ship to store food to keep your crew well-fed on long journeys. 
Starting with an 80-strong crew or more is ideal, but frequent restocking of supplies when visiting cities becomes a necessity if you're planning to be at sea for a long time.
Remember, a bigger crew isn’t necessarily a good thing. The more men in your ship, the more food you need, and the harder it is to keep them happy.;
, Do this at any town, including the pirate haven although not in all settlements. Remember, once you're done recruiting in a particular town, you can't do it again for a while. Also, the number of men you can recruit depends on your rank within the nation, the wealth of the town, the happiness of your current crew, and your reputation for having profitable voyages. 

, When you defeat an enemy ship, and its sailors survive, some of them can be coaxed to join your crew. The size of your current crew and their happiness is a major factor at this point. If you need more men after the battle, it's good to replace these captured sailors, but it's much more advisable that you recruit pirate crews at shore instead. 


Crew members thrown overboard in battle by cannon impacts will be picked up. These sailors are added directly to your crew for the duration of the battle. However, only half of them tend to stay on afterward. 
If you switch to a ship smaller than the one you had, you will lose your excess crew once you sell or lose your previous ship. Losing crew this way is rather painless as these sailors do not take any gold along with them.

, Your crew is key to how strong a pirate you will be. It would seem logical that the bigger your crew, the bigger the ships you can plunder, and so much more to be gained. However, a huge crew means more expense and more cargo space needed, and with supplies drying up more quickly forcing you to restock at the nearest city or to attack ships merely to keep your crew satisfied.


Most players feel 200-men crew is sufficient for expeditions that don't involve attacking well-defended towns. This number can even win in tough ship battles.
When attacking smaller ships, don't take 500 men with you as that number is for taking over large cities.
The wisest thing to do is not to keep a bigger crew than what you actually need.  

, Crew happiness is crucial, and quite complicated to maintain. Adequate food supply is definitely in order, but another way to keep them happy is by having a sizable loot in your hands. An unsatisfied, poorly-motivated crew will appear weak during battle, will be slow in reloading cannons and in raising or lowering of sails, and will likely make you lose in combat.


A Cooper specialist helps keep food from spoiling, halves the rate at which food is consumed, and helps you get away with buying less.
If you have long travels and running low with supplies, attack other ships to restock.
Remember that where there’s unhappiness, mutiny is not far behind, and your mutinous sailors could very well depart with one of your ships along with all its cargo and gold. 

, Expeditions that are too long decrease the morale of your crew. With weeks and months on end with no sight of land and home, your unhappy crew can cause your sailing speed to be inconsistent, and your turning rate to drop. If you have to be away for lengthy amounts of time, make sure there’s lots of food and loot.

, Getting wealthy only makes up a fifth of your final fame score, but most likely you’ll be pursuing gold as your main objective throughout the game anyway. You will need to plunder ships, and with your captured ship, you can replace your old one and gain more space for food, ammunition, and more crew.

, This will take up most of your time. Any captured pirate ship will most likely have at least supplies and some gold. If you’re lucky, it will have valuable cargo you can sell for gold. How profitable this becomes depends a lot on the targets you strike: 


Indian War Canoes. This kind of ship bears little or no gold at all, and not worth the attack unless you're trying to impress the European nations. War ships have about the same yield, but attacking Indians makes you popular with all four nations, while war ships boost your reputation quicker than trade vessels. 
Grain Transport. Attack this ship if you have very low food supply to avoid starvation, but prepare to find an insignificant amount of gold aboard.
Merchant Ships. These are loaded with a decent amount of gold and cargo—low-value such as sugar, high-value such as luxuries and spices, or both.
Loot varies a lot among the small-ship types, e.g., Trade Galleon, Merchantman, and Fluyt.
Bigger merchant ships are usually big for a reason. They tend to carry a good supply of gold and cargo.
If any merchant ship has an escort, that's a clear sign that it has something worth protecting on board.
During combat, make sure to put down the escort as well for it is known to occasionally carry a bulk of gold.
Smugglers. These tend to be easy targets and have a small yet good cargo of luxuries, spice, and even some gold as well. Smugglers have a higher chance of having specialists on board.
Unnamed Pirates. Their loot depends on their luck. Sometimes they have little to nothing, and then there are times when they’ve just had a good plundering run before you caught up with them. 
Military Payroll and Treasure Ships. This is an easy way to get gold without having to sell cargo. Payroll ships usually carry only gold, while treasure ships have a good load of luxuries and spices aside from gold. These ships are heavily defended as attacks are expected, so a whole other fleet may act as escort, both brandishing 30 guns which, needless to say, will be quite painful. 
Named Villains. These are people on the wanted list with a bounty on their head, ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 gold. If you ever encounter ships with the name of Mendoza, Raymondo, and Montalban, take them out immediately. 
Named Pirates. Especially the most famous ones, they have the best loot in the game. Their loot increases over the course of the game, and you get 10% of what the top ten pirates screen lists as the total amount of gold they've plundered. Be warned, these pirates have very powerful ships, so come prepared. 

, This requires a bigger crew to pull off. Earn more gold by sacking the various towns in the Caribbean, targeting the wealthy ones and followed by the prosperous. Modesty as well as poor towns won’t be worth the effort.


Defenses in towns are not always balanced. For example, there are poor towns with a surprisingly strong garrison. Similarly, there are wealthy cities with weak defenses, especially those that are just recently rich. 
If your target has great defense, soften up the garrison by convincing pirates and Indians to attack it. Keep in mind that each pirate or Indian can only be set on a town belonging to a nation closest to them.
Usually a garrison is bigger than 300 soldiers. Once attacked by pirates or Indians, the garrison will be thinned out or the town is left unharmed.
If the attack succeeds, it's a different story. A pirate attack reduces a town's wealth rating to “poor” instantly, and a successful Indian attack will scare off a sizable portion of the population. 

, Get goods either by purchasing them from the town merchants or steal them from ships. You will get better results selling in the towns of a nation wherein you’re a Colonel or, better yet, a Marquis. These two ranks give you trading bonuses, and the town will have more goods for sale and also have more gold in reserve.

, Choosing a ship is vital for your journey and raids. The game only has nine different classes of ships. The best one depends on what you intend to do with it.


Pinnace. Ships of this kind include the smallest ship in the game; have very low capacity for guns, crew, and cargo; and can be very vulnerable in battle. However, being the fastest and best-turning ships, they're quite hard to hit and perform quite well even against the wind. 
Sloop. Excellent as small ships go, they’re fast like the Pinnace, but can carry larger crews. Sloops are the most popular choice for a flagship, and many players stick with them for their high speed and ability to dodge hits during battle. 
Brig. A bit larger than Sloops but possessing of good speed and the ability to sail against the wind. Brigs are clearly a balance between agility and heavy armament. The Brig of War is an excellent ship and a popular choice for a flagship. 
Frigate. Frigates are the best choice in terms of large ships with lots of room for guns and a capacity to hold huge crews. 
Combat Galleon. Fast Galleon, War Galleon, and Flag Galleon fall in this category. Their power is comparable to a Frigate, but they’re far slower. They can speed up when going with the wind, but significantly slows down against it.

, The more powerful your ship, the easier it will be to conquer and win. With the gold you’ve plundered and/or earned from trading, upgrade your ship to a faster one with better sails and a stronger cannon for more firepower. Upgrade by visiting one of the major cities, specifically the port.


Upgrades may be unavailable in some cities, so it's best to go to a merchant. In no time, you will climb the ranks, become a duke, and marry a governor's beautiful daughter.

Run your game.",How to Copy PC Games," In order to copy the game, you will need a program that will allow you to transfer the contents of the disc to your computer. These burning programs range from free to paid, but all of them should be able to get the job done. The most popular programs include:


Alcohol 120%
CloneDVD
ImgBurn
Nero Burning Rom;
, You will need to know the type of copy protection that the disc is using before you can start ripping it. The best free utility to do this is Protection ID. This program can detect any copy protection method that might be used by your disc.


This is only necessary if you are using Alcohol 120%, as Alcohol 120% asks you for the protection type before ripping. If you are using CloneDVD or ImgBurn, you don't need to identify the copy protection., This program bypasses the encryption on DVDs, allowing you to create perfect 1:1 copies of the disc. Not all ripping programs require AnyDVD to be running, but it will make the process much more likely to succeed. AnyDVD is a paid program, but you can use the trial version to make your copies.


You don't need this for Alcohol 120%. Instead, use the copy protection identification step above.
AnyDVD runs in the background and you don't need to do anything to get it to work.

, In order to create a backup that doesn't require any patching, your disc reader and writer will need to be able to read and write RAW DAO and Subchannel Data. Most modern drives support this, though you may run into issues on older computers.


Philips, Lite-On, and Plextor drives are the best for copying games, and nearly all models support RAW DAO.
If your drive doesn't support this mode, then you will likely need to install a patch later on in order to play the game.

, Open up your ripping software. If you are using CloneDVD, ImgBurn, or Nero Burning Rom, ensure that AnyDVD is running in the background. If you are using Alcohol 120%, ensure that you have determined the correct protection method that the disc uses.


Insert the disc, click the Create Image (or similar) button, and choose the correct drive from the image ripping software.
Set a location for the image. When the disc is ripped, an image file is created on your hard drive. This file will be the same size as the disc, so make sure your hard disk has enough free space.
If you are using Alcohol 120%, select the copy protection method in the Datatype menu.
Lower the read speed. Copying a game with protection software is tricky, and ripping it too fast can cause errors. Set the ripping speed to 4X or lower to ensure that no errors occur during the ripping process.

, Once you have set your ripping preferences, you just need to wait for the ripping process to be completed. Depending on the speed you set and the size of the disc, this could take a significant amount of time., Once you have the image file on your computer, you can either burn it to a blank disc or use a virtual drive to load the image file as if it was a disc. Alcohol 120% comes with a virtual drive program, or you can use Daemon Tools.


Avoid using your operating system's built-in image mounting software. Programs like Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools come with software to help circumvent copy protection.
If you weren't able to rip the image using RAW DAO, you'll need to use Daemon Tools to mount the image. This will allow you to load the image even though the copy protection wasn't bypassed., Open the virtual drive program. Select the image file on your computer to mount. The virtual drive program will create a new DVD drive on your computer, and the image file acts like the disc. When the image file is mounted, it's as if the disc has been inserted into the drive.

, Once the disc has been mounted, it will act exactly as if the physical disc was inserted into a physical drive. For most games, the Autorun menu will appear after the disc is mounted, and you can install or play your game like normal.

, If you want to copy your newly-created image to another disc, you'll need an image burning program. Many of the disc ripping programs come with burning software as well, including Alcohol 120%, ImgBurn, and Nero.

, When you start up the image burning program, load the disc image that you created in the first section. Most image burning software support all major image file types.

, Make sure that you are inserting the same kind of disc that the original used. For example, if you are burning a CD image, make sure that you use a CD-R. If you are burning a DVD image, make sure that you are using a DVD-R.


Avoid CD-RW/DVD-RW discs. These are rewritable and often cause errors when you try to load them with an image burned.
The best brands of discs are Memorex, Verbatim, and Sony. These will lead to the least amount of possible errors.

, Lower the write speed to help prevent any potential errors. Much like ripping, a lower speed leads to a more reliable final product. Once the burning process is complete, your disc will contain a 1:1 copy of the original game disc, and can be used just like the retail version.

, If you want to be able to run your game without having to have the disc or backup image inserted, you will need to install a No-CD crack. These are programs that trick the game into thinking that the disc is in your drive. You can find cracks in a variety of places online.


These sections above are only for circumventing copy protection. You may still need to deal with CD checks if you plan on playing the game without the disc or backup image.
Cracks can also allow you to play your game online even if you don't have a valid key or license.

, Since gaming piracy is a large market, cracks have become a very popular way to spread viruses. Make sure that you scan the downloaded crack for viruses, and only download cracks from trusted sources.

, The installation for cracks varies from game to game. Some cracks are self-contained installation files, and you install them much like you would most programs. Others are executable files that replace the game's main executable file. These need to be placed in the game's directory on your computer.


Nearly all cracks come with a README file that will explain how to properly install the crack.

, After the crack is installed, either run your game like normal or run the new executable file if that's how your specific crack works. Your game should load like normal, though some cracks will inject new loading screens or intros.

The instructions will explain what commands you can use, and may also set forth the game's theme.

Sometimes, a game's back-story and goal will be spelled out right away. In other games, this gradually emerges during gameplay.;
, If you just skim over things, you may miss an important clue.

,


You can try asking the game ""What is ... ?"" In Zork, for example, you can ask ""What is a grue?""

,


You can use the inventory command to remind yourself of what all is in your possession.
Most games have ""baggage limits"", so you may have to drop something before taking something else. There may also be passages which limit how much you can carry through. Such limits usually consider the collective weight of your inventory, not merely the quantity.
Some objects can act as containers; for example, you could put coins in bag. This may let you carry more inventory, or otherwise give you flexibility.
When you leave an object behind, don't count on it being present when you return.

,


Remember that there are ten possible directions: north, east, south, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast, up, and down. If a room has more than three visible exits, chances are that it is centrally located.
For up and down, either draw stairs or just make a straight line with D and U notations.
Some pathways are effectively curves or even circles. Going north and then south will not always get you back to where you started. At the beginning of Zork, for example, if you go north, you'd then have to go west to get back to the first location. Experiment with the directions, and make the appropriate curves on your map.
Some passages are one-way; this may or may not be explicitly noted when you try to go back. For example, you might climb up a chimney, but then be told ""Only Santa Claus climbs down chimneys"". If you find you can't return to the previous room, draw a one-way arrow.
There will often be ""underground"" and ""above ground"" areas, which will require separate maps.
Before starting a map, explore enough to get a sense of the area, so that you can space it correctly.
In a maze or forest, several locations may have identical descriptions. Such areas are especially important to map, and should have separate sections if they are large. You can drop an object to mark each place (there could be someone else taking dropped objects, however.) Another way to distinguish locations is to keep track of the exits.

Again, going west and then east will not always get you back to the same place; the path could be a curve, a circle, or one-way. In this type of area, such quirks are less obvious. If you find that a pathway actually leads directly back to the selfsame room, draw a circle.
If a maze seems quite complex, it may be best to avoid it for a while. Once you have more experience navigating the game, the maze may make more sense.


Note where objects or hazards are found.
If you encounter a locked door or an enemy blocking your path, it is likely that you can open up a new passage. Use a dotted line to note a potential passage. If the barrier is something else, there may or may not be a solution; the game has to have boundaries. If a barrier seems to be on the outskirts of the game area, there may be no way around or through it.
Most game areas are too complex to be mapped perfectly. If there's an underground level, chances are that there are multiple routes back up to the surface, some of which may not even involve a direct up. If two locations on different maps turn out to be side-by-side, just note that on each map.

There may also be ways to teleport from one location to another. If you discover one, note it on the map, making clear how you get from place to place. Test to see whether you can teleport back and forth, or if it only works one way.



,


If the game keeps score, note anything which increases your score. If merely picking up an object increases your score, said object is a treasure. Keep a list of treasures and their original locations.

Be aware that there could be someone else within the game who also wants the treasures. Such a character could be an enemy or an ally.


Note anything interesting. Just as a seemingly useless object likely has a purpose somewhere, an obscure bit of information may be a clue.

In an adventure with multiple installments, such as Zork, one episode may contain a clue pertinent to a subsequent episode. So don't immediately discard your notes when you finish a game.



, Danger could be lurking around the corner. Even if you know where you're going, many text adventures feature random occurrences which can mess you up.


If you are ""injured"", it is usually best just to restore a saved game where you are in perfect health. An injury will make it harder to navigate the game. Not all text adventures keep track of health, but those that do will usually have a diagnose command that tells you your exact status.
Likewise, if you ""die"" and come back, restore a saved game where you haven't died. ""Death"" usually costs you points and leaves you with residual injuries. Moreover, your possessions may be scattered throughout the game area.

, You may have already done something inconspicuous which will prevent you from finishing. With your map and information accumulated, you can always redo it from the beginning.

, You are not likely to get very far without some experimenting.


Do not assume that a particular action will produce the same result every time, even in identical situations. Randomness is often present in text adventures.

, Your moves are counted, and some things are time-sensitive; for example, a light source may eventually go out.

If you have a lantern or other light source which can be switched on and off, turn it off when you don't need it.

On top of the second tank, add a Rockomax-Kerbodyne adapter, an FL-R1 RCS tank, and a Protective Rocket Nose Mk7. These are your booster rockets., There should be two connecting the top tank of each booster to the top tank of the central rocket, and one connecting the nose cone of each booster to the tank in step 6., You should place four sets on each booster: one at the top and bottom of each fuel tank. Each set should be one block on the side facing away from the central rocket, and one ninety degrees around in either direction (so 12 total on each booster)., Don't use symmetry mode for this, it goes a bit funny. For each booster, you'll need to place two fuel lines, one for the top tank and one for the bottom. If you try with only one line, it may make the fuel flow go a bit dicky. Connect the north booster to the east booster, and the south booster to the west booster. Then, connect the east and west boosters to the central stage., Try two on each booster. The launch clamps should be part of stage 9., Liftoff in ten... nine... eight..."

Keep an eye on all your opponents; there are only four ghosts in the game.,
Realize that you're probably smarter than the game.,
Once you have the basics down, concentrate on amassing as many points as possible.,
When you eat a ghost on a power-up, it becomes a pair of eyes, which gradually work their way to the center of the maze (the jail area) to regenerate.,
Learn how the ghosts think.",How to Win in Pac Man," Keep your closest watch on the nearest ones. Also keep an eye on Blinky (Red) and Pinky (Pink) as they are the fastest and the most skilled. In most Pac-Man versions, you will move faster than the ghosts, which means the only way they can catch you is for you to make a wrong turn, or for them to corner you.;
, The artificial intelligence in Pac-Man is very crude. Ghosts may appear to chase you, but many times they will turn off onto different paths when they're right behind you. If it looks like you're going to be cornered, move in the direction of the ghost that has to make a ""choice"" of whether to pursue you or take a different route. Many times you will get lucky. Try also to stay in areas with multiple turn offs and routes; it's much easier for you to lose your pursuers here.

, Clearing the map is a start, but also try to collect the fruit that will occasionally appear, as well as stalking ghosts when ""powered up"". It's generally a good idea to clear the map in quarters, using the ""power-up"" dots when 2 or more ghosts begin to congregate in your area. Ideally, you should wait until there are at least 3 ghosts in your area to use a ""power-up"", since you collect an increasing amount points for every ghost you devour. If you can nab all 4 ghosts on one power-up, you'll earn 200, 400, 800, and 1600 or 3,000 points (in most versions). Don't waste your time chasing ghosts, but remember that every one you devour has to travel back to the map's center and then back to your area again to be a threat. Therefore, you should make a decent effort to eliminate the threats in your area when powered-up. Don't just try to send them in the opposite direction.

, If you are clearing an area near the center of the map, watch these eyes! Don't get caught at the ""jail's entrance"" when a ghost regenerates!

, There is literally no randomness to their movements. They start off each level aiming for their respective ""home corners"": Blinky (red) heads to the top-right, Pinky (pink) to the top-left, Inky (blue) to the bottom-right, and Clyde (orange) to the bottom-left. After a few seconds, they start chasing you-- you'll know they've changed tactics when they make a 180 degree turn. Blinky heads straight for your position, Pinky heads for a spot just in front of you (unless you're facing up, due to a glitch), Inky heads for one end of a line that has a spot just in front of you as its center and Blinky as its other end, and Clyde chases you if he's far away but heads back to his home corner when you're nearby. They'll alternate between these two strategies throughout the level, but eventually settle on chasing you.

Try to go for chain combos.",How to Blacksmith on Puzzle Pirates," It doesn't always change symbols, but there's a good chance it will, so it's good to keep in mind that the 2 you just hit might be a Knight the next time you give it a slam.
, Though the sword in the back will slowly cool down and become gold, it doesn't represent a timer. You will have used up an hour of labor when you run out of moves, so whatever you do, avoid running out of moves!, The board will start off as being entirely gold, with all the pieces still hot. Hitting it once will result in it becoming a stone gray color, and hitting it twice will result in it becoming shiny, silver, and completely cooled. If you hit a silver block one more time, the block will disappear completely, meaning you will no longer be able to hit it. It's not a good idea to begin destroying blocks for good in the beginning, because then you'll have fewer moves when you're near the end. This results in the labor work ending earlier with several warmer blocks remaining, which never makes for a good sword., When you first begin, you'll only have blocks labeled one through three, but you'll eventually also work with fours. The number on the block represents how far the next turn will be.







Striking a ""1"" block: you will only get a range of one block far. Working with these ranges are much easier than others. You'll be able to hit any block surrounding the ""1"" block you just hit.






Striking a ""2"" block: you won't get to hit in a two-block range, as you won't be able to hit any surrounding blocks. Instead, you will be able to hit blocks two blocks away, whether it's vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.
Striking a ""3"" block: you won't get a three-block range either. Similar to the two, it will instead allow you to hit blocks three blocks away, also vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.






Striking the ""4"" block: it works just like the ""2"" and ""3"" blocks; it can hit blocks four blocks away vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.







, Along with many number blocks, you'll find several chess pieces. In the same way, there are four different number blocks, and there are four different chess pieces. However, unlike the number blocks, each chess piece has their own unique movement rules., They are little castles with a sword piercing through it along with some waves in the background. If you use a Rook piece, you must strike a block that is either vertically or horizontally lined up with it. Along with lining it up, the piece must be at the edge of the board.

, Bishops look like lighthouses with two crossed rapiers behind it. If you use a Bishop piece, you must strike a block that is diagonally lined up with it. Similar to the Rook piece, the block it hits also has to be on the edge of the board.

, Knight blocks depict a horse with a mermaid-like lower body. If you use a Knight piece, you must strike a piece that goes two squares in any non-diagonal direction then one block that is perpendicular to it. Though these pieces may not sound very useful, they can be real lifesavers if you plan accordingly.

, Queens depict a small skull in the center of the block along with a crown and some leaves. They're described as being quite flexible, and they certainly are; Queens can strike any edge piece that is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to the block. Think of it as a combination of a Rook and a Bishop.

, Rum Jugs are like wilds; they can go absolutely anywhere on the board that has an available space.

Obtaining a Rum Jug requires you to hit every block on the board once. If you want a second Rum Jug, you'll have to strike every square again until they're all silver.

, A good idea for racking up a lot of points is planning out moves that will result in combos. Combos award you with lots of extra points, and getting several combos in a row will leave you performing incredibly and doing expert labor, meaning you'll get tons of pieces of eight for your labor!, The most occurring combos include the ""Fancy Hammerin'"" combo, which you get from striking one of every Chess Piece; the ""By The Numbers"", which you get from striking numbers in their numerical order (e.g. 4, 3, 2, 1 or 1, 2, 3, 4); and the ""In The Rhythm"", which you get from striking one of every number in a non-numerical order., For example, if you hit a queen twice in a row, you'll get a x2 combo, or a ""Double"". These kinds of combos continue all the way up to x6. From least to most hits in a row, you'll receive the combos ""Double"", ""Triple"", ""Bingo"", ""Donkey"", and finally ""Vegas""., This is when you do several different combos continuously, like getting an ""In The Rhythm"" combo then immediately getting a ""By The Numbers"" combo afterward. This will rack up a ton of points, resulting in good swords and good labor."

See which type of Slam-A-Winner the game is.,
Examine how fast the turntable spins, and how long it takes the ball to drop.,
Learn what it means, for when and if the ball drops and bounces off the right side of the yellow ring surrounding the Jackpot hole.,
Be careful, occasionally the sensor that detects what hole the ball drops in may become misaligned, and probably out of sync for a game or two.,
Take note that occasionally, if the counter in charge of spitting out the correct number of tickets is counting too slow (this happens very rarely, and varies by the machine), it could end up giving you more tickets than what was supposed to be given from a normal counter.,
Don't continue playing, if you use these tricks correctly, and win a Jackpot.",How to Win the Jackpot in Slam A Winner1," If the numbers indicated on the holes or, mostly even numbers, this is most likely a tougher version of the game. The better & easier version of the game where big tickets are won more easily is the one where various numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, JACKPOT , and 2 Bonus Plays)., Basically this is best done by testing it out yourself with a couple of practice tries. What you'll want to do is hit the button when the shining light (where the ball will drop from) shines right on top of the 9 hole (it is to the right of a hole labelled ""JACKPOT"" with an elevated yellow ring surrounding it & the 9 hole is separated from the Jackpot hole by a 1 hole in between both of them)., That means the drop was too early, and the button should be pressed AFTER the 9 hole passes under the shining light. If the ball drops & bounces off the left side of the yellow ring, that means the drop was too late, therefore, the button should be pressed BEFORE the 9 hole passes under the shining light. If the ball ""appears"" to have landed right on top of the Jackpot hole, however, bounced right out, that means you got the timing correct, but just need to stick to that timing & keep trying. If a proper ball dropping speed is not kept at a constant with each ball drop, it my become tougher to land the ball in a desire hole, For example, the ball may land in the 3 hole (Dark blue) that is to the right of a green hole, surrounded by a yellow ring, known as the 100 hole. However, when the ball eventually reaches the sensor hole, and awards you the amount of tickets indicated on the hole the ball dropped in, if the sensor that keeps track of the turntable's position becomes misaligned, the sensor may accidentally award you 100 Tickets, instead of the 3 that the ball landed. This displacement of the sensors could be good (landing in a hole next to a big number, and being awarded the big number) or bad (you could get the ball perfectly in the Jackpot hole, but if the sensor is displaced, it could ruin your luck by awarding you something else). Why this happens, or how this happens isn't really clear, and is most likely a random, accidental event of chance and luck., Also, the Jackpot number usually starts out at 25, 100, or 125, depending on the machine. It usually goes up to a certain number, 750 by default setting on the machine. Whenever the Jackpot is won, the Jackpot number is reset to the lowest number that the Jackpot is set to., Once you are capable of landing the ball in the Jackpot hole very easily, without much or any difficulty, the best trick to getting yourself better Jackpots, is to stop playing, and wait for others to play, and let the Jackpot build up, with each time people insert credits (tokens or quarters normally), until you feel that the Jackpot is high enough for your desire. However, DON'T wait too long, because if you do, other people may end up nabbing that big Jackpot, instead of you.

To ensure that you got the Jackpot awarded to you, usually an announcer announces, ""Jackpot!"" (On the Xtreme version it would announce ""Whoa, you won a big prize!""). If you get the ball in the 100 hole, it'll announce, ""Winner"". If you get the ball in the 2 Bonus Plays hole, it'll say, ""Big Bonus"". It is advised that you listen for these announcements in the game, to make sure that it is working correctly.

Learn what to do, if and when you discover that the ball has bounced around the turntable and got trapped on the side of the turntable, next to the wall, and continue to roll alongside the wall, until it is knocked into a hole either by rolling against the wall & the side of a yellow ringed hole, or by the objects sticking inside the turntable from the inside walls.,
Learn what to do in the rare occasion that the ball is rolling alongside the wall, and it is possible to tap/knock on the wall where the ball is, try to time it so that, when you knock on the wall where the ball is, the ball may fall into the 25, or 75 hole when it passes right by either of them, as the 25 & 75 holes are not covered with yellow rings the way the 100 & Jackpot holes are.",How to Win the Jackpot in Slam A Winner2," Here's how you can still win tickets even though you failed to get the ball in the Jackpot hole.
, However, some versions of the game have yellow holes on the 25 & 75 holes also. Also note, that depending on the machine, some yellow rings may be bigger or smaller than others. It's the bigger rings that make it easier for the ball to be lodged in the big amount holes."

Find the area the Taurus Demon is in.,
Prepare to face the Taurus Demon.,
Enter the fog door.,
Clear out the Hollow marksmen on the guard tower behind you.,
Move to the middle of the bridge.,
Run back to the cleared guard tower and decide which of the following methods you wish to kill the Taurus Demon with.

",How to Defeat the Taurus Demon Boss in Dark Souls1," The Taurus Demon is most likely only the second boss you will face, and as such, he is hard to miss if you follow the path through Undeadsberg. Once you have lit the bonfire in Undeadberg, follow the bridge past the fire bombing hollows, up the large stairs and through the city until you come to the large tower towards the end. On the second floor there will be a fog wall; the Taurus Demon will be through the door, but beware – you cannot return until you defeat the boss, so only enter if you are prepared.

, Whichever method you choose to fight the demon with, you'll want to have leveled up your Endurance and Dexterity stats a fair bit, as you'll be doing a good amount of rolling and running during your battle. Otherwise, you'll also want to stock up on firebombs (about 20 of them to be safe), which can be bought from the merchant under the two spear Hollows in Undeadsberg, not far from the bonfire there.

, You'll find yourself on a crumbling bridge with a guard tower ahead and a guard tower behind you with a ladder and two Hollow marksmen.

, Fighting the Taurus Demon with them shooting at you can be difficult, and two of the methods you can use to fight him need you to implement the guard tower, so killing the Hollows is easiest. Climb up the ladder and dispatch them both.

, At some point you'll trigger the arrival of the Taurus Demon, who will climb off the far guard tower.

Wait for the Taurus Demon to jump onto the tower and back off again.,
Climb back up the ladder and repeat the process until you have killed the Taurus Demon.",How to Defeat the Taurus Demon Boss in Dark Souls2," This method is by far the easiest, but is also slightly longer than the other methods.;
, The Taurus Demon will be waiting for you at the bottom of the tower.

,,, It will explode and take a small chunk of health off the beast.

, Although it may be tempting to throw a second firebomb, usually it will take too much time to throw and the Taurus Demon will quickly kill you, or you'll accidentally fall off the tower, as throwing a firebomb moves you forward slightly.

, The Taurus Demon will jump onto the tower thinking you're still on it, but if you time it correctly and climb onto the ladder, he will jump back down onto the bridge soon after.

, It may take a little while, but this method is by far the safest and easiest way for newcomers to the game to defeat the boss.

Escape from the Taurus Demon's clutches.,
Sprint all the way to the other end of the bridge and back again.,
Climb the ladder and repeat the process of plunging attacks and luring the demon away until you have defeated the Taurus Demon.",How to Defeat the Taurus Demon Boss in Dark Souls3,", The Taurus Demon should be waiting below by now.

,,, After you finish the attack, you'll find you're stuck between the fog door and the demon himself. If you roll quickly through the Taurus Demon's legs, you'll be able to escape without taking damage. If you have time, you can also quickly slash his legs as you run by. Do not try to climb immediately back up the ladder as the Taurus Demon will hit you before you can finish climbing it.

, The Taurus Demon will be following you quickly, so when you reach the end of the bridge, you need to the again roll through his legs and run back to the first guard tower.

, It is a more difficult method overall as you will be within the reach of the demon more often than the firebomb method, but the large chunks of health you remove with plunging attacks will not only make the fight quicker, but allows you to save your firebombs for other enemies.

Lure the Taurus Demon to the area of bridge where the side has been destroyed.,
Stand near the edge of the broken bridge with the Taurus Demon rushing towards you.

,
Wait for the Taurus Demon to make a sweeping attack, then roll backwards.",How to Defeat the Taurus Demon Boss in Dark Souls5," It is near the middle of the bridge and on the left side. You may have to run back to your own guard tower and then roll through the demon's legs before you can effectively lure him to this spot.

,, If you've timed it correctly, and the Taurus Demon is in the correct spot, the inertia from his club will propel him off the edge of the bridge and kill him instantly. This method is fairly hard and difficult to do. If you are unwilling to die, do not try this method. However, despite its difficulty, the method has both an element of humour worth viewing it and will reduce the fight with the boss to a quick melee.

"
"
Get shot.,
Go on the bridge.,
Weave about.",How to Defeat the Taurus Demon Boss in Dark Souls6," In order to do this you will have to let the two snipers at the top of the guard tower shoot you a couple of times.

, Once the snipers have shot you for a bit, cross the bridge until the Taurus Demon comes out.

, Once the Taurus Demon is on the bridge, get the snipers to start shooting you at the same time that you go behind, in front or underneath the Taurus Demon. The snipers will shoot the Taurus Demon. Keep on repeating this until the Taurus Demon is dead. It is a bit tricky to do but it's hilarious to see the Taurus Demon getting shot by his own teammates.

Make sure that Kbounce is installed on your computer.,
Play a few rounds, getting acquainted with the controls and how it works.,
This article will be using the lower left corner as a start point in describing techniques, though the strategies will work at any corner, and possibly even vertically (though horizontal traps are much easier and more useful).

,
Place the cursor, with horizontal lines selected, on the fourth row up from the bottom, at least 8 columns away from the left edge.,
For level 2, with 3 balls, start the corridor 4 additional spaces to the right, making room for the third ball to be trapped in the corridor.,
For round 3, with 4 balls, a single corridor is possible, but tricky - so make two corridors, stacked, as shown here.,
With the box-trapping technique, it's possible to get up to rounds into the mid-30s, though it becomes essential to trap balls in 2x2 areas and trap multiple balls in these areas to continue to clear 75% of the field.,
By now, there are enough balls to make it almost impossible to draw a line all the way across the field with one try, but there are enough balls to draw a partial line that does not reach any wall, and this is what you're going to do.,
Now draw a line that does end at the wall, on the 6th row from the bottom.,
If you make a mistake, it's not a crisis - just build the trap in another corner, and build vertically to block off your first attempt.,
As rounds progress, it gets pretty crowded in there.,
That one square cannot be filled in a useful fashion, and the resulting corners disrupt the flow of the balls.,
After the trap has been completed, you can relax - most, if not all, of the balls will fall into it without further intervention on your part.,
If you get a perfect start, and the short wall is exactly 4 blocks long, the balls will eventually orient themselves into a pattern like this.,
Wait for the longest space between balls in the minor line (the one that bounces off of the bottom corner of the short wall) and fill the first two columns to the right of the left wall (pretty easy with almost all of the balls busy elsewhere).,
Once all of the minor line has bounced onto the new track, finish filling that column (you have to wait for a gap in the major stream, and start very close to the end of the short line).

,
The major stream will start progressing around the field, along the same track that the minor line took.,
To finish the round, once all of the balls are stable in the trap, close off the tail, then the main body.,
Draw vertical lines just outside of the space taken by the balls to close off the other areas.,
Be warned: this does become something of a long march.",How to Win at Kbounce," It's a standard game for KDE, which is a popular window manager for *nix systems (more information and installation files are available at http://www.kde.org/ ).;
, The usual beginner strategy is to draw lines bisecting the playing field, eventually enclosing each ball in a space small enough so that 75% of the field is blocked off, completing the round. This is fine for new players, but once you've mastered this, it's time to change strategy and start building toward higher levels and more serious scores.

,, Start a line when neither ball can intersect your left-side line before it's completed, trying to catch a ball with the head on the right, making a longer line and conserving a life. This will give you a line part of the way across the field, with three spaces between it and the bottom of the field. Switch to drawing vertical lines, and when a ball bounces into that corridor, draw a vertical line behind it in the 4th column from the end of the corridor, trapping the ball into a 3x3 square. You should have enough space in the corridor to trap the second ball in an adjacent space, closing off the entire rest of the board. To save time, draw a vertical line above the end of the corridor when it's safe to do so, closing off the space above and reducing the area the balls can be in. The field should look this.

, It's fairly easy to leave a perfectly square space outside of the corridor, in which case, the balls will bounce off of the same parts of the walls, never entering the corridor. To correct this, draw a vertical line adjacent to the right-hand wall, narrowing the space by one, giving the balls a new trajectory so that they precess around the edges. This is also how to correct the situation of the balls regularly bouncing near, but not into, the corridor.

, Continue in this vein, adding corridors until you have enough space to trap all balls, for a few more rounds. You'll find that you can have 4 corridors 3 spaces wide, with one 2-wide corridor. In the two-wide corridor, continue to leave the balls spaces 3 wide to be in - a 2x2 space is possible, and results in a higher score, but is tricky, and not really essential. Your goal isn't to have a great score at level 16, it's to survive until about level 20, at which point you'll change to a new technique where score is maximized. It's pointless to risk losing the game for a higher score at round 12 when your per-round score later will easily go over 7,000 points. As your confidence grows, you can start using 2-wide corridors more extensively, though you probably won't have enough time to do so before round 6 - balls are less likely to enter a 2-wide corridor. Practice terminating lines by hitting balls rather than the lines being intersected - this skill will become very useful, then essential, later in the game.

, In earlier versions of Kbounce, in which 1-wide corridors were useful, that's how the previous world record was set, with a double-ball per square technique. That's not necessary, though - the new technique will trap an unlimited number of balls into a 14-space area, letting you clear 97% of the field. You'll have the lives and time to start using it by the time you're at round 20, though time constraints make it iffy before round 15.

, Use your skills at ending lines by hitting balls to draw a line in the third row up from the bottom, ending it 2 spaces from the left wall. Ending it a bit further away isn't a serious problem, as long as you've got the line started. Growing the line a few spaces isn't tough, and you've got enough lives to spend doing it. Be careful to not reach the wall - at least 2 spaces between the wall and the line are necessary. If needful, just draw the rightward-headed line when you know the left-headed line will be killed before it reaches the wall - you've got several lives to play with, a few lost making this first line won't hurt.

, This line doesn't need to be very long - 4 spaces long is ideal, 3 long will work, and longer than 4 will work as well, though the closer to 4, the better. You just need to overlap the first line by 1, so you can close off the pattern to end the round. If your first line doesn't end exactly 2 from the wall, now is the time to draw vertical lines adjacent to the left wall below your second line until you've moved that section of wall to leave 2 spaces between the wall and your first line. Your field should now look something like the picture. Once you've got this done, complete your first line all the way to the right wall. Be careful of balls bouncing along the corridor you've formed, and expect to spend a few lives doing this. Balls will have begun to accumulate in the left end of your ""Roach Motel"" trap. Some will stay immediately, and some will bounce through the trap, down the bottom corridor, and then back to the trap. Some of these will be caught, some will bounce right back out. If more bounce back out than not, adjust the length of the bottom corridor by one. Try to start with an odd number for the length of this, as it seems to work best. See the tips sections for reasons that balls behave differently in the trap. If you got a perfect start, closing off the last two spaces of your bottom corridor will cause all balls entering the trap to remain there, and your screen will now look like the next picture.

, If all 4 corners get messed up, close off the top or bottom to make 2 new corners to try in. Slow and steady does it - overconfidence has given me plenty of practice in correcting for errors. Once you've got the trap built, the level is pretty much won. At the very worst, you should be able to close off enough to make 75% and get a fresh round and fresh start, even if you make minimal score on any particular round.

, Slow but steady is the key. At this level, the worst mistake to make (and easiest, after having your line totally killed) is to add onto a line so that your join square is killed, but you make other progress in building the line, leaving a 1-square gap, like this:

, Sometimes you can abandon that trap and build another, other times you'll need to construct workarounds to trap all of the balls. Inconvenient, but not fatal - even with several bad traps, you can finish the round and start again with a fresh slate. If you stay calm, you can, at the very least, survive any round, no matter how badly the play has gone. (Note: In later versions of Kbounce, by ver 0.11, filling that single square is possible, so this problem becomes a non-issue.)

, If the last few balls keep bouncing back out, change the length of the trap's tail until they behave. If they simply won't enter the trap, adjust the field until they do. Start adjusting the field by filling the space above the short wall of the trap vertically, as soon as traffic is light enough to make it easy and safe. Once that is filled, after you're sure the remaining balls won't enter the trap, adjust the wall furthest from the trap entrance one column at a time.

,
If the left end of the long wall of the trap ends 2 spaces away from the outside wall, filling 2 spaces at the end of the trap will retain all balls that run the corridor. As you can see, most balls (the major line) are bouncing from the top outside corner of the short wall to the inside corner on the lower right, while the rest (the minor line) are bouncing from the bottom outside corner of the short wall, through a loop bracketing the inside corner at the lower right, to the inside corner at the top of the short wall, where it returns. Given enough time, all balls that don't enter the trap will align themselves in these lines. Once that's done, it's fairly easy to get them all into the trap pretty quickly.

,


If the first balls bouncing out of the previous pattern will return before all of that line has bounced out of the pattern, draw a partial line above the track, filling only the leftmost four columns, and letting one of the balls still in the minor track kill your line, so it looks like the ""Part-way through..."" screencap.

,, After about 4 circuits that track lands directly in the mouth of the trap. Some of the major line will hit the corner and bounce back out - generally less than half, though it really doesn't matter. Those remaining few will take about 9 circuits of the space, then enter the trap.


Even if your beginning isn't perfect, as long as you have a functioning trap, you're going to win the round. You've got plenty of time, and plenty of lives, so relax, but do keep an eye on those seconds - when you're down to 300 seconds, it's time to start getting serious about finishing the round.

, (Closing off the main body ends the round, and you want that tail closed first for maximum score.) That'll look like the screenshot 'All balls in the trap' just before you close.

, This will leave you with a roughly B-shaped area of 14 squares. This will result in closing 97% of the area, for the practical maximum of bonus points for the level.

, The current game of the original author, as for this writing, has been in play for 5 days now (not steady play, but fairly frequent), and each level now starts with over an hour of time to complete it. In passing the half-million score mark, the author squeaked in with barely 26 minutes to spare, and only 109 lives left - so you can see why the challenge is pretty much over. As this technique keeps you busy for a few minutes in the beginning of a round to set up the trap, then another few minutes of cleanup after the trap is mostly filled, there's a lot of time in the middle doing nothing but waiting for the trap to fill. Higher scores than mine will be made by people with more endurance than. Previous formulas to estimate the top possible score are irrelevant to this technique, because you can theoretically have an infinite number of balls in the 14-square trap. The top score will be reached when the software can no longer handle the numbers, or the CPU can no longer calculate trajectory and bounce for so many balls, and slows to uselessness. (In the example described here, the computer slowed considerably at the beginning of a round well before hitting round 100, though the seconds counter remains accurate. As balls stack in the trap, speed resumes.)

Get into your opponent’s head.",How to Win Any Racing Game," Some games will have optional settings that allow some of the controls to be handled automatically or partially guided by the computer. Turning them on will help simplify gameplay and allow you to focus on other aspects of the race. A few example options are automatic transmission, traction control, auto braking, or steering assist.


Automatic transmission mean you won’t have to worry about switching gears.
Traction control and auto-braking
Steering assist will make handling more forgiving and work against things like over-correction in turns.;
, A game’s physics will determine how cars handle and what kind of adjustments you will need to make in how you play. Experiment with a variety of tracks and cars to improve your understanding of how the game treats its driving physics.


Most racing games can be classified as one of two types: simulator, which tries to emulate real driving as much as possible, and arcade, which favors exciting, simpler, or flashy play over realism., A car with a good top speed won’t do as well as one with tighter handling on a track with lots of sharp turns. Picking the right tool for the job will give you an edge over other drivers.


Some games allow you to upgrade and customize cars. This can help you further tune a car towards your driving style or to a particular track.

, The more your know about the track, the more you can prepare for turns and straightaways to optimize your driving.

, Some racing games differentiate between dirt and paved roads or put courses in rain and snow. These conditions will affect how your car handles and you will need to adjust how you drive to compensate. Usually this means braking and turning with more care to avoid losing control.

, Try to avoid mashing the brake button or pulling the analog stick all the way to the side when turning. Gamepads and steering wheel controllers have pressure sensitive inputs that can measure precise movements, meaning partial presses and smaller movements will make less drastic changes when driving.


Keyboards do not have pressure sensitive inputs, but you can try techniques like tapping the brakes through turns to avoid losing all of your speed.

, Depending on the sharpness or the turn, braking or releasing the acceleration button will give you better tire traction through the turn and let you accelerate quickly on your way out. If you are playing with manual transmission, shifting inside of a turn will also hurt traction.

, Manual gear shifting and drifting through turns are examples useful maneuvers that take time to master, but will improve your play.


Shift to a lower gear when going through corners and higher when accelerating. Timing the shift is key! You can use the sound of the engine and the car’s tachometer to help you gauge when to shift upwards.
The general concept of drifting is: go through a sharp turn while accelerating enough so that tire traction is lost and the rear of the car moves opposite to your turn. Turn the wheel to match the direction of the rear and release the accelerator. As soon as you start to gain traction straighten out the wheels to the direction you want to go.

, Using a practice mode let’s you experiment with techniques and learn cars/tracks in a non-competitive environment,

, If you can’t match your opponent’s top speed, then don’t try to pass in straightaways. Look for small advantages in turns or hills. Small bursts of speed can add up.

, Depending on the physics of the game you play, it may be advantageous to try and force your opponent to lose control of their car. Be careful when nudging, or you may lose control of your car as well. Typically you want aim for the rear sides of your opponent for the best results.

, Try switching up your driving style to confuse your opponent. If you’re normally a conservative driver, get aggressive, and vice versa. Make sure you don’t sacrifice control of your car in your efforts to psyche them out!


If you are playing in the same room as your opponent, a bit of distracting banter can go a long way.

Create a New Game.,

Evolve Air and Water.,
Devolve High Lethal Symptoms.,
Evolve Drug Resistance.,
Evolve Cold Resistance.,
Evolve Hypersensitivity.,
Evolve Major Lethal Symptoms.,
Use Your Extra DNA.,
Keep your Cure Low.",How to Beat Parasite Brutal Mode in Plague Inc.," Choose New Game and then tap on “Parasite.”


If you have a saved game previously, it will be replaced and can no longer be recovered. Select “Brutal Mode” for the level, then proceed to giving your plague a name.;
, At this part, you will be able to assign Genetic Code for your Plagues. Genes are unlocked after you have beaten the previous stages.


You can refer to the guide below for your Genetic setup, but you can choose whatever you see is effective for this level.
Under the DNA Genes, choose “Cytochrome Surge.” This will give you more DNA points whenever you pop an orange DNA.
For the Travel Gene, Teracyte is advisable since it increases the chance of your plague to spread by land. It can cross borders as long as there's enough host.
The Evolution Gene should be Sympto-Stasis; this will make the plague easier to cure but the symptoms in the later part of the game doesn't increase it's DNA points requirement. This is a very important part of the strategy. You don't have to worry about the Cure percentage in this stage since we will be using the 'undetected' approach until we have spread the plague in every part of world.
Choose Genetic Mimic for your Mutation Gene. This will make the Parasite harder to cure, a good choice to counterbalance the Sympto-Statsis' drawback.
Lastly, Extremophile is the best option for your Environment Gene. This will give minor bonus in all environments, giving your Parasite a faint boost to enter nations with different types of climate.

, The best and most favored starting country to many Plague Inc. players because of its high population and access to airport and seaport. China is a good alternative, but at some level of the games it shows that China may spread your plague in a very slow pace.


If you choose India, the very first country that will be infected is most likely China. From there, the plague will spread faster and effectively since there are already a good number of host from India.
After choosing your starting country, pop red and yellow bubbles to gather DNA points.
Don't forget to speed up your game to fast forward. You can find the option at the upper right of the screen.

, Keep in mind that every plague type has unique abilities which can give you huge advantage. Parasite possesses Symbiosis, an ability to make your plague more in tune with the host, making it less likely to be noticed; evolve this until Level 3.


Continue popping bubbles until you have gathered enough DNA points.
Don't add any symptoms or transmissions yet until you have evolved Symbiosis to its last Level.

, After you have successfully evolved Symbiosis to Level 3, you can now evolve Cyst and Anaemia. You can find these Symptoms in the DNA Window and then tap on “Symptoms” tab.


Cyst is a painful lump containing pockets of pathogen which has a slight chance of bursting which can spread the Parasite. To put it simple, this symptom help increase the infectivity of your plague.
Anaemia is a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood which can lead to hypoxia in the organs. This, too, increases the infectivity.
Generally, evolving Symptoms at the earliest part will make humans aware of the plague, causing them to do research for the cure before you could even infect the whole world, but with the Parasite's ability, Symbiosis, level 1 and level 2 symptoms are less likely noticed.

, Since we have evolved the Cyst, it's time to make use of its pathogen. As mentioned, cyst contains lumps that releases pathogens when it burst.


To add infectivity, we need to evolve Air and Water. These Genes can be found under the “Transmissions” tab. Evolve Water to 1 while Air should be Level 2.

, There are chances that the Plague will mutate random symptoms which is fine, since mutated genes doesn't reduce your DNA points, but make sure to devolve any symptoms that has lethal level.


“Lethal” will alarm the researchers, causing them focus on creating the Cure to eradicate your plague so make sure to keep Lethal low.

, As you have notice, the spreading of your plague is still slow despite having a high level of transmission. The reason to this is that civilians can use medication to fight against your parasite.


To stop this, evolve your Drug Resistance to 1. It can be found under the “Abilities” tab. Your plague will dramatically spread to other nation in decent speed, especially in poor countries.

, One of the obstacles in spreading to other nations is the climate. Evolve your Cold Resistance to Level 2.


This will strengthen your Parasite and will be able to spread quickly in cold countries such as Canada, Greenland, etc. Don't forget to devolve symptoms with Lethal.
There's no need to evolve the Hot Resistance since you have lay your plague in India; it is already immune to warm climates. Save your DNA points for the later part of the game.

, If this symptom hasn't evolve, use your DNA points to do so. Again, this increases the infectivity of your plague.


After this, return to your game and pop more bubbles and wait until all the nations are infected, or until a message “There are no healthy people left in the world” appears on your screen.

, As soon as you receive a message announcing that there are no healthy people left in the world, it's time to evolve the deadly symptoms.


Go to your “Symptoms” tab and then evolve the following: Paralysis, Total Organ Failure, and Coma. This will start killing people and cure will start to increase, as well.

, As the population starts to decline, you will receive a generous amount of DNA Points. Use this to evolve Internal Hemorrhaging, Hemorrhagic Shock, and Necrosis. Don't worry about the cure percentage.

, All nations will be working together in order to create a cure. Stop this by evolving the Genetic Hardening Ability and Genetic Reshuffle.


This will reduce the cure amount which will increase your final score. Before the cure reaches 50%, humanity has been eradicated by your killer Parasite. Congratulations, you won the game!

What you choose here will have a huge impact on how the game plays out, so choose wisely. There are a few suggested upgrades that you should pick to make this game easier:


DNA Gene - ATP Boost. This will give you extra DNA points at the beginning, which is essential for slowing down the cure.
Travel Gene - Aquacyte. Basically required to infect difficult islands like Greenland, Iceland, and New Zealand.
Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis. This will keep symptom costs low.
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This slows the cure progression, which is important because the search for the cure starts immediately.
Environment Gene - Extremophile. This boosts the infection rate in every environmental condition.;
, Before choosing a starting country, use your ATP Boost bonus to purchase a few starting upgrades. These will make your life much easier later on in the game, and will help mitigate the cure.


Code fragment interception - This will help slow down the cure.
Coughing
Cysts
Abscesses
Insomnia
Paranoia

, Your starting country is very important, as this will determine how quickly the virus starts spreading. Most guides recommend starting in India due to the large population and proximity to China, though others suggest Saudi Arabia.


As soon as you choose a country, work will begin on the cure.

, At the start of the game, you should prioritize certain upgrades to give you a much better chance later on. As you start collecting DNA, evolve the following upgrades, in order as soon as you can afford them:Code segment interception
Nausea
Vomiting
Drug Resistance 1
Genetic Hardening 1 and 2

, If you receive pop-ups informing you that planes or ships have been sterilized, you should prioritize the corresponding transmission methods:


If airplanes are sterilized, evolve Air 1 immediately.
If ships are sterilized, evolve Water 1 immediately.

, Your next few upgrades are aimed at slowing down the progression of the cure. These symptoms make the cure more difficult, and should be evolved as soon as possible:


Hyper-sensitivity
Paralysis
Coma
Seizures
Insanity

, The following upgrades make your virus harder to kill and more likely to spread. Evolve these quickly to increase the rate which your virus infects new countries and decrease the cure's research rate:Radical elements stabilized
Water 2
Air 2
Extreme bioaerosol
Drug Resistance 2
Cold Resistance 1 and 2

, Now that your virus is spreading, it's time to evolve some more symptoms. These will increase the infection rate, leading to an even quicker global infection:


Pneumonia
Sneezing
Rash
Sweating
Anemia
Hemophilia
Skin Lesions
Diarrhea

, There are a couple more upgrades that you should focus on to decrease the cure progress. These are not available until late in the game:


Encryption Breached
Drug Immunity

, Once every country in the world is infected, this ability can increase the infectivity of your virus. The downside is that after a short time, the infectivity will decrease to lower than its original value, so only use this after all countries are infected.

, Occasionally, your virus will randomly mutate. It's highly recommended that you devolve these symptoms as they appear, as they can start killing people before the infection spreads to everyone.

, Towards the end of the game, you will be racing against the cure. The Genetic Reshuffle ability will slow down the cure's progress, and is a good investment when you don't have much else to evolve. There are three levels, each of which will set the cure back.

, When every person in the world is infected, you will receive a pop-up message. At this point, you're safe to evolve every lethal symptom, as you don't have to worry about infecting new people. At this point, the faster you can kill everyone off, the better.

Have a really good team to complete this dungeon.,
For the first boss, Yevgeny, defy his stuns for each blade you cast for your attacker.,
Take care of the second boss.,
Face Malistaire.",How to Beat Castle Darkmoor (Graveyard)," You all need to know the strategies, and cheats of the bosses. You all need to be synchronized and communication throughout the dungeon. Communication is an important thing for this dungeon;
, So just use stun block on the people who are going to blade the attacker. After every 4 rounds, he uses one of the shadow enhanced spells on you with a bubble, blade, and traps on everyone. So you want to blade and trap as fast as possible so that he doesn't cast one of those powerful attacks on you!

, The second boss in the Graveyard dungeon is Shane von Shane. In the second dungeon of Darkmoor, you see him as the school of death. However he is now storm which will make him way harder to beat. There is a simple strategy that will allow you to kill him in under three rounds! (You need to go first for this one). On the first round, you want the first 2 people to use the spell Choke, so that the minions cannot use any devious spells on you. The third person should blade the storm wizard, causing Shane von Shane to use supercharge with a lot of pips, then the storm should use the spell Steal Charm, to steal his 100% plus blade. On the second round, the storm wizard should mass prism, while the first person only uses choke, and the second wizard use death dispel, then the third wizard should use a feint. On the third and final round, the first three people should blade the storm, while the storm uses either Sirens, Storm Bugs, or possibly Storm lord.

, Now you are at the final, and last battle of the dungeon! Malistaire the Undying has many cheats, but he's not very hard once you have a good strategy. The Dragon Titan takes away your blades every 4 rounds. So in the first 4 rounds, you should blade up the storm wizard, so that he can kill the minions. Once the minions are dead, you should obviously focus primarily on Malistaire. Windstorms, Traps, and Blades should do the trick. Try to keep track of the round so that you don't end up wasting your pips on blades. Right before you attack, have someone use the treasure card version of Doom and Gloom. In his shadow form, he will not be at 99,999 health, instead at being 25,000-30,000 health. Also, at this state, the dragon titan will start to betray malistaire and give a universal 100+ which will help you a lot when killing him. Once you kill him, Wa La! you have completed the dungeon

When he comes back as an ice element, repeat steps 2 to 3 using your Wrench until you’ve depleted his health. Then drain more ADAM from him.
When he comes back as an electric element, repeat steps 2 to 4 until you’ve depleted his health.

, When you’ve drained his 3rd ADAM, splicers will come out to attack you. Ignore them if you can. Just focus your attacks on Atlas until you have a chance to drain his last ADAM to finish him off.


With some patience (especially on hard mode), you will be able to combine all these steps together and pull off a full on assault on Atlas, and he will be defeated in no time! Happy hunting!

Control yourself before you break your controller.,
Take a break.,
Plan healthy distractions ahead of time.,
Game in comfort.",How to Avoid Snapping when Losing a Video Game1," What happened the last time your snapped? You probably didn’t sit down, take a few cheap hits in Mortal Kombat, and spike your controller into smithereens. Chances are, you got worked up over the course of back-to-back-to-back headshots right as your character spawned. Who wouldn’t snap!? Watch out for signs that you’re about to snap and try to chill before it happens.Before each new mission, level, or respawn, take a moment to gauge your heartrate. Gaming is fun, so your love muscle is probably pumping like mad. That said, if it’s going a little too fast, and your cheeks are flushed, take a breather.
If you start spewing words your grandmother wouldn’t like, put your controller down immediately. You’re nearing meltdown.;
, In between epic campaigns - or every other Tetris level – get up. Walk to the kitchen. Eat a carrot. Have a glass of water. Go outside. Listen to the birds sing or contemplate the stars. The point is: give your brain or your mouth something else to ruminate.You don’t have to give up on beating the game tonight – you totally still can. You’re more likely to do so with your mood intact if you take quick breaks from time to time.
In fact, your virtual sword may fall with heavier swings if you give yours eyes and thumbs a break periodically.

, In order to help you chill after a loss, have a non-video game entertainment option already planned out. This doesn’t have to be anything grandiose. For instance, set that magazine you’ve been meaning to read next to you. Even better, get your running shoes out or pump up your bike tires. When you feel your blood begin to boil, blow some steam by working out.You can always return to your game if you so desire. Working a healthy activity into your day may even help you execute in the virtual realm.
Game for shorter periods of time. This may sound like a terrible idea, but it’s an important step if you want to do a better job of keeping your cool. Your patience will begin to run thin during marathon gaming sessions.
Set a timer for yourself at the start of a gaming session. Have a plan for what to do when the timer goes off.

, Discomfort unrelated to the game may also make you agitated. If it’s uncomfortably hot in your gaming arena… er, room, you’re much more liable to snap. If you’ve been postponing dinner to continue your quest, this too shall increase your risk of snapping. Though you should work on controlling your temper regardless of environment, it’s easier to do so when you’re comfortable.If it feels like the furnace of Mordor or the ice plains of Hoth, adjust that thermostat.
Keep an apple beside your console. Not only might this remind you to collect real-world nutrients to prevent a meltdown, it will also offer another distraction within easy reach.

Take responsibility for your actions.,
After you snap, reflect.,
Laugh at yourself.,
Learn from the loss.,
Give yourself a “talking to.” You may need a dose of tough love.",How to Avoid Snapping when Losing a Video Game2," It’s extremely important to recognize that you alone are responsible for your real world behavior. In order to avoid snapping, recognize that it is you and you alone that allows yourself to behave this way. You must accept this responsibility in order to start changing your behavior.You won’t get better at a game unless you recognize how you can approach it differently. The same rule applies to how you handle a loss emotionally. Acknowledge the issue so you can begin addressing it.

, There are several questions you can ask yourself to help prevent it from happening again. Foremost, gauge how you feel after your composure returns. Literally ask yourself, “How am I feeling right now?” You might not like your answer, but that’s okay. Next, ask yourself, “Did that contribute anything positive to my day?” It’s a loaded question – but be honest with yourself.By forcing your mind to acknowledge your behavior, you may be able to keep your emotions in check next time you lose in a video game.
Adjust the wording of questions like this however you wish. The point is to acknowledge that it doesn’t feel good when you snap. Other options include, “Did that solve anything?” or “How did that improve the situation?”

, Don’t mock or judge yourself. You should, however, look for the humor in these situations. Though this may not happen easily, it can help the process of self-reflection by easing the rapid emotional descent you’ve just endured. While laughing might not seem proactive, the ability to do so indicates that you’ve regained control of your emotions. This is vital to making a decision about how to prevent another meltdown., You’re probably thinking: “Yeah, right! They’re just a nooby &@*%-cheat!” Well, that nooby &@*%-cheat is roaring with laughter in some darkened, victory-filled dungeon. Instead of losing your cool, start thinking about how to make sure it never happens again. While someone else might be at fault – or deserve some credit – the fact of the matter is that you were in a situation that led to your loss.Immediately think about why you lost. Try to identify the specific decision that put you in position to lose. Ask yourself, “What you could have done differently to prevent this loss?”
Plan how you’ll approach the same scenario differently next time. This will not only help your game improve, it will also keep you from losing your cool.

, This may be especially effective if you’re the one that dishes it out. If you keep snapping, sit yourself down and think about what’s actually happening: You are sitting on a couch, staring at a box, and holding a piece of plastic. Further, remind yourself video games are supposed to be fun.State these or other brutally honest points to yourself out loud. It may not be fun to force yourself back into the real world, but it may help you control yourself next time around.
On the other hand, congratulate yourself too. Take note of healthy responses to losses, and recognize that this is evidence of improvement controlling your emotions. This will have real-world, positive effects on your life outside of gaming.

Ask for help from other gamers.,
Recognize that video games contribute to aggression.,
See a mental health professional.",How to Avoid Snapping when Losing a Video Game3," Though live gameplay usually doesn’t show it, the gaming community definitely watches out for its own. Whether you’re looking for advice on how to approach a particular game scenario so you don’t lose again, or need help controlling your temper after losses, plenty of people are able to give you advice.Start by talking to other friends that game. The harder they game, the more likely they’ll have endured a similar situation. In particular, ask about specific things they do to keep their cool.
You can also find plenty of advice online. You can even find play-by-play advice about how to avoid losing in certain ways.
Avoid paying for gaming advice online. There are plenty of free options on blogs.
If you can’t find what you’re looking for, post a question on a popular message board. Even if nobody knows what to tell you, someone will tell you where to look!

, Put simply, there is objective, scientific evidence that video games cause aggression. This aggression is not necessarily tied to gunning down hundreds of electric blips on a computerized version of D-Day or hatcheting your way through a horde of the undead. Instead, aggression is actually tied to poor performance. It’s losing itself that causes gamers to fantasize or engage in violence.If you can’t control your temper enough to follow a loss with healthy behavior, it may be time to take a break from gaming altogether.
If you can focus on how to improve after a loss, and keep having fun – stick with it. Not only will you get better at keeping your cool – you’ll lose less too!
If you ever have thoughts about hurting others, such as the desire to hit someone, see a mental health professional to talk about your anger.

, If you are in any way concerned about your ability to control your temper, or the amount of time you’re spending playing video games, set up an appointment to speak with someone about it. Mental health professionals can help you learn to control both your emotions and your behavior.


If you’re still in school, see a school counselor at your earliest convenience.
Outside of school, any mental health professional will help you identify your options. There are support groups online and in person for emotional control issues as well as gaming addiction.

Hide in the shadows, and preferably stay behind people.,
Never break the locks.,
Hang from ledges so you can drop down on enemies and knock them out.

,
Crouch when necessary.,
Avoid enemy contact as much as possible.",How to Be Good at Splinter Cell," This way, enemies won't see you sneak up on them.;
, If you pick them you will make less noise, attracting fewer enemies. Also, guards may raise an alarm if they find that a lock is broken.

,, Movement while crouched is slowed. The slower you move, the more quietly you move, so you won't be easily noticed.

, That means using the air vents and pipes instead of the short and easy paths. The road less traveled makes all the difference!

, Do they sound realistic or closely resemble sounds you’ve heard before? Does the hum of a race car's engine as it passes by sound realistic? Do your character’s footsteps on stone, wood flooring, dirt, and grass sound realistic? How do the sound effects draw you in to the world of the game?

, Think about all the time and effort put into each little nook and cranny in the level. Look at the fine details, like bumps on a rock, single blades of grass, and unique clouds. In older games or games with simpler graphics, pay attention to how the game artists dealt with limitations to produce the best possible visual effects. How do the game's visuals affect your experience?

, Understand that a real person’s voice was behind theirs. Search for small graphical details during the cut scenes, when the graphics are usually the best. Look for things like strands of hair or clothing moving in the wind, characters blinking and things in the background.

, One way to approach this is through the MDA framework - mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. Think about how the different aspects of the game interact and affect your playing experience.

The mechanics of the game include the rules, basic gameplay components, and algorithms involved.
The dynamics are the ways the mechanics combine and interact when actually playing the game.
The aesthetics are the emotional responses evoked in the player while playing the game.

, When applying to attend E3, they look for a site that is professional and is a major video gaming website. A blog from somewhere such as WordPress or tumblr won't cut it.

, Be sure that it looks professional, that it's easy to browse around, and that it has good quality content that will keep your visitors interested and wanting to come back.

, Not only will your visitors look at it when determining how they like your website, you'll also need one when creating a business card for your website., Now that you've done everything you need to do in creating your website, it's time to launch it.

, Not only should you write about the latest news in the gaming industry, but you should also write editorials, game reviews, and other opinion pieces. This will set your website apart from others. Make sure your headlines are catchy. Instead of something like ""Shigeru Miyamoto talks about the Wii U,"" write something such as ""Nintendo has high hopes for the Wii U, says Shigeru Miyamoto."" Be sure that you provide new content on a regular basis to keep viewers coming. No one wants to go to a site that is rarely updated.

, You need to get the word about about your website, so advertise on sites such as Google Plus, reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. If you write good content for your website, you'll find that your visitors will advertise your website to others as well.

, Your site has to be live for at least 6 months before you can register for E3. Preferably, you'll want to wait longer in order for your site to become popular, and that you'll become used to writing regularly.

, You'll need business cards with your site's logo on it in order to register. Make a batch of around 100 of them to give to people at the event.

, You'll need a legal ID such as a driver's license in order to register.

, Follow all of the instructions for registration, and make sure you have everything you need before registering such as a business card and legal ID. You'll also need an article with your name on it that you have published on your website within the past 3 months.

, Make sure that the trip fits within your personal schedule.

, E3 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center at downtown Los Angeles, California. If you live far away, book a plane ride to California in advance, and choose an affordable hotel that's near the convention center. Your trip may require an overnight stay, so pack clothing and other materials that you'll want a few days before the trip.

, It's important to continue doing so in order to keep your viewers coming, and to ensure that they'll be at your website for your E3 coverage.

, You can find a list of the days and times that you can do this on the E3 website under ""Media FAQ."" You'll need to bring your registration confirmation and photo ID with you.

, Be sure to arrive before the time that the event starts to beat the crowd, and that you have your media badge, badge holder, business cards, and photo ID with you.

, Otherwise, you won't remember the details later when you're writing coverage about the conferences. Don't worry about bringing a laptop with you, as they have a media center where you can write stories and publish them.

, Take notes about your experiences with them so that you can write about your impressions of them on your website.

, You'll want to take pictures of the showroom, the games, and other things that you're interested in so that you can publish them on your website. Having pictures will also set your website's coverage of the event apart from other websites that only cover news of the event.

, How did you like it, and how can you do things differently the next time that you're there? If you're going for more than one day, prepare for it while you're at your hotel room. If you'd like, write an editorial or other piece about the overall experience on your website.

It is easy to kill, but if it catches up to you, it will stamp on you with its massive forelegs. When hunting the Brontotherium, quietly sneak up on it and fire from a medium to far range from your weapon. However, the only weapon that is effective against this animal is the sniper rifle, although the other weapons can be used against the Brontotherium.


Don't get too close, because this could cause the Brontotherium to charge and eventually kill you.;
, This is the second animal available to hunt on the hunt menu. It is not considered dangerous unless it is either wounded or cornered. It is a plant eater as described, and senses of sight are weak, but senses of smell and hearing are very good. When hunting the wild boar, do not get too close, as it could charge.


The wild boar's killing animation differs from that of other herbivores featured in the game: it kills the player by impaling him on its huge tusks and shaking him around like a rag doll.

, The wolf is the third animal available to hunt, and also the first carnivore in the game. As its description describes, it prowls the land howling for others of its kind, and then attacks and rips any unlucky hunter to shreds. The wolf is labeled as very dangerous on the hunt menu, possibly because it scares a bit easier than most other carnivores.


When hunting the wolf, be very careful. It is the second most aggressive carnivore in Carnivores Ice Age, and its idle animations consist of it panting and howling and producing dog like barks. Once you finally succeed in killing a wolf, you will earn 7 points.

, The fourth animal available to hunt, the woolly mammoth is dangerous when cornered or surprised, and will gore you if you get too close with its sharp horns. It is also commonly seen while not being hunted.

, The Diatryma is a large omnivorous bird and the fifth animal available to hunt. It is the only pointable animal to not be a mammal. Once the Diatryma catches up to the hunter, it will jump to attack its victims and eat them instead of swinging them around in its mouth.

, This animal is also known as the Irish elk or the Megaloceros, and is the sixth animal available to hunt. At close range, the giant deer will gore the player with its huge antlers and shake him around like a rag doll. It is also one of the weakest creatures in the game, capable of being brought down with a close shot of the X-Bow, shotgun, or DB shotgun.

, This is a new animal featured in Carnivores Ice Age. It is also known as the Indricotherium. If a hunter fails to bring down a charging Paraceratherium, it will repeatedly crush the hunter under its mighty front legs, much like the Brontotherium.

, This is another new animal on Carnivores Ice Age. It is slower than all of the other animals featured. If a Doedicurus manages to catch up to you, it will kill you by clubbing you with its massive spiked tail.

, The smilodon is unlocked in Carnivores Ice Age after the player earns 250 credits. It is the most aggressive carnivore in the game, and rightly described as extremely dangerous. Whenever you are killed by it, the smilodon will slam your corpse repeatedly on the ground with its mouth.

, The mammoth is the largest animal in Carnivores Ice Age. Its killing animation consists of it swinging the hunter from side to side and then smashing him into the ground. Often, when using a stronger weapon against the mammoth, it can be bought down while charging. At close range, however, it is considered dangerous, especially when wounded. A smaller weapon such as the pistol is not considered effective against the mammoth at close range.

, The Titanis is a large bird featured in Carnivores Ice Age. It is marked on the map with a yellow ""?"" and can be killed like any other creature. At close range, the Titanis will use its sharp beak to slice and devour you if you have previously approached it or have attempted to bring it down.

, The hyaenodon is a new and pointable animal in Carnivores Ice Age. It is labeled as a very dangerous predator in the game, and if it catches up to the hunter, it will pin its prey to the ground and rip it to pieces. Caution and stealth must be used when hunting the hyaenodon.

, The Andrewsarchus is a new animal in Carnivores Ice Age. Unlike most smaller carnivores featured above other than the hyaenodon, Andrewsarchus is very aggressive. It will charge the hunter when wounded, no matter what distance it is from it and its attacker. Like the hyaenodon, Andrewsarchus will pin its prey to the ground to eat, instead of thrashing him about.

, The bear is a pointable animal in Carnivores Ice Age. Despite being described as extremely dangerous, the bear is actually a very shy predator. The bear shares its call with the Yeti. The bear kills the player by biting the player`s arm and smashing him into the ground.

, The yeti is a bonus animal kept secret until the player earns 1,000 points. The yeti kills the hunter by grabbing his legs and repeatedly smashing him on the ground. It is incorrectly given the stats of the Tyrannosaurus on the hunt menu. It also has the same call and idle animation as the bear. The yeti has white fur and red skin.

Create the context for the thought experiment:


Let there be an event of change, A, which is caused by electrons giving off photons as they move in their orbital shells around the nucleus of their atoms;
Let each electron be spinning, and have sides S1 and S2, such that side S1 is toward the Observer and S2 is opposite the Observer;
Further, let the photon(s) be emitted from side S1;
Let there be an Observer O, who will perceive the photons after they have travelled some distance, d, at lightspeed;
Let the Observer O also be constituted of electrons that absorb the incoming photon(s), and have sides S3, towards and absorbing the photon(s), and side S4, opposite the absorption;
Let the time t occurring during the light's travel at lightspeed over distance d be negligible.,
Assume the given condition, ""PARTICLE SPIN"":


Let the electrons in the thought experiment be subject to ""spin"", though they be particle-waves or cloud-like, along an axis more or less, as they traverse their orbit around the nucleus (much like the Earth spins on its axis as it goes around the Sun);
Understand that ""spin is ***not*** yet thoroughly understood by physicists and may ***not*** occur around a single axis at all!

,
Define the term ""ordinary time"" to be the time that elapses when an electron orbits around the nucleus of the atom many times, in order to make up a partial second that human beings can sense visually, perhaps about 1/48th of a second.

,Assume that spin does occur around an axis, then we might also assume that the photon carries the information of the electron's state to the perceiving electron;

,Assume also that the information belongs to facing side S1 and not to opposite side S2;

,
Consider that the electron is constantly spinning, assume S1 becomes S2 and S2 spins around to face the Observer and becomes S1 (unless a photon strikes the electron in the interim or there is some other dynamic event); that is ...

,
Theorize that THE ""PRESENT"" BECOMES THE ""PAST"", and THE ""FUTURE"" spins around to become THE ""PRESENT"".,
Conclude, given that since there are many electrons within an ELECTRONIC FIELD as this all occurs, that we may suppose that a PATTERN OF INFORMATION is passed to the Observer more or less continuously over a period of time, and it is IN the continuity of that pattern that we HAVE the experience OF Time itself.,
Let the theory then account for the fact that the immediate future is typically very similar to the immediate past.

Don't rush your product but at the same time don't take forever on miscellaneous details. Plan it out and stop halfway through and re-assess what you can and can't afford to do.;
, If you aren't making an open-world RPG pay careful attention to your storyline. Find ways to make it deeper and interactive as often as you can. Sometimes a great storyline can save an RPG with so-so gameplay. On the other hand, a bad storyline can kill an RPG with outstanding gameplay. This is what the player is going to be following for some ~20-80 hours of their life. If they don't like the story in the slightest bit, they will drop it within the first couple of hours.

, Yes, even in the most linear of RPGs you need to have sidequests and optional dungeons and bosses. Players like to explore and take on new challenges. Don't be the one to deny them that.

, It is fine if a game's setting, mood, and so on so forth, is foreign to the player but make sure it fits and is crafted carefully. A lack of atmosphere can make the player feel disembodied from the story and a broken one can destroy immersion and ruin a perfectly good story for the audience. When done right, your game can do just the opposite and draw the audience in.

, Even if you don't make a game with branching dialogue options or multiple endings, it is still good to consider choice and imagine where it might fit into the game. This helps you look at the story from the player's perspective and not just the character's. Are players really going to like the new NPC you introduced even if he's on their side? If not, don't make the party constantly take actions to keep that NPC in the spotlight, or have a character with an unfriendly disposition interact a little more with the NPC than others to give some satisfaction back to the player.

, It's kind of like the cherry on top. If the player is able to explore and find more challenges to take on they will applaud you all the more for it. On top of that, it keeps players engaged with your game after the climactic showdown with the big baddie. This will make them more likely to spread the word about your game or replay it at a later date.

, If players have to consistently grind at certain parts of the game to stay on par then something is wrong.

, Usually the core gameplay of simple RPGs is combat but regardless of what your core gameplay is, make sure it holds up and stays varied within its bounds. For instance if you use a quest system as well. Make sure to vary the quests available and keep them interesting.

, Most original characters have the issue of being n-sided. No matter how many characteristics you add, the character will always feel lacking in some areas and too opinionated in others. Realistically, a character has an infinite number of faucets to their personality but it is understandable if that is hard to accomplish. Rather, pick a theme for the character and work from there.

, Let the player create their own character or make them a silent protagonist. In the end, the main character probably won't be leaving the player's sight, so make sure it is someone they like.

, A dark sorrowful story can't stay that way for too long and realistically no character is able to stay so depressed for so long without doing something drastic. Show that they are still human without killing the atmosphere.

, The main issue with angsty characters in RPGs these days is that most don't have much to be angsty about or perhaps the source of their emotional tension isn't addressed or expressed well. Keep their motivations personal and their angst justified and expressed properly and the player will at the very least show some respect for them.

, If you don't understand radiant AI, here is an example: you have an easy quest you forgot to complete in one of the earlier towns and you want to finish it off. As you backtrack the enemies are scaled to your level in order to keep the quest relevant at this stage of the game. This isn't necessary in every RPG but it works wonders in larger, open-exploration ones such as Final Fantasy XII (it's radiant AI would be the LP you gain from killing wolves in the Estersand) where backtracking is inevitable.

, These aren't really necessary but they are often fun to find and digest. At least they let the player know that you had some fun making the game and put your heart into it.

, If the main villain doesn't react to the player characters or even recognize their existence then there's something wrong. Inactivity needs to be explained and major events need a response, however small they may be. The main villain is, in the end, a character too.

, This goes without saying. The smaller story arcs that span from town to town need an antagonist obviously. Make sure they aren't just token characters though.

, Create one yourself if you can, just make sure the basic tune can portray the story's main themes.

, Optional sidequests that pop up in revisited towns are a basic example of this. Others can be tied to the main storyline such as a dragon flying from the cave you just exited to attack the party's hometown. Or maybe something as subtle as changing most of the NPCs' dialogue in a given town after a short cutscene in a different town. Mix it up and come up with some of your own.

, Saving the world is wonderful but ask yourself if that kind of plot device is really necessary. If the characters would not fight the final boss if it wasn't going to destroy the world then you should probably rethink your character's motivations and work on the story from there.

, Let your game have its own style and feel to it. While it is true that new-age graphics doesn't make a game inherently fun, a good sense of aesthetic can help the player get into the storyline, especially in cutscenes.

, While it feels good to have that one lucky critical strike win a tough boss fight for the player, it is equally as frustrating to lose to a random encounter due to a lucky status effect proc. Start by making the combat system constant and tweak it with luck effects from there.

, Do whatever you need to do to keep the player aware of the game's current main objectives and don't make them go on a scavenger hunt for said objective.

, If a player in the mid stages of the game can easily clear an encounter with a round of AoE spells without even thinking then you are doing something wrong. The idea here is to use ""easy, if handled correctly"" encounters so as to not upset the balance of power.

, Don't just throw in the old random encounter system and if you do make sure you test the rng for it. Try to find a way that allows for fast dungeon crawling and streamlined level grinding when needed.

, A lot of fledgling rpgs make the mistake of these big dramatic maps and dungeons that are confusing and waste the player's time with dead ends and long linear corridors. Don't waste the player's time by wasting yours creating a labyrinth.

Most text-based games focus on a story, a puzzle, or an adventure that combines story, exploration, and puzzles. Here are several free options:



Twine is quick and easy to use in your browser.
StoryNexus and Visionaire add more gameplay options and static images.

Inform7 is a more powerful tool with a large community of supporters.;
, GameMaker and Stencyl are good options that work for any genre, and they give you the option to use programming without requiring it. Scratch! is another tool you can use for browser games.

, A 3D game is a much bigger challenge than a 2D game, so be prepared for a long project and a lot of hard work. Spark and Game Guru will save you some of this effort by letting you build the world without programming. If you already have some programming knowledge or want to start learning how to code, try the extremely popular game engine Unity.


If you want to craft your own 3D models instead of using pre-made assets, you'll need 3D modeling software such as 3DS Max, Blender, or Maya.

, Even if you have a programming background, you may want to use one of the engines above for your first game, and you shouldn't feel obligated to try a different approach just because it is more difficult. That said, some people enjoy the extreme level of control they get from building a game from scratch. Ideally, program the game in an Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse rather than a text editor, so you can put together everything you need in one convenient project.


While you can program a game in almost any language,, learning C++ will give you a powerful tool that has plenty of game-development resources and tutorials online.

, For your first project, making a typical, small example of a genre you like is a fine starting point, such as a platformer or a role-playing game. Before you get started, write down any ideas you have for what the game will be like, and your answers to the following questions:


What is the main component of the game play (the ""core"" game play)? This could be fighting enemies, solving puzzles, or talking to other characters.
What do you want that game play to look like? For example, fighting enemies can happen with real-time button-pushing or turn-based tactical decisions. Dialogue-heavy games can let the player shape the plot based on his decisions, or they can be more about learning as much as you can about the characters and world.
What is the mood of the game? Is it creepy, cheerful, mysterious, exciting?

, If you're using a game engine or game-making tool for the first time, this is a great time to play around with the tool. Learn how to place backgrounds, objects, and moving characters. If possible, make objects that the player can interact with, or look through the software's ready-made objects and see if they come with built-in interactions.


If you're not sure how to do something, ask about it on the tool's website or search online for help.
Don't worry about lighting effects and other graphical ""extras"" yet.

, This can involve minor tweaks to the game creation software, or more complex systems being built from the ground up. Here are some examples:


If you're making a platformer, do you want the character to be able to double-jump or perform other ""special"" movement? Play around with the height the character can jump, and whether you want different responses from a light tap, holding down the key, or choosing from several jumps of different types.
If you're making an action role-playing game or horror game, which weapons does the player start out with? Choose two or three weapons that the player can upgrade to, and test them out. Try to make the choice between weapons interesting. For instance, a weapon can deal more damage, hit more than one enemy, or make enemies weaker. Don't make it the best option for all of these purposes unless it comes with a high cost (a spell that costs more mana, or a weapon that falls apart after one use.)
In a dialogue-based game, do you want the player to choose between dialogue ""branches"" listed on the screen, or mostly just listen, perform a task elsewhere to unlock more dialogue, and return to hear more? Do you want the player to find out everything in one play-through, or should there be multiple paths and endings?

, Three to five short levels is a good target for your first game, though you always have the option of expanding it afterwards. Keeping the ""core game play"" design above in mind, make the challenge of each level a little different. You can either make these levels in order, or make them all separate and put them together once you're finished, whichever is easiest for you.


A platformer usually introduces moving platforms or faster enemies.
An action game can introduce swarms of enemies, a single strong enemy, and enemies that are hard to beat without a specific weapon or tactic.
A puzzle game usually sticks with a single type of puzzle, and either just uses more difficult versions each level, or introduces new tools or obstacles that require more thought from the player.

, These are often referred to as ""secondary mechanics"" or ""secondary gameplay loops."" By using the core gameplay mechanic, such as jumping, the player advances the secondary gameplay as well, such as stomping on enemies or collecting items. This in turn can lead to longer-term accomplishments and goals, such as reaching the end of the level, saving up money for an upgrades, and eventually beating the game.


As you can tell from the example, you might have included these already without even realizing it. Just make sure the player can quickly figure out that there are goals out there. If the player plays for ten minutes and thinks the whole game is shooting enemies over and over again, she might get bored. If she kills the first enemy and gets a coin, she'll realize that she has a new goal (save up coins for a reward) and that the core gameplay will directly advance her toward it.

, Test every single level many times, and get friends or acquaintances to help you. Try to approach the game in many different ways, including methods you never intended such as ignoring quests and walking straight to the final boss, or trying to beat the game while choosing ""bad"" weapons or upgrades. This is a long process that can be frustrating, but fixing bugs and making sure the gameplay is fun for all players will be worth it.


Give your play-testers just enough information they need to get started. They should know that they're working with a work in progress, and how to use the basic controls. They don't need to know anything else.Give playtesters feedback forms so you have a record of all the information, and can easily compare and refer to it.This also lets you ask specific questions about parts of the game you are unsure about.
The most helpful playtesters are people who don't know you, and don't feel obligated to compliment your game., While you can find many free game assets through an online search, take some time to adjust anything that looks out of place, or hunt for replacements. Learn pixel art if you want to adjust simple art in your 2D game, or use software such as OpenGL if you're tackling an ambitious 3D project. Add lighting effects that encourage the player to walk through the main pathway of the room, and particle effects that show off cool attacks or add movement to the backgrounds. Add sound effects for walking, attacking, jumping, and anything else that needs it. While there's always opportunities for more tweaks and playtesting, your game is ready to release as soon as the visuals and audio are up to your standards. Congratulations!

(Basics) You need to know ALL basics of a RPG, such as the str, con, siz, and pow.,
The Advanced is all of the basics AND INT(intelligence).,Roll for the actions and abilities.,
Create the world.,
Create the quest line.,
Use the actions to your advantage if playing an advanced rpg.,
(Beating the game) Don't think about the ending at the beginning!",How to Play an RPG That You Made," You probably don't know what the heck ANY of these are but here are the basics. You need STR (strength), Con (health), Siz (size), and POW(all of these are variables. Magic, Will, and soul measurement), DEX (attack speed), and CHA (ability to get others to listen or follow).
, Also actions are included with advance. Jumping, Climbing, Listening, Pickpocket, Lock pick, Spot hidden items, Sneak, Throw, Fist, Hide, First aid. Also choose your class, Warrior, Mage, and Assassin.(you can create your own classes like in the Elder Scroll video games if you would like),, A world should always include a hometown, shops, inns, and houses(Others houses and houses you may buy., If you're playing with friends have them come up with things also.

Say that your quest involves finding the legendary crystal of Ariii, there is a legend that you must find all the Golden weapons to unlock the door and kill the Goldman, Goriaon. Create plenty of golden weapons(this is just an example of your game) to find, create temples to find the weapons and also Side Quests.
Side quests are quests that you can choose to do or not. With the main quests(EX. finding golden weapons) however, you can choose that you HAVE to do them or you DON'T have to do them.

, Just make sure that it doesn't get too confusing. If it does get way too confusing you can make it so there are only a couple of actions so that you know which one to use(it is just best to have all actions)., Think about how to beat it at the end. If you really like the game a lot you can make plenty of sequels that have all your levels and skills and actions, or you can make it a never ending game by using just side quests."

Click the yellow button that says ""Launch"" to run the Unreal Engine.

, A project, in the context of UE4, is a file used to store all the data for each game you are developing. When you open UE4, the first thing it will do is launch the Unreal Project Browser.

In the ""Projects"" tab, you can open your existing projects. In the ""New Project"" tab, you can create a new blank project or a new project based on a template. To create a new project, make your selections, then click on the green ""Create Project"" button in the bottom-right.

, A level, in the context of the Unreal Engine, is an area where gameplay occurs. To create, open, or save a level, use the File Menu.

To test a level directly in the Level Editor, use the play button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. To enter or exit full screen mode, use the F11 key.

, An actor, in the Unreal Engine, is any object that has been added to a level.

For example, find the cube in the menu on the left side of the screen. Click on it, then drag-and-drop it into the window in the middle. The cube in the middle window is now an actor within the level.
Note that not all actors are physical objects. For example, there are several actors that simply mark specific places in a Level where certain things should occur. These are still actors even though players will never see them in the game.

, Mesh is a 3D-modeling term that refers to visible 3D objects. Unreal Engine has two main types of mesh actors - the static mesh actor and the skeletal mesh actor.

The static mesh actor is for meshes with no moving parts.
The skeletal mesh actor is for meshes that do having moving parts.
The starter content contains some meshes you can use but third-party 3D-modeling programs, such as Maya, 3D Studio Max, or Blender, create most meshes used in games. You can find lots of meshes for free and for sale in the Epic Games Launcher and on the Internet in general.

, Brushes, also known as geometry brushes, are actors that model 3D space. This is very close to the definition of a mesh, but there are some key differences between the two.

Brushes are for simpler shapes while meshes are for more complex shapes. Brushes are easier to work with but require more memory. So, in general, use brushes to quickly prototype the layouts of levels, and then replace them with meshes for the final product. You can access brushes from the Geometry tab on the left side of the Editor.

, The material of an actor is a property that is common to both meshes and brushes. A material is an asset you can apply to the surfaces of Actors to make those actors appear to be made out of that material. For example, you could apply a wood material to a cube mesh to make a ""wooden cube."", The purpose of a light actor is to represent visible light. Note that they only represent the light itself and not the object from which the light emanates. For example, to have a lamp in your level, you would need a static mesh actor of a lamp, including the light bulb, in addition to a light actor in the same location as the bulb. There are four types of light actors in Unreal:

Directional Light Actor - used to mimic light coming from an extremely long distance away, such as outer space; used primarily for sunlight and moonlight.
Point Light - for light that emanates in all directions, like from a light bulb, or fire.
Spot Light - emits light in the shape of a cone, like from a flashlight, or, as the name suggests, a spot light.
Sky Light Actor - emulates the light that reflects off the atmosphere (the ""glow"" of the atmosphere).

, The Level Editor is the home screen when developing games in the Unreal Engine application. The large rectangle in the middle is the viewport. The thin strip above that is the toolbar. At the bottom of the screen is the content browser. On the left side of the screen is the modes panel. On the right side of the screen is the world outliner at the top, and below that, the details panel., To use mouse navigation, hold down one of the following mouse buttons or button combinations and drag the mouse to perform the action:

LMB - move forward or backwards, rotate left or right
LMB+RMB / MMB - move left, right, up, or down
RMB - rotate in any direction

, To use WASD navigation, keep the RMB held down the entire time: Maya refers to a popular 3D-modeling program that uses these controls. To use Maya navigation, keep the Alt key held down, then hold one of the following mouse buttons and drag the mouse

Drag the mouse - rotate in any direction

W, A, S, D keys - forward, left, backwards, right

Q and E keys - up, down

Z and C keys - zoom in and out

, Maya refers to a popular 3D-modeling program that uses these controls. To use Maya navigation, keep the Alt key held down, then hold one of the following mouse buttons and drag the mouse:

LMB - tumble/orbit the camera around a single point of interest
RMB - dolly/zoom the camera towards and away from a point of interest
MMB - track/pan the camera up, down, left, and right

, To move, rotate, and scale actors in the Level Editor, use the Move, Rotate, and Scale Tools. You can see which tool is selected by looking at the first three icons in the upper-right of the viewport.

To switch between the tools, click their icons, or use the shortcut keys W, E, and R.
When the Move Tool is selected, three colored arrows will appear on the currently selected actor. To move an actor along a particular axis, click on the corresponding arrow and drag the mouse. To move an actor in two dimensions, click on the connector between the arrows. For all three dimensions at once, click on the white sphere in the middle of the arrows.
When the Rotate Tool is selected, you can rotate an actor around one of the three axes by clicking on one of the colored arcs and dragging the mouse.
When the Scale Tool is selected, you can make your actors bigger or smaller. Just like with the Move Tool, you can manipulate the actor in one, two, or three dimensions at a time.

, When an actor is selected, the details panel will display the properties of that actor, most of which can be edited.

The transform category is common to all actors. In the transform category, you can move, rotate, and scale actors manually by entering values directly. This is useful when you need precision or exact values.
Mobility is a setting that applies primarily to mesh actors and light actors. For meshes, there are two options - static and moveable. Static means the actor will remain in place the entire time, while moveable means it's possible for the actor’s location to change. For light actors, there is a third option - stationary. This is used for lights that don’t move, but can change in other ways such as changing color or turning on or off.

, A blueprint in the Unreal Engine is an asset that contains data and instructions. With blueprints, you specify the logic that controls your games and keeps track of important data such as health, energy, score, etc., There are two main types of blueprints, the level blueprint and blueprint classes.

A level blueprint holds data and instructions for a particular level. It might hold data such as the time remaining to complete the Level, or the number of keys you’ve collected in that level, and so on. It also stores instructions that pertain only to that level.
Blueprint classes are a way to turn any actor or asset into a blueprint. This allows you to create objects with custom traits and behaviors. One of the great things about blueprint classes is that you can use them to create as many copies, or instances, of your creation as you want. Once you complete a blueprint class, it will be available to you in the content browser, and each time you drag it into the viewport, it will create a new instance of that actor. Each instance has its own data independent from the other instances.

, To open a level blueprint, go to the toolbar, click the blueprints button, then click on “Open Level Blueprint.” This will open the Level Blueprint Editor. Inside the Level Blueprint Editor is the event graph.

The event graph is where you script logic. If you’re a programmer, you can script the logic in pure code using C++. However, Epic Games has a visual scripting system that allows non-programmers to script logic and can be convenient even for programmers with experience.

, The scripting system works by using various nodes, that each serve a specific purpose, and connecting those nodes together. By default, the level blueprint starts off with two commonly used nodes in the graph. They are disabled to start with, but can be used right away by connecting them to another node.

The first node is the Event BeginPlay Node. An event node is a node that activates when a certain event occurs. So an Event BeginPlay Node, inside of a level blueprint, will be activated by the event of the level first starting.
The second default node is also an event node. The Event Tick Node is a node that activates on every tick of gameplay. Before every frame of the game draws on the screen, any logic that connects to the Event Tick Node will execute. This is useful in situations where you need to constantly check certain conditions that, when met, will have an immediate effect on the game, such as the main character colliding with something harmful.

, The icons along the left and/or right sides of nodes are pins. Pins on the left side of a node are input pins and pins on the right side of a node are output pins. They input/output data to and from nodes and specify the order in which Nodes should execute. Pins connect to one another with wires.

To create a wire, left-click on a pin and then drag the mouse while still holding the LMB. This will drag a wire out of that pin. If you hover over another pin and release the LMB, it will connect the end of the wire to that pin.
Pins with a white icon that looks like a play button are execution pins. Execution pins on the left side of a node are input execution pins. When a wire connected to an input execution pin activates, it will trigger execution of that node. Execution pins on the right side of a node are output execution pins. Wires connected to an output execution pin will activate once that node has finished executing. Output execution pins can only connect to input execution pins and vice-versa.
By chaining nodes together through their execution pins, you can define a series of nodes that should execute, one after the other, every time the first node in the series activates. The first node in a chain will always be an event node.
Pins with a circular icon are data pins. The purpose of data pins is to pass data between nodes. Output data pins can only connect to input data pins and vice-versa. Whatever data the output data pin contains is sent to the input data pin it connects to.

, To add a new node to the event graph, you will need to select that node from the node menu. The node menu is brought up by right-clicking on any empty space in the graph, or by releasing the LMB over any empty space when dragging out a wire from an output execution pin. When doing the latter, the node you add will automatically connect to the wire.

There are many nodes available to choose from in the node menu. They are organized into categories, but if you know at least part of the name of the node you’re looking for, you can use the search box at the top of the node menu to search for it.

Pick your genre.,
Pick your platform.,
Write out the preliminary design.,
Start with a core philosophy.,
Write down your features.,
Take a break.",How to Make Your Own Video Game1," While every successful game is unique in its own way, almost all of them fit into a specific genre. Decide what kind of game you want to create, and look at what other games in the same genre do. Some common genres include:


Arcade games
Shooters
Puzzles
Platformers
Racing
Adventures
Endless runners
RPGs
First person shooter
Story/Manga driven JRPG
Tower Defenses
Horror
Fighters
Comedy
Survival;
, The platform that you choose to develop your game for will significantly impact the way it is developed. The platform dictates the way the game is controlled; smartphone games are typically touch- and tilt-based, PC games typically use a keyboard and mouse, and console games use gamepads.


There are exceptions to all these rules, but you will generally find it easier to design the game around a specific control method.
If you want to make an iPhone game, you will need to submit it to the Apple store from a Mac computer.

, This should just be at least one page, but will be the heart of the gameplay experience you create. It contains the fundamental concepts of your game, and will allow you to see if your idea is really viable as a video game.

, This statement will serve as the motivating force behind the game. These are very simple statements that get to the heart of what the game is. Revisit it often to ensure that your game is still meeting its basic goals. Some example core philosophies:


This game simulates a space station economy
This game lets you play as a living car
This game is about testing the player’s reflexes

, The features are what sets your game apart from others in the same genre. Start by listing your ideas and concepts. Turn those concepts into action-driven sentences. Shoot for between 5-15 features. For example:


Concept: space station construction.
Feature: Build and manage your own personal space station.
Concept: damage from asteroids
Feature: Struggle to survive against environmental hazards, including asteroids, solar flares, and comets.
Writing down your features first will allow you to flesh each one of them out later in the design document. Having your features listed in the beginning will keep your project focused and prevent “feature-creep”, where ideas keep getting added later on in the process.
Continue to revise these features until you are satisfied that they represent the game that you want to make.

, Put the preliminary design in a drawer and try not to think about it for a week or two. You want to be able to go back to it with a fresh perspective. This will help you determine if the project is really worth pursuing, or if you need to go back to the drawing board.

"
"
Get down to the nitty-gritty details.,
Formulate the table of contents.,
Fill out each section of your document.,
Run it by another person or your team.",How to Make Your Own Video Game2," The design document is the backbone of your video game. It contains detailed descriptions of your game’s mechanics, plot, setting, aesthetic design and more. The format of the document is not as important as the content.


Design documents are especially important if you are managing a team of programmers and artists. Make sure that the document is geared toward them, and not towards the end consumer. Avoid being vague and go into great detail as to how each of the game’s mechanics should work.
Not every game has a design document, and no two design documents will look alike. Use these steps as a guideline, but feel free to tailor your document to your game’s needs.

, Every single aspect of the game needs to be addressed in the table of contents. The only thing that doesn't need to be included is the story, unless the story is fundamentally connected to the mechanics of the game.Approach the table of contents in a similar way as you would a game manual. Start with broad sections, such as Character Creation, Combat, and Main Interface, and then flesh each one of these sections out with subsections.
Think of the table of contents as an outline for the game. You will be going into much more detail for each entry in the table

, After you have the table laid out, start expanding on the mechanics. Take the time to go into detail so that there is no confusion when you start programming. Each mechanic should be fully explained, so that there is no confusion when it comes time to implement it.

, Depending on your approach, game design can be a very collaborative process. Insight from others can help keep your game focused, and can point out areas that aren't as well thought-out.

Decide on an engine.,
Learn your engine, or find someone who knows it.,
Build a prototype.,
Refine the controls.",How to Make Your Own Video Game3," The engine is the underlying base of the game. It contains a host of development tools that ease the creation of a game. It is much more time-efficient and less complex to create a game using an existing engine than to create a new one from scratch. There are a variety of engines designed for indie developers.


Engines often make it much simpler to manipulate graphics, sound, and AI.
Different engines have different strengths and weaknesses. Some are more suited to 2D graphics, while others are designed for 3D graphics. Some engines require significantly more programming knowledge than others. There are several game development tools that you can use with no previous coding experience. Popular independent development engines include:

GameMaker: Studio – One of the most popular 2D game engines.
Unity – A 3D engine popular for its ease of use and portability.
RPG Maker VX – A scripting engine designed for 2D RPG is the traditional JRPG style.
Unreal Development Kit – A 3D engine that can be adapted to a wide range of uses.
Source – A very popular 3D engine that is consistently updated and modified.
Project Spark - An optimized 3D engine that addresses the average user.



, Depending on the engine you choose, you may be facing a significant amount of programming. Even the most basic engines will require time to understand how to manipulate them. If the programming is beyond your capabilities, you’ll either need to learn it or hire someone.


This will be the beginning of your team-building phase. If you are unable to program, your first hire will need to be a programmer. You can worry about art and sound later; you need to be able to come up with a working prototype before the project can continue
There is a large community of independent developers that you should be networking with. People will join projects for all kinds of different reasons and compensations. This is where having a solid game design document really helps, because it shows that you have a commitment to your idea.

, Once you are familiar with the engine you have chosen, build a prototype of the game. This prototype will serve as a basic test of the core functionality of the game. You don’t need graphics or audio for the prototype, just simple placeholders (like a cube or a stick figure) and a small test area.Test and refine the prototype, again and again, to ensure that it is fun to play. Make note of anything that doesn't work or feel right, and readdress the mechanics involved. If the prototype isn't fun to play, then the final game probably won’t be either.
There will always be features that seemed easy or feasible that just won’t work when it comes time to make the game. Expect the prototype to change multiple times as you tweak what works and what doesn't.

, The most basic functionality of the game is the player interacting with the game through some sort of control input. Use the prototype to ensure that the controls are as perfect as they can possibly be.


Games with poorly-implemented controls will frustrate players. Games with perfectly executed controls will be rewarding to a player’s skill.

"
"
Consider your project’s needs.,
Rough draft some art.,
Design the world, or structure, of the game.,
Develop your art assets.,
Record your audio assets.",How to Make Your Own Video Game4," Depending on the scope of your project, your art needs can vary significantly. Some games are built using only simple shapes and colors, while other games feature complex worlds created by vast teams of artists and sound designers. Be realistic with your goals for the assets in your game, and hire accordingly.


Most independent games are created by small teams, oftentimes one person. If you are doing the entire project yourself, expect it to take a significant amount of time, especially if you are intending to create all of the assets yourself.
There are a variety of free-to-use assets available online through development communities. Always make sure that anything you use does not violate someone’s copyright.

, In order to start getting a feel for then visual aesthetic of the game, you will need to begin implementing art into the prototype, and then start expanding that prototype into the game proper.


There are a variety of styles that you can use. Pixel art (intentionally retro) is one of the most common styles employed by independent developers. This is because pixel art is typically the fastest and least-expensive art to produce that still results in a “good looking” game.If you have more time and manpower, you can consider using 3D art. Basic 3D modeling is possible with a one-man team, but more complex details will take significantly more time. 3D models need textures on top of the model.

, Once you have some art to use, you can start constructing the game itself. Depending on the style of game you are making, you may need to create levels or playing areas. If you are making a puzzle game, then you can start designing your puzzles.

, Depending on your art style, there are different programs you can use to create your art assets. Some of the more popular programs include:


Blender – This open source program is one of the most popular 3D modeling solutions around. There are endless tutorials available online that can show you how to get up and running quickly.

Photoshop – This program is essential in the texturing process, as well as creating most 2D art. It is expensive, so if money is a concern, consider trying GIMP, the open source, free alternative to Photoshop. GIMP has most of the same functionality.
Paint.net – This is an open source alternative to Paint Shop Pro, and will allow you to create 2D art with ease for free. This program is especially useful for creating 2D pixel art graphics.

, Sound design plays an essential part of the immersion when playing a game. Whether or not you have music, when and how you use sound effects, and spoken dialogue all affect the way the player connects with the game.


You can find several powerful and free audio recordings and music creation software online. Consider using these if you are on a tight budget or are working independently.
Make your own sound effects with objects around your home.

"
"
Play your game as much as possible.,
Stay focused on your core philosophy.,
Polish, polish, polish.",How to Make Your Own Video Game5," As you build each aspect of the game, play it to ensure that it remains fun and cohesive. If an area or idea feels weak or poorly implemented, refine it or cut it. Once all of your levels or puzzles or play areas are complete, play through it to make sure it is fun from beginning to end.

, Throughout the development process, you should be constantly checking to see that your game is attaining that philosophy. Make sure that you are sticking to your feature list, and that you aren’t getting bogged down by more and more additions.

, Constantly go back over your art, sound, and game design to smooth rough edges and bring out your game’s distinct style. Your ability to quickly polish will be heavily dependent on the art style you have chosen to use.

"
"
Start bug hunting.,
Perform actions that you wouldn't normally try.,
Prioritize your bug fixes.,
Watch other people play.",How to Make Your Own Video Game6," Once you have a working game from start to finish, it’s time to start looking for ways to break it. Finding the bugs in your game and squashing them is essential to making sure that as many people can play it as possible.

, Every conceivable way a player can interact with the game needs to be accounted for. Make sure that your game rules can’t be bypassed or broken by attacking those rules as much as possible.


Bug testing can take a significant amount of time, even as much as the game took to create. The more people you can get to help with testing, the more problems you will be able to find and fix.

, If you have a large list of bugs, and only a limited time to fix the game, make sure that you deal with serious, game-breaking bugs first. For example, if there was a bug that allowed a player to earn an unlimited high score in a score-based game, you would want to make sure that bug was taken care of immediately.

, Get some friends over to try out your game. Watch how they approach your challenges, and how they interact with your game world. Chances are they will try to do things that you never even thought someone would do.

"
"
Check with your engine on rules for releasing compiled programs.,
Hype your game.,
Decide on a distribution service.,
Support your game.",How to Make Your Own Video Game7," Each engine supports specific platforms, and some require different licenses to release on different platforms. For example, with Game Studio, you can release on Windows and Mac OS X with the Standard version, but need to upgrade to the Pro version and pay an extra fee to release mobile versions.

, Once you are nearing your game’s release, start trying to attract some attention. Release some screenshots and video clips of your game in action on popular gaming forums. Contact gaming news sites and let them know that your game will be releasing soon (be sure to include how to get it, how much it costs, and a summary of the game).


Create a company website during production so that you can start building followers. Hosting a forum for your game is a great way to get fans talking to each other, and regularly updating your site can start to draw more attention.

, Some independent developers will host the game on their own website, but you may find that demand costs you a significant amount in hosting fees, and some hosts can’t support the load that a successful game requires. There are several popular outlets for releasing independent games on PC and Mac OS X:


Steam
Desura
Humble Store
GOG
Mobile games typically need to be released through their prospective stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, etc.). The same goes for console games (Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, etc.).
Different services will take different cuts on the sale of your game. Research each one to see if they are right for you. Most services have sales reps that you can speak with directly as a developer.

, Once your game is released, support it as much as financially possible with bug fixes and more content. The age of digital distribution means that games can be updated quicker than ever before. There are bound to be bugs that appear once the population at large has access to your game. Do what you can to fix these as soon as possible.

Decide what kind of music you'd like your game to feature.,
Learn how to read and write music.,
Get the necessary tools If you need any specific instruments or tools, go get them.,
Compose!,
Record/Create.,
Create Sound effects.,
Do Voice overs.,
Edit, compile it, and add it to the game!",How to Make Video Game Music," Do you want hardcore metal? Or do you want something a little more soft and classical? You could even use both, if you want! There are absolutely no boundaries to creativity.;
, You can do this with either tabs or a music range. Start with a range, since it is the classic way to compose music. Learn all the notes and symbols, and although this may be a long task, it's really worth it.

, Look in the Things You'll Need section for sound programs and software.

, If you need lyrics, write them with a certain rhythm in the syllables. Go see a How to Write a Haiku or Alexandrian Poem entry for help with this. Composing music requires quite the musical ear, you can't just put any notes together. Remember the mood and atmosphere you want to create.

, This will take a lot of tries, but it's normal. Depending on what kind of tools you are using, this could mean a makeshift recording studio or just a computer. Of course, if you are using real instruments, you will need to record it, but some music software lets you create music as well as edit it. Choose the one that's right for you.

, It will take tons of work, but this step is worth it. This is a really fun part in making the music, because it is so different from the rest of the recording. If you want realistic sound effects, there's no other way around it: you'll have to get out and do exactly what you are creating the sound effect for. Clang utensils or pots for a sword clash, throw heavy rocks down a rocky hill for a destructive sound. There are also sites where you can download sound effects, which are quite useful if you can't get the exact kind of sound you want.

, Again, this will require a lot of starting over and redoing. This part is quite simple, all you need is recording software, a good microphone and a filter (to eliminate spitting sounds and some interference) and a group of people that will bring your characters to life. This part can or cannot be essential, but I think it will be pretty useful. First and foremost, write your script. I suggest you look for a How to Write Theatre Scripts for this one. The voice actors usually have their scripts right in front of them, so don't worry on remembering it right (although you certainly will after all the tries). Do not forget to project the cut scene so that the actors can match the lip flap, if necessary. I suggest you record as a group instead of each voice individually. It makes the exchange of words more natural. Only thing is, the other actors have to keep quiet when one is speaking.

, You can do this using the recording software. Make sure you're really familiar with your software, read the Readme or watch a How-to video. And now, you're all done and ready to test your game!

Remember nothing is as difficult as it seems.,
Collect everything that you need to get started with what you want to learn.,
Get started with basics of coding: print a message, declare variables, perform some mathematics manipulation, run some loops, apply comments, etc.,
Follow the step by step procedure as prescribed in a book, white paper, article, research, etc.,
Deface your mind to make it remember what you learn.,
Practice and apply what you learned.",How to Make Coding Fun," It just a matter of little effort at start. As they say,""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" and ""You will never find out how far you can fly unless you spread your wings."" Now remember before getting started with any of the available programming languages, you first need to decide 'what' and 'how' you have to get started with. It's fairly simple these days because of Internet.


For help on any sort of initiation go visit Google, online discussion forum, blogs, Amazon book ratings, YouTube video tutorials etc. Every sort of resource are at your doorstep, you just need to open a door to let them in.;
, Get it organized because it will help you keep track of thing and it's also helpful for easy reference.

, #*Remember when you get started don't mug things up instead understand what does that code does


Practice and practice and apply those in your own ways. The moment you start understanding, you will find coding FUN.
Be prepared to make the errors. You might find yourself in mess. It no big deal, it's obvious that you will face thousands of errors that might be really difficulty for you to debug. But remember those errors will prepare you for future. Some error are very much difficult to debug while other are comparatively easy.
Take help from internet and other valuable resources as discussed above. Problem might just seem difficult at first but if you put a little effort then you will definitely nail it down.

, As you learn, practice and apply new thing you will find yourself gradually enjoying programming. And, sooner or later coding will be FUN.

, Deception is the key. The trick is the be naughty. Human mind tends to remember naughty, funny, vulgar stuff sooner, so learn coding that way. For example, print a message as such 'Dude you made a wrong choice, you suck' (in C Programming: printf(""Dude you made a wrong choice, you suck""; ), loop 100 times saying 'You are a genius' ( in PHP Programming: for(i=0;i<100;i++){ echo ""You are a genius""; } ), display error like 'You are so dumb' (in JavaScript: alert(""You are so dumb""); ), etc. These techniques might seem funny but this works very effectively.

, If you learn something try to execute it, then practice it another time, and when you have the hold apply it differently in your own way.

Anything in apostrophes can be changed, it won't affect the game - don't accidentally type it in to the actual code.,
Open Notepad or any other coding programs-Geany, Notepad++, etcetera.,
Start the Code.,
Add Colours.,
Create the Menu.,
Creating ‘Exit’ and ‘Instructions’.,
Begin the game.,
Fighting and Running.,
Just close the notepad, then click yes, save the file, change the format to all file,add .bat after you type the name.

",How to Make a Video Game With Cmd,";
, Save the file as ‘My Game’.bat

, Start by typing:


@echo off
title ‘My Game’
color 0A
if ""%1"" neq """" ( goto %1)
pause

, Now save it and run, it will come up with an error and all the different colour combinations. Find the one you like and type it in after “color”, instead of “zz”. A good combination is color 0A, it makes the text green and the background black.

, To create the menu get rid of pause and type in:


:Menu
cls
echo ‘1. Start’
echo ‘2. Instructions’
echo ‘3. Exit’
set /p answer=‘Type the number of your option and press enter.’
if %answer%==1 goto ‘Start_1’
if %answer%==2 goto ‘Instructions’
if %answer%==3 goto ‘Exit’

, To create the exit screen type in this:


:‘Exit’
echo Thanks for playing !
exit /b
Now for the instructions type in:
 :‘Instructions’
cls
echo ‘Instructions’
echo.
Then write:
echo ‘Your instructions here’
As many times as you like then type:
pause
goto Menu

, Type in a scenario:


:Start_1
cls
echo ‘You have run into bad guys. Their forces are:’
echo ‘3 farmers’
echo ‘You have a high chance of winning.’
set /p answer=‘Would you like to fight or run?’
if %answer%==‘Fight’ goto ‘Fight_1’
if %answer%==‘Run’ goto ‘Run_1’

, Now to make fighting and running:


:Run_1
cls
echo You ran away safely !
pause
goto ‘Start_1’
:Fight_1
echo You have chosen to fight.
echo The battle is waging.
set /p answer= Type number 1 and press enter to continue:
if %answer%==1 goto Fight_1_Loop
:‘Fight_1_Loop’
set /a num=%random%
if %num% gtr 4 goto ‘Fight_1_Loop’
if %num% lss 1 goto ‘Fight_1_Loop’
if %num%==1 goto ‘Lose_Fight_1’
if %num%==2 goto ‘Win_Fight_1’
if %num%==3 goto ‘Win_Fight_1’
if %num%==4 goto ‘Win_Fight_1’
:‘Lose_Fight_1’

echo Sorry, you lost the battle :(
pause
goto Menu
:‘Win_Fight_1’
cls
echo Congrats, you won the fight!
set /p answer=‘Would you like to save?’
if %answer%==‘Yes’ goto ‘Save’
if %answer%==‘No’ goto ‘Start_2’
:‘Save’
goto ‘Start_2’
Now you can repeat the code used in ‘Start_1’ to create a second fight and a third and fourth and so on.
Also when you type e.g. :Fight_1 you also have to make sure that parts that say goto Fight_1 stay the same as each other so if you change one you have to change both.

Crowdfund if you're serious.",How to Make a Video Game from Scratch," You'll need to do some planning and thinking about the big issues if you want to keep your process moving smoothly. What genre will your game be (RPG, shooter, platformer, etc.)? What platform will your game be played on? What will be the unique or prominent features of your game? Each answer to each question will require a different set of resources, skills, and planning, as they have different ways that they impact game development.;
, How the game is designed will be very important, so you'll want to work this kind of thing out before you start making the game. How will players progress through the game? How will players interact with the world? How will you teach players to play your game? What kind of audio and music cues will you use? This is all very important.

, If popping out games like Mass Effect was easy, everyone would do it. You need to understand what you can and can't do without a huge studio and lots of experience behind you. You also need to be realistic about what you can accomplish within a reasonable amount of time. If you're not realistic about what you can do, then you're likely to quickly become disappointed and give up. We don't want you to give up!

, Making a game anywhere above ""mobile"" level requires a computer that is, by most definitions, ""tricked out"". If you're using an older system, you'll find that you are unable to get the game you make to work on your computer. You'll also need some pretty powerful and very specific software for making games. Some programs are free or cheap, but others can cost a lot of money. Good software is discussed in a later section, but know that the software you'll need can include 3D modellers, image editors, text editors, compilers, etc.


You'll need a powerful processor (at least a quad core, and preferably one of the new i5s or i7s), lots of RAM, and a high end video card at a minimum.

, If you just want to make a quick mobile game with uncomplicated visuals and programming, that's fine. That's a good project to work on on your own, because you can use it to show future employers and investors what you're capable of. But if you want to make a more serious game, you're going to need to get some people to help you. Indie games usually have a team of around 5-10 people (depending on complexity) and bigger name games can have up to several hundred people working on them!

, You'll need lots of people with lots of different skills (such as artist's, coder's, ect.)if you're going to make most types of games. You'll need programmers, modelers, visual designers, gameplay or level designers, audio experts, as well as producers or marketing/money type people.

, Think of this like as something between a resume and a battle plan for your game. A design document lays out everything about the design of your game: the gameplay, the mechanics, the character, the plot, etc. In doing so, it also shows everything that needs to be done, who will do it, what the expectations are, and the general timetable for getting things done. Your design document is very important for not only keeping your own team on track but also for showing to potential investors.


Your game design document should be split into sections and include a detailed Table of Contents.
Common sections to include cover the story of the game, major and minor characters, the level design, the gameplay, the art and visual design, the game sounds and music, as well as a breakdown of the controls and user interface design.
The design document should not be limited to text. You will usually find design sketches, concept art, and even items like preview videos or sound samples.
Do not feel limited or too worried about your design document and it's formatting. There is no standard format or required items to include. Just make a document that fits your game.

, It takes money to make a game. If nothing else, the tools are expensive and it's extremely time consuming (taking away from the time you could spend doing things that make actual money). It gets more expensive the more people you need to work with and the more complex their skills need to be in order to make more and more sophisticated games. You need to figure out where your money is going to come from and you need to discuss with your contributors how, when, and how much they will be paid before the actual work begins.


The cheapest way to make a game is to do everything 100% yourself. But this is difficult if you lack the skills, and many very different skills are needed. For most inexperienced people working on their own, a simple clone app is about the most that can be managed. Even if you make a game by yourself, you'll still need to pay licensing fees for most good engines and many of the app stores and other sales venues. Don't forget about taxes for the money you do make, either.
To make an average quality indie game, you will need roughly in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Major titles often take in the millions of dollars to develop.

, You'll need to choose an engine for your game. The game engine is the piece of software that controls all of the little details about how the game works (like AI, physics, etc). Engines require tools, which are sometimes included but sometimes need to be made from scratch, that allow you to interact with and create the game within the engine. Once that's sorted, you'll need to find someone who knows how to script in that engine. Scripting is where you tell the game engine what to do. This usually requires a certain amount of programming skills.

, You'll also need to start creating the actual content in the game. This means modeling the characters, making the game sprites, making the environments, all of the objects that the player interacts with, etc. Excellent skills with 3D software and visual arts are usually needed to complete these tasks. Meticulous planning-ahead: also good.

, You need people to play through your game. Never mind finding the bugs: you need people to play it if only to find out how other people see and experience the game. Something that seems intuitive to you may be very confusing for everyone else. A tutorial or story element may be missing. You never know. This is why it's important to get outside views.

, Once you're done making your game, you're not actually done making your game. You're going to have to test everything. Everything. You need to get through every possible scenario in your game to make sure that there aren't any bugs. This takes time and manpower. Allot a generous schedule to testing!

, Let people see your game once it's done. Show it to companies that might want to invest in it as well as people who you think might want to play it! Have a website and a development blog, post screenshots, video walkthroughs, trailers, and other content to show people what your game is all about. Drumming up interest will be crucial to the success of your game.

, There are lots of places where you can release a game but where will depend on what type of game you made. Currently the app stores and Steam are the most open to newcomers. You can release your game independently on your own site but hosting costs tend to be prohibitive. You'll also have less visibility.

, There are several great programs that beginners can use to make basic games. The most famous are probably Game Maker and RPG Maker, but Atmosphere and Games Factory are also good. You can also use children's programming training tools, like MIT's Scratch. These are surprisingly good at teaching you the basic skills you'll need.

, If you're not hiring a pro to do your graphics works, then you've got a lot of studying ahead of you. You'll need to learn to work a number of complex graphics programs...but you can do it! Photoshop, Blender, GIMP, and Paint.net are good places to start if you want to make the visual elements of your game.

, You'll have a much easier time making a successful game and getting investors if you have experience, education, and a well-known game attached to your name. Because of this, it's probably a good idea to work for a traditional, known game developer before breaking out on your own. This might require going to school or acquiring some skills, but it's still working towards your goal and it will be worth it in the end.

, The indie game development community is strong, supportive and welcoming. If you're good about supporting, promoting, discussing, and helping them with their projects, they'll return the same in kind. Talk with them, get to know them, and let them get to know you. You'll be surprised what you can accomplish with a community behind you.

, If you want to make a professional game that can hold its own against other serious games, you're going to need money. Luckily, things have really changed in the last few years and crowdfunding has made it possible for unknowns to make excellent games. Get acquainted with Kickstarter and similar websites. Just be aware that you'll have to really work to run an excellent campaign, which means realistic goals, great rewards, and constant communication.

Think of the plot, the characters, and what are the tasks for the player.,
Decide how the side quest will start.,
Think of the body of the side quest.,
Think of the side quest ending and reward.",How to Make a Video Game Side Quest," Your side quest will have to be about something, so think what will be the side quest plot and objectives.


The Plot: Should be a small story with a conflict, as the player will be there as a key to solve it.
The Objectives: They have to be related to the plot and they can be really different according to it, for example, deliver a message to someone, give something to the X character, go to an X location, or between many other options.;
, The start of the side quest will be how the player will be introduced to that small plot. The most common way to do that is to make the player talk to an NPC, but it can be the opposite as the NPC can go and talk to the player when the player reaches a specific place. There are also a few other ways but they are very rare, like making the player find something that makes him curious and drives him to investigate about it.

, Now it's time for the objectives. As mentioned earlier in the first step, one objective can be totally different than another, and is up to you what they will be. Your side quest can have any number of objectives, since a simple one of donating some money to someone - and he only needs that - to one with multiple objectives, like finding out what some evil guy is about to and you would have to check his house first, then talk to him, or whatever.

, Last but not least, when the player completes his part on the story, the side quest should have an end and, depending on the side quest and the game, the player should be rewarded. Most of times, a great side quest ending is better than a reward, since the player should have fun completing the objectives and following the story already. But that doesn't mean that creative rewards like the Wabbajack in Skyrim are really welcome.

Don't restrict yourself when making the boss.",How to Make a Video Game Boss," No matter how far fetched the game is, it's much better if you make it fit with the level's theme. For example if the level is in a dense jungle no one's going to enjoy a fight against a whale. However, if the boss fight is in the ocean or some place filled with water (I.E. The stage in Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep Final Mix's Monstro boss fight after being spat out), people will expect a whale or other sea creature to be the boss of the level.;
, If the level's common enemy is harder to defeat than the boss then it won't sit at all well. Also, make sure that the boss has more attacks than the common enemy.

, If it's Level 1 don't make it impossible to beat but if it's the final boss don't make it a one-hit kill. However, each boss should have a weak spot (but not an obvious one if it's the final boss unless you're using a lock-on feature in your game).

, This is especially true in war games such as Call of Duty. In that scenario do you really need a strong and heavily-armed German at the end of every mission? No, but some bosses can have multiple phases.

, For example does the player have to do something within the arena to make the boss vulnerable, or can the player lock-on to the vulnerability?

, This helps define the difference between a new enemy and an actual boss. If a boss is of the same type, it may help to use the same theme.

, Normally every boss fight has the same music but the final boss, but this doesn't have to be true for your game. One of the easiest ways to go through with this is to make the music a remix of the regular level music.

, This makes it tougher which is the point in a boss fight.

, in Kingdom Hearts II, Sephiroth wants to steal your Keyblade via defeating you, so it's natural you'd want to thwart him even if it takes months, like it does with most people who use the Kingdom Key instead of the Ultima Weapon.)

, There is no rule stating that every boss must appear at the end of every third level, and just because the level theme's is in a sewer, doesn't mean you can't give your rat boss some wings (after all, you could explain that waste in the sewers are tampering with the rat's biological DNA and thus, the reason why it is has wings!)

First off decide upon what kind of game you're making.,
Always make each level center around a single theme.,
When it comes to music think what would fit best.,
If you wish to have a boss have the boss fit with the theme of said level.,
How difficult it is should depend on how early and/or later in the game it is.

,
If possible try to think up of a theme that has never been done before.,
The kind of challenges should once again depend on the level's theme.",How to Make a Video Game Level," If it's a non-linear, explore-everything game like Banjo-Kazooie or Legend of Zelda then every level should be a different theme and be very spread out. If it's a linear war game like Halo or Call of Duty make it a campaign and each level is in a predesignated order.


If it's the latter it's rather easy to think up of levels so long as you have a plot.






If it's the former than it's a lot trickier since you have to think up of various themes to run through with 5-10 levels.





;
, For example if its covered in cemeteries and graveyard it's horror-themed and if it's taking place in a Himalaya-like place it's ice-themed.


One of most frequently-used (and clever) themes is horror. Of course when it comes to horror make it Halloween-ish horror (the holiday) not Hellraiser-ish horror.






An absolute must for every non-linear game is a water-themed level. Try to introduce it early on such as Level 4 or Level 5 which is when the game should begin turning difficult. The point is to get the player more oriented to swimming (no matter how badly the controls handle) for later in the game.







, Banjo-Kazooie is ground-breaking in this regard since every level's music sounds exactly as it should. The level that consists of a polluted harbor is dark whilst the level that consists of the 4 seasons each has a different music for each season: chirpy for spring, a slow violin tune for summer, a horn for fall and a harp-like tune for winter.

, If the level is themed to the Amazon rainforest have a tapir or sloth be the boss. Make sure that under any conditions you don't interchange it (e.g. in a water-themed level you have a desert lizard boss).

,, once more Banjo-Kazooie is a good example of this. For example beforehand no one had ever tried to make a level out of pollution or prehistoric times or the 4 seasons of the year. Try to think outside the box.

, If the level is wind-themed perhaps you need to get something out of a cloud without being set afire away by a strong wind.

, Put a couple of bus stops and get some buses going. It won't get you much in the beginning, but the idea is to get some cash flowing, and then you can start to pay off the running costs.

, This can dramatically increase your city size. Trains can earn quite a bit of income.


Once your city is quite large and you have a lot of money, then you can build an airport, but don't put the second airport in a near-by town. Put it on the other side of the map. Also, only use the ship ports if you have a wide enough sea area, make sure that the ship reaches the other port without getting trapped in a whirlpool, they tend to happen in corners or close to land, If this is an issue, consider using the ""pass through waypoint"" option on a route.







, Once you've done all of the above, you should have a successful transport company that's earning quite a lot of income.

Repeat the process one more time until her HP falls below 10,000.,
Cast Armageddon before her HP goes below 9,000.",How to Beat Elizabeth in Persona 3," Before you start the battle, Elizabeth will ask you to send your party members back. This means you will have to fight her alone.
, This only applies to currently summoned personas. Example: She summons Surt (fire based attack) and you have Loki (null fire skill) equipped., The same goes for Weapons, Armor, and Acce. The Element includes physical attacks like Slash, Pierce, etc., At least wait until it can kill her in one hit. A good time is when her HP is 9,998 and below. If you do otherwise, she will retaliate with her Megidolaon and spam it., Elizabeth is similar to the main character because she is also a multi-persona user/wild card. Her team consists of the following:

Surt – fire based attacks
Jack Frost – ice based attacks
Thor – electricity based attacks
Cu Chulainn – wind based attacks
Metatron – light based attacks
Alice – dark based attacks
Nebiros – debuffs/ailments based attacks
Masakado – almighty (Megidolaon does 9,999 damage)

, For this battle you will be relying on fusion spells, specifically Infinity (Vishnu and Ananta), and Armageddon (Satan and Lucifer). For the rest of your team, any persona of your choice will do. However, there are 4 must-have personas because of their fusion spells.

Lucifer - required
Satan - required
Vishnu - required
Ananta - required
Orpheus Telos and any other persona - optional

, Missing Elizabeth during a physical attack can be costly. Spears and bows are recommended.

, Physical resistance can lower physical damage. This can be obtained from Messiah., –+Evasion can be obtained from Messiah. It is not very useful because of divine pillar's effects. However, it still gives a decent amount of defense., This halves physical damage, so you will not be able to evade. It can be obtained from Alilat., This is needed for healing., It can randomly reflect physical attacks. This is an exemption to rules 2 and 3 mentioned above., This is an item that sacrifices itself, so you don’t die against Mahamaon and Mamudoon., Level 99 is recommended because it gets 999 HP and SP., You’ll need it to calculate Elizabeth's HP every time you do damage., It will be a long and tough battle, so get ready., Elizabeth will use Surt and attack you with either Maragidyne or a physical attack. You can attack at this turn.

How you attack is based on which persona you brought to battle. Using Mind Charge is recommended because physical attacks do little damage against Elizabeth.

, Elizabeth will summon Jack Frost. She will attack you with either Mabufudyne or a physical attack. Heal on this turn.

On average, Elizabeth will hit you with at least 400 damage. Use Diarahan or Soma on this turn.

, Elizabeth will summon Thor. Since you used Mind Charge, attack with either Garudyne or Bufudyne on this turn., Elizabeth will summon Cu Chulainn. Heal yourself with either Diarahan or Soma on this turn., Elizabeth will summon Metatron and cast Mahamaon. Since you’ve brought some homunculus with you, there is nothing to worry about. Cast Mind Charge on this turn., Elizabeth will summon Alice and cast Mamudoon. Like the previous persona, a Humunculus will save you in case Mamudoon doesn’t miss. Attack her with any -dyne spell (Agidyne, Bufudyne, etc.)., Elizabeth will summon Nebiros and attempt to inflict ailments on you. Do a physical attack on this turn., Elizabeth will summon Masakado and attack you with Megidolaon.

It’s important that you cast infinity. Megidolaon will kill you instantly if you don’t use it.

, She will summon pixie and fully heal herself. The first time her HP falls below 10,000, she will heal herself back to 20,000 HP., This time she won’t heal. But be careful because if her HP falls below 9,000, she will heal endlessly., She will not be able to retaliate with Megidolaon. This will kill her instantly and end the battle in your victory."

Slow down the cure.",How to Beat Bacteria Brutal Mode in Plague Inc.," When starting the game, you will be able to choose a few upgrades for your virus. These are unlocked by beating the game multiple times, and you may not have access to all of them. This mode is still beatable if you don't choose any upgrades. The following are some suggestions if you have them available:DNA Gene - Metabolic Jump. This gives you bonus DNA for popping bubbles.
Travel Gene - Native Biome. Gives you bonus infectivity in your starting country.
Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis. Keeps symptom costs from increasing.
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic - Slows down cure research.
Environment Gene - Extremophile - Gives a bonus to all environments.;
, Your starting country is very important, as this will determine how quickly the virus starts spreading. Start in China or India. The best location for your bacteria is either China or India. China and India have the largest population in the world, which hasten the spread rate of the infection.


Both nations have warm climates, which automatically gives your plague the ability to withstand warm weather.
China and India can quickly infect neighboring countries, and since both have seaports and airports, it won't take too long for the infected citizens to migrate on planes and boats and infect other parts of the world.

, Your bacteria will randomly evolve symptoms as the game progresses. Make sure to devolve every single one, otherwise too much work will start on the cure. To devolve, tap the DNA button at the bottom left of the screen and then choose Symptoms. Tap on the gene that has generated and then choose Devolve, which can be found at the lower right of the menu.

, Once you start earning some DNA, you can work on increasing the transmission capabilities of the virus. Start of by unlocking Water 1 and Air 1. These will increase your bacteria's ability to spread over boats and airplanes.

, Bacterial Resilience is the Bacteria's unique ability. This will thicken the Bacteria's shell, making it more comfortable in all climates. Drug Resistance allows the bacteria to spread in more developed countries. Evolve the following upgrades, improving transmission as well:


Bacterial Resilience 1
Drug Resistance 1
Water 2
Air 2
Extreme Bioaerosol - This becomes available after maxing out Air and Water transmission. It gives a boost to both.
Bacterial Resilience 2 and 3

, Remember to keep devolving every symptom that randomly mutates, even if it isn't lethal. This will keep work on the cure to a minimum while allowing everyone to get infected.

, This will probably take a while, so set the game speed to the fastest setting. Make sure to keep popping bubbles and devolving symptoms when they mutate.


Once the entire population is infected, you will receive a message letting you know that there are no healthy people left. Time to unleash the symptoms!

, With everyone infected, it's time to hit the population hard and fast so that they start dying before the cure is finished. Evolve the following symptoms, preferably in order:


Rash
Sweating
Fever
Immune Suppression
Total Organ Failure
Coma
Paralysis

, Once people start dying off, hit them with another round of deadly symptoms. These have the added benefit of slowing down cure research as well:


Insomnia
Paranoia
Seizures
Insanity

, Most of the world should be dead or dying, but you may still have the cure to worry about. Evolve Genetic Hardening and Genetic ReShuffle to slow down the cure's progress. If your Cure percentage reaches above 60%, use Genetic Reshuffle. This will make your disease harder to analyze in the lab and slows future cure research.


Evolving this ability will also decrease the cure percentage to 15–20% percent.
If the cure rate increases beyond 60% again, use Reshuffle once more, upgrading it to level 2 then level 3 if it reaches 60% again.
Genetic Hardening is useful as well since this increases the time before the cure is finished. Use this to your advantage until the population in the world declines and no one is left.

This game uses both your keyboard (W, A, S, D, Q, E) and your mouse.,
When you start this game you will have to choose a name and a gender for your character.,
Your inventory has six slots for weapons, but only four of them are free because the game starts you off with a small sword and a small pistol.,
You have many choices of weapons you can take with you in your missions and you be given a chance to change weapons at the end of each mission and when you start the game.

,
Weapons will be shown in lists and if you click the tab with the letter on it, the list will change to that list with different choice of weapons.

,
The first list is list A.,
Then on to list B.,
On list C. You will find nothing here but the weapons will be unlocked on later missions.

,
List D. You will find the majority of the automatic weapons.,
List E. You will see the Scorpion (50 shots) This weapon shoots three shots simultaneously and does heavy damage but cannot shoot in a straight line.

,
List F. When you first begin, you will see the Ti-rex M30(40 Shots).,
List G. You will see the Nayberg NS30(30 Shots), when you shoot the large missile heads,they will not shoot in a straight line.

,
List H. Weapons will be unlocked in later missions.

,
List I.,
When choosing weapons, try to have a mix of the two main types.,
Any time you run out of ammunition, it automatically changes to your small pistol, regardless of whether you still have stronger weapons that have ammunition in them.

,
When you start a mission, you will see on you top left corner an orange bar, how much health (lives) you have left, and your score.

,
Every time you get hit, you will be damaged and your orange bar will become shorter, but you will notice a red bar under your orange bar, the red bar indicated how much or the orange bar can regenerate until you have reached the end of your red bar and you can't see the red bar anymore.,
Every time you finish a mission, you will get stronger weapons that may replace your current weapons, but by including some of your older weapons in your inventory you may have a bigger chance of succeeding.

,
When you are on a level and there are no enemies, switch to a long range weapon with unlimited ammunition and shoot randomly, some times it's a switch you have to hit, or something you need to destroy in order to proceed with the mission, or move to the edge of the screen where you might have to move to go to the next room.

,
If you shoot randomly, you might find an item that increases your score, food you can use to regenerate the amount of damage you have, or a box filled with weapons.,
There are many types of enemies and the majority have both long range and melee but some use only melee.

,
At the end of each mission, you will have to fight a boss.,
Everybody is different, the preferences are endless so experiment.

",How to Begin Playing Commando 2,";
, You have a choice of a male and a female character, and they are actually not the same! The female character has a better firing rate at pistols, bows, and machine guns but the male character has a better firing rate in bazookas, shotguns, and other heavy equipment. After you have chosen your gender you have to choose a name. Once you have chosen a gender and name for your character, you will not be able to change them later in the game, unless you start a new character.

, One melee and one long range weapon respectively. You are stuck with these weapons for the rest of the game.

,,, You will see the Commando Sword (Unlimited) which is an upgrade of the sword you already have on your inventory. And then there is the Hand grenade (30 Shots) and the Flame cocktail (40 Shots), by throwing the hand grenade you get one powerful explosion, and when you throw the Flame cocktail, you get three slightly less powerful explosions but with a wider spread.

, When you begin, you will only see Barreti MC 21(Unlimited), it is exactly like the small pistol in your inventory, but with a silencer, this allows the user to shoot enemies without the other enemies to become aware that you have started firing. Note that this will not work for enemies that are already aware of you.

,, You will see the SG 200 (200 Shots). It shoots bullets rapidly and is useful when there are a lot of enemies. The Stingfire 220 (250 shots) is exactly like the SG 200 except the Stingfire 220 has more ammunition.

,, It will shoot small missiles in the air.

,,, Weapons will be unlocked in later missions.

, Automatic weapons are for agile enemies or enemies with low health. And weapons that deal a lot of damage to your enemies for bosses or for big enemies you can hit easily.

,,, How much damage you receive depends on the type if enemy you are shot by. If the orange bar runs out, you are dead and one of your health (lives) is subtracted, but you can restart the mission at the last checkpoint you've been to.

,,, If you find a box with weapons in it, you can equip a weapon with no ammunition or a partially-filled weapon, and when you collect the box, the weapon you have equipped will have full ammunition. Many of there bonuses are in crates, barrels, the sky (in some levels), or enemies you kill sometimes drop them.

,, Each boss is different and have varying characteristics, some might be quick, small, and agile, some might be big and cause heavy damage, and some might be a mix of the two. Some bosses will force you to fight multiple levels of them. Think about the boss before you choose a weapon to fight it, how many shots do you have left, how fast is this boss, can you aim and shoot well, and how strong is your weapon?

Try to understand that they only call you that because they think that they are cooler than you and that they are above you. But, in reality, everyone that plays are on the same level.


If you have questions, go to the Help Center. Many familiar woozens to Woozworld will be there to help.;
, Wooz can now only be purchased with real money. But, don't worry. If you want wooz, watch the videos in between units. While that usually that only gives you 1 or 2 wooz, that's better than nothing right? Beex is just as important as wooz. Most people have 6 million beex already! Beex is pretty easy to earn, so you should be collecting that as well. Beex can be used to buy most things, but if you want to wear something that isn't your level you should consider buying it with wooz.

, Twin Games, Revenge Game, Spin the Bottle; there are so many to choose from. Games can help you earn wooz. If people are about to leave the game, you usually ask them ""Buy, trade, or out?"". Then, they can either leave, trade you expensive clothing/ furniture, or buy something from a shop pods. Either way, at the end of the game you should have a little more beex than you have before, or a few more items. Make sure you get a rich prize to give away, or else people will call you a scammer. You can play games yourself to win a prize, which you can give away at your game.

, It changes by the minute. Things may be expensive, and this is where the wooz comes in. The more up-to-date you are, the more people will add you and start having conversations with you.

, Many people who have made it big on Woozworld are stuck-up and snobbish. Don't be one of those people. Don't discriminate between ""rich"" and ""poor"". Don't give people the cold shoulder if they don't have the latest hairstyle. It may make you seem cool at first, but you'll start losing friends, and people will probably start gossiping about you with other woozens and making up things that aren't true. Woozworld is usually gossip central, so watch out.

, Woozworld shouldn't be about making it big, it's fun! Do what you want to do, as long as it doesn't hurt others.

Shuffle the genes.",How to Beat Bio–Weapon Brutal Mode in Plague Inc.," When starting the game, you will be able to choose a few upgrades for your virus. What you choose here will have a huge impact on how the game plays out, so choose wisely. There are a few suggested upgrades that you should pick to make this game easier:


DNA Gene - ATP Boost. This will give you extra DNA points at the beginning.
Travel Gene - Aquacyte. Basically required to infect difficult islands like Greenland, Iceland, and New Zealand.
Evolution Gene - Patho-Stasis. This will make your upgrades much cheaper.
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This slows the cure progression, offsetting the negative effects of the Patho-Stasis upgrade.
Environment Gene - Extremophile. This boosts the infection rate in every environmental condition.;
, Before choosing a starting country, use your ATP Boost bonus to purchase a few starting upgrades. These upgrades will increase ineffectiveness while keeping lethal mutations from showing up too early.


Coughing
Gene Compression 1 and 2

, Your starting country is very important, as this will determine how quickly the virus starts spreading. Most guides recommend starting in India due to the large population and proximity to China, though others suggest Saudi Arabia.


Work will begin on the cure shortly after the game begins.

, At the start of the game, you should prioritize certain upgrades to give you a much better chance later on. As you start collecting DNA, evolve the following upgrades, in order as soon as you can afford them:


Water 1
Air 1
Gene Compression 3
Deactivated Modified Genes - This combined with Gene Compression 3 will slow the lethal effects down significantly.
Water 2
Air 2

, Occasionally, your virus will randomly mutate. It's highly recommended that you devolve these symptoms as they appear, as they can start killing people before the infection spreads to everyone.

, This next set of upgrades is designed to greatly increase the infectivity of your virus. Evolve these in order as soon as your have the DNA to afford them:


Cold Resistance 1
Extreme Bioaerosol
Cold Resistance 2
Drug Resistance 1 and 2
If people start dying from your virus during this period, get Deactivated Modified Genes 2 as soon as possible.

, At this point, you need to wait for everyone on the planet to be infected with the virus. Once you receive the message that there is no one healthy left, you're ready to flip the switch on the virus.


If people start dying while you're waiting for everyone to get infected, get Nucleic Acid Neutralisation 1. If more people keep dying, evolve Nucleic Acid Neutralisation 2. If it kills again, evolve Nucleic Acid Neutralisation 3.
You will need to unlock the three Nucleic Acid Neutralisation abilities no matter what, so you may as well get them while you're waiting for everyone to get infected. in order to unlock the Annihilate gene.
Remember to keep devolving any random mutations that pop-up. Your only symptoms should be Coughing, Rash, Cysts, Sneezing, or Sweating.

, This is the ultimate symptom, and will start killing people incredibly quick. It is essential that everyone in the world be infected before you activate this gene.

, At this point, everyone in the world is going to die, unless the cure arrives first. Your only remaining challenge is to ensure that the cure does not get finished. The following abilities will put a serious damper on the cure's progress:


Genetic Hardening 1 and 2
Insomnia
Paranoia
Seizures
Insanity
Inflammation
Paralysis
Coma

, If the cure is still progressing, upgrade Genetic ReShuffle 1 and 2. it shouldn't take much to watch the whole world burn at this point!"

Investigate it with one of your ships. You will find Professor Devi and his Ark from the SAAT (Scientific Academy for Advanced Technologies).;
, Prof. Devi will ask you to get him a 3D Locator and a Salvage Arm. You must send resources to Yana and Rufus in order to receive these two parts.


First you need to click on Yana Rodriguez’s Ark, and she will tell you to send her 5 tons of building modules and 5 tons of wood. During this part of the chapter, you most likely haven’t started making wood. Set up a Tree Nursery and two sawmills nearby. Make sure these are connected to a depot or warehouse. Once you give Yana these resources, she will give you the 3D Locator.
Next you need to visit Rufus Thorne by clicking on his Ark. He will require 10 tons of building modules and 5 tons of tools. Make sure to deliver these at the same time on the same ship. Once you give Rufus the desired resources, he will hand you the Salvage Arm.
Take the two parts to Prof. Devi for further instructions.

, You will lose your two ships and receive a submarine. Don’t worry that you are losing two of your ships as this is the final mission for Chapter 1, and you will be moving to a new location in Chapter 2.

, Prof. Devi will give you three locations to scout underwater. Take your new submarine to each of these locations, select the dive button, and then click on the scout drone button to scan the area. You will need to do this for all three locations even though only one is the location of the Virago.


You cannot dive near shorelines and must be in the deep sea.

, Return to Prof. Devi to deliver the three documents you uncovered. Remember to surface your submarine before attempting to deliver the documents. Prof. Devi’s findings will lead to the need of using explosives!

, Prof. Devi will ask you to blow up the debris that is blocking you from scanning the Virago. Retrieve explosives from Thorne’s Ark and communicators from Yana’s Ark. Once you have these, you will need to bring them to Prof. Devi’s Ark. He will hand you the detonators to use the explosives. Bring the supplies underwater to the Virago and initiate the bomb by clicking the aqua detonator

, After the detonation, Prof. Devi will ask you to scan the Virago for a data log. Scan the area by clicking on the scout drone button. Unfortunately, the data log will be damaged after the explosion. This completes the mission and Chapter 1.

Master Gorax gives you two tasks to complete.
The paladin Sergio also gives you a task.

, After completing the tasks set out by fire magicians, you must talk to Parlan. He will assess your progress and award you with the key to the library.

, Specifically, you must read the farthest unoccupied book to the right. This book contains information on the Test of Fire, and upon reading it, a new diary entry is created for you.

, If you take the correct path, you should see two statues and rays of blue light emanating from the ground. Agon, a fellow novice reaches the treasure before you can. Unfortunately, however you react to his victory, he attacks you. Defeat Agon and open the chest that lies nearby and obtain its contents. The chest contains a blank runestone. You will need this for the final part of the test, which is to create a Fire Arrow rune.

, Upon returning, go to the library and talk to master Hyglas. Hyglas will agree to teach you the formula to create the Fire Arrow rune, if you gather all the ingredients for it.

, Go to Gorax and buy one Sulfur and one Fire Arrow spell scroll. After you have these on hand, talk to Hyglas who will teach you the formula. After learning the formula go to the Rune table, and create a Fire Arrow rune. You cannot use it yet.

, After completing the tests, go to each of the High Fire Magicians and talk to them. Once you have talked to all the three High Fire Magicians, talk to Pyrokar again, who will swear you to an oath and give you the Fire Magician's robe.

Try not to miss your shots.,
Grab health and ammo when possible.,
Take cover.,
Use your favorite loadout.",How to Be Good at Transformers: Fall of Cybertron," Don't just sit there and shoot. You will be an easy target and die if you do that. Don't shoot while dodging though, because weapons have much less accuracy when jumping and dodging. Also keep jumping randomly so the opponent misses their shots.;

, It is always important to be at high health and have ammo so you are prepared. You can also grab a Energon Recharger. When you have the Energon Recharger item, you can repair yourself during a big fight.

, Most people don't use cover and get killed. When under heavy fire, make sure to hide.

, Every loadout is different. Make sure you have the abilities and weapons that suite you the most.

Practice.,
Lead Really Far.,
Aim Up in a Head On.,
Use Tracer Belts.,


",How to Aim in War Thunder (RB Planes)," One of the best ways to learn how to aim is simply by practicing. As time goes on, you will eventually get used to the bullet drop, and the muzzle velocity. Easy ways to practice include:


Creating a custom battle on realistic difficulty, and playing against bots until you get the feel of the guns.
Playing an arcade battle, but turning off the lead angle indicator in your options.
Playing realistic battles until you can aim properly.;
, It is hard to know how far to lead without developing an instinctive feel for where to aim. A good tip for leading when your enemy is in a hard bank, is to start your aim two plane lengths in front of the enemy, and try to keep it there. Since you won't be able to keep your aim two plane lengths in front of them, eventually you will hit the sweet spot, and get some hits. For jets, you have to lead twice as far ahead as you would for props. It takes some getting used too but if you start shooting approximately 2 seconds before the enemy plane passes through your cross hairs, you should get some hit.

, Going head on is never a good idea, but sometimes you get forced into a head on situation. In 95% of head ons, you will have to aim slightly above their plane. This is because your bullets begin to drop as they leave the plane. By aiming slightly above the enemy, your bullets will ""fall"" into them. On the off chance your enemy is diving into the head on, you need to aim below them. Otherwise they will fall faster than your bullets and you will miss! Vertical targeting slightly negates this fall of your bullets as it angles the barrels of the guns upwards.

, Tracer belts light up like fire crackers when you shoot them, so you should be able to see where your bullets go, and correct your aim from that.

MugenArchive.com
MugenCharacters.org
MugenFreeForAll.com;
, If its a ZIP file, you can just double-click it to see its contents. If it is a RAR file, you'll need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to open the file.

, Extract the ZIP or RAR file so that you can access the folder inside. You can use the Extract button that appears when you open the file, or you can right-click on it and select ""Extract files"".

, The most important thing to look for when examining your new character files is the character's DEF file. This file must have the same name as the folder that contains it. For example, if the folder name is ""LINK_3D"", the DEF file must be named ""LINK_3D.def"".


If the new character folder has multiple DEF files in it, just make sure that the base one matches the folder name. For example, LINK_3D may have multiple DEF files for the different versions. As long as the ""LINK_3D.def"" file matches the folder name, you should be OK.

, MUGEN can be installed anywhere, so open the folder that you extracted your MUGEN files into after you downloaded it. If you don't remember where it is, perform a search on your computer for ""mugen"".

, You'll find the char folder inside you mugen folder. Drag the newly-extracted character folder into this folder.

, This contains the files that control the MUGEN emulator.

, Right-click on the file and select ""Open with"". Choose Notepad from the list of programs.

, This is the list of all of the character files that have been added to your game.

, The name you type here needs to match the folder you added to your chars folder, which also needs to match the name of the character's DEF file. For example, if your new character's folder is named LINK_3D, type LINK_3D in the section.


If your character came with multiple versions, add the base DEF file to the end of the folder name. For example, if your LINK_3D character came with multiple versions, type LINK_3D/LINK_3D.def instead of LINK_3D. This will tell MUGEN to load the base DEF file, which will process the rest of the versions
There may be lots of comments in your ""select.def"" file. These are indicated by ; at the start of the line. Make sure that you enter the characters on lines that don't start with ;.

, You can set the ""order"" of the character, which determines where it will appear in Arcade Mode. For example, by default the Arcade Mode pits you against six Order 1 opponents, one Order 2 opponent, and one Order 3 opponent. You can set the order of a character from 1 to 10. The game will randomly draw from all characters with the same order when determining a match-up.Add , order=# to the end of the character's entry in the ""select.def"" file. For example, to set LINK_3D as Order 3, type LINK_3D, order=3


, Stages can usually be downloaded from the same places that you find character files. Like the character files, stages typically come in ZIP or RAR format.

, Double-click the ZIP file or open the RAR file to see the contents. Stages come with a DEF and an SFF file. There may also be an MP3 file if a soundtrack is included.

, You'll find this folder in your mugen folder.


Move the MP3 file into the sound folder if the stage came with one.

, You'll be adding the stage to your Stage Select screen, as well as assigning it to characters for Arcade Mode.


The ""select.def"" file is located in the data folder.

, This is where all of your downloaded stages are added.

, Start a new line beneath the existing stages and type stages/stageName.def.

, If you want a certain character to always appear on a certain stage when encountered in Arcade Mode, you can add it to their character entry in the section.


Add a comma to the end of the character entry plus the path to the stage name. For example, to set LINK_3D to always appear on the Castle.def stage, you would type LINK_3D, stages/Castle.def.
Add the order of the character at the end of the entry. For example, LINK_3D, stages/Castle.def, order=3


, Once you've added your characters and set the stages, you can save the file. Your new characters will appear when you start MUGEN.

Choose a claw machine that isn't totally full.,
If possible, watch someone else play.,
Enlist the help of a friend.,
Search for the item you want before you put your money into the machine, so your time is not wasted on deciding.

,
Consider the type of claw when you are picking a target.,
To get a small collectible basketball, make sure the target ball is not surrounded by any other basketballs.,
Insert the money and immediately start.",How to Win at a Claw Machine," In a full machine, the toys are packed tightly together, making it harder to grab one.;
, Count how many seconds they have after putting the money in. This will help you with your strategy later!

, Ask him/her to watch the sides of the machine to see if the claw is on the toy. In other words, one person uses the control to maneuver the claw while the other person spots and guides the controller to the item's destination. This method is a time saver and that's important - many claw machines run on 15 to 30 second timers. If you don't have anyone around to help, judge the claw's position by looking at the mirror inside the claw machine. The mirror can serve as your second person.

,,


Four pronged claws are great for grabbing around the chest area of a stuffed animal. When you use this type of claw on a stuffed animal, try to maneuver the claw so that the four prongs are positioned both above and below the arms with the central part of the claw close to the neck or high chest area.
Three pronged claws: For stuffed animals, instead of positioning two of the prongs above the arms, position the prongs around the left or right arm. Have the claw at an angle so that it covers the whole chest area of a stuffed animal.

, This might rotate the claw on its way down, causing you to miss your basketball. If this is inevitable, try to bring it straight down as much as possible.


For best results, aim the center of the prongs in the radius center of the basketball. This technique draws a 60 to 70 percent chance of grabbing a basketball, but it is very difficult to center the claw in the middle of the basketball. But keep in mind that balls have a way higher catch rate than stuffed animals do. This means that you have more luck with that cute Super Mario plushy than the NBA Chicago Bulls basketball.
If the prong picks it up with ease but then drops it at the top, try going for the one closer to the chute.







,


If you have 15 seconds, spend the first 10 seconds maneuvering, then the last 5 checking all sides of the machine to make sure you're positioned well enough for a grab (if you are doing this on your own). *The claw sometimes automatically goes down after time has gone up, but sometimes it goes back over the drop area, so make sure you are perfectly over the item you want and press the button to lower the claw.






If you have 30 seconds, spend 10 seconds maneuvering, 10 seconds checking the boundaries of the claw (sometimes it won't go all the way to the corners) 5 seconds for perfecting, then the last 5 dropping the claw.






If you have 45 seconds, spend 5 seconds deciding (if you put the money in already), 10 seconds maneuvering, 10 seconds checking boundaries, 20 seconds perfecting, and 5 seconds to drop the claw

Always try to make space.,
Secure.,
Camp appropriately.,
Try not to start in the center.,
Practice alone.,
Always look for bigger spaces, but secure your original as much as you can.,
Don’t underestimate your opponents!,
Never do moves, that is unnecessary!,
Don’t die for a powerup.,
Planning is crucial.,
Don’t try to slaughter everyone at once, because it is most likely you will be slaughtered first, but if someone is too close, take him down.

,
Look after players who are chasing other players.,
Learn curving.,
If someone invaded your space, shut down the way in immediately, but don't linger there too long; your enemy will try to break out, and you should be quicker, because he'll most likely to block your way out.

,
Confidence is everything.,
Delay taking some powerups!,
Chase your opponents when you are faster than them!,
Trick your opponents with the reverse!,
Time your powerups!",How to Be a Good Player in Curve Fever," Even if a little corner, that should give the others enough time, to take their owns, so you won’t have to navigate without a plan and evade everyone.;
, If your space is big enough, make sure that you secure it ASAP. The bigger space you have, the more others wants to invade it.

, Make a full camp, by starting from the borders until you reach the center, or make the lines loose, and before you reach the center, make a turn, and start to go back through the way you just did.

, Everyone can attack you, from every side, and you have a low chance to capture any space.

, If you have a premium account, than you are lucky, since you can set any powerups. The most useful is, to set only one power up, which should be the following: Fast, slow, triple, square and reverse. Try to make hard moves, big challenges that you wouldn't dare while playing seriously. Remember, all the failures helps you to become pro!

, You can go back anytime, but don’t stay in one place if you have the opportunity, to get bigger space. If you miss the chance, others will take it, and by that, they’ll have a higher chance to win.

, Try to keep your gaming style as peaceful as you just can, otherwise, others will notice your rudeness, and will target you! If you are peaceful, you’ll be less visible to others, which is a big advantage, since they’ll target you anyway if you are the leader.

, Try to do the less important moves as simple as possible, but if you have to dodge someone, be vulpine.

, If it’s risky, and you have a bigger chance to win, leave it. Risk them only if you are losing

, When your space is full, and you have to navigate in the more chaotic part of the map, plan from step by step. Point out a goal, where you have to get, like an empty space or a powerup, and search for a way backwards! This is very important. Start the search from the goal, until you reach yourself. You should do this before you are out of space, since the game is fast, and it is possible that you won’t have enough time to calculate all this moves. Never leave your space before time, only if your way out will be blocked.

,, Secure your back, then get after them; you’ll have a chance, to get them, and you will have a bigger space if they are that desperate.

, With practise, you will eventually figure out how big is the curve that you can make. Calculate your moves knowing this. For example, if you need to turn into a small place, go to the opposite side for a short time, so you don't have to curve all the way in.

,, Believe, that you can make that move, even imagine it. This is the most important step of all. If your head is not clear, or if you are too excited, than you can't plan that much. Relax, don't take it seriously, don't think about what others may say about you; enjoy the moment, try to do your best and concentrate as much as you can. Try to play with nice people. Motivating and fun company can fasten your learning up. If you happen to play with a douche, ignore him. He is most likely to make mistakes more often, because of his negative attitude which totally distracts him.

, If you get an eraser or a switch in your camp, try to wait as long as possible before taking it. The longer you delay, the greater is the chance that some of your opponents die before the board clears.

, If you pick up a green speed or a red turtle, you can use your speed to go in front of your opponents and kill them.

, If you see a reverse (the powerup that switches the keys of your opponents snakes) nearby, you can use it to trick your opponents. Go towards the powerup and pretend that you are going to take it. Then turn away in the last second. Your opponents might think that you took it and therefore press the wrong key.

, Take a fat when your opponent is about to go through a hole. Take a green speed when an opponent is nearby. Usually, red powerups are best in the endgame when there are little space left, so try to save them.

Double Side attack: The aliens will come in from both sides throughout the entrance phase.
Doubled-UP attack: The aliens come in side-by-side. This is the most difficult set to kill. You have to destroy one layer to get to the other.

You can get away with sloppy play in most stages. Always bring yourself to full attention during the Doubled-UP attack stage.



Single-File attack: Twice as long, but one after another. You should be able to hit almost all of the aliens during the entrance.

, This will give you a small semi-""safe"" area.


The direction the blue aliens will rotate will be determined by their side.

, After the first challenging stage, one of the blue aliens will morph into a creature with three parts. Shooting all three parts of the creature gives a 1000+ point bonus. If the stage has been almost completely cleared, collecting it will be a cinch. Allow the creature to fully form, if you shoot it while its morphing, the bonus will be lost.

You can download Pac-Mac 256 for free from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.;
, You can either play a Free Game or you can use a Credit. Using a Credit allows you to use Power Ups.


Free Game - You can play the game without using any credits or paying anything. You won’t be able to use any power-ups though. To play for free, tap the “Free Play” button to start playing.
1 Credit - If you want to have power-ups during the game, you can play it by spending 1 credit. You have 6 credits to begin with, and these replenish over time. Tap the “Play” button to start playing with power-ups. You will be deducted 1 credit, which will be replenished in 10 minutes.

, Pac-Man starts at the bottom of the maze. Move him by swiping towards the direction you want him to turn. If you want to move him up, swipe up. If you want to turn him left, swipe left. Pac-Man will start moving. If you have the game sounds on, you can hear the classic chomping sound as Pac-Man moves through the maze.

, The maze is filled with Pac-dots for Pac-Man to eat. Your score is based on the number of dots you eat in the game before getting hit by the glitch or a ghost. Move Pac-Man across the maze and eat as many Pac-dots as possible.

, Avoid the different colored ghosts in the maze. Once you hit one, it’s game over. Different ghosts move and act differently in the maze, so observe their movements and plan your turns.

, Aside from the Pac-dots, there are a few fruits scattered on the maze. These fruits will multiply your scores. When you see one, see if you can eat it without risking getting eaten by ghosts.

, You may also see Power Pellets every so often. These are the white round items, much bigger than the Pac-dots. When you see one, try to eat it. It will give Pac-Man invincibility against the ghosts for a short time. All the ghosts will turn blue and Pac-Man can eat them, which adds to your score. When the ghosts start blinking white, it means the power is ending and you should go back to avoiding ghosts again. You don’t want to be near one when it turns back to their original color.

, The main difference between Free Play and 1 Credit is the use of power-ups. There are various power-ups available in the maze. If you see items not resembling Pac-dots, fruits, or pellet, most likely these are the power-ups. Get Pac-Man to them to give it some special powers for a short duration, much like when it eats a Power Pellet. Some power-ups will allow Pac-Man to shoot lasers at ghosts, while some will temporarily freeze the ghosts in their places.

, Whatever you do, always move up. After a few seconds from starting, the glitch will begin from the bottom and it will eat up the maze. If Pac-Man gets hit by the glitch, it’s game over.

, Continue playing and beat your highest score. The further up the maze you go, the more Pac-dots you can eat, and the more points you get. Eating the fruits and the ghosts will also increase your score. Your score is displayed at the top part of the maze as you play.

When a game is started your first ball is placed in the shooter lane, ready to launch. Either pull back and release the plunger or press the launch button. Some machines use different styles of launch buttons including gun handles, door knockers, etc. depending on the theme.

, There are buttons on the side of the game. These are the flipper buttons, pressing these will flip the flippers on the corresponding side of the playfield. Some games have more flippers than the standard 2 at the bottom.

, The basic goal of pinball is to keep the ball on the playfield and use the flippers to aim for targets and score points. There are dividers above each lower flipper. If the ball comes down the inner side of a divider, it enters the return lane and comes back to the flipper. If it falls in the outer lane, known as the outlane, the ball is lost and your next ball begins (unless that was your last ball). You also ""drain"" if a ball slips between the flippers. You usually get 3 balls per game.

The whole point of the game is that there is one or more ghost and the rest of the people are Pac Man.,
Choose a spot to play.,
Find people who are willing to play.,
Once you have assembled everything, you’re ready to set up the playing field.,
Grab the rock or chalk and draw a shape that fits the whole area (unless if it’s really big).,
Next, draw random lines that connect to the biggest shape you drew.,
Draw a circle in the middle of the playing field.,
Pick the person that is going to be the ghost.,
Ask the ghosts to stay in the middle of the circle or choose any place.,
Ask the Pac Men to stand in any place they like as long as it’s on a line.,
When you start the game, everyone can run but the ghosts will chase the Pac Men which is the whole point of the game.,
When a ghost successfully touches a Pac Man, the Pac Man sits down (to avoid confusion with players) on the place where they got touched which means they are ‘out’.,
The ghost though has special privileges which let them pass the ‘out’ Pac Man no matter how many there are in a line.,
When there is only one more Pac Man left, that person is acclaimed as the winner.",How to Play Pac Man in Real Life1," That means, one or more person is catching the rest of the people who are running on lines.;
, Find a huge area of land that is used for recreational purposes. It would be better if it has lines or circles all over it e.g. a basketball court. Make sure there isn't anyone there and it is a surface where you can draw things on it with chalks or a rock. The bigger the space, the better.


When using a public place, always ask for permission first!

, It’s a straightforward game that anyone can understand. You can ask your family members or friends. Remember that the more people you invite, the larger area you have to hire.

, You will need a rock or a chalk to do this.

, It should be around the size of a normal basketball court depending on how many people are playing (i.e. 30 people = 2 or 3 basketball courts).

, The lines can be anywhere as long as a person can walk around. Always remember to leave some space around it.


Add in some strange shapes too. This can be circles, hexagons, cylinders etc. Add in some tricky bits too to make the game more fun.
Ensure all of the lines you drew are touching other lines so there won’t be a dead-end. You can though if you want to but don’t add in too many.

, That will be the place where the ghost will start. You don’t have to draw it as the ghost can start anywhere but it’s best too so you don’t have to choose the position where the ghost stays.

, Pick one if you have a very less amount of players i.e. 10 players= 1 ghost. If you have more, it’s better to choose two. Remember you can always restart and play the game over and over again.

, This will mean that the rest of the players are Pac Man who have to run away from the ghosts.

, They will obviously stay away from the ghost.

, All of the player ‘’’must’’’ stay on the line when running. No cutting corners! Whoever fails to follow the rules, they immediately are out which will be explained in the next step.

, Their job is to block the rest of the Pac Man from getting to the other side of the line. That means: e.g. there is a person out and is sitting on a line, a Pac Man sees the person out but can’t go on the other side of the line.


If they do however, that is cheating which means that they are out.
Also, there is only one person in a row of a line. That means, there can’t be two people standing next to each other running on a line. If that happens, they’re out.

, This makes the game more fun and quick. This rules ‘’’only’’’ applies to the ghost.

, Play again if desired.

, Modifiers that change scrolling speed such as HI-SPEED will help you to see notes better. Changing the scrolling speed means that the space between notes is larger, but this also means that the time for you to react is much more shorter, so watch out. Also, HARD or EX-HARD is very helpful. HARD or EX-HARD make the gauge increase more difficult and decrease at more rate than normal. This way, you can push yourself to the limit and slowly but sure, you will do better.

, Don't play same songs repeatedly. There are a lot of songs with interesting pattern, so you can learn new techniques.

, You cannot push yourself too much. It is better that you start playing on difficulty range(s) that are comfortable for you, then increase the difficulty step-by-step.

This means that you're close to the stall and can get a lot of money easily.;
, In the region you will need a produce stall that sells celery, a job nearby and a tavern/house to sleep in. Some produce stalls that sell the celery can be found in Bowerstone, Oakfield and Bloodstone. Since there is a high paying blacksmith job and a tavern to stay the night in Bowerstone, your best bet is to travel to that region. Once you're there, move on to the next step.

, Once you have a tidy amount of gold, find the produce stall. In Bowerstone, it's either on the bridge or just before it. Walk up to the stall or the trader standing by it and press the ""X"" button. It should bring up a list of all the things that trader has to offer. Go to ""Buy Items"" and buy as many celery as you can. If you have enough money, you should be able to buy all of that trader's stock.

, Now that you have your celery, it's time to eat it. Open up the menu screen and go into your inventory. You should find the celery in the ""Food and Potions"" category. Keep selecting it to eat it all up, one by one. Every time you eat one celery, you will get thinner by five points. You probably won't notice it at first but you will start noticing it later on when villagers start finding you more attractive.

, Opposite the bridge in Bowerstone, there is a tavern. Upstairs, there are a few rooms with beds in. Walk into a room and select a bed. Choose to sleep until the morning. By then, the stall should have re-stocked and you can repeat the process. To be on the super safe side, you can sleep for seven days. However, your character will eventually get old if you keep doing that. Repeat the process from step one until your character is thin enough for you.

Green lights. Green lights indicate that the console is powered and operating correctly. The number of green lights indicates how many controllers are connected.
One red light. This is the Hardware Failure indicator. It is usually accompanied by an “E74” or similar code displayed on the TV. This is caused by the video scalar chip being damaged.
Two red lights. This is an overheating error. If the console becomes too hot, the system will shut down and display this light code. The fans will continue running until the components have been cooled.
Three red lights. This is the General Hardware Failure, also known as the Red Ring of Death. This indicates that one or more components have failed, and that the system is no longer operable. No error code will be displayed on the TV.

, Once the clamps have been removed, lift the heat sinks directly off of the board. You may have to apply a little force to pull the heatsinks off of the thermal paste.

, You may need to use acetone or nail polish to completely remove the old thermal paste.

Have the console professionally fixed.,
Have the console sent in to Microsoft.",How to Temporarily Fix Your Xbox 360 from the Three Red Rings2," There are many establishments, both online and in brick-and-mortar shops, which offer Xbox repairs. They will essentially be performing the steps outlined above. They may also reflow the solder using a heat gun or reflow machine. These repairs can be expensive, but may be more reliable than doing it yourself.


Be sure to choose with a trusted establishment. Don’t just send your Xbox to the first website you find online, do some research and make sure they are legitimate.

, If you are still under warranty, Microsoft will replace or repair your failed console. You may have to pay shipping or additional fees depending on the details of your warranty.

Dust your Xbox.",How to Temporarily Fix Your Xbox 360 from the Three Red Rings3," Heat is the number one cause of hardware failure for the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 needs to be as cool as possible in order to operate properly. Overheating can cause a variety of hardware issues, leading to the failure of different components.


Excess heat warps the motherboard, separating it from the CPU and GPU.

, Do not place it in a cabinet or other enclosed space. Make sure that other electronics are not close, and that none of the vents are blocked. Do not place your 360 on a carpeted surface, as it will not be able to vent out of the bottom.

, Running your Xbox constantly will increase the amount of heat it generates. Give your system breaks to allow it to cool down.

, There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that placing your system vertically decreases its ability to dissipate heat, as well as increasing the chances of scratched discs. Place your system horizontally on a hard, flat surface.

, Stacked items will reflect heat back into the system. Keep the top of your system clear.


Even stacking a couple of game cases on top of the Xbox can cause a significant increase in heat.

, Make sure to dust the area regularly to keep particles from accumulating in the system. Dust the surroundings to reduce the amount of dust in the air.

, Use a vacuum to suck dust out of the vents. Wipe dust off of the system regularly. In extreme cases, you can open your case and use compressed air to blast dust off of the components.

You can determine whether a game supports system link by looking on the back of the game box or in the manual. This will also tell you how many players can join in on system link play.
Note that standard ethernet cables won't work without a hub for original Xbox users because they do not negotiate IP addresses. A crossover cable is required instead.;
, Simply use your system link cable or Ethernet crossover cable to create a connection between the Ethernet port on the back of each console. You'll find the Ethernet port below the Aux port on the original Xbox, Xbox 360 E and Xbox 360 S editions, and it's located next to the A/V port on the original Xbox 360.


Those connecting at least three consoles will instead use Ethernet crossover cables to connect your consoles (separately) to the network hub, switch or router. Note that some older routers may not work as well.
Connect the consoles to your network hub, switch or router in order rather than skipping one of the ports.
A standard ethernet cable (Cat5 or Cat6) will work for original Xbox consoles (so long as you're using a network hub rather than connecting the systems directly).

, Note that you may wish you to assemble your screens so that other players can view them all or only the player's. Either way, you'll likely need some space to arrange them appropriately.

No image appears on my TV after connecting recording device.,
Recording is choppy.",How to Record Xbox 360 Gameplay1," In order to record direct gameplay from your Xbox 360, you'll need a device that can take the video and audio signal and record it before passing it on to your display. Make sure the recording device supports the output cables for your Xbox 360 (for example, some newer recording devices only support HDMI, while your Xbox may not have an HDMI port).


There are a lot of different devices to choose from when it comes to recording gameplay. The most popular brands are Elgato and Hauppauge. These two companies make external devices that connect to your computer and record gameplay from the console.You can also get a PCI capture card for your desktop computer, such as the Black Magic Design Intensity Pro. Cards like this are less user-friendly, as they will need to be installed yourself, but they tend to be a little more powerful (and expensive).;
, Some recording devices will cause some display lag when they are recording. To avoid this, you can use a splitter to send the gameplay to your TV, while the game recording happens on your computer.

, After you've acquired all of your tools, you'll need to connect everything in the correct order.Connect the Xbox 360's video cable (HDMI or Component/YPbPr) to the recording device's ""IN"" port.
Connect the recording device's ""OUT"" port to your TV.
Connect your recording device to your computer. Connect to a USB 3.0 port on your computer if possible.

, All recording devices will come with recording software that allows you to capture gameplay footage from the Xbox 360. Insert the disc that came with the recording device, or visit the webpage indicated by the manual to install the recording software.

, The resolution and frame rate that you record at will have a significant impact both on the resources required as well as the final size of the file.


If you connected your Xbox 360 via Component/YPbPr cables, your maximum resolutions are 720p or 1080i. HDMI supports 1080P (on most newer recording devices), but will still be limited by the actual output of the Xbox 360, as not all games are displayed at 1080p.
Most recording devices can only record up to 30 frames per second (FPS). If you have a newer device, you can record up to 60, but this is very taxing on your computer's hardware and not all Xbox 360 games display at 60 FPS.

, Start playing your game and use the the recording software to begin recording. Recorded gameplay will take a significant amount of hard disk space, so make sure you have plenty of free space before starting to record.

, Once you've finished capturing some gameplay, you can edit the footage to your liking and upload it to your preferred online video site.



Click here for instructions on editing your footage.

Click here for instructions on uploading your video to YouTube.

, If your TV does not support 1080P, it could be the cause of no image appearing when connecting your recording device.


The quickest way to fix this is to change your Xbox 360 video output settings to 720p or 1080i.

, This is typically caused by the recording process overtaxing your computer's hardware. Lower your recording settings to see if you can improve performance.


You should notice a significant difference moving from 1080p recordings to 720p recordings, and when moving from 60 FPS to 30 FPS.

Since you're going to be recording ""off-screen"" with this method, you're never going to have perfect quality. Instead, you'll want to focus on minimizing the amount of outside distractions by setting up the camera so that the screen takes the entire frame and ensuring that it's steady.

, You can use a tripod for this, or find a level surface that gives your device a good view of the TV display.


Try to fit the entire TV display so that it fills up the camera's frame.

Identify power weapons and their locations on each map.,
When playing a multiplayer match, ALWAYS begin with a strategy that will allow you, or someone on your team, to acquire all the Power Weapons on the map.,
Know the maps - Know all the popular hiding spaces, the 'newb highways', the vehicle spawns, the power weapon spawns, interactive gates, man-cannon jumps etc.,
Communicate - When you are in a team, talk-talk-talk.,
Team Work - If you see a friend and enemy fighting, make it a priority to help.,
Vehicles - If playing a very good team, either your entire team needs to be in them, of don't touch them at all.,
When playing CTF (Capture the flag) or Assault, there are two winning tactics.,
When playing Territories, concentrate your close friends around one or two areas.,
When playing Team Slayer, follow your teammates and stay withing covering range of them.",How to Win in Halo 3 Multiplayer,"


The weapons that are commonly considered power weapons are: Energy Sword, Gravity Hammer, Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Spartan Laser, and Beam Rifle.
A power weapon is a weapon that will (when the right technique is used) kill an opponent with one round (i.e. a single head-shot with the sniper rifle, a close range shotgun blast to the torso).
Also, depending on the map you are playing, there are tactical weapons which although not considered power weapons, can severely alter the course of the game-play. These weapons are usually asymmetrical and hotly contested. These are context sensitive and up for debate. But some definitely are:

Missile Pod/Turret (Turret is debatable. Before grabbing, ask your self- Does your team have a sniper up to counter snipe? Is the enemy in a Banshee ? Is some one on their team skilled with a Battle Rifle?) on Valhalla.
Mauler/Needler/Rocket on the Narrows
Battle Rifle/Sword/Sniper on Construct
Battle Rifle/Needler/Shotgun/Rocket on Isolation
Battle Rifle/Rocket/Shotgun on the Pit
Mauler/Beam Rifle/Spartan Laser/Cloaking on Snowbound
Battle Rifle/Needler/Covenant Carbine/ Gravity Hammer/Cloaking on Guardian
Battle Rifle/Brute Shot/Sniper/Spartan Laser/Shotgun on Last Resort

These weapons, although suited well to each of the maps listed above, are not more effective than Power Weapons.



;
, It is a good idea to use this approach not only because controlling the Power Weapons will give you a slight advantage in a 1 on 1 or multiple assailant scenario, but it is also important to get them off the map early in order to prevent the opposing team from controlling the Power Weapons and using them against you and your team mates. If you are unable to pick up power weapons in a game, then resort to possibly using one of the tactical options listed above. If you do not prefer one of those weapon combos, at least make sure at all times that you have a decent longer range weapon (Battle Rifle, Covenant Carbine) and a good close range weapon (Assault Rifle, Mauler, Brute Shot).


Some weapons that are considered universal Power Weapons are-

The Sniper Rifle
The Shotgun
The Rocket Launcher
The Spartan Laser
The Beam Rifle
The Energy Sword
The Gravity Hammer

Control these weapons to win.





, If playing ranked, hammer out a rock-solid plan of attack. Even if your plan refuses to work, having a clear cut objective will turn you into a more driven, focused fighter, and keep you from wandering around aimlessly. If in social, still formulate a plan. You will be surprised at how often the enemy will not notice or not act on this.

, Relay enemy positions, what weapons they have, and try to use basic tactics, I.E., flanking, and ambushing. A victory yell now and again can raise morale, but don't do it often, or you soon will be muted.

, Even if you steal his kill, or 'Vulture' him, he will appreciate the help and it will benefit the team. If you are a sniper, use your ammo to drop the shields of enemy's, and let your friendlies get the kill, thus conserving ammunition.

, A full team of warthogs is hard to stop, but one gunner less one is easy prey. Here are some general strategies.


Light Vehicles-

The Ghost - When piloting the Ghost remember that if you stop moving or are maintaining a very slow speed, an enemy can commandeer (carjack) your vehicle. It is important while in the Ghost (and most other vehicles) to ALWAYS KEEP MOVING. ALWAYS KEEP MOVING. ALWAYS KEEP MOVING. Staying in motion simply makes it harder for enemies to shoot your vehicle. They may land a couple of shots on you, but usually you can make a clean getaway even if your shields suffer a little. Also, the Ghost is a wonderful vehicle to use to splatter members of the opposing team. When approaching an enemy to splatter him, make sure that before you arrive at the target that you are using the turbo booster on the Ghost (Left Trigger). If you are engaged in this boost and come in contact with an enemy, it is almost a certain kill. Also, the dual plasma cannons (Right Trigger) are an effective weapon and should be used liberally being that there is unlimited ammo for them (careful though because they do give your position away easily).
The Mongoose - This is a light transport vehicle with no on board weapons. Even though it counts as an achievement in the game to splatter someone with this vehicle, DO NOT regularly attempt to use the Mongoose as an assault vehicle. The Mongoose is very fast and has the capacity to transport 2 (Passenger, Driver) soldiers. Because of its speed, the Mongoose should mainly be used in a ""smash & grab"" tactic. For example, in Valhalla, the mongoose is a great tool to speed to the middle of the board to control the Spartan Laser and drop off a sniper at the pelican. Another good Mongoose tactic would be to load it up with 2 soldiers and use it in a flank, or pincer movement in unison with soldiers on foot to catch the opposing team off guard. Note that this requires a well trained and organized unite, or else you are likely to be slaughtered.
The Chopper - Same ramming attitude with the Ghost. Use the cannons to pick off aware enemies. One exception. When a vehicle makes a headlong pass at you perform the 'Harley of Death' (You will be surprised how often it happens), pull the left trigger to boost and ram them. One good ram can take out a fully loaded Warthog.


Warthog Tactics

The Warthog (MG) - As a driver, your primary goal is to keep you gunner alive. Don't take risks to get a splatter award, and don't rush into an ambush thinking you can kill them. Keep the truck alive as long as possible, but don't avoid combat when it comes. Keep the passenger seat between you and the enemy to reduce the amount of damage you take. Remember, if you die, your gunner will die also. As gunner, your duty is to shoot every available target, regardless of range. Prioritize your enemies. The guy close to you with a rocket or a 'splazer' is a bigger threat than the mile and a half away sniper, and don't whine about not getting kills to your driver, as his job is to stay alive. The passenger is arguably the most/least important team member. His job should consist of three things-


Securing power weapons.

Acting as a martyr should the 'hog get swarmed'.
And acting as dismount. i.e. securing flags/bombs, or jumping out to help friendlies in a fire fight.
A fully functioning 'hog team' demands skill, training, and a level head, but a fully loaded and coordinated Warthog is in my opinion the most devastating vehicle in the game.
The Warthog (Gauss)- The drivers priority is the same here, but added is the need to stay far from the front line, and keep the gunners aim level. As a gunner, you are the ultimate sniper. Infinite Ammo, Range, Accuracy, 1 hit kill damage, it is just epic how much damage a crack shot can induce with this. Target light vehicles (Banshee, mongoose, Ghost, Chopper) first, then infantry. Do not engage tanks if at all possible, unless you ambush them. A passenger has the same responsibilities as before.


Aircraft-

The Banshee - This is a flying vehicle with incredible maneuverability. The weapons on this vehicle include the double plasma cannons (same as the ghost) and also a more powerful plasma blast that is fired using the ""B"" button. Simply pull back on the Left Stick to ascend, and push forward to descend. There are also two ""evasive maneuvers"" possible. One is the ""barrel roll"" executed by hard tapping the Left Stick to the left or right and pressing the ""A"" button at the same time. Also is the ""somersault"" performed by hard tapping the Left Stick forward or backward and pressing the ""A"" button at the same time. These will help you evade Missile Locks, etc.


Tanks-

Wraith- This is the more maneuverable of the two tanks, and comes with a small speed boost that allows it you to escape from tight spots. It's plasma mortar is more than a little hard to aim, and to learn to use, but can be devastating to infantry and can arc fire so that you can remain in cover while still providing support using good judgment or more preferably, a spotter. It also carries a turret mounted plasma gun for anti-infantry work.
Scorpion- Usually the more preferred of the two, it comes with a straight shooting cannon, and an anti-infantry turret mounted machine gun. Also is faster in a straight line, but decidedly harder to turn.



, One, and the best if you are new, is to guard/camp your teams bombsite/flag-point. You will not get a lot of kills, but the ones you do will be very valuable and appreciated by your team. If you keep them from winning, then you can't lose. The second, is known as the spawn-rush. You, and some friends who have practiced this, jump in a fast vehicle and rush for the other teams base to capture there flag or plant the bomb. If done right, you can be in and out of harms way before they know what happened.

, Hold them at all costs, and do not leave. At the start of the next round,rush for the two farthest away territories. This will mean that the hard part is already over, as the rest of the territories should be fairly easy to capture.

, The more weapons you can bring to bear all at once on your foe, the better chance you have at winning. Team Slater matches are just a series of altercations, and the side that wins the war is the side that wins the most altercations.

, A Wraith, Banshee, Warthog and two Mongooses are present in each base.

, There is one present in each base and can lock onto vehicles.

, For example, if someone is hiding behind the wall next to the man cannon in a base and jumping up and down while you're trying to snipe them to taunt you, snipe the Fusion Coil while they're in the air to create a big explosion.

, For example, practice hijacking a Banshee, and know that running towards a Wraith head-on isn't a very good strategy.

, For example, driving around in a Mongoose for apparently no reason will put people off their guard, when you're actually going to the other base to get the sniper.

, Holding the Right Trigger and pressing the Left Joystick forward or back will move the object forward or back respectively, whereas pressing the Joystick left and right will rotate the object. Holding the Right Trigger and moving the Right Joystick will rotate the object also, but it is in a different direction to the Left Joystick. Now you will be able to rotate or manipulate objects to your wishes, although it is hard to master, especially with objects such as walls or doors.

Power drains are a piece of equipment which you can use in both the Halo 3 campaign and multiplayer, so work the same way as bubble shields and the like. Walk over an unarmed power drain to pick it up and press X on your Xbox 360 controller to use it. When activated, it emits a shield-draining energy which effects anyone caught in its' radius, and lasts for approximately 6.5 seconds. In addition, the explosion when it over-charges and is destroyed, can in some cases kill nearby enemies.;
, Most maps have default-spawning power drains, such as Construct, The Pit and Valhalla, but they can be bought and placed on any map when editing in Forge, so use them as much as possible. Try to see the best strategies are for certain maps and what uses the power drain can perform.

, The power drain is most effective when deployed, drains your opponent's shields and is then followed by a weapon such as a battle rifle, carbine or magnum. One head shot from any of these will finish off any opponent affected by the power drain, and this is especially useful when firing upon lots of enemies bunched close together.

, Power drains are one of the most effective ways to disable enemy vehicles. When deployed, the power drain will stall any vehicle its' drain effect touches in the same way as an over-charged plasma pistol. Although the vehicle's guns will still work, the occupants and the vehicle itself will be vulnerable to a grenade or weapons fire, or if you wish, to boarding. The effect won't last long, so be ready.

, Power drains are very useful for covering areas and buying you time. If a large group of enemies are flanking you through a corridor or other area, consider throwing a power drain their way to hold them off while you make your escape. Usually, opponents who see that a power drain has been deployed will avoid the area for a while, making them excellent for holding of vital weapon spawns and areas on the map.

, Opponent in a bubble shield or regenerator? No problem! Power drains can be thrown inside bubble shields and negate the effects of a regenerator, even reducing player's shields if they are next to one. Power drains are also effective against players who have picked up over-shields or invisibility, reducing their shields and making them visible to others. And of course, nothing scares campers more than a power drains followed by a grenade.

, On odd occasions, the power drain can actually kill opponents. If their shields have been depleted and they are standing directly next to the power drain as it over-charges and is destroyed, then there is a chance that the player will die. This chance is greatly increased when the power drain is deployed near fusion coils.

, Power drains are deadly when thrown into a man-cannon, especially when it's in the path of an oncoming banshee or vehicle. Power drains are also incredibly useful when used on maps with elevators, such as Construct, where a power drain can doom anyone traveling up the lift, or be used to clear it to make way for team mates. In addition, power drains can effect players through walls and on different levels, so on multi-story levels don't underestimate them.

, This will make your character enter the Ghost and turn on the power to it. A message may appear, prompting you to enter the Ghost when you near the vehicle.

, Unlike when on foot however, you will not be able to zoom in by pressing the Right Joystick.

, The amount of pressure you place on the joystick will be relative to how fast you want the Ghost to travel. Use the joysticks in combination to turn and maneuver around the map. If you apply no pressure to the Left Joystick, the Ghost will remain stationary and will also not show on your opponent's radar.

, The Ghost will continue to fire as long as you apply pressure to the trigger. Although the guns are not as powerful as other weapons in the game, they can be used at a fair distance with effect. However, you will not be able to move as freely whilst firing.

, This will speed the ghost along the ground at a faster pace than usual, although you will not be able to shoot and you will not be able to turn as freely whilst the boost is applied. The boost however is useful for ramming opponents with your vehicle. If you kill them, this is called a 'Splatter' and counts as a kill towards your character.

, However, pressing A only slows the vehicle down and raises the front of the ghost, rather than stopping it all together and is very ineffective whilst applying boost. Simply ceasing to apply pressure or move the Left Joystick is a much better alternative. However, pressing A can come in handy if you are about to make a large jump or avoid small obstacles, as it raises your vehicle's front allowing for some ground clearance beneath it.

, It will exit your character from the vehicle and the Ghost will cease to move.

, A message may appear, prompting you to flip the Ghost when you near it. The Ghost will function as normal after you have flipped it.

Go for the best possible- Vehicular manslaughter is the highest medal you can get for splattering, but that doesn't stop you from getting Running rampage or Perfections or higher.",How to Use a Ghost Effectively in Halo 3," To use a ghost well, controlling it must be automatic, so this means practicing on maps with ghosts on it, such as High Ground or Isolation. Simply get in a ghost and travel the map on it, finding the hard points for you to later avoid, and the areas easy to access in case you need an escape plan and get to know where the ghosts spawn.;
, When a map with a ghost comes up, rush the ghost immediately. If possible, tell your team mates that you want the ghost. The more you use them the more kills you will be able to get while using them.

, The maps with ghosts on them are Avalanche, High Ground, Isolation, Last Resort, Rat's Nest, Snowbound and in some special game-types Sand trap, Stand off and Valhalla may also include ghosts. Each map has its own strengths and weaknesses in regard to using ghosts.




Avalanche - This map is hard to use a ghost on due to the high amount of flying and armored vehicles. Stick to the sides of the maps and areas where the wide open space of the map narrows, such as the middle of the map.
High Ground - This is by far the most successful map for ghosts, but it requires team work to keep them alive. Due to the fact that there are two ghosts, you only have to beat your team members to get one. Once you are in the ghost, get your teams members to secure the laser and rockets, in order to take out the enemy ghost and to avoid the enemy using these weapons against you. Due to the amount of high-powered weaponry (Rockets, laser, brute shots) it is best to keep moving, splattering opponents instead of shooting, and do not move in a straight line from the beach to the fort - it is much better to take a detour around the bunker in the middle, which also spawns enemies.
Isolation - Due to the long re-spawn times for the ghost on this map and the presence of rockets, Isolation is a difficult map to drive ghosts on. If you use it correctly however, and manage to keep the ghost alive, it can turn a game. Head straight for the ghost because you will likely encounter several other enemies and eventually rockets, so be prepared to sacrifice or destroy the ghost before someone else gets it. If you manage to get the ghost, don't be tempted to stick around where it re-spawns, head straight up to rockets. Quite often, if you time it correctly, an enemy will jump down to get rockets in front of you and you can instantly splatter him. Unless it is absolutely needed, never go above ground. There are too many rocks and trees to navigate the surface safely - a much better plan is to stay below ground and have your team camp below with re-generators where you can protect them. Driving this map beforehand in forge will help immensely - don't be tempted to sit around, just keep driving. Remember, the ghost takes a very long time to re-spawn, so keep it safe.

Last Resort - The ghost is hard to get to if unless you spawn on the sea wall side of the map. If you do manage to get the ghost, drive in a U shape around the giant fan, going from the beach through around the side of the fan and over to under the turrets. If you get shot, drive directly back to the beach, where it is unlikely you will meet a lot of enemies. Also, this route minimizes the amount of fire you will take, due to the angle you will drive on. You are most likely to kill enemies around the pylons and sniper base. Be sure to get a teammate to secure laser.

Rat's Nest - The ghost is probably not going to do much on this level - between your teammate's warthogs and your enemies' warthogs and rockets, you are likely to die a lot without much effect. If you do manage to avoid these obstacles, keeping around the bottom of the map so you can secure the middle area is your best bet.
Snowbound - The ghost is only useful on Snowbound if your team cooperates. Be sure to pass the plasma grenades before moving to the ghost when you first start, in case an enemy has already beaten you there. Because most of the fighting will be taking place underground, you are likely to get very few kills. However, if your team mates agree to stay above ground, you can protect them and get more kills in the process. This will not work however if the opponents are winning, as they will remain underground. Again, driving in a circular motion around the map will prove the best tactic.



, The more you play with various scenarios the more experience you will gain on how to defeat them.




Players on foot are easiest to kill, but while splattering enemies is more reliable and less time consuming, it also means you have to get in close to your opponent, so weigh the odds before going in. You risk getting stuck and blasted by rockets or laser, so if you are tackling someone with plasma or spike grenades, move in a curved line to negate if they throw one. If the player jumps, do not boost immediately, but wait for them to start falling before you splatter them.
Vehicles are more tricky to dispose of however. Fights with other ghosts are usually a case of who started shooting first, so make sure you surprise the other ghost so you have the upper hand.
Warthogs are hard to kill with ghosts, so the best plan is to use your speed to out run them. It may seem like you can out-shoot a warthog gunner, but you can't.

Mongooses are hard to kill also, but if you can corner or out-maneuver them, you can easily shoot them down.
Taking down choppers are hard, so take great care. Use your speed to attack them from the sides and back - they will kill you easily if you are in front of them.
Tanks and aircraft are definitely hard to take down with just a ghost, so the best bet is to leave the ghost and board them or evade.



, You will be surprised how long you can last on a ghost if you are smart and have a bit of skill. Don't expect to get the most kills every time, but aim for a high kill/death spread. Do not stop unless you need to - use your boost (Left trigger on the Xbox controller) in 1 second bursts with only a slight pause in between. This allows you to turn easily, but keep moving fast to avoid enemies, thus allowing you to stay alive for longer.

, This will damage your ghost, sometimes irreparably, and cause your health to be lost. Over time your ghost will degrade through battle, so avoid slamming into obstacles as much as possible. This is easier if you apply boost sparsely or every few seconds to allow easy turning, or just ignore it all together, although this isn't recommended.

, After a while you may feel quite attached to your ghost, but if you need to destroy it if you've been boarded, then do it immediately. It will be highly unlikely that you will get a chance to re-board the vehicle and even if it's sitting in the middle with no one driving it, you will likely be killed in the process of retrieving it. It is best to learn some other tactics for multiplayer games in these cases.

, The more practice you get the more medals you will receive.

Adapt to different situations.",How to Tackle a Group of Covenant in Halo 3," There are few types of Covenant forces, such as Brutes and Jackals, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some may be more susceptible to grenades, while other easier to kill with headshots. Learn how to kill each type of Covenant effectively before tackling a large group.;
, Covenant forces are usually mixed, with several unit types and ranks combined into one small unit. Observe the force's movements to discover who the leader is and what weapons they have.

, Although you may find yourself with only a plasma pistol and Needler, try to keep good attacking weapons such as the sniper or beam rifle or battle rifle for big battles such as this. Having a few grenades handy is also a good idea.

, Never launch an attack if you don't have cover, higher ground or access to weapons and grenades. If you have at least one of these conditions, then you will probably stand a good chance of withstanding a hard fight.

, This target should be carefully selected based on a few factors: rank, easiness to kill and threat. For example, the force's leader would be a prime target or a model with a devastating fuel-rod gun. Any enemy which is easy to kill and would pose a big threat in later battle is a prime target to eliminate first.

, Whoever you've chosen, it's probably for a good reason, so finish him off and do it quickly. Since you have the element of surprise, consider trying to stick the target, although head-shotting him would be much easier.

, Secondary targets may include enemies which also pose a major threat, such as snipers or turret-gunners, or those with powerful weapons, such as rockets or Gravity Hammers.

, You've lost the element of surprise and need to kill as many enemies as you can before they begin to form a plan to counterattack. Throw a few grenades to gain some time while they dodge the explosions.

, Although they may be a silly little enemy on their own, in large groups they are dangerous, especially if you are trying to aim up a Brute later on. Grunts are fairly easy to kill - one burst from a battle rifle will usually kill - so they should take up much time to eliminate. Drones are a little more hazardous - they can deplete your shields quickly and they're hard to get a lock on. Use a SMG or assault rifle to clear large areas on them and the battle rifle to pick off the last ones.

, A few grenades should kill any Jackals, but if there are only a few Jackals left, focus on killing the Brutes first. From there you can wipe up any Jackals left alive using a combination of melee and battle rifles, since it will be easier to engage in close-range combat with other hostiles eliminated.

, Any stray Jackals or Grunts roaming around shouldn't be too hard to kill, so relax and spend the rest of your time collecting any ammunition or special items.

, This article of course is targeting only one specific scenario with a medium, mixed infantry-based force. In other levels you may encounter all-brute forces or those with only drones. Vehicle based units are a different matter again. Throughout the campaign you will find numerous varieties of Covenant units, so be prepared for anything.

Get accustomed to the different type of grenades on offer.,
Practice using all four types of grenade.,
Adapt for different situations.,
Be intuitive.,
Use grenades in combination with other weapons.",How to Throw Grenades Like a Pro in Halo 3," There are four different types of grenades, and not all can be found on all maps or campaign levels, so you will need to get used to using all four types. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, so know what they are.

Frag grenades are a human-based grenade type which allow the user to 'bounce' the grenade off walls or floors to reach a target, making them highly useful around corners.



 


Plasma grenades are a Covenant-based grenade type which have adhesive properties, allowing them to stick to vehicles, players and some other surfaces.






Spike grenades, like plasma grenades, are a Covenant-based grenade type used primarily by Brutes, and also have an adhesive quality. However, they also shoot spikes out when detonated and can adhere to all terrain.






Incendiary grenades are a Covenant-based grenade type which explode with fire when detonated. They are only found in Halo 3's campaign being used by Brutes, but can be Forged to appear in player maps.





;
, Consider setting up a Custom Game when you can only use grenades or place a lot in Forge so that you can have an unlimited supply to use. The more you practice, either against targets or other players, the more skilled you will become with using them.

, Now you know what each grenade type's feel and capabilities are, it's time to put them into action in different situations. In a game you will need to assess the situation and act accordingly. Some times you will need to act very quickly, so your grenade throwing needs to be fluid.

Use frag grenades when attempting to kill a player around a corner, in a corridor or some other enclosed space. If your aim is good enough (typically for frag grenades it should be at your opponent's feet) then you stand a good chance of bouncing the grenade right at your enemy and killing him.






If someone is rushing you, a good idea is to use a plasma or spike grenade to 'stick' them. Even if you die, you still stand a chance of collecting a Kill From The Grave medal if the grenade kills them after you've died. Try aiming directly for their torso to maximize your aim.






Vehicles are easy to take down with plasma or spike grenades (although spike grenades are usually more effective). Simply aim for where the vehicle is heading and hope it blows it up.







, Blindly throwing a grenade may get you a kill occasionally, but to really be successful with them, you'll need to know where your opponent is going and throw a grenade just as they get there. If you know someone is chasing you around the corner, drop a grenade at their feet just as they turn it. If someone is coming over a man cannon, lob a grenade where they will land. If you can master guessing where they'll be, you'll gather many kills.

, The grenade/battle rifle combination is a powerful and deadly one, where you drop a grenade at someone's feet and finish them off with a single headshot. Other combinations also prove effective, so be creative and use the grenades as a nice addition to your arsenal.

Try a different style of teabagging, such as hitting your opponent's body with the B button or crouching up and down and moving the Left Joystick around as if you are grinding.,
Move on.",How to Teabag in Halo 3," Remember, it's a frowned upon practice that may upset or anger your opponent - after all, you've killed them, do you really need to rub it in more? If someone has been doing it to you in the match and you want revenge, it is understandable, but most people will think you are a big-head or loser if you teabag without provocation, so decide carefully.;
, Any kill will do, but teabagging is usually performed as a form of bragging and humiliation to your opponents, so a good kill will work much better, especially if it is with a low-level weapon such as a Magnum.

, Make sure you get there fast as there is only a limited amount of time before the player's screen cannot watch it any more, so time is of the essence. Getting to a player's body may be difficult if you killed them long-range or with an explosive weapon, which may fling the body anywhere.

, This is called teabagging, named after a sexual act which couples perform. You may choose to crouch up and down slowly or rapidly - it's your choice.

, Shooting the body may also work, but will waste your valuable ammo.

, You do not want to teabag for more than 3-5 seconds, as after this time, your opponent won't be watching any more as they will have spawned and you risk being killed by another player. People are more likely to kill you if you are teabagging one of their team mates, so take care.

You'll be playing against a few other players around your own skill level, so be prepared for a quick, furious and closely fought game. The Lone Wolves playlist can be accessed from the Ranked playlists in Matchmaking.;
, They are a hard vehicle to master, so get in as much play time with them as you can. You can only really kill someone with a Mongoose in a head-on collision, so take the time in either a custom game or forge session to get used to taking people out with a Mongoose, dodging attacks and generally moving around the Halo 3 world.

, In Lone Wolves, only High Ground and Isolation are equipped with mongooses, although Legendary Brawl does have other maps with the vehicle on it. These maps come up very infrequently in Lone Wolves, so be prepared when one does - otherwise you may miss your chance.

, They re-spawn pretty quickly, so if one isn't available, it won't be far off. It may pay to wait until all the power weapons have been expended, such as rockets and the spartan laser, so you have a better chance of surviving. On High Ground, mongooses can be found at either end of the map, while on Isolation they are found near the brute shots at either side of the map.

, Never stop driving while you're in a Mongoose; you'll be surprised at the number of times you'll splatter an enemy when turning a blind corner or one who happens to drop in front of you. Keeping on the go also lowers the risk of getting killed. Keep to a safe course, going near highly frequented areas, but alter it every so often to make sure you don't get ambushed.

, For example, a player with rockets, a shotgun or one who is throwing excessive grenades your way is not a good choice. Try finding unaware players who are already preoccupied in a battle or those who are standing still. Anyone which is unaware or who's shields are already depleted are prime candidates.

, This is harder than it sounds - you may have to drive around the map for a while before you get an opportunity and even then, you may fail. Keep at it and remember, you only need one splatter with your Mongoose to unlock the achievement. Once you have splattered someone, you will never have to drive a Mongoose again, so relax.

, It is represented by an image of Mongoose sending a player flying with three stars in the background.

Know that the True skill system works on two basic values, your uncertainty value (sigma) and your actual skill (mu) and will be referred to as sigma and mu from now on.,
Your sigma is basically how the game accounts for luck; it is the numerical representation of what your skill could be.,
Every time you start a new ranked play list your sigma for that one is high.

,
Mu increases after a win.",How to Understand Trueskill in Halo 3,";
, Play consistently for a low sigma, or play inconsistently for a high sigma.

,, Always. The increase is proportional to the winner's Sigma and the Mu difference between the winner and the loser. So, if your Sigma is high, you will proceed faster through the ranking system (in both directions). If your Sigma is low, you will both gain and lose rank more slowly.

Familiarize yourself with the game's Heads Up Display (shortened to HUD) which can be seen on your screen while playing in Halo 3.,
Learn Halo 3's controls which you will need to use in order to play the game:


Look around in Halo 3 by rotating or moving the Right Joystick on your controller.,
Familiarize yourself with the style of play that Halo 3 uses.",How to Play Halo 3," This is the opening screen of the game where you can select from several game modes to play from:


To play in Halo 3's campaign, select the Start Solo Game (which will begin the campaign story in single player mode) or Campaign just below that (which will allow you to select a previously completed level an allow you to change the settings or number of players).
To enter multiplayer action, select Matchmaking (An Xbox LIVE feature which allows you to play games verse other players around the globe), Custom Games (a local or Xbox Live feature where players can verse each other on a variety of maps in customized matches) or Forge (which allows players to create, edit and play on maps for use in Custom Games).
Finally, Theater allows you to save and edit films or screenshots from your campaign and matchmaking experiences for later viewing. Once you can navigate these features, you'll have a better understanding of how to play Halo 3.;
, Note that playing different characters, such as the Arbiter or Oracle in Forge mode, will change the appearance of your HUD:


To aim, use the cross-hair in the center of your screen which is where your shots will fire (in addition, red marks will appear around it if you take fire, to show which direction you are being hit from).
Your shield's health is shown on the top middle side of your screen (it will turn red if you are nearly dead).
To view what weapons you have and how much ammunition they hold, look in the top right-hand corner of your screen - Your current weapon will be shown in bold with the number of shots remaining and your side-weapon will be shown slightly below that. Note however that the number of shots is not shown when playing in split-screen.
On the opposite, top left-hand corner of your screen you will find the grenades you currently have in your possession.
Your radar (which allows you to see the whereabouts of enemies and allies) is located in the bottom left-hand side of your screen, although in some cases, it will not be available.
Finally, you can find match or campaign statistics and leader boards in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.

, Pressing the Joystick in also allows you to zoom in, whether with your binoculars or in some cases, a weapon's scope (such as when using a sniper rifle or rocket launcher).
Move around by rotating or moving the Left Joystick. The harder you move the Joystick, the faster your character will move - if you only move it slightly, it is possible to slow movement to a crawl. Pressing the Left Joystick in allows your character to crouch, making you a harder target and hides you from enemy radars.
Fire your weapon in Halo 3 by pressing and/or holding the Right Trigger on your controller. Different weapons have different abilities, so note what rate of fire they have. In cases, some weapons can be fired in combination with your zoom feature, so experiment with which weapons allow you to do so.

Throw a grenade by pressing the Left Trigger. Grenades throw on an arc, so aiming may be harder than other weapons. In addition, some grenades can bounce away while others can stick to walls or people, so experiment with the effects of the grenades.
Reload your weapon, swap or pick up weapons from the ground and/or perform an action (such as boarding a vehicle or opening a door) by pressing and/or holding the Right Bumper on your controller. The Right Bumper is a heavily used button in Halo 3, so get familiar with it.
Swap grenades by pressing the Left Bumper on your controller. You can carry more than one type of grenade, so pressing this button will allow you to select the best type for your situation. To view which is selected, look on your HUD for the type which is bolded.
Jump by pressing the A button - this can be used on combination with a number of other buttons, allowing you to shoot, aim or move whilst in mid-air. Jumping is useful for reaching places not normally accessed by walking alone.
Melee by pressing the B button on your controller - this performs a hand-to-hand attack with your weapon or fist and can be used to finish of an opponent.
Throw equipment by pressing the X button on your controller. Equipment is a recent invention found only in Halo 3 and has a variety of uses, so you will have to experiment with them. They can be equipped and picked up just like weapons.
Swap your weapons by using the Y button. This will pull your side weapon out and holster your main weapon. To swap again, press Y again.
To talk during a voice-restricted match, press the D-Pad in any direction and speak into your microphone if you have one.
Show an in-depth view of players and scores by pressing and holding the BACK button on your controller.
Pause the game, match or campaign by pressing the START button. This will pause the game for you only if you are in a multiplayer match, so beware. In addition, you will be able to access the pause menu, where you will be able to change game options and change teams.

, Halo 3 is basically a shooter, so weapons, cover, aim and strategy are all parts of the game which you must play. Primarily, the game uses a checkpoint system where you must navigate the level to reach a destination or eliminate a target, so navigation skills are key. On multiplayer matches, and indeed in co-operative campaign play, you must work with team mates and allies to finish your mission. Sharing resources, such as vehicles and weapons, are vital, so to play Halo 3 you must learn how to use the game and work with it. Practice makes perfect, so try out your new skills in a variety of scenarios.

Learn your weapons:

UNSC Sniper Rifle - This sniper rifle is the standard sniper rifle found on many maps.,
Know where your rifles are.,
Use the best zoom for the situation at hand.,
Use the guidelines marked inside the scope which are commonly overlooked - huge mistake.,
Learn the key locations in every map.,
Be unpredictable!,
Know the damage your shot will do.,
Have A Back-Up Plan!,
Normal Sniping - The standard sniping technique is to just track your opponent using your aimer.,
Sweep Snipe, or Swipe Snipe - Players most commonly choose to ""sweep snipe"" at players who are moving.,
Monkey get the Banana Snipe, or Leading snipe - This technique is one of the most under-estimated ways to snipe, yet it is extremely effective when mastered.,
No-Scoping - As the name suggests, it is the technique in which the sniper does not use the scope to achieve kills.",How to Snipe in Halo 3," It usually comes equipped with 12 rounds. There are 4 rounds in a clip. It can hold a maximum of 24 rounds. All around an excellent choice.






Covenant Beam Rifle - This sniper rifle can be found on only a couple of the present multiplayer maps. The key difference to this sniper rifle is that it does not need to be reloaded. Rather, when a certain firing rate is achieved, the gun will overheat, forcing the player to become vulnerable momentarily. In the hands of the right player, well placed shots can mean unlimited firing, but requires more patience than the UNSC Sniper.







, You must also have knowledge of where the snipers will spawn on each map. Practice your rush to the rifles to maximize your time.

, One of the hidden secrets of an expert sniper is that of using the scope effectively:

x2 zoom should be used in most cases as it will give an easier shot while giving you enough peripheral vision to ensure your safety.






x16 zoom should only be used at far distances, but can also be very useful at extreme close range. In narrow hallways, x16 means zooming completely into an opponents body, guaranteeing a hit. It is also good if you're absolutely sure you'll be able to pull off a head shot on an unsuspected victim, as the targeting region will be much larger.







, Note the height of the vertical lines in relation to the height of a Spartan. This makes it easier to judge how high your scope should be set in comparison to the ground. Also, the horizontal guidelines are extremely useful for calculating the distance away from a wall a target will run out from behind of. Using your guidelines makes head shots more predictable than ever.

, Look for places that will give you a height advantage, a broad view, and a well rounded advantage over other players. Understanding the flow of the game, and where players are typically located at a given time during the match will make finding your location much easier. Play custom games or experiment in forge to get an idea of where you'd like to snipe.

, Too often, snipers make the mistake of staying in one place for too long. Though this can be effective if teammate cover is provided, you must be wary of your opponents knowledge of your location. Killing someone instantly is satisfying, but don't let it catch up with you - players are smarter than you think. They will adjust their movements according to your position. Every time you kill an opponent, or even after a couple of missed shots, be sure to relocate to another location. If this isn't an option, even switching to a different side of a wall is better than staying in the exact same position for too long.

, A headshot is an instant kill, while body shots will only deplete shields, requiring a second shot to kill.

, You should always have a way to escape or hide if someone finds your position.

, This is best for sudden occasions, or situations where the following methods are not applicable.;
, To sweep snipe, focus on your targeting reticle and where it is in relationship to the target's head. You want to make sure your reticle is the same elevation (height) as the opponents head, regardless of where it is horizontally. Then, judging the distance, Pull the aimer stick in the direction of the player. When your reticle crosses over your target, fire. The key to this technique is to minimize vertical movement. This technique requires you to solidify your ability to know the sensitivity of your movement in relationship to the target's location. It is more common for last resort shots, or when you're in danger. This takes a lot of practice so try shooting the seagulls on Last Resort on the beach side or shooting the flying robots on Construct.

, This technique is for the more patient approach, as you must be aware of what your opponent's next move will be. It is best used at times when your target is in a gravity lift, or if your opponent is crossing an open area, unaware of your location. The key is to make your opponent do all the moving, and you simply shoot when the time is right. To successfully do this, you must understand your targets movement. Place your targeting reticule at a spot where you think the target will soon be. Give yourself scope room to reduce tracking. By reducing your aiming movements, you'll be much more successful. When the time is right, lay waste your opponent.

, This is extremely difficult as the reticle without zoom is extremely small. However, this should not intimidate you. No-scoping is a life saver when combat gets close, But it is Harder to get a shot on someone when using this technique. The same principles apply when no-scoping as regular sniping. Try mixing up your movements without aiming too much. Experiment with jumping and crouching to increase your survival chances. Don't love your scope too much, as it can be extremely time consuming to keep zooming in and out.

Work on your Battle Rifle, or ""BR"" shots.,
Teamwork.,
Know your strengths.,
Know the maps.,
Know your grenades.,
Learn when NOT to take a power weapon.,
Don't let yourself get psyched out.,
Use your teammates!",How to Play Mlg Variants in Halo 3," The MLG starting weapon is a Battle Rifle because it allows you to defend yourself off of any spawn, close or far, in almost any situation. Having a BR is almost the tantamount skill in Halo 3 MLG variants, because the best teammate in the world who can't kill somebody is next to useless. Play FFAs in Customs with your friends with MLG settings on (Motion Tracker is usually added into Free-For-Alls) and work on hitting your shots. There are a ton of BR training related maps out there forged on Foundry. Either find one of those or make one yourself and practice long and close range BR. Using the Carbine as well helps you have a steadier BR, because you have to have the reticle on them constantly, instead of every half second.;
, Teamwork is the next most important skill set in the game. There are specific maps played in the circuit, and each of them has their own defining characteristics. To be able to tell your teammates where a person is on the map requires coming up with names for the different parts of the maps and using them to tell your team locations of weak players, or where the guy with the rocket launcher is headed next. Teamwork also includes knowing your role at any given time. If everybody is pressing towards the flag, hang back, come in from a different angle, support your teammates from the other side of the map. If everybody is crowding the sniper tower on Guardian, go to the top of the tree in jungle area, or head on over to blue room and shoot from the window. Concentrating all of your players in one area isn't going to work very well, know when to spread out and take map control.

, The BR isn't the most steady in the game, but if your sniping isn't bad and you know how to call out, grab a sniper and get to high ground. Use your position to call out and slay with the sniper. If you have trouble with working as a team, try to stay back in on position. Don't go roving with a teammate if you're not going to work with him. Stay set up and use that BR skill to put heavy damage on opposing players for your teammates to finish off. Knowing how you play best is key to surviving.

, Knowing the maps is essential to good play. Knowing where power weapons spawn (Rocket Launcher, Sniper Rifle) and being able to time the spawns is key to good map control. If you can rush the rocket launcher spawn and grab it right as it drops, you won't just have rockets in your possession, but you'll know exactly when the new ones are coming up, and be able to repeat the process. Know good places to set up and team shoot, as well as common routes players take from one area to another. On the map The Pit, the green hallway containing rockets and the open hall further to the side are common pathways from one side of the map to the other, but the green hallway can also be a deathtrap if it's you against two. Know when to use the different routes, and which can be used to flank around and come from the side.

, In Halo 3 grenades are everywhere. One frag grenade will drop you to no shields in a single explosion, and a single subsequent BR head shot can put you down. Know when people are going to throw their grenades, and drop down or get away when they start flying. Learning how to use them is just as essential as knowing how to not get hit by them. Learn common camping positions, and then find a spot in the wall right behind them to bank a grenade off and down. If they don't try to run and put themselves right into your BR reticule, then just throw another to finish off all of the one shots.

, If you suck with the sniper, let the guy who's good take it, and focus on what you can do. If you're not any good with the rocket launcher, there isn't much in the way of learning except to try not to aim for the person themselves, but use walls and the floor for splash damage. Jumping and firing at their feet is a good way to accomplish this.

, If you're beaten before the game even starts, then what's the point of playing? If you're doing badly, don't get mad and start to play worse. Sit back and THINK about what you're doing wrong, think about what the opposing team is doing right. Try to adjust your play style. If going up to snipe 3 keeps getting you killed from top blue, than rotate to somewhere else and try from there.

, You don't have to chase down every kill yourself. Your teammates are there to help. Use team shooting and call-outs to corner opposing players, or just overwhelm them with superior firepower before they can get away to cover. As well, you have to be able to understand when your team can't get to your call out or finish the player you just got to one shot. They could be fighting other opponents or attempting to complete one of the objectives. Learn to accept that.

The rules of the game are as follows:

, By far, the best map is Valhalla; however, The Pit or Sandtrap may also make good choices.

, Alternatively, press X and set everybody to have a Gravity Hammer and a Rocket Launcher.

,
The batter tries to hit the rocket.

If the batter is killed, the other team gains a point.
If the batter hits the rocket, he/she has the right to kill the pitcher, which gains his/her team a point.




If you die 3 times, the next batter is up.
When all batters have gone up to bat, it is the other team's turn to bat.

"
"
If you don't die when you are the batter, you run to a base.

,
There is a person there, guarding the base (you should have a secondary weapon for this).

,
To step onto that base and continue, first, you must kill the person guarding the base.,
Also, here are some miscellaneous rules to follow for the game:


If you destroy the rocket without dying, you get 1 point.",How to Play Baseball in Halo 32,",, Whether other teammates can help or not is up to you.

,
If you make it around all of the bases that's 1 point.
If your team gets 4 batters in a row that don't die, that's 4 points and the ""runners"" leave the bases they are at. (It's like getting a home run with the bases loaded-every runner leaves, and your team gets 4 points.)

,
If you have a sword or shotgun, start shooting someone with another gun like BR or AR and then back up round a corner and swap to your shottie.,
Snipers are useful but mainly as secondary weapons.,
Remember the double melee.,
If you see a crowd of enemies in a fight, lob random grenades.,
Don't charge in.",How to Raise Your Game at Halo 3," This means that the only reason your team will lose is by their own fault. They can't blame you.;
, If you see a person moving up a passage towards where you are, it is fine to slip round a corner and hide so you can get a kill on them. This is 'productive camping'. Camping is wrong when you sit in a place just hoping that someone will come. This wastes time that you could use getting more kills.

, This is especially important on The Pit. About 3 out of 4 people go to the rockets. If you get camo, you can take out at least two of them using grenades before even getting noticed.

, You should always have a BR in your hands anyway. But if you throw a grenade and then BR someone once in the head, they automatically die. So look on the radar and throw a grenade where they are going to be. If they have started shooting you, don't throw the grenade.

, They are the most powerful grenade and they can get sneaky kills in tight situations. If you just killed someone and have no shield, and someone else starts to come towards you, stick them so you get an extra kill before you die.

, You should always swap to another weapon if you are planning on going close range. When you are in aim with someone running towards you, move right and left with the left analogue. Then whenever their head passes the crosshair, have a pop. It means you are a moving target and it means that whatever your control sensitivity, you'll always move left and right at the same pace.

, Just don't. Unless you are on Sandtrap, it isn't even worth having as a second weapon.

,, as they come round, blast them into Master Chief sized nibblets.

, If you have just seen someone a way away, switch to your sniper and take them. DO NOT walk around with one out because you have a low chance against anyone at close range.

, Lots of people at shield doors melee each other once and then try to shoot. It is quicker to just melee a second time.

, This will support your team as well as getting some kills.

, That is why you have a BR - to walk around the side of the big fights and BR people from the side where they aren't looking.

, Know every nook and cranny of every map. You need to be able to get from point A to point B in as little time as possible because detours could result in a high amount of deaths and that spells trouble for you and your team. You will also need to know where the different weapons are located on the map so that you can use them more effectively.

, Obviously a shotgun is not going to be very effective from across the map. you should always carry at least one medium or long range weapon in your arsenal.

, If the other team is ranked higher than you, than maybe you might think about playing less aggressive and more conservative.

, If your shields are down, than find a good spot to stay in so that you can regenerate. This will help bring down the death margin.

, Vehicles are a good way to rack up some easy kills by splattering the enemy.

, Halo 3 is played at its best when friends come together and play with (or against) each other. Friends make excellent teammates and usually you play your best with them.

, If you know you are about to die, toss a grenade out there and you might a get a lucky kill but be careful not to kill your teammates!

, You need to make the 'Run-time Minimum' the same number as the 'Placed On Map' number directly above it. For example, if the number for 'Placed On Map' is 1, then you need to change the 'Run-time Minimum' to 1 also; this will make the trip mine respawn instantly after one has been used.

Once all your controller's holes are covered or filled properly, lay down your cardboard and place the toothpicks in the cardboard about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from each other and place the Start, Back, 2 Bumpers, Triggers, Center Top Piece, and Center Bottom Piece on the tooth picks.,

, If not done right, your buttons will not fit back into place properly, and may stick. Start with one of the Analog stick holes. Go from the inside and tape up the hole. This will make it so you do not get any paint on the inside, and only the visible parts. Make sure it is perfectly even all the way around, or else the paint will be crooked. Do this for the other Analog Stick hole, and the D-pad hole if you wish, but they are by no means required.

, This requires VERY narrow pieces of tape. Take a sliver, about an inch long, and put it on one of the walls, so that it completely goes all the way up and down. Go all the way around until all the walls are covered. Now, take the outside pieces that are sticking up, and make a cone so they won't get in your way. Do this for the rest of the buttons. (NOTE: Wrapping the tape inside-out on a standard nail can help greatly with this step)

, Take a piece of tape, and rip it so that it is a little bit bigger than the trigger hole, and put the tape on it from the inside of the controller.

, Most of the Buttons will sit fairly well on the toothpicks, some will require 2 toothpicks to make stand correctly.

, Follow basic spray painting instructions in order to get a smooth coat and even paint color. Putting a 2nd coat on the controller is recommended, but I'd suggest waiting for 24 hours after the 1st coat has dried.

, To remove it you must remove two small screws located inside the D-Pad. These screws are slightly smaller than those on the controller shell and may require a smaller screwdriver. On a Xbox 360 wired controller, the D-pad will come right off, no extra screwdrivers required.

, Gently pry the clips to separate the two parts of the D-Pad. The D-Pad can now be easily removed.

Remove the upper grill.",How to Open an Xbox 3601," Place the Xbox upside down. Put your finger in the flip-opened hole, and pull. You’ll probably have to give it a good tug.;
, Six tabs, hidden behind the white side venting holes, hold the gray lower grill on the case. Use your case opening tool or a small screwdriver to pop these tabs, one at a time, and remove the lower grill carefully. You will want to start at the front end, where you removed the faceplate, as there is a good place to grab the grill to lift it away.

, Pull off the hard drive, if you haven’t already. You will see that this side is not flat, but rather contains a small step where the hard drive fits in. You will have to pop the two tabs which are placed along the ledge before proceeding to the others. Now, pop the two tabs which are visible on the white sides, as in the previous step. You will find the final tab hidden under one of the rubber feet. There is a seal on this tab, which will tell Microsoft if you have broken your warranty.

Ease open the shell.,
Unscrew the inner casing.",How to Open an Xbox 3602," These tabs are located next to where the power plug connects and will likely need to be opened at the same time. They can be popped one at a time, however, this is more challenging. At this point, you will want to use the second small screwdriver. Use both of these or the case opening tool to open the tabs. This will allow you to pry the shell open.

, At the other end of the same side, you will find five more poppable tabs. You can open them one at a time by keeping constant pressure while prying open the shell or simply use the case tool, which will open them all at once.

, Turn the Xbox 360 around to view the front end. Now, locate the clip at the end nearest to the DVD drive. Open this with your fingernail (it should be pretty easy) or a flathead screwdriver and a bit of prying. Open each of the four tabs, one at a time.

, You should be able to see the inner casing now that the shell is removed. This inner casing can be opened by unscrewing the cover panel. Turn the Xbox onto the other side and lift up the remaining shell to reveal the interior components. Don’t forget to be careful while doing this.

Finding the Perfect Name.,

Asking Trusted Friends if they want to run the Clan with you.,
Setting up a Website.,
Make profiles on Social Media Sites.,
Advertise your Clan to Gamer's.,
Advertising your clan is simple.",How to Make an Xbox 360 Clan," Branding your clan is the most important step in creating a new clan. You want something unique, that makes sense. Find something that you want to represent long term. Your making a clan that your going to spend countless hours building. Many clans that are large today, have been going for many years. So finding a name that people can relate to and want to represent is your ticket to success.;
, Ask yourself, are you making a clan for fun or competitive? It really matters, because a fun clan can be taken in many different ways. While a competitive clan is limited to small sizes and try outs. A competitive clan requires good players to keep it strong and at the top of the rankings.

, So assuming that your clan is for fun after the previous advice. You want an enjoyable ranking system that your members can rank up through different levels of leadership. Say for example, a military styled rank structure is what many clans today use in forming a chain of command. Recruits are normally the entry level rank for a new member joining your clan. Between Recruit and Leader should be a variety of different ranks with different roles within your clan to allow for a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. If it's a stressful structure with too much clan building roles, then chances are they won't like it and will leave eventually. Don't forget that this is a clan based on a video game, not the actual military.

, All clans should have a few rules that keep your members in check. This should be to prevent abuse and drama from overtaking your clan. Many clans have witnessed situations where thing got out of hand, but could have been prevented if rules were put in place to prevent it from happening. This is something that different ranking members can patrol and make sure that other members abide by.

, This should be one of the easiest steps in creating a clan. You already play a game or a variety of games. You need to decide whether your clan will be based on a single game, or multiple games. Make that clear in your structure so that the structure stays organized.

, Some people don't like leading a clan by themselves, so ask your closest friends on Xbox LIVE if they'd be interested in leading a new clan with you. If not, then try to do it yourself before bringing in someone else. You do not want a random person joining and being in charge of your clan. It will only cause a headache and they will try to overrun you as leader. I have seen this many times and sometimes it goes as far as the original leader being kicked out of the clan. Lots of drama comes with random leaders who you don't know. Build your clan up, and promote people based on the actions they take while moving through your ranking system.

, Making a website for your clan is about the hardest thing about making a clan. You don't need a website, but it definitely helps your clan stay organized and in contact. You have so many options on what kind of website you'd like to make. Many go with a forum styled website, you can use vbulletin, IP Board, MyBB, phpBB, and a variety of other forum software.

, Social Media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are not required, but they help you make your clan stand out. You can create a Facebook Page for your clan and you can create a profile for your clan on Twitter. The bigger your audience is on other social media sites, the more people see and learn about your clan. Its also helps get news and information about events to your members who use the sites often. Some clan pages, such as Revolution of Gaming's, have grown to hundreds of members.

, This is your last, but not final step. After getting here, you not only have to advertise your clan to other gamer's so your clan grows, but you have to continue to update and build your clan in the other areas that have been stated here in this article.

, You can do many things to find new members. You can play the games your clan plays and ask people to join, which is the best option. And you can use sites like www.xbox360clans.net to find new recruits. You just have to pitch your clan to others and ask them to join.

Figure out if you have lag.,
As soon as the game starts, throw a grenade, AWAY from your teammates mind you, and study the explosion.,
Check your timer, this is the most efficient way of safely finding out if you have lag, most games have a timer that begins counting down at 15 seconds, check this timer constantly if you suspect lag, if the timer skips from say 11:40 seconds right down to 11:37 seconds, then you only have minor 2-3 second lag.,
Now that you know how lagged out you are, try making the best of it, remember, lag goes both ways, sometimes.",How to Make the Most out of Lag," It's pretty obvious when you get lag, are your shots not registering on an enemy player (no matter how much you shoot at him, he just won't die), do die for appertain no reason or do your grenades simply disappear when you swore you threw them, these are good indicators that you have severe lag.


But first: how to find out if you have lag without directly engaging the enemy-;
, If it explodes about a second after hitting the ground (keep in mind that plasma grenades have a 3 sec fuse) then your connection should be fine.

,


If the timer, however, simply freezes, this means you have severe lag, i suggest you find a good hiding now.

,


For all you know, your enemies just see you as this freaky guy teleporting from place to place, you can use this to your advantage sometimes.
If enemy units just seem to be standing there, doing nothing at all, then chances are they have blackscreened (this is when a player dies and does not respawn for some time, this doesn't mean you can't kill them though, feel free to step and and score some easy kills.
If you are the one lagging, you can still help your team. Don't rush the enemy head on but fall back and provide support.

Go to forge and start a session on Sandtrap.,
Go to the front of the elephant and stack all of the plasma batteries in the front, basically right next to the fusion coils.,
Go to the back of the elephant again and shoot at only one of the fusion coils, then stand back and watch the most amazing form of the flying elephant.,
Another way is to put as much junk as you can pile on and try to drive it.,
One of the more simple ways to fly the elephant is to simply take a scorpion, warthog, or anything else with a good size and hold on to it as you make it get stuck in a corner or where the driver is and fly away, and the elephant should follow you wherever you go.

",How to Make an Elephant Fly in Halo 3," The first thing you want to do is delete all the fusion coils and plasma batteries that are on the map. Then, drive one of the elephants out to a flat open area. Next, stack every single fusion coil in the middle of the bottom floor, but spread them all over the middle or else it won't work, and don't forget to set the respawn time to 10 seconds and the maximum/minimum time to the highest number.;
, Set the times for respawn just like the fusion coils.

, It will do flips and rise up really high, then fall down and rise up again, and it usually makes its way around the map, unless you do it a certain way.

, What typically happens is called ""LAG"" which is when you have to much stuff together and causes the elephant to ""LAG"" into the ground. After awhile the game will get angry or whatever and make your elephant barrel roll, but in the more severe cases, the lag can send your elephant across the entire map. This is considered to be a relative to the ""Bump"", which is the annoying ""bump"" that items do when you try to form objects with turret cases and stuff like that, and it usually screws everything up and makes it all fall down.

Decide if you want to take part in a double experience weekend.,
Play to your strengths.,
Work your game play around the weekend playlist.,
Gather a good team while playing in a double experience weekend.,
Play smart.,
Have fun!,
Stop playing if you have to - whether you were trying to work on your kill/death spread, your experience or just have fun, if you are not meeting that goal, stop playing in the weekend playlist, or at least take a break.,
Get all the maps required!",How to Make the Most out of Double Experience Weekends on Halo 3," As the playlist title suggests, instead of one experience point, you gain two, allowing inexperienced players to gain points quickly. However, if you have plenty of experience points, but a low rank, then a double experience weekend is hardly worth playing to you since they are largely unranked. Take into consideration what you need to level up before selecting to play a double experience weekend - if you need experience then it may just be for you.;
, Although you may be keen to play a double experience weekend, if you are unskilled in some scenarios, such as free-for-alls or Grifball, then it may be wise to wait until the next weekend to enter a new scenario. If you are excellent at using all types of weapons, then a 'fiesta slayer' playlist may suit you, since it spawns you with random weapons. However, this can also be a curse if you re-spawn with a plasma pistol every time. If you are more tactically-minded, then a 'team flag' weekend may be to your liking. Every weekend the scenario changes, so only choose the weekends which will best suit your strengths.

, It's there for a reason, so make use of it! If you need the experience and it's a scenario you are fairly good at, then try to cram as much playtime in that playlist as you possibly can. If you are successful, it's not uncommon to earn up to 100 experience points in a single weekend.

, If the weekend's scenario is team-based, then you'll want your most skilled friends to play with you. If the scenario is a free-for-all based scenario, then you may want to consider gathering a group of friends which you know you can easily beat. If you get the right people to play with you, it is likely you will be able to maximize the amount of experience you get for the weekend.

, Although with the allure or random weapons and fun scenarios, the double experience weekend is still as competitive as other Halo 3 playlists, so if you entered the playlist to get experience points or better your kill/death spread, then play to meet that goal, using the combat scenarios to your advantage.

, Above all, the double experience weekends were created to introduce players to a fun atmosphere. Although they can be useful in gathering experience points, try to have fun and be a fun person to play with. Winning and being fun aren't mutually exclusive.

, Quite often the playlist is random and uses less than usual scenarios, so don't be surprised if you have to give up the first time around.

, Most Double EXP weekends require that you have downloaded some, or all of the extra Halo 3 map packs. Although some are free, such as the Cold Storage and Heroic map packs, others such as the Legendary and Mythic map packs cost Microsoft points. Whichever maps you need, if you want to take part in double experience weekends, then you may have to purchase them.

",How to Make a Good Team in Halo (2)," You should get one of each for your team. Snipers, well obviously snipe people. The Heavy use big weapons such as rocket launchers or dual needlers. Heavies also run right in the middle of the battlefield and blast the crap out of enemies while being covered (being protected) by Snipers or Vehicle Fighters. Scouts/Spies' use light and effective weapons such as the noob combo (dual plasma pistols) or plasma rifles and usually cover people or check for enemies. The Vehicle Fighter drives the team around in Warthogs or fires at enemies in Ghosts, it's important that the Vehicle Fighter knows how to actually drive the vehicle and not spin in circles trying to turn.;
, Have a few people hide and the rest go run around the map, once someone goes by the ambush squad, open fire!! This technique is important too.

First off is aiming.,
Next is an essential.,
before shooting or sniping before shooting.,
Third you need to learn how to dodge.,
Fourth is no-scoping.,Well I was going to add something but forgot what it was so that's my guide

",How to Kill With a Battle Rifle in Halo 3 Multiplayer," Don't aim for the head when using a BR. The spread pattern makes it bad to aim there. Instead aim for the neck all the shots will the hit the head.;
, DO NOT NOOB COMBO!!! If you know don't know what noob-comboing is its when you shoot a fully charged Plasma Pistol shot at someone and the head shot with a BR. This will make people hate you and it makes your gamer rating VERY low because everyone avoids you. Instead of noob-comboing try throwing grenades

, This is a perfectly acceptable way to kill.

, Dodging simplified down to basics involves strafing,jumping, and reversing direction. Strafing is when you move left or right now add jumping to this. Your best bet is to add jumps randomly I'll try to demonstrate with a pattern S is strafe J is jump. S_J_S_S_S_S_J_S_J_S_S_J: This provides a good slap in your opponents face trying to change the aiming of their BR. Now reversing direction is always a good way to help too it makes your opponent have to turn around to get to you. So again a pattern except now we add R for direction change. S_S_J_S_S_S_S_J_R_S_J_R_S_S_S_S_J. So now your opponent has to turn around 3 times to get to you

, No scoping on a BR is much different from NS sniping. No scoping on a BR involves aiming at you opponents body NOT their head unless your VERY close.

, It will be number 4 of the 7 categories. You will need to purchase a few lighting effects in order to make your map darker.

, You have reached the lighting effects. There are six lighting effects in total: Fx, Nova, Fx, Pen and Ink, Fx, Olde Timey, Fx, Colorblind, Fx, Gloomy, Fx, Juicy. Each has their own effect on the lighting, but combined, some can make your map much darker.

, Although you might assume Gloomy will give you the best effect, and it indeed does darken your map, adding Olde Timey and Juicy to it will make your map substantially darker. Note however that Fx, Juicy has a side effect which makes orange colour stand out - you might want this for a radiation-like effect, or you can remove it all together, although the sepia tone of the Fx, Olde Timey will really stand out if you do.

, Although you might want some pieces of light in your map such as energy doors or fusion coils, removing them completely will make your map even darker.

Get familiar with the Forge system, which is the program in Halo 3 which allows the user to edit and create maps.,
Decide what kind of map you wish to build and what type of custom games you plan to play on it.,
Select a map you wish to edit or build upon.,
Start working on your map with your original plan in mind.,
Decide whether you want to spend the time rotating every object perfectly or if you just want to chuck your objects in any order in what ever way.,
Begin with the basic stuff, such as crates and ramps to get the overall feel of your map before you place the finer details in.,
Start adding more detail to your map.,
Change into player form (as opposed to oracle form)aka: monitor mode and walk around and play-test your map as much as possible during these stages.,
Add weapons and grenades and objects such as barrels and boxes.,
Set up spawn points.,
Complete the finishing touches.,
Invite a few friends over to test the map.",How to Make a Good Map on Halo 3," It is fairly daunting at first, but once you learn to master a few techniques, making maps will get easier. You can access the Forge from the main menu screen between Custom Games and Theater.;
, Do you want a vehicle-heavy map or one where players have to navigate an obstacle course? What you want your map to look and feel like can guide you to select a good starting map. Large maps, such as Sand Trap, Valhalla and Avalanche, are a perfect starting point for vehicle based games and sniper matches. Close-combat maps such as Black Out, Guardian and Epitaph are more suitable templates for maps intended for close-range games. Basically, think about what you want to do with your map and then you'll be able to select the right one.

, There are several default maps on Halo 3, such as Sand Trap, Isolation or The Pit, but most map makers prefer Foundry and Sandbox because they were intended to be used primarily as a Forge map. Some maps, such as Foundry and Sandbox, are only available through downloaded content, however the Heroic map pack in which Foundry is located, is free to download. Currently, the Legendary and Mythic map packs must still be purchased. or you can buy odst and get all the maps

, You could start by deleting all the existing objects on the map so you have a blank template to work with, although there are blank maps that are available to download which already have this done for you.

, Spending the time to make sure the objects on your map are symmetrical and straight or adjoin properly can give a professional feeling to your map, but some of the funniest and crazy maps are the ones with a huge pile of weapons and vehicles in the middle of a room. Experiment with both to decide, or make two separate maps if you can't choose.

, Don't get too complicated to begin with - you just want to start off with the bare bones of the map so you can correct mistakes easier. Setting up zones is a good idea too - places where the vehicles and players spawn, key areas and pathways - these can all be planned out now. Make sure there is enough room to drive if there are vehicles and that it functions well.

, This may be in the form of second stories or vehicles, shield doors or man cannons, objects like these which aren't too detailed are good to start adding now. If your map has several bases or areas, it may be a good idea to just concentrate on one or two at a time before moving on to the next ones.

, This will help you to see if there are any major faults, such as levels too high to reach, or impossible obstacles. Try many different scenarios when you are testing your map - drive around, jump and see if there are lines of sight. Testing will be invaluable - there's nothing worse that inviting all your friends to a new map you've made and none of them can leave the spawn point because you forgot to add a teleporter!

, Make sure that they are evenly spaced out and that the powerful weapons, such as rockets, shotgun and the energy sword, are evenly spaced out throughout the map. These weapons also benefit from having risk in order to get them - for example having the shotgun in an exposed place, or the rockets next to some fusion coils. This makes it fair and exciting for people to play and adds an element of tactics to the game. Stock weapons such as battle rifles and assault rifles should be made easier to get, and grenades (if you choose to have them) should also be fairly abundant.

, Take care to place them in secluded places to avoid ""spawn killing""(although it is fun), where players get killed immediately after re-entering the map. If there are spawn points for different teams, make sure this is set up by entering the spawn point's set up by pressing X before placing it and selecting ""Attackers"", ""Defenders"" or another team number. This will ensure that only members of that team spawn from that point.

, Make sure there are no major faults and set up weapon re-spawn times. Make sure it works well for the game type you intend to use it for and make sure it all flows well. Don't think you have to spend all your budget on objects - quite often a map can be too over-loaded with weapons and objects, so less is indeed more in some cases.

, Have a few play tests on it and be prepared to make changes! Some areas may be way to powerful (a room with only one entrance and infinite rockets is only fun for the person in it killing everyone else!) while others may be not used at all, so you may want to put something in there to entice other's into it. Remember, map creation is an ongoing process - don't be surprised if you come back to an earlier map months later and change everything with all the experience you've gathered since.

This is because the flashing software has been designed to work with the most recent updates, and you may run into some errors if you don't have your Xbox 360 current.

See this guide for more details on updating your Xbox 360.;
, In order to flash the DVD drive, you will need to pull it out of the Xbox 360. To do this, you will need to remove the outer panel of the Xbox.

See this guide for detailed instructions on opening your Xbox 360 case.

, Gently pull the DVD drive straight out of the Xbox. Make sure that you do not tug the cables that connect the drive to the Xbox’s circuitry., After pulling the drive out, disconnect the two cables that attach the drive to the Xbox. You should now be able to remove the drive completely from the console., There are four different possible DVD drive manufacturers that your Xbox 360 could be using. Some drives will require more tools than others. You can identify the drive by examining the sticker on it. You only need to know the manufacturer in order to determine what tools and process you will be using.

The four manufacturers are Lite-On, Samsung, BenQ, and Hitachi.

, In order to flash your drive, you will need to download the software designed for the process. There is a program called JungleFlasher which is designed specifically to flash Xbox 360 drives. You can download JungleFlasher for free from the developer's website.

You will also need the firmware files for your drive. Download the iXtreme LT+ 3.0 firmware files from the iXtreme website. JungleFlasher does not come packaged with these files for legal reasons. These firmware files change the way the Xbox 360 DVD drive functions, allowing you to install custom software.
If you are flashing a Hitachi drive, you will need to download the extra iXtreme LT+ 3.0 Hitachi files as well.

, After downloading JungleFlasher, extract the folder to an easy to access location on your computer. You do not need to install JungleFlasher in order to use it. Placing the JungleFlasher folder on your desktop or on the root of your hard drive will make it easy to access during the flashing process., Once you've extracted JungleFlasher, extract the archive containing the iXtreme LT+ 3.0 firmware files. Open the extracted folder, and then open the Firmware folder. Copy all of the files into the Firmware folder in the JungleFlasher directory., Open the JungleFlasher directory, and then open the libusb folder. Copy the libusb0.dll file from this folder and place it into the JungleFlasher root directory, the same location that the JungleFlasher.exe program is located.

Open the PortIO folder and copy both of the files to the JungleFlasher root directory as well.

, You will need several tools in order to connect your DVD drive to your computer so that it can be flashed:

USB Connector tool (Xecuter X360USB, X360USBPro)
DVD Power-to-Molex adapter (Xecuter CK3 Lite). This isn't required if you are using the Xecuter X360USB tool, as it is already built in. If you are using the X360USBPro tool, you will need this adapter.
Probe (TX CK3 PROBE 3, TX SPUTNIK360 UNLOCK PROBE, MAXIMUS 360 SCORPION TOOL V2). This is only required for the Lite-On drive. No other DVD drive requires this tool.
Molex-to-outlet power connector (Molex to USB works as well)

, If you are flashing a Lite-On DVD drive, you will need to remove the protective panel on the DVD drive in order to access the circuitry. Flip the drive over and remove the four screws holding the panel in place. Remove the panel to expose the circuitry.

You only need to do this for Lite-On drives. If you are using any other drive, you can skip this step.

, If you are using the Xecuter X360USB tool, connect the Molex cable to the Molex adapter on the USB tool, and then connect the other end to the Molex-to-outlet adapter. Connect the USB tool to the DVD drive using the standard power cable (unless you are flashing a Lite-On, in which case refer to the next step). If you are using the X360USBPro, connect the CK3 Lite to the DVD drive using the power cable, and then connect the CK3 Lite to the outlet using the Molex-to-outlet adapter., Connect the probe cable to both the USB connector and the drive. Plug the end of the cable with the push button to the power connector on the DVD drive. Plug the other end of the cable into the USB connector.

Attach the probe piece to the small wire coming out of the probe cable. The probe should light up.

, This will allow data to be passed from your computer to the DVD drive., Plug the connector into an open USB port on your computer. Avoid using a USB hub, as it will not provide enough power. You can use an extension cable if you can't reach a port. More lights should appear on the USB connector when plugged into the computer., Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process., Click the DVDKey 32 tab. This will display all the information on your drive's DVD key, which is essential for flashing. In the ""Drive Properties"" section, the ""DVD Key"" entry should say ""Unverified""., Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the ""Sammy UnLock"" button.

This will keep your Xbox 360 from getting banned immediately from Xbox Live. The ""DVD Key"" entry in the ""Drive Properties"" section should read ""Verified""., Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process., Click the Hitachi GDR3120 tab. If your Drive Revision section has the ""78/79"" option selected, you will need to burn an extra CD to unlock the drive. Click the ""Insert the 79 Unlock Audio CD"" link, which will open your browser and attempt to download a file. Save the file and then extract it.

Burn the BIN file to a blank CD-R using your favorite image burning program. See this guide for more details.

, In the Hitachi GDR3120 tab, click the Send Mode-B button. A window will appear with instructions, but these can be ignored since you're using the USB connector tool., After you are in Mode-B, click the Open button to open the drive tray. Insert the disc and then click the Close button. Click the 79 Unlock button to read the disc. The drive will eject the disc automatically when finished.

This step is only required if you have a version 79 drive.

Click Yes when the program says that the flashing report is stable., You can see the progress in the text box at the bottom of the window. Once the flashing process is complete, return to the Hitachi GDR3120 tab. Turn the DVD drive on and off (you can simply pull the power cable from the DVD drive to reset it).
, Once the drive is connected to the USB tool and your computer, you can start JungleFlasher to begin the flashing process., Click the MTK Flash 32 tab and then click the ""BenQ UnLock"" button. The DVD drive will be unlocked automatically., You will see text in the box at the bottom of the window. Once the drive has been unlocked, look for the ""Drive Properties"" section of the MTK Flash 32 tab. The ""Vendor"" field should read ""Drive in Vendor Mode""., Click the Read button. JungleFlasher will begin reading the BenQ firmware files. After it's finished, you will be prompted to save the original firmware as a backup. Choose a location that you can easily find if you want to restore your original firmware files., After the firmware backup has been saved, you will be prompted to load the BenQ LT+ firmware files. Click Yes to proceed., Click the Save Drive Key button and save the drive key somewhere safe.

The MPX01 point is located on the circuitry of the DVD drive, and is where you will need to probe during the flashing process. You can find the MPX01 point next to the large chip installed on the circuitry., Open the DVDKey 32 tab in JungleFlasher. Click the PhatKey button and wait a few moments for the program to load. The ""MTK Vendor Intro failed"" window will appear. You are now ready to probe the drive.

Ensure that the light on the probe is on, indicating it is receiving power.

Get a good vantage point on the grunts you wish to kill.,
Shoot the grunt.,
Dodge their attacks - expect a fair amount of fire back since grunts are usually in a large group.,
Eliminate them all.,
Melee the grunts.,
Have fun.,
Shoot grenades at them.",How to Kill a Grunt on Halo 3," If they are unaware of your presence, then let it stay that way until you are ready to attack. Somewhere higher than the grunt is best, both for protection from their plasma grenades and for a better point to head-shot them. If the grunt is on a plasma cannon, find a spot where you can easily shoot them from.;
, Unlike other enemies, most weapons will easily kill a grunt, although a battle rifle or carbine to the head or an assault rifle burst to their body will be quite effective. Don't even bother with grenades unless you are trying to stick one so that it runs back into its own allies and explodes or if it is a ghost, in which case, sticking it may be the best option. Grenades should be used if there is a large group of grunts too.

, Their plasma grenades can be deadly (especially when they go into kamikaze mode) and their weapons can be quite effective when used in numbers. Stay behind cover and keep your distance.

, Grunts are easy to kill and if you kill their lead brute, they panic and become even more easy to kill! But, beware of the grenades on higher difficulties.

, This can be fun, especially as they will most likely run away as you approach. Be aware of other non-fleeing enemies in the area, but generally, one or two melee hits to grunt will kill him. This is particularly helpful if the grunt is asleep, as you will not alert the others to your presence.

, If nothing else makes Halo 3 fun, it's the senseless slaughter of grunts. Have fun and don't get too caught up in winning because nothing can be more fun than messing with the Covenant's smallest soldiers.

, In large groups, it's fun to watch them get killed in large numbers.

Sneak up on the Hunter you wish to kill.,
Learn their vulnerable points.,
Dodge their attacks and keep your distance.,
Be aware of the other Hunter's movements at all times if there are two - quite often you will be shooting at one while the other loops around to get you from behind.

,
Decide how you want to kill them, whether it is from preference or due to the weapons you have.,
Stick them.,
Melee them.,
Run them over!,
Use a combination of shooting, grenades and melee (or even splattering) to finish the hunter off.",How to Kill a Hunter on Halo 3," If the Hunter is unaware of you, they are much easier to kill. This may be hard if you have allies with you, but if you have weapons such as fuel rods or sniper rifles, sneaking up is essential.;
, Hunters are generally quite impenetrable on their front side, but if you can attack them from the rear or sides, they are much more prone to damage. Their head, neck, back, and any other areas not covered by armour, are great spots to aim at.

, Their assault cannons can be very powerful and even kill in one hit on harder difficulties, so keep behind cover. Their assault cannons lose their power once you damage the Hunter enough, so take your time. Keeping your distance also means the Hunters can't get you with their powerful melee attacks.

,, If you have a sniper or beam rifle, a quick few shots to the back of the head is quite effective, as too are brute shots. Spartan lasers and rockets are usually an instant kill, while fuel rod guns and plasma cannons or machine gun turrets are good if you are aiming at their back. Any of these weapon combinations are a good choice, and if their armour begins to fall off, they're even easier to kill.

, The Hunters in Halo 3 are much more susceptible to grenades than in the previous two installments of the game franchise. In fact, one well-placed spike grenade can kill a Hunter instantly if it's stuck to the Hunter's head with the spikes going into its body.

, The Hunters have always, and even more so in Halo 3, been vulnerable to melee attacks and a few hits to the Hunter's back will remove its armour and leave it exposed. However, this tactic will involve you getting in close to the Hunter, risking their powerful melee attacks.

, If you are traveling fast enough or using the vehicle's boost feature (if it has one), one hit from a ghost, prowler or warthog will be enough to kill them out-right. Of course, if the vehicle has a gunner on the vehicle you are driving is a tank or wraith, their guns will be sufficient to kill a hunter provided it doesn't shoot you down with its assault cannon first.

, A few sniper shots followed by a spike grenade and a round of melee will most likely kill any Hunter, so keep your options open. Just shoot him in the back with a sniper and he'll die. Shotguns are also effective when shooting a hunter. Note that shooting a Hunter in it's back is easier than shooting its head, but it does less damage.

"

Take cover!,
Choose a suitable weapon.,
Pick up a few plasma or spike grenades.,
Fire from cover using a suitable weapon.,
Retreat if you have to.",How to Kill a Drone on Halo 3," Drones appear from nowhere with only a moments notice and can be devastating if you are not in cover. Their plasma pistols can deplete your shields very quickly, so if you are out of cover when they attack, find some fast. Their ability to fly and land on walls means they can shoot you almost anywhere, so take care when finding cover.;
, Close-range weapons such as the shotgun and energy sword are no use against drones. Instead, try to select explosive weapons (such as the rocket launcher or brute shot), automatic weapons (such as the SMG or dual plasma rifles) or medium-range weapons such as the battle rifle or carbine. If these aren't available then try to find a less powerful weapon which may work.

, Normal grenades won't work as effectively as weapons, but if you have run out of ammunition, then they can be invaluable.

, If you have an explosive weapons such as a rocket launcher, then wait until the drones are clustered together to take them out with one shot. However, if no explosive weapons are available then your best chance is to either try to stick one with a plasma or spike grenade and hope it kills a large chunk of them or shoot them with a SMG. Pick off any survivors using a battle rifle or carbine.

, Drones are exceptionally good at depleting your shields quickly so take as much time as you need in a secure location to restore your health.

Keep your distance from the brute you want to kill.,
Remove all surrounding enemies as brutes are far easier to kill if they don't have their grunt or jackal mates around them throwing grenades and trying to snipe you.,
Attempt sticking them with a plasma or spike grenade, or even an incendiary grenade if you can.,
Aim for the head if grenades don't work.,
Melee them in the back if you have no other option.,
Retreat and regroup if you are finding it too hard.",How to Kill a Brute on Halo 3," They are extremely powerful at close to medium ranges and quite often throw grenades and flares to kill you. The higher-level brutes may also carry gravity hammers or plasma cannons and their spikers are good at close range attacks, so keep your distance at all costs. Their berserk power also makes them formidable at close range.;
, A battle rifle or a few grenades should do the trick, but try not to enter into a group of them with a brute as you will likely get swarmed. It goes without saying that you should never charge into a full group of brutes either!

, This will, at least, remove this armour. Unless they are in a tight group however, you may find it hard to stick one on its own.

, The head is the easiest way to kill a brute, either with a sniper or beam rifle or with a carbine or battle rifle. It may take a few shots to first remove their armour, but it is far quicker via the head than the body.

, This will be most effective if the brute is alone and not aware of you, as it will remove their armour and open them up for a second attack.

, Most brutes won't follow you too far (unless it's a high-level brute, often with gravity hammer) so take the time to restock on ammunition and wait for any equipment they've deployed to dissipate (such as bubble shields or regenerators). Make sure you retreat well away from their grenade throwing range as this is their most deadly aspect.

Know how a Ghost works: The driver of a Ghost sits in the back.,
When trying to kill a Ghost, aim at the driver.,
Board it.,
Immediate shield.,
Kill it by making it come to you.,
Now if there is a swarm of them, throw a grenade at the middle and get to a hiding spot.,
Blow it up.",How to Kill a Ghost in Halo 3," There is no protective covering for the driver on the back, not counting the hood and small rear piece. A Ghost has two guns which shoot pretty fast and do moderate damage. It also has a 'Boost' feature, which allows you to go fast for long periods of time.


Note: You cannot shoot while boosting, but you can boost as long as you want; there is no recharge or limit of how long your periods of boosting can be.;
, Usually, the driver of a Ghost will be a Grunt, so it won't be that hard to kill it. A Ghost's driver is exposed at the back of it, behind the hood. This is very hard to do with a sniper or battle rifle.

, You have to get close to the Ghost to do that, but if you are close enough hit the RB and you will jump on it, kick/punching the driver out, and hopping in. Usually players hide somewhere until it gets close or until it sees the player. Then players jump out.

, The second a Ghost sees you, it will shoot at you and/or some closer. If you notice a Grunt noticing you, immediately throw a Deployable Cover/ Bubble Shield. It will defend you while also defending allies. Another good thing is that if the Ghost really wants to get you, he will drive throw the Bubble Shield or around the Deployable Cover, and get next to you to shoot. This is good because you can then easily board it.

, Get behind a wall or something, then jump out, fire a few shots at the driver, then get behind the wall again. If this killed the driver, good for you. If it didn't, the Ghost will see you and come to your wall. You can then board it.

, It should blow up the one you threw it at, plus a few others. A Frag would kill the one you threw it at, the Plasma would do that and possibly the one next to it, a Spiker should take out at least three.

, Besides killing the driver. If you shoot at the Ghost itself enough, (with a machine gun or other powerful weapon) it should explode, damaging anything next to it as well. This is also the result of throwing a grenade at it.

Choose your weapons carefully.,
Gather grenades, especially if facing a group of jackals on the ground.,
Remove all grunts in the area first - it is easier to aim for the jackal's weak spots without plasma grenades and needler shots flying all around you.

,
Dodge their attacks.,
Attack using your weapons with precision.,
Use a vehicle as an alternative to weapons.,
Melee them once or twice if all else fails to take them out.",How to Kill a Jackal on Halo 3," Because of their defensive capabilities, it is important to choose your weapons well before engaging a jackal, or group jackals as there usually is. Explosive weapons or long-range weapons are key to taking down jackals with energy shield, while long to medium-range weapons will be effective against marksmen/sniper jackals. Weapons such as the needler will be fairly useless against the jackal's energy shields, so remember to plan ahead.;
, Frag grenades work best, as they can bounce under their shields, while plasma grenades can occasionally bounce off them and not make impact at all.

,, Sniper jackals are fairly good with the beam rifle, so use the cover carefully. Although less effective, the plasma pistol attacks from the shield jackals can still be brutal if they charge up enough.

, If facing jackals with shields, try throwing a few grenades in their direction or some rocket or brute shots. If that doesn't work, use a long to medium-range weapon to shoot through the gap on the side of the jackal's shield (where their weapon rests) to stun them temporarily, giving you the chance for a headshot. Sniper or marksman jackals are fairly harder to kill, especially on harder levels, so locate them and remove them carefully with a few well-placed sniper or battle rifle shots.

, Marine gunners are perfect for disabling jackals, especially the shield jackals, but splattering them with a vehicle is also quite effective. They can be tricky to run over at first due to their dodging abilities, but back them into a corner and anticipate their movements and they will be easy to eliminate.

, This does involve getting in close, so it may be useful to eliminate all other high-level enemies around you first.

Play in a Halo 3 multiplayer match, either in Matchmaking, Custom Games or Forge.,
Wait for a match with a Ghost on it, or create one yourself in Custom Games or Forge.,
Splatter five enemies, earning a Splatter Spree medal.,
Shoot the next enemy you kill instead of splattering them.,
Continue to splatter opponents until you receive a Vehicular Manslaughter medal.,
Shoot the next enemy you kill instead of splattering them.,
Repeat as much as desired.,
Check your game statistics in-game after the match or over the internet on the Bungie.net website.",How to Glitch Extra Splatter Spree Medals in Halo 3," In order to earn extra splatter spree and vehicular manslaughter medals, you will need to exploit a glitch in multiplayer mode. Of course, if you are doing this glitch in Custom Games or Forge, you need to make sure there is someone else playing for you to splatter.;
, This glitch primarily works with the ghost, but can also be performed on a number of other vehicles, such as choppers and Banshees. Due to the fact that Ghosts and the like are only found on larger maps, if you are performing this glitch via matchmaking, then consider entering the Big Team Slayer playlists to increase the chance of a vehicle map.

, You will need to run over and kill five opponents without killing anyone else in any way to do this. Due to their maneuverability and boost, ghosts are excellent vehicles to splatter others in, but although cumbersome, brute choppers can also complete the job.

, Via a glitch in the medal system, this will reward you with a second splatter spree medal, even if you have only splattered five people in a row. For example, if you have just received a splatter spree medal while in a Ghost, kill your next victim with your plasma guns to receive a second medal in addition to the first, or shoot several enemies to receive that amount in medals.

, You will need to splatter ten enemies in a row without killing anyone else in any way to do this. If you shot someone to glitch a second splatter spree medal after your first, this will not ""reset"" the count, so you should still be able to acquire the vehicular manslaughter medal without beginning again.

, Like the splatter spree, you will receive another vehicular manslaughter medal once you do this. This may be more desirable as the Vehicular Manslaughter is harder to achieve than the splatter spree.

, This glitch can be repeated multiple times, in some cases allowing players to obtain several splatter sprees and vehicular manslaughter medals in a single game. Simply continue to shoot enemies to obtain as many medals as you desire, but take care not to splatter anyone, as this will end the glitch.

, If you performed the glitch correctly, you should see a splatter spree or vehicular manslaughter medal for every enemy you shot after receiving the first.

Decide whether you want to spend the extra effort on keeping your allies alive.,
Keep them out of trouble.,
Take the hits for them.,
Use vehicles wisely.,
Avoid leading them into dangerous situations.,
Swap the better weapons with them.,
Use equipment wisely.,
Kill all dangerous enemies before they do damage to your allies.,
Cut down on friendly fire incidents.,
Resist the urge to betray your allies.",How to Keep Your Allies Alive During the Campaign on Halo 3," It does make it easier to complete the game's campaign, but putting yourself in danger and constantly looking out for them can be tiresome. In some cases, you might just want to finish a level by yourself, so consider just letting them die.;
, This may sound obvious, but they're trained to fight and very eager to get stuck in, so it's a harder prospect than it looks. Whether it's grabbing the faster vehicle, clearing the area before they arrive or simply blocking their way, the best way to save your allies is to avoid letting them get into combat.

, Although it may be easier to let your allies simply go out and be cannon fodder first, it will almost always end in their demise. Go out and draw fire away from them - after all, your health regenerates and theirs does not.

, Let's face it, you're going to need Marines when using vehicles, but if you want them to see another day, then you have to use vehicles wisely. Never let them drive - not only will you end up dead, but so will they - marines are far better gunners and passengers than drivers.

, Sure, it might help a little dragging them along to take out a Wraith, but it will probably damage them irreparably. Leave them behind and take it out yourself - it may take time but it will save the loss of your allies.

, Remember, they have unlimited ammunition, so swapping your rocket launcher if it only has one rocket left may be advisable. You can swap your weapons with an ally by walking up to one and holding the Right Bumper when prompted. You will get their weapon and they'll get your currently selected weapon.

, A well-placed bubble shield, deployable cover or regenerator could save countless allied lives, so be sure to recognize when there's a bad situation and when to deploy your equipment. Generally, equipment can be salvaged from anywhere, but dead Brutes usually have defensive equipment.

, Grenade throwing grunts and brutes are deadly to allies, Wraiths and turrets are too. But above all, hunters are by far the most deadly to your allies. Sooner or later an ally is going to find itself in a Hunter's path and die, so be careful and act quickly.

, You may not think it, but far more Marines and Elite allies die from your fire than from hostiles. Be aware of your tank-fire, your grenades and general weapon fire. If possible, take a less explosive weapon or shoot from a separate area to where they are positioned.

, They may be dumb and rush in when you don't want them to, or fail to shoot properly, or even drive off with your parked vehicle, but remain calm and remember who's side you they are on and that they are only powered by minimal artificial intelligence. It's not their fault.

Gather a few grenades.,
Find a ledge or area you can't reach with jumping alone (to jump, press A on your Xbox 360 controller).,
Throw a grenade at the base of the object, wall or ledge you wish to jump onto.,
Move to the grenade quickly and jump just as it is about to explode.,
Move towards the area you want to land on whilst in mid-air (i.e.,
Practice grenade jumping again and again.",How to Grenade Jump on Halo 3," Grenades are usually readily available on most levels and areas, and they re-spawn quickly as well. Plasma grenades are the ideal choice for grenade jumpers as frag grenades are harder to throw and jump off since they 'bounce' away from you, although it is still possible to use them. Avoid using spike grenades as the explosive spikes they shoot will probably kill you rather than boost you.;
, Containers or walls are a good size to practice grenade jumping on as they are too high to reach with jumping alone, but can easily be reached with a grenade jump.

, again, this is easier with a plasma grenade since it doesn't 'bounce' away like a frag grenade. However, you can use a frag grenade if you aim it carefully so that it stops moving where you need to jump from at the object's base.

, Do not jump too late and don't jump too early - doing this will most likely result in your death as you'll be too close to the grenade's blast radius to survive. However, if you manage to time your jump correctly, then the blast from the grenade's explosion will catapult you upwards rather than kill you.

, the ledge or area you were trying to reach with the grenade jump) and land your grenade jump. Congrats! You just grenade jumped!

, The first few times you may find yourself getting blown to bits or not jumping high enough. But practice grenade jumping enough, you'll find it easier and easier to do. Practicing works exceptionally well if you are trying to master frag-grenade jumping, as you won't have to rely on plasma grenades alone to grenade jump.

Begin a Forge session on the Sandbox map.,
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.,
Locate the area of the map where the skull is located.,
Dodge the guardian's attacks in editor mode by using the thrust (pressing and holding the Left Trigger) and moving in vertical and horizontal lines once you have passed the boundary of the map.,
Decide which method of getting to the Sandbox skull you wish to use, as there are many.,
Change from editor mode back into player form (if you are not in it already) by pressing UP on the D-Pad again and pick up the skull by pressing the Right Bunker when prompted.,
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Sandbox Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.",How to Get the Sandbox Skull in Halo 3," This can be done by selecting the Forge from the main menu and selecting the Sandbox map from the ones available. Gathering the Mythic skulls is infinitely easier when you are in a Forge session rather than Custom game.;
, Make sure that if you are not host, that the player who is has enabled all players to be able to enter editor mode.

, Go directly towards the edge of the map from the Red base on the middle level (the Red base is the one with the red orb of light above it); if you are facing in the correct direction you will see a setting sun and a half-submerged wall. The skull is in a dip between two sand dunes at the very base of the wall.


To find the skull easily, enter the Theater mode of Halo 3 and view the film from your session on Sandbox. When you press Y on your controller, it allows the camera to move freely and you can move over the boundary of the map without the worry of getting attacked by the guardians. Once you have found the skull you can return to Forge with a better knowledge of where to look.

, This becomes easier if you make players invulnerable to damage with 4X over-shields and 200% recharge rate - the guardians will still kill you, but it will make it harder for them to.

, Some take longer than others, while some need the help from friends. Whatever the case, as soon as you cross over the boundary of the map, the guardians (or protectors of the map represented by tall sentry towers) will shoot at you with several laser beams with excellent aim. Here are some methods:


Spawn a teleport sender node somewhere on the middle of the map. Still in editor mode, spawn a receiver node and drag it as far towards the skull as possible. It will drop to the ground when you get killed by the guardians. When you re-spawn, spawn a bubble shield next to the teleport sender node and pick it up in player mode. Enter the teleporter and throw the bubble shield as soon as you come out of the teleport receiver node by pressing X on your controller. Once inside the bubble shield, enter editor mode again and spawn more bubble shields. In player mode, assuming you dropped the teleporter close to the skull, you should be able to form a path of bubble shields to the skull. A video of this method can be seen here on YouTube.

Using a similar technique to the one above, instead of bubble shields you can also use scenery pieces to block off the guardian's attacks. Large blocks, walls and shield doors are effective to form pathways between the teleport receiver node and the skull. It may take slightly longer, but will be more permanent than the bubble shields which will disappear over time. A video of this method can be seen here on YouTube.

Get two friends to hold objects such as shield doors or large blocks up to the guardian's lasers to block their attacks. This will buy you some time, although it will take a lot of skill and patience and team work between you and your friends.
Create a Tube Corner piece. Get inside the Tube Corner piece, then pick the piece up as the Monitor and fly to the skull. To make it to the skull easier, try having a friend stay in a safe spot and help navigate you to the skull.
By far the easiest way, although it is a shortcut, is to download an edited map which has the towers disabled or blocked off. You can download these map variants from a Bungie.net file share to your console. An example of one can be found here on Bungie.net.

A potentially hazardous way to acquire the skull is to effectively turn off the guardians by overloading the map. It is easy to perform, but the results from this are unreliable and can potentially harm your game experience if your Xbox 360 is prone to faults. Only attempt if you are skilled in the make up of Halo 3 maps. A video of this method is shown here on YouTube.


, Be careful not to get killed by the guardians before you claim it. Congratulations, you just found the Sandbox Skull!

, It is represented by a skull with an oracle image on its forehead.

, The area is located directly after a fight with the brutes, grunts and drones guarding the first shield door to the highway. There is a long stretch of piping running alongside the road to the left. If you see a Covenant phantom fly overhead, then you are in the right place.

, If you can't reach it, consider parking your warthog, or other vehicle, next to the piping and jump off onto it.

, There will be a yellow, grated barrier in front of it on the piping which you will need to jump over.

, You will see a small protrusion from the piping below with two bolts on it. You need to jump onto these and then onto the ledge far below.

, You will take a little bit of damage from the fall, but don't be alarmed. Walk towards the end of the ledge straight ahead and turn to your left. You will see the Tough Luck Skull resting on a rock ledge on the mountain.

The most important thing is to find a team with players you are comfortable with.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Playing over a LAN line is a must if you are preparing for a competitive tournament as playing over LAN is completely different to playing over XBL.,
Broadly speaking, if you want to improve your Halo 3 skills (especially in a team environment) MLG is unequivocally the best playlist to be playing (not squad battle... if you play that, you're heavy support >_<), not only is MLG at the forefront of competitive gaming on a global scale, but it runs the largest e-sports circuit in the world.",How to Improve As a Team in Halo 31," If you don't get along with your teammates, then obviously you are not going to do very well.;
, There is no substitute for practice. With practice comes better team chemistry, better communication, better teamwork and team-shooting, better strategies etc.

, XBL is accessible and convenient which subsequently leads to more frequent and consistent practice online, however, there are latency issues which means that the game isn't as ""precise"" as it would be on a local area network and at a very high level of play 50-50 situations are always in favour of the connection host on live (unless of course you're playing squad battle in which case everyone will be warping everywhere due to lag). There's no reason why you can't improve your game hugely on live, but LAN experience is definitely important for tournament preparation.

, Competitive Halo is always calibrated to the MLG standard.

In most competitive game-types motion sensor is turned off, therefore you are relying on your eyes and the eyes of your teammates.,
Become proficient at team-shooting.",How to Improve As a Team in Halo 32," Call out (state their position) anyone you see and details about how much shield they have. 9/10 times in higher levels of play, players with low shields will be taken out, thanks to detailed communication

, This separates the good teams from the great teams. what's the point in taking someone down to low shield, just for them to escape around the corner and recharge their shields? The idea is that the more people firing on a single person, the quicker they will die and the less damage your team members will sustain. Again, good communication is a must to develop good team-shooting

Choose appropriate roles for the players.,
Whilst this may sound a good idea, it is much better if all players in the team are proficient with all weapons to avoid any weaknesses, though it shows that teammates are evaluating themselves and other members of the team which is good.,
Main Slayer: If you consistently come highest on your team with kills, and use power weapons effectively, you are probably the main slayer.,
Sniper Support: Unlike the Main Slayer, the Sniper Support player does not aim to actually kill the opposing team, they will take the shot if they can, but their main goal is to put the pressure on the opposing team to find and kill them, thus distracting them from the flag or actual kill count.",How to Improve As a Team in Halo 33," Many teams make the mistake of assigning specific tasks for specific members of the team. For example, if there is a strong sniper in the team, the sniper may be left to that one person.

, Having said that, players may fall under one or more of these categories.


Main slayer
Frenzied
Support
Objective

, As the main slayer you will usually be the one using the power weapons, and you will be expected to make a lot of sick plays and spearhead attacks. To be a main slayer you have to be proficient will all weapons, but most of all the BR and the sniper rifle. Don't get too big headed though, you may be the one getting the majority of kills, but if you start attacking without the support of your team, you will quickly be ripped to shreds.




All your team members should be around the same skill level, if you're not then your team is less likely to bond together as well and less like to work as a team. If you feel like you're the weakest link, then its up whether or not you want to Improve As an Individual in Halo 3. The main idea of this role is to get as many kills as possible, but there are different roles in this position.



Frenzied: Frenzied is a role that pretty much is self explanatory. The job of the Frenzied is to literally charge in with a power weapon into a mass of enemies and to cause as much chaos as possible. The Frenzied, however, usually dies in the act, but if you have support near by, it can be a 3-4 to 1 trade off. (Frenzied players are usually good when you need to end the game and you have at least 4 more kills then the enemy.)

Support: If you are the one who pushes the other team back into your sword/hammer equipped teammate then you are most likely a Support player. unlike the other two categories there are sub categories of support players

, A very good Sniper Support will actually be a Main Slayer in most games, and a passable one will usually find themselves coming in second place.



Heavy Support: If you can drive a tank so well that you never get boarded, you're heavy support. If you can hit a Banshee from across the map with a perfectly shot rocket, you're heavy support. Your job is to put such an impressive amount of ammo on target consistently that no one can leave the base, lest they feel your instant, explosive wraith. so when your team comes down on them, none are left in the base and any that come after their flag are instantly blown out of the map.

Light Support/Driver: These two jobs are often inter changed, as they have so much in common. Light Support players occupy turrets, both on the Warthog and stationary. Light Support often accompany the Objective players to their targets, and will often drive them out with the flag with a Warthog or Mongoose. The enemy team will curse at you, and make you their main target in all CTF matches, for they know that while the slayer slays, and the objective runner scores, it is you that is the glue that holds it together. In Slayer game types an Objective player is often a Light Support.

Stealth Support: Very popular when used in a game without radars or a lot of corners. The Stealth Support's job is to kill anybody who walks into their territory by STEALTHY means. I do not highly suggest rushing in with guns blazing when you see an enemy, rather have camouflage and let one of your teammates lure an enemy into your trap. This is effectively used on The Pit, on the yellow rafter right next to the Camo Hallway when you have Camouflage. Since the Camouflage hallway is one of the three most active parts of the maps (other two include Sword Spawn and Rocket Spawn), your job can be crucial.

Objective: Objective players have one simple goal: get the flag/ball/bomb and get it to home/target. They live for that simple, yet hard rush that comes with bringing back the flag to make a tie game one that you've won. It does not matter to an Objective player how many times they die, nor how many times they kill, all they do is get the flag and get it home. However there is also a subcategory for this position.

Linear Carrier: The linear carrier is as vital to the team as the Objective person is. The Linear carrier is the personal bodyguard of the flag carrier. The Linear Carrier should always have a Battle Rifle and a power weapon of some sort. He is to defend the flag carrier at all costs, even suicide sticking somebody. However, if the original carrier dies and the area is clear, the Linear Carrier will run with the flag and the old Objective man will become the Linear Carrier.

Guardian: This class is only used in Objective Games like 2 Flag, or Offense and Defensive Games. A Guardian is a special role which can be played either offensively or defensively. This is one of the only roles that can be interchangeable throughout matches. It is usually the second best person on the team who ends up being the Guardian. An Offensive Guardian is posted on the route the flag carrier is going to run to score. The Guardian should be just out of the line of sight of anyone traveling down the same path the carrier did. The Guardian will kill anyone following them in any means possible. The Defensive Guardian has essentially the same job, but from a defensive standpoint. The Guardian is posted at usually heavily populated parts of the map, or routes bomb carriers come to destroy your base, or those who are attempting to get the flag. A tip for all Guardians is after you get a kill there, move to another key point on the map.

Set-ups.,
Setups relate mainly to a system in which a team can centralize their play around the objective (whether that be in TS or objective games), obviously these change between maps, but there are also major contrasts in objective setups compared to slayer setups but for objective there is often a standard setup which is adopted by the majority of teams relating to a certain game type e.g.,
An individual's role in a team setup can vary and often has more emphasis on either slaying or supporting (for objective games- rare in slayer; especially on Amplified >_<, but definitely applicable for Isolation, but note that Isolation is no longer an MLG-standard map), often, particularly in objective games such as oddball there will be someone guarding a certain area and focusing on getting ball time and defending e.g.,
Note that during games individuals will switch positions to accommodate shifts in momentum and so are not tied to certain roles.,
The main idea is achieving a balance between getting as much geographical scope as possible (not only applying to the view of the map but also power weapon coverage etc.),
Aggressive rushes.,
Base raids.,
Lock down.,
Opening strategy.",How to Improve As a Team in Halo 34," You are going to want to position your team so that you can actually start team-shooting. The idea behind setting up is that you are able to catch the opponent in a crossfire situation, i.e. 2 or more members of your own team firing on 1 of their team. Set-ups should also be chosen so your team can control key points in a map, e.g. power weapon spawns, power-ups and key geographical points.

, running the flag down long hall on the Pit and spawn trapping the opposition at snipe courtyard etc.

, top blue on Guardian, and there will be slayers focusing on suppressive fire e.g. blue window or S3.

, When the circumstances are in your team's favor everyone must do their best to lock down key areas of the map and prevent the opposing team from breaking the setup. In terms of defensive line of sight, an individual will have certain areas of the map to focus on and this will often involve watching distant areas from which a team could attack e.g. (taking Guardian as a case in point- there may be someone located at bottom snipe lift on an oddball game, this person could defend the blue setup put shots into lower areas of the map e.g. elbow, S1-Underglass).

, without compromising the setup's rigidity (e.g. if all of you push too far out of your setup for whatever reason, if even for an instant, this could result in the opposing team spawning behind you. , Rushing has become a far more effective tactic in Halo 3 than it was in Halo 2, making it an excellent tactic to employ. However, this doesn't mean running at the opponent randomly, which will likely get you killed.


Rushes, though they may seem random, must be well planned. It's best if all four members are alive at the time, so that your rush is as effective as possible. Rushes need to be coordinated and used at the right time, you don't want to be charging your opponent when they have all the power ups and power weapons.
It is therefore more likely to see teams charge when they pick up a power weapon or a power up. As when you are charging you will attract the full attention of the other team, it is good to sneak one of your teammates around their blind side to flank them. This will mean as the other teams focus is in one direction, you can sneak up behind them, scoring easy kills or finishing off your teams' kills.
Also you have to take into account the personality of the team. Some teams are naturally less aggressive than others, so these teams may choose to work more of effective set-ups and use rushes sparingly. On the other hand, there are teams which are made up of more aggressive player, so it would suit them to rush.

, Similar to an aggressive rush, but the tactics and scenario is different. A base raid is usually employed in a one sided objective match (One Flag, One bomb, etc.), double sided objective match, but the team is only defending their base, and VIP.


For this to work, every member will need to be alive, and at least have a single grenade. It is also recommended that you have a power weapon of some sort as well, it will improve your chances. Once you are positive that they are all in the base, set up key entrances.
As for example The Pit base, have one person at main entrance, one person side entrance, and two at opening. Since most of the time the enemy team will have at least one power weapon, your first move is to throw a grenade, or if necessary strafe in and then throw a grenade. The grenade, if it is well-placed, should take out the enemy shields, or at least do some damage.
If one of your members has a power weapon (for this example a rocket launcher) let him jump in and shoot it off. As soon as it goes off rush in. If a team member has another power weapon (shotgun,sword) let him be the first to go in, but have all members immediately follow instead of waiting.
If nobody has a power weapon all rush in with a precision weapon like the battle rifle, or an automatic weapon like the SMG or Assault Rifle.

, This is a special set-up in which you are trying to defend something, or someone at all costs. If you are locking down your base so the enemy can not steal your flag or get the bomb in, YOU MUST NOT BE ON TOP OF THE OBJECTIVE POINT. I can not stress enough on how people think they can crowd around the flag, and a single rocket kills the whole team.


You of course need to be near the position so find a strategic point in which you can see the point you are protecting, but not on top of it. If there is a Sniper Rifle available have a single person go outside and kill the enemies he can.
When defending a point or person, one person should have a Power Weapon, or at least a good course range weapon, even dual-wielded SMGs will be deemed plausible. If you are trying to protect a person (if he is the Oddball carrier or a VIP) this changes a little bit. Find a medium sized area, just large enough that if somebody throws a grenade, everybody is damaged equally.
The only thing is that this area must have minimal points of access. A place where someone can walk through 5 different ways is a terrible strategic position. This area should have a dead maximum of 3 openings, even though it is usually better if there is only two. Secondly, for the person who the team is guarded, find a spot in the room that is both close to their protection, and it is difficult to get hit by a grenade.
Stay calm, stay crouching, and the lock down will usually be successful.

, Make sure that all the members of the team know what their role is in the opening plays of the match, before the game starts. Teams will usually devise strategies to control key areas of the map and power weapons, allowing them to dominate the match right from the beginning. Opening strategies will also be affected by the team you are playing. Aggressive openings can be negated by a good set-up. Similarly against teams who have effective set-ups, you may want to adopt a more aggressive opening strategy, to disrupt their set-up.

, The Heretic skull is located fairly high on the map, at roughly the same height as the sword.

, There is a Needler next to a fusion coil in the area to help distinguish this side from the back of the map. Because the map is symmetrical, setting a point to guide yourself by helps immensely. However, the map is also fairly small, so shouldn't pose too much of a problem.

Play ""The Covenant."",
Start the level from the beginning.,
Get to the end of the level.,
Clear the final room of enemies.,
Number the rings one through seven.,
Jump through rings 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 3, and 4.,
Watch for the rings to flash.,
Use the skull to hear rare dialog.",How to Get the IWHBYD Skull in Halo 3," This is the eighth level in the game — the one where you fight the Prophet of Truth.You can find the skull on Normal, Heroic, or Legendary difficulty. It won't' appear on Easy difficulty.;
, You must do this for the skull to appear. You can't get the skull if you start from a saved game or a rally point.

, The skull is located at the very end of the level, so you can play through most of it as you normally would. When you see the chapter title ""Stop Truth"" and enter the massive, long room filled with glowing rings, you've reached the part of the level where you can get the skull.


Don't worry — as long as you met the criteria above, none of your actions earlier in the level will affect whether or not you can get the skull.

, Getting the skull is almost impossible if you have to worry about fighting enemies at the same time. Kill all of the hostiles in the room before you get started. In other words:


Kill all the Covenant in the room.
Kill the Prophet of Truth.
Extend the bridge at the end of the room and kill all the Flood.
Don't jump down the elevator shaft — you won't be able to return if you do.

, Getting the skull requires you to jump through the giant glowing rings in a certain order. There are seven rings in the room. The ring next to the elevator is ""1."" The ring next to Truth is ""7."" The rest of the rings proceed in order between these two: the second ring from the elevator is 2, and so on.


For easy reference, the only ring with a red section on it is ""4."", Because the rings are so far apart, this can take a few minutes. Don't worry — there's no time limit. However, there are a few things to keep in mind as you do this:You must always jump toward the bridge you extended. You won't get the skull if you jump through the rings in the wrong direction.
If you mess up, you must start from the beginning again (ring 4). You don't have to start the whole level over.

, This is a sign that you've completed the order successfully. Now, head for the bridge at the end of the room. The skull will be on the ground in the center of the path.

, The skull doesn't affect the game besides giving you an achievement and changing the way dialog works. Computer-controlled characters will have the rarity of their dialog responses reversed. In other words, they'll frequently say things that they would normally say only rarely and vice versa. This can lead to some interesting, humorous exchanges, especially during combat.


As just one example, if you're using the skull while fighting Brutes with other marines, you may hear one of them say, ""Hey, I heard their weakness is bananas, do we have any bananas?"" It's possible to hear this without the skull, but it occurs much more rarely."

Green lights - The system is operating normally.
One red light - This indicates a general hardware failure, and is usually accompanied by a code on your TV screen (e.g. ""E74""). See the next sections for some tips on getting this fixed.
Two red lights - This indicates that the console is currently overheating. Turn the Xbox 360 off for a couple of hours and make sure that it is ventilated on all sides.
Three red lights - This is the Red Ring of Death, and indicates a major hardware failure. This usually occurs because the motherboard has overheated and become warped, causing the chips to lose contact. You'll need to either open up your system and repair it yourself or send it in for professional repair.
Four red lights - This indicates a faulty or unsupported A/V cable.;
, Your Xbox 360's power supply also has a light on the back. This light can help you determine if your power supply is failing:


No light - The power supply is not receiving power from the wall.
Green light - The power supply is working correctly and the Xbox is on.
Orange light - The power supply is working correctly and the Xbox is off.
Red light - The power supply is failing. The most common cause is an overheating power supply. Unplug it on both ends and let it sit for at least an hour.

, The S model has a touch-sensitive button, and may not work with a gloved finger or if you use a fingernail. Press the button with your bare finger to turn the console on., An overheating power supply is one of the most common reasons that an Xbox 360 will not start. Many people tuck the power supply away, but this can lead to heat build-up. Make sure your power supply is well-ventilated and not blocked by other object.


Unplug the power supply on both ends and let it sit for at least an hour to cool.
Make sure the fan in the power supply is still functioning. You should be able to hear a faint whirring sound when the power supply is plugged in and turned on. If the fan has failed, you'll need to get a new power supply.

, If you get two red lights on your Xbox 360 Power button, your console is overheating. Turn it off for a few hours to let it cool down. Make sure that the Xbox 360 is placed in a well-ventilated area and that no other objects are directly next top it or stacked on top of it.


There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that keeping your Xbox 360 horizontal will lead to better cooling.

, If your Xbox 360 is displaying four red lights, your video cable may be damaged or incompatible, or the connection isn't complete. Check that all of the plugs are connected properly. Try using a replacement official video cable to see if your problem is fixed.

, Sometimes you can have too many things connected to your Xbox 360, causing it to draw too much power. This is especially common with modified consoles with unofficial hard drives or other peripherals. Disconnect everything you can and try to start the console again.


This failure is commonly accompanied by error code E68 on your TV.

, A common cause of failure for Xbox 360 consoles is bent pins in the USB ports causing a short circuit:


Examine the USB ports on the Xbox 360, both in the front and in the back. If any of the pins inside are touching each other or the casing of the port, they are likely causing a short circuit.
With the Xbox unplugged, use tweezers to gently bend the pins back to their original position. Avoid using the USB port in the future if possible so that the pins don't get bent again.

, If your console is still covered by Microsoft's warranty, you should be able to get it repaired for free or for a discount. You may receive a replacement console if it is damaged beyond repair.


Visit devicesupport.microsoft.com/en-US to register your devices, check their warranty status, and request service.

, The Red Ring of Death (three red lights around the Power button) can indicate a variety of different hardware problems. Most of the time, it will be because the console has overheated and the board has warped, causing chips to lose contact. You can use the secondary error code to determine the exact cause:While the console is on and the red lights are flashing, press and hold the Sync button on the front of the Xbox.
While holding the Sync button, press and release the Eject button.
Note the flashing lights that indicate the first digit. One light means the first digit is ""1,"" two means ""2,"" three means ""3,"" and four means ""0.""
Press the Eject button again to get the next digit. There are four digits total.

, Once you have a secondary code, you can look it up to see what your hardware problem is. You can find the code meanings at xbox-experts.com/errorcodes.php.

, This will list the known repairs that can fix the code, as well as point you to the proper parts and tools you'll need.

, Even if your console is out of warranty, it may be easier to have it repaired at the local electronics shop or hobbyist's garage than to try it yourself. Check Craigslist and local ads for Xbox 360 repair services. This is especially important if your Xbox needs to be reflowed, as this requires special equipment to do right.

, One of the most common replacement parts you'll need is an X-Clamp replacement. This is the piece that keeps the heatsink attached to the CPU, and getting a new one will keep things solidly in place. You'll also likely need new thermal paste to apply between the CPU and the heatsink.


If you're replacing the clamps on the Xbox 360, you'll likely need a drill in order to install the larger replacement bolts.

, There are too many variations to list here, so look for a repair guide that matches your error code. You may need extra tools like a heat gun to reflow the solder. Different repairs will vary wildly in difficulty and required materials.

, Most repairs will require you to open your Xbox 360. This is a fairly complicated process, and is made easier with a special tool that is included in most repair kits. See Open an Xbox 360 for detailed instructions.

, You'll need to remove the DVD drive in order to get to the components underneath. Disconnect the two cables coming out of the back of the drive, then lift the drive up and out.

, The fan shroud unclick and can be set to the side. Remove the cable connecting the fans to the motherboard, then pry the fans out of their metal housing.

, If your Xbox is overheating, cleaning out the dust inside can make a big difference. Use a clean paintbrush to get dust out of the heatsinks, and a can of compressed air to blow dust out of crevasses.


Remove the fans and carefully remove the dust from each blade using your brush. Don't blow fans with compressed air, as this can make the fans spin faster than they are designed to.

, This is the small logic board that is mounted vertically along the front of the open console.


You'll need to use a spudger or flathead to pry the shield off, and then a Torx screwdriver to remove the three screws.

, There are nine gold Torx T10 screws and eight black Torx T8 screws.


Your RRoD fix-it kit will likely include replacements for the eight T8 screws.

, You can lift the motherboard out from the front. Be careful to not let the motherboard fall out while turning the console over.

, If your repair calls for X clamp replacement, or you want to apply new thermal paste to the CPU heatsink, you'll need to remove the X clamps from the back of the motherboard.Use a small flathead to pry the X clamp away from the retaining post until it pops out of the groove.
Insert the flathead underneath the released clamp and then pry it completely off the post. Repeat for each corner of the clamp.

, You may have to apply a little force to break the seal of the old thermal paste.

, Ensure that you've cleaned off both the CPU and the heatsink surface so that none of the old paste remains.

, Apply a small drop of paste on the center of your Xbox 360 processor. The drop should be small, smaller than a pea. You don't need to spread it. If the drop is placed exactly in the center, it will spread automatically when the heatsink is installed.

, This covers the basics of cleaning the system, replacing the clamps, and applying new thermal paste. Refer to your repair guide to see what else you'll need to do to get your system fixed. This could include reflowing the solder that connects the chips to the motherboard, which is a complicated process.

Begin the Floodgate campaign level on Halo 3.,
Start the campaign level and run towards the entrance to the destroyed city of Voi.,

Wait for a marine to cry out ""All squads report"".,
Shoot the Flood with your battle rifle or carbine.,

, Immediately, look up to the aforementioned building on the right, directly in front of where the power lines run from. A Flood will appear on the roof carrying the Fog skull.

, If you wait too long, it will jump across the street and out of view, so you must be quick. If a marine yells out ""There! Over there!"" and a new checkpoint saves, then you have waited too long and will have to begin again. However, if you manage to shoot the Flood before it escapes, then the Fog skull should fall onto the street for you to collect.

, Congratulations, you've found it! Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics to see the Fog achievement has been unlocked for 10 gamerscore. It is represented by a skull with a swirl of fog on it. You will also be able to use the Fog skull in your campaign games by pressing X in the campaign menu and selecting it. It gives you a x1.5 campaign score multiplier, but you will not be able to use your motion tracker.

Begin the Crow's Nest campaign level on Halo 3.,
Play your way through the beginning of the level until you reach the level chapter 'Know Your Role' in the command centre for the base.,
Look directly up at the ceiling.,
Walk to the far end of the room, away from the monitors, until you have gone up two levels of stairs.,
Walk directly below the lighting on the top level of the room and jump onto the green supports below the piping.,
Move along the supports until you can jump up onto the large piping on which the skull is located.,
Claim the Black Eye Skull by pressing the Right Bunker button on your Xbox 360 controller.",How to Get the Black Eye Skull in Halo 3," To claim the skull, you must have begun the campaign level from the beginning and have attempted it on a difficulty of at least Normal. The Crow's Nest campaign level can be accessed from the Campaign option on the main menu.;
, This is towards the beginning of the level and is directly after the Covenant forces breach the perimeter to the base. Commander Miranda Keyes will be talking to a Marine technician and the room is lined with fairly large monitors.

, You will see a large portion of piping running through the top of the room - the Black Eye Skull is resting at the very end of this piping.

, There will be two barrels and a marine or two beneath the piping. If you go through the door leading to the barracks, you have gone too far.

, The supports are right behind the two barrels, right below the piping, and run parallel to the piping for a while.

, The Black Eye Skull is located at the far end of the piping, directly above the command centre's monitors.

, Congratulations, you've found it! Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics to see the Black Eye achievement has been unlocked for 10 gamerscore. It is represented by a skull with a black eye and a smaller skull with a black eye printed on it. You will also be able to use the Black Eye skull in your campaign games by pressing X in the campaign menu and selecting it. It gives you a x1.5 campaign score multiplier, but you can only get shield regeneration by performing melee attacks on enemies.

Begin a Forge session on the Citadel map.,
Enter editor mode (or oracle form) by pressing UP on the D-Pad once you have begun play.,
Move past the overshield spawn towards the blue side of the map.,
Stop in front of the two white-blue, triangular light panels on the wall directly after the overshield tunnel.,
Look up the wall to the ceiling, directly above the triangular lights.,
Spawn a grav lift in Forge mode.,
Move the grav lift, while you are still holding it, into the ceiling gap, just to the right of the centre beam.,
Locate the Citadel skull on the floor below the ceiling gap.,
Check your Xbox 360 gamerscore and achievement statistics and you will see that the Citadel Skull achievement has been unlocked for 25 gamerscore.",How to Get the Citadel Skull in Halo 3," This can be done by selecting the Forge from the main menu of the Halo: Complete Multiplayer Experience disc and selecting the Citadel map from the ones available. Gathering the Mythic skulls is infinitely easier when you are in a Forge session rather than Custom game.;
, Make sure that if you are not host, that the player who is has enabled all players to be able to enter editor mode.

, The skull is located past the overshield tunnel, in the bend before reaching the blue side. Make sure you are on the overshield side of the map, as Citadel is symmetrical; if you can't see the skull, move to the other side of the blue base.

, They are fairly large and ""point"" back towards the overshield. In addition, there is a small column to the left of these lights with arrow-lights running up it. If you reach the area of the blue base with the sniper rifle, then you have gone too far.

, You should see a gap in the ceiling with a beam running through it; the Citadel is sitting on a ledge in this gap. However, the area is far too small to enter and claim the skull, although you can fly up to it and view the skull.

, Grav lifts can be purchased for $5 from the Scenery category in the Forge items menu.

, Rotate it outwards - the idea is to launch the skull from its' ledge onto the floor below via the grav lift's pull. You'll need some skill with rotating objects, so try practicing first.

, If you have performed the extraction correctly, the skull should have been sucked from its' ledge and thrown on the floor below where you can claim it. Change from editor mode back into player form by pressing UP on the D-Pad again and pick it up by pressing the Right Bunker when prompted. Congratulations, you just found the Citadel Skull!

, It is represented by a skull with the Shield World symbol on its' forehead.

Recon can be unlocked by completing a series of 7 achievements dubbed Vidmasters, 4 in Halo 3 and 3 in Halo 3: ODST.,
Vidmaster Challenge: Lightswitch : This achievement is probably the easiest, it requires you to get 50 EXP in any playlist.,
Vidmaster Challenge: 7 on 7 : This is one weird achievement!,
Vidmaster Challenge: Annual : Now it gets complicated, and hard.,
Vidmaster Challenge: Brainpan : We're moving into Halo 3: ODST now, but this achievement can be 50% completed if you have the first 3 of the Mythic Map Pack add-on for Halo 3.,
Vidmaster Challenge: Classic : All ODST now.,
Vidmaster Challenge: Deja Vu : Well Deja Vu is similar to Annual, the insane achievement with the Iron Skull.,
Vidmaster Challenge: Endure : Last One!!!,
And that's it!!!,
You will see the 7 Vidmasters highlighted, if they are all unlocked you will see a button saying 'Unlock My Recon!",How to Get Recon Armour," Let's start with Halo 3's:;
, So basically, win 50 games in a gametype. Easy!

, You must get 7 EXP on the 7th of any month. Just reach it and you get it.

, In this achievement you and 3 other players must complete the mission 'Halo' on the Legendary Difficulty, and with Iron skull, and everybody using Ghosts. This will take you about 2 hours, so be ready for a long fight. There are many MANY strategies to unlocking this achievement, you are advised to just take your time. Remember, Iron Skull makes sure that if one of you dies you go right back to the last checkpoint, or restart the mission if you ALL die. Check out Halopedia for cool strategies.

, It requires you find 6 skulls, all hidden in each of the Mythic maps, just fly around in Forge and find em'. If you have not bought any map packs yet, DON'T! They are all in Halo 3: ODST multiplayer disk so you will just waste money buying them.

, This requires you complete any mission on Legendary Difficulty, signed into Xbox Live, without firing any bullets or throwing any grenades. Best map to do so would be 'Uplift Reserve' as it has many vehicles. Just keep driving and don't look back. Firing in vehicles, charging a laser, or any other weapons will cause you to fail the challenge. Simply don't touch your Right Trigger at all for this one.

, You must complete the mission 'Coastal Highway' on Legendary, with Iron Skull on, and without using the Warthog or the Scorpion Tank. About 1-2 hours for this, use the mongooses to keep up with Dare, and kill all resistance whilst covered behind her. Once again there are brilliant strategies on Halopedia.

, Get this and you will finally unlock Recon Armour! In this, you must have a 4-Player Xbox Live Heroic match on Firefight, and make it past the 4th set. It is easier than it sounds.

Never over-rush!,
Battle Rifle.,
Sniper.,
Use grenades effectively.,
Call out your enemy and talk to your team.,
Don't get angry.,
Have fun!,
Learn from your losses or mistakes.,
Use your brain!,
Communicate with your team.",How to Get Better at Halo 3," If you over-rush you will die. Maybe not a few times, but you will never be able to rush constantly and never die. It's impossible. Pros can't even do it. So don't over-rush.;
, Always use it- it's a key weapon to use in almost any scenario. If you spawn with an assault rifle, pick up the br. Use it a lot, go into customs, and practice. Make it your best weapon. Use the assault rifle in close quarters, for quick and easy kills.


""Four shot"" with it! (3 shots to the body, 1 shot to the head)







, Use it get better with it, and conserve your ammo. If you're not sure you can hit him at least once don't shoot. If you don't get a head shot, use the br, and one shot (if it's your secondary). Practice no-scoping with your friends, close and long range, (long range if your getting shot, it will help in clutch situations). Head shots will kill instantly.

, Don't just throw them anywhere! Find out different ways to get people using the right trajectory. Also throw them at the wall of a corner so they bounce and if anyone is there they are hurt and you can go round and pwn them!

, i.e. If on 'The Pit', and if there is a guy with sniper on the top of your snipe spawn you should say, ""snipe top our snipe"" so everyone knows, and can either kill him or not die by him. This is key if you wanna be a pro or semi-pro gamer.

, Yes halo is full of BS stuff, stuff that SHOULDN'T happen or lag, it's halo it happens. so don't get mad over it. That will affect your game. Another thing, if you go into matchmaking and your teammates are talking BS, then MUTE them, don't get mad with them it's not worth it. Just have fun with it.

, If you're not having fun don't play it, and if your losing it's okay, still laugh about it. I mean it's just a game. And if you don't want to play, then don't, It's just like doing anything else; if you don't want to do it, then most likely, you're not going to do the best you possibly can. Just play a different game until you feel like playing Halo again.

, As in everything in life, you won't be amazing right away or most people won't. You are bound to mess up, and more than likely you do the same stuff, like rush in for that guy camping bottom lift on Guardian. so learn from it, think about what you are going to do next.

, Believe it or not, to be extremely effective in this game you must out-smart your opponent. Tell me...if you shoot a guy and he is one shot, where is he most likely to run? Figure it out before he does it, and you get the kill every time. Basically out-think your opponent. Be able to run away when you are one shot, do new things, and change up your style.

, Share and develop tactics between yourselves. Plus, many eyes are better than one in spotting the enemy.

  The Default Control Scheme.",How to Get Good at Halo 31,",

Examine the Control Scheme. Obviously, you must learn the controls before you can play. You should probably use the Default Control Scheme. However, you can change to other Control Schemes using the menu.

However, each of the control schemes come with their own advantages. For example, the Bumper Jumper scheme allows you to turn and jump/melee at the same time, etc., etc. Try learning to use more than one, and switch when you've got a better advantage with one over the other.

Head shots are key.,
Use walls!!!,
Find someone to play with.,
Don't get mad at yourself.,
Crouch.,
If you are behind a rock and you see that someone is waiting for you to come out, you have two options: 1) Run like mad in the direction that is farthest away from the center of the enemy's scope.,
Never run straight at the sniper as it will be easier for them to shoot you.,
If someone is near a ledge and too busy to notice anyone around them then you don't have to waste any bullets on them.,
Run straight at them.,
Be sure to throw grenades in the air and be shooting at your opponent (rather than the vehicle itself) when you aren't throwing the grenade.,
If you kill your opponent, stop shooting immediately if you don't want to destroy the vehicle.,If you are out of ammunition or just don't want to waste it, try stealing a vehicle while the person is shooting someone else.,It often helps to hold RB (use) while fighting a vehicle since this will trigger your character to automatically hijack it.,
If you are facing a Ghost (the purple one), don't engage until they stop firing and begin to use their turbo toward you.,
Use the missile launcher if possible.,
Fight fire with fire.,
If you're playing Infection and have decreased gravity and/or increased speed for zombies on, simply get a running start.,
Experiment with the weapons and vehicles in the game to see which ones you are better at using.,
Once you have found a weapon you like, think of how it would perform in situations where there are many enemies, or possibly only one enemy.,
Use cover and items to your advantage.,
Know how to counter vehicle attacks.,
Be sure you have ammunition.,Always be aware of your surroundings; keep track of your motion tracker in case any enemies are near.,Keep a close range, and a medium range weapon at hand at all times.",How to Get Good at Halo 34," Ever wonder how you lost that battle and you got the first shot off? Your enemy was probably getting the headshots off with whatever weapon they were using. Remember to always be moving in a battle and jumping around a little, this makes it harder for the enemy to hit you. Whether your using an assault rifle or battle rifle, always go for the headshot, if you can pull it off right, you'll win most of your 1v1 battles., Need a way to take out that enemy around the wall but you just can't get a shot off? Throw a grenade at a wall in the hallway in order to make the grenade bounce off into the hallway and cause damage or even kill the enemy that was there., I have always played better with people that can communicate and I can work well with., It will only make playing harder for you and your team, you always tend to play better when your relaxed and can think it through., It can be very useful to crouch, this makes you undetectable on the radar until you fire or start running again, this is also very useful so can sneak around the map without detection, use surprise attacks and sneak up on those pesky snipers, and this works best with camo., 2) Based on what you see in the opponents screen, find out where they are and throw a grenade in their direction., Instead, try running side to side as you move towards the opponent. Also, you may want to jump, which will make it harder for the average player to kill you. But beware, this will only make it easier for an experienced player to kill you, since you can't change directions in midair. Shoot at him as much as you can while rushing, taking damage will cause the rifle to un-scope and give you more time to get in cover., Instead, hit them with the melee attack or take a couple swipes at them with a sword. Be sure to not take too much time sneaking up on them because the player could look at your screen and turn around to make your job harder., If the vehicle has weapons on it, jump up and down as you run, as most vehicles can't adjust their aim up and down. If the vehicle has no weapons don't jump before you get hit. And if you're in a vehicle and trying to splatter people, act as if your going to run them over, wait for them to jump, when the jump, that's when you stop, wait until they start falling to charge at them, trust me, you'll get them as they can't change direction in mid air., If all else fails,try to stick the vehicle with a plasma or a stick grenade. Throw a frag in front of you before you would be run over and the vehicle will flip over you and crash., If you do, continue shooting.,,, You'll be able to tell because they cannot shoot and the sides glow blue. (They also speed up considerably.) If you are low on shields or ammunition, DON'T BE AFRAID TO HIDE! Your health will regenerate., This weapon locks on to vehicles and homes in with deadly accuracy, and it's very easy to aim. And if they happen to get close enough you should use a plasma pistol so it temporarily shut down the vehicle and Hijack it, oh and, you can thank them for the shiny new banshee/hornet., Grab your own aerial vehicle. You can ask a friend to pick off your foe while you distract him, if you're on a team., You can even defeat foes if you're using the energy sword like this, with patience and practice., A great way to do this is use the Forge feature in the game. It would be good to use them when fighting enemies., The Gravity Hammer may be great for killing one Brute, but if there is a pack of Brutes, you have a problem. Try to get comfortable with a weapon that works in all situations, as well as your favored one. For example, the Assault Rifle or Battle Rifle is a great secondary weapon to the Sniper Rifle or Beam Rifle. Also consider how often it is found in the game, and how fast it runs through ammunition., If you see a wall that extends into a battlefield, hide behind it when your shield starts to run low, and run out when your shield recharges. Halo 3 is an accurate game, so you can use real battlefield tactics, like flanking and cover just like in real life., Being able to take out a pack of Brutes is great, but what if they all get Choppers? Find and exploit the weaknesses of the vehicles, such as, shoot the Covenant out from the turret in Wraiths and shoot the fuel tank on the Ghost. Being able to snipe a Brute or Grunt out of a ghost is not essential as it is very difficult, but learning to do so can make the Legendary campaign significantly easier., If you run out of ammo, just run to a dead body and pick up a new gun, and find a new one later. If there is a small Covenant with a good gun, run up to it and beat it down, then take its gun and continue on your course.,,"
"
Learn how to use the battle rifle.,
Examine Your Arsenal.",How to Get Good at Halo 35," The battle rifle is the best weapon in the game for short to medium ranges., There are many weapons in Halo 3, and to get better at this game, you must learn the strengths and weaknesses of all of them.

The Guns. The Guns are your main weapons in Halo 3. You must learn how to use them before playing.

The Battle Rifle. The Battle Rifle is a quite strong weapon that shoots 3-round bursts and can zoom in for long-range shots. It can do quite a bit of damage to enemies if you shoot at their heads. This weapon is good for short-to-long ranges. It is not dual-wieldable. This is a standard starter weapon. A good technique with the Battle rifle or BR is to throw a frag grenade at oncoming enemy or any grenade and then get one shot off in the head will typically work quite well. The Battle Rifle takes 4 shots to kill someone in the head.
The Assault Rifle. The Assault Rifle is the ""cousin"" to the Battle Rifle, because it has many similarities with it. However, instead of shooting bursts, the Assault Rifle is a full-auto weapon. It, unlike the Battle Rifle, cannot zoom in. This weapon is good for short-to-medium ranges. It is not dual-wieldable. It, like the Battle Rifle, is a standard starter weapon.
The Magnum. The Magnum is a semi-auto handgun. Its rate of fire is somewhat low, and can become inaccurate at long ranges. It's a rather powerful gun which is often underused. The Magnum is good for short-to-medium ranges. It is dual-wieldable. In dual wield configuration and at short ranges, three headshots with both magnums will result in a kill, which is even faster then a Battle Rifle.The Magnum takes 5 shots to the head to kill them.
The SMG. The SMG, or Sub-Machine gun, is a full-auto weapon. It is inaccurate at medium-to-long ranges. It can do great damage at short-to-medium range. It is dual-wieldable.
The Rocket Launcher. The Rocket Launcher is an extremely strong weapon. It can spread a huge amount of damage where it is shot. It is somewhat inaccurate at long ranges, and enemies can dodge the rockets. It can destroy vehicles. It is good for short-to-medium ranges. It is not dual-wieldable.

Shoot at Your Enemy's Feet! An enemy is less likely to survive a rocket shot if you shoot at their feet, because they cannot run away as easily.


The Shotgun. The Shotgun is a weapon that can do extreme damage at close range. It can down almost any enemy at point-blank range, and is feared by all enemies. It can deal low damage at medium-to-long ranges, and should be avoided in those situations. It is best at close range. It is not dual-wieldable. You should also Try to get close with the shotgun and shoot and press B for a insta-kill combo!

Aim for the Chest! For easier kills with the shotgun, wait for your enemy to approach you then release a hail of BBs at your opponent's chest. Since the torso is the largest target of the human, the BBs will be clustered in one area resulting in more damage.


The Sniper Rifle. The Sniper Rifle is a semi-auto weapon that can be extremely strong at long ranges. It can blow up a rocket when shot in its direct path. It can kill in one shot when aimed at the head, and two shots anywhere else. This weapon is one of the best in the game, and its location should be memorized on every map. Remember that you can double-zoom with this weapon. It is best at long ranges. It is not dual-wieldable.

Find ""Sniper Spots"". When using the Sniper Rifle, some places are best for using it. Elevated, out-of-the-way locations are best, because you get the best view of the map, and you can't be seen easily.
Refrain From ""No-Scoping"". No-scoping is when you do not zoom and try to kill enemies shooting ""from the hip"". As satisfying as no-scope kills can be, they are tough to get, and only masters should attempt.
Predict Your Enemy's Movement! Enemies may suddenly jump and move unexpectedly while you are trying to snipe them. This can be very annoying, but if you can predict their movements, you can easily get a snipe.


The Spartan Laser. The Spartan Laser is a ridiculously powerful weapon that shoots a red laser that obliterates enemies and vehicles. It, apart from the Sniper Rifle, is the only weapon that can kill multiple enemies with one shot. It charges quite slow, and enemies may take that as a chance to duck out of sight. It is best at long range. Try to make sure when you see a group of enemies at long range you keep your focus on a single target, rather than choosing in ""mid-charge"", this may cause in a miss, waste of ammo, and revealing your location. It is not dual-wieldable.

Use The Spartan Laser Against Clusters and Vehicles! From afar, the Spartan Laser can destroy vehicles and all of the enemies in them. It can also kill clusters of enemies, resulting in multi-kills for more points.
Widen Your Beam! Right before one fires the Spartan Laser, shift either to the left or right resulting in an arched beam rather than a beam fired in a straight line.


The Machine Gun Turret. The Machine Gun Turret is a grounded weapon that shoots rounds at a fast rate. It can be detached so you can carry it around as a regular weapon. It can destroy many enemies in a row and light vehicles. It is best at medium-long range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Missile Pod. The Missile Pod is a weapon that, like the Turret, is grounded but can be used as a regular weapon; carried around. It can lock on to and destroy vehicles, and can kill enemies with ease. It is best at medium-long range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Flamethrower. The flamethrower is a weapon that shoots deadly flames. It can kill an enemy after the first contact, because it keeps them on fire after you hit them with it. It should only be used at short range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Energy Sword. The Energy Sword is a melee weapon that can kill all enemies in one ""lunge"". The Energy Sword can be used by pressing the melee button or the attack button, the latter causing a ""lunge"" that, from a small distance, causes your character to lunge toward the enemy and strike them. Both, if they make contact, are an instant-kill. This weapon's location should always be memorized. Beware though, if you get in a sword fight it is wise to swing with perfect timing and use jump attacks. It should only be used at short range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Plasma Pistol. The Plasma Pistol is a weapon that can shoot relatively weak energy shots at fast rates or ""charged"", strong shots at slow rates. The latter can instantly deplete any shields. When charged fully it stop a vehicle dead in its tracks, and give you a chance at a kill. This weapon is best at short-to-medium ranges. It is dual-wieldable.
The Plasma Rifle. The Plasma Rifle is a weapon that has a very fast rate of fire, and can be very powerful and deplete shields quite fast. This weapon is quite similar to the Plasma Pistol. It is best at short-to-medium ranges. It is dual-wieldable.
The Needler. The Needler is a very powerful weapon that shoots pink needles. They are capable of doing lethal damage when shot for enough time. The needles are also semi-homing. The Needler has a fast rate of fire, and can kill enemies quite quickly. It is best at short-to-medium ranges. It is NOT dual-wieldable, as it was in Halo 2.
The Beam Rifle. The Beam Rifle is the Covenant equal of the Sniper Rifle. They are mostly the same, however, there are some noticeable differences. Instead of shooting bullets, the Beam Rifle shoots beams of energy. The Beam Rifle cannot reload and has a limited amount of shots before it must be discarded. It can also shoot two consecutive shots in a row, at the cost of temporary overheat. It is best at long range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Carbine. The Carbine is a semi-automatic weapon that has high accuracy and shoots beams of energy. It can zoom in and be potentially deadly when shot at the head. It is best at medium-to-long ranges. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Gravity Hammer. The Gravity Hammer is an extremely powerful melee weapon. It is feared by all because of its 100% lethality at close range. It can also deflect a rocket. When an enemy is hit with this weapon at close range they will either be pushed back or killed. This weapon can only be used at close range. It is not dual-wieldable. Its location should be memorized on every map.
The Spiker. The Spiker is a weapon with a fast rate of fire. It is a very good weapon to use to beat down enemies. This weapon is best at short-to-medium range. It is dual-wieldable.
The Brute Shot. The Brute Shot is a very powerful grenade launcher. Because of its power, this weapon can kill enemies very fast. It can also, in a few shots, destroy vehicles. It is best at short-to-medium range. It is not dual-wieldable.
The Mauler. The Mauler is a small weapon not unlike the shotgun. It is less powerful but smaller. It can kill enemies quite fast when dual-wielded. It is best at short range. It is dual-wieldable.

Flash your Xbox 360.,
Acquire your games.,
Patch the .iso file.,
Ensure that you have a compatible DVD burner installed in your computer.,
Get quality DVDs.,
Download DVD burning software.",How to Burn Xbox 360 Games onto DVD Discs1," Your Xbox should be flashed with the latest version of the iXtreme LT+ firmware. You can either do this yourself or find someone to do it for a fee. It involves opening the Xbox, identifying the DVD drive manufacturer, connecting the DVD drive to your PC, and then installing custom firmware onto the Xbox DVD drive. This will allow your Xbox to play backup DVDs.;
, To burn a game, you will need the .iso file that is created when the disc is ripped to a computer. There are two main ways that you can get an Xbox 360 .iso file: you can download the .iso from a source online, or you can make a backup from a physical disc.


The most popular way to download .iso files online is to use a torrent client and tracker. You can find .iso files for nearly any game using torrents. Be aware that downloading games that you do not own is illegal in most areas, and even downloading games that you do own is frowned upon and could land you in trouble. See this guide for details on using torrents.
You can create your own .iso backup files from physical discs if you have the right software and hardware. You will need an IDE Kreon DVD drive (SATA will not work). If you don't use the right drive, your backup will likely be corrupted or won't work at all. You will also need a program called Xbox Backup Creator, which can be found on various Xbox modding sites. When using Xbox Backup Creator, simply insert the disc into the Kreon drive, select ""Complete Backup"", and click Start.
Xbox 360 .iso files are typically around 8 GB in size.

, The .iso file must be ""stealth-patched"" in order for it to work correctly online after being burned. You can do this using a program called ABGX, which can be found on most Xbox 360 modding sites. Make sure that you are connected to the internet while running ABGX 360 so the latest verification files can be downloaded.


In the ABGX Options menu, check the two boxes that say ""Check/Fix Video padding"" and ""Check for AnyDVD style game data corruption."""" In the AutoFix menu, select ""Level 2"" for the AutoFix Threshold. In the Region menu, select your region (NTSC/U for North America). Save the settings using the File menu.
Click File → Open Input and open the .iso file. Click the Launch button at the bottom of the window. A new window will appear with a readout of the patching details. The patching process will take a little while to complete. If you see the messages ""Stealth check passed!"" and ""AnyDVD style corruption was not detected"", then the patching process was successful and you will be safe to play the game online.
ABGX will create a .dvd file alongside the .iso file. You will need this when burning.

, There are essentially two types of Xbox 360 games: XGD2 and older, and XGD3 games, which use a newer form of copy protection. Only specific DVD burners will be able to create working copies of XGD3 games.


The LiteOn iHas Revision B burner is the highest recommended burner for copying XGD3 games, though several other models work as well. The DVD burner must have an MKT chipset in order to copy XGD3 games.
The Sony Optiarc 5280S-CB-PLUS is also able to burn XGD3 games and is able to do so right out of the box (no firmware modification needed).
XGD2 games do not require any particular model of DVD burner. Higher quality burners will lead to more successful copies.

, Burning newer 360 games pushes the disc to its physical limits by writing data further to the edge of the disc. Having a high quality DVD will reduce the number of bad burns you get.


Be sure to get Dual Layer (DL) DVD+R discs. These have a capacity of 8.5 gigabytes.
Verbatim brand discs are the most highly recommended, as they are the least likely to fail during the burning process. Any disc that is DL and has a capacity of 8.5 gigabytes should theoretically work

, Any image burning software that supports .iso files and is compatible with DL DVDs will work. There are many freeware burning programs available online.

"
"
Insert a blank DVD.,
Open your DVD burning program.,
Press the burn button.",How to Burn Xbox 360 Games onto DVD Discs2," Ensure that it is a DL DVD +R and that it has not been used before.

, Load the .dvd file that was created when you stealth patched the .iso file. Set the Write Speed to 2.4x. If you set it to burn too fast then the chance of a corrupt copy goes up.

, The burn process will take some time to finish. To make sure that you get an optimal burn, do not allow your screensaver to start while burning, and close as many running programs as possible.

"
"
Insert a blank DVD.,
Download and install BurnerMAX Payload Tool.,
Open your DVD burning program.,
Press the burn button.",How to Burn Xbox 360 Games onto DVD Discs3," Ensure that it is a DL DVD +R and that it has not been used before.

, This freeware program allows your burner to surpass the 8.5 GB limit of a DL DVD and actually burn 8.7 GB, which allows you to fit a full XGD3 onto a disc.


Run BurnerMAX before starting the DVD burning software. Click the “BurnerMAX” button and wait a few seconds. You should receive a message saying “BurnerMax is Enabled.” If you do not receive this message that means that your DVD drive is not compatible.
If you insert a new DVD or restart your computer, you will have to run BurnerMAX again.

, You should see that the maximum capacity of the DVD is now 8,738,897,920 bytes. Load the .dvd file for the game you are copying and set the Write Speed to 2.4x. This is especially important for XGD3 games, as the chance of failure is much higher.

, Make sure that you do not have any extra programs running, and that the screensaver will not start during the burn process. These are all much more critical when burning XGD3 games. The margin of error is very slight, and any hiccups during the burn process will lead to an unusable game.

, Execute this by moving to a narrow area, where the driver/pilot can't shoot or splatter you; in other words, where a vehicle can't fit. Make sure you either crouch or limit your movements. Then, use the radar to detect the vehicle's movements. The driver will most likely try to scope you out and come closer, if he/she is inexperienced.

, While the driver/pilot is unsure of your location, stick it with a plasma grenade or spike grenade. If those two grenades aren't available to you, quickly pop out and hijack the vehicle (if he/she is in range). The driver should be vulnerable at this point, leading to an easy kill. You could also stay behind a corner and hijack the vehicle if you wish to.

, After you get enough money, start at the forward bunker (the one with the hole in the wall).

, The wise thing to do is make it a trap, as the hatch on top of the bunker can be opened by hitting it, shooting it, or the less noticeable way, throwing a bubble shield onto it. Set up a turret of your choice down the hallway by the hatch, and block off the first hallway right next to the big hole in the wall.

, Spawn a second sniper rifle, and some grenades (firebomb and frag. are best). Then, for an even better view of the beach, spawn a portal and then go on top of the roof of the tower and spawn another.

, Remember, there is a small opening on one side of the base were someone can crawl through a pipe into the base. Block the hole and they won't get in. Towards the back of the base where the ghost is, there is a catwalk. Use crates to make a wall so nobody can get in. Set up turrets in high places, be creative, set them up on the top of the control room next to the big missile launcher, and on the little spot behind the control panel for the gates.

,, Line the gauss warthogs and tank, then use any barriers and pallets you have left over to put in front of the vehicles for protection.

, If the other team somehow gets in and destroys all vehicles, you need a place to regroup with your teammates and plan a counterattack. A few good places for this are inside the cave by the beach, up on the high area by the beach, in the inner part of the bunker, and if you are by yourself, in the pipe.

They are of a brighter colour than their purple, normal Wraith counterparts and can be be quickly identified by their tell-tale anti aircraft guns which shoot into the sky.;
, If you eliminate them, the Wraith will be much easier to attack and approach.

, This can be done by shooting them with a sniper or beam rifle aimed at his head. The carbine or battle rifle are also effective, although it may take significantly longer to kill the gunner by this method.

, The Wraith is easiest to jump onto from behind, since the driver will be unaware of your presence and if you have eliminated all other enemies in the area, then you should have no problem staying on once you've jumped up.

, You can find it on top of the main vehicle - make sure you are aiming with your cross-hair at it to melee that exact spot.

Block the doors and set up bunkers in the big base to make a fortress.",How to Confuse and Conquer in Halo 3 Sandtrap," There are several areas to set up traps where they are not easily seen.


Some of the most common ones are the gravity-lifts, the small bunkers, and little hiding places where you can set up and wait for an opponent to drive by.;
,


If you choose to set up a trap in one of the bunkers, use fusion coils and fill it up until no more can be put in. Set up a sniper spot from where you can see the bunker, and when an enemy comes stumbling by, shoot next to them so they go into the trap and then shoot one of the coils to cause instant death.

,


They should be positioned in such a way that the first portal is the only accessible one and the others are in high areas where no one can reach them.
Once they go into the first portal, they go through the rest, thinking they will end up somewhere better.
That is when they come to the last portal, out in the middle of the desert, where the guardians make short work of them.

,


Make it such that the enemy spawns are next to a useless vehicle, like a mongoose or the ghost.
Then, on your side of the map, set up tanks and walls so that the unsuspecting enemy doesn't know what to expect.

, A warthog with correctly positioned barriers takes up to four shots with a rocket launcher to destroy. Place Gauss warthogs in unlikely areas to dominate with the cannons.

,


Both the players should switch to monitor mode
One should lift a scorpion tank high up into the air.
The other player should spawn a fusion coil and set it on the tank while it is in the air.
Then, just move the tank and the fusion coil will spawn and fall every 30 seconds unless you set the timer (preferably 10 seconds). Just repeat all over the map and you have random fusion coils falling from the sky onto people!

, Leave one door open, but set up a turret there to can run off anyone who may try to enter through there.


One way to build a bunker is to spawn a barrier, tip it over and set up a machine - gun turret in it.
Tanks are very useful and make a huge difference in a battle. To catch the enemy off - guard, put a Warthog or a tank in the base so when they get in, they get killed by the cannons.

Have a Plan B - if it's too dangerous or difficult to board the ship safely, or if it looks like you may fail, you may just have to destroy the vehicle.",How to Board an Enemy Vehicle in Halo 3," Vehicles which can be boarded in Halo 3 are Mongooses, Choppers, Ghosts, Warthogs, Wraiths, Scorpions, Banshees, Hornets, Prowlers and in some campaign occasions, Anti-Air Wraiths. In the Halo 3 campaign, Scarabs can also be boarded, but can be accessed like any other terrain feature rather than selecting a certain option to board it, and the same goes for Elephants in multiplayer. If any of these vehicles have enemy players in them, then they can be boarded if you have enough skill and timing.;
, If you need a ghost and a player is tormenting your team in one, then you may consider boarding it. However, attempting to board a Scorpion tank in the middle of a field when they know you're there may be a bit tricky and not worth your efforts. Whatever you decide, do it before the vehicle causes too much damage. In most cases, it may be more fruitful to simply destroy the vehicle instead of capturing it.

, If you have time, view where the player drives the vehicle, where would be a good spot to attack and what you will need to use to complete the task. However, it is more likely you will have very little time to act, so seize opportunities when they arise if you haven't got time to create a plan.

, Do it fast before you lose your window of opportunity.

, Others, such as the Mongoose or the passenger and gunner seats in the Warthogs, you can only enter the vehicle without harm to the driver, although you may then proceed to attack him from then on.

, Nothing can ruin your chance of boarding a vehicle more than if you get killed by the enemy or you arouse suspicions. Find a place where the vehicle frequents, such as a confined driveway or path, and wait. Carry a shotgun or power-weapon for safety to ensure you don't die before boarding.

, It may be a while before the vehicle returns so just be patient and remember it's for a good cause. However, if it looks unlikely that the vehicle will return to the spot or if your absence if costing your team too dearly, be prepared to abandon your plan. Consider trying to attract the vehicle to the area if you are desperate.

, Whatever it is, you've got to move fast. You'll know it when you see it.

, Run as fast as you can to the vehicle, making sure the coast is clear and trying to stay in the vehicle's blind spots until the last possible moment. If you are seen, then you risk getting splattered, shot or lose your chance so be careful.

, A message will appear in the top right-hand corner of your screen prompting you to board the vehicle. Holding the Right Bumper constantly can save you missing the opportunity to board, since sometimes the prompt will only be available for a split-second.

, When you board a vehicle such as a Ghost and Warthog, or flying vehicle, the driver will be ejected but dazed (meaning he cannot move fast or jump), so it will be best to eliminate him while he is vulnerable so he cannot re-board you. However, when boarding a tank or wraith, you can only board the vehicle to plant a grenade, but the driver will not be ejected. If the tank or wraith isn't too damaged, it may still be able to be driven. If the vehicle has passengers, you will have to deal with them too, but it will probably result in failure or the vehicle being destroyed.

, If you've managed to capture the vehicle and eject all its previous occupants without dying you can now use the vehicle to simply drive off (or fly off in some cases) and use it for your own uses. Make sure the enemy cannot re-board you as you will have wasted all that time.

, It may be hard since you've spent all the work, but if you can't have it, then what's the point of letting them keep it?

This applies to both rockets and sniper.,
- If you catch rockets or sniper and stay still for 2 seconds, they will not be delayed.

,
- If you stand on the respawn of the weapon, look at the clock for 2 seconds after they hit the ground, they will not be delayed when you pick them up.

,
- If you catch the rockets or sniper and keep running, when you stand still for 2 seconds is exactly when the weapon respawn timer will begin again.

,
- If you have a sniper rifle (say, the 12:27 one) and ""catch"" the ammo from the 9:55 one that will not dirty it at all.

,
- If you dirty the weapon off of spawn, when you die is when the clock will start for the respawn of that weapon.

,
For example, say I catch the rockets off of spawn at 11:56 and run until 11:32 then stand still until 11:30, the rockets will respawn at 8:30 instead of the normal time.",How to Become MLG Worthy in Halo 3," The Battle Rifle is the most powerful weapon in the game if used efficiently, despite what other people say. Mastering the Battle Rifle brings you much closer to become a pro.Four shots, with the fourth ending in a head shot is a kill. in MLG settings damage is at 110%, so you only need 11 out of the 12 bullets in the burst to kill.;
, Even though the Battle Rifle is the best weapon in the game, there are more weapons that you must be decent at to become a pro. Examples are Sniper\Beam Rifle, Mauler, Plasma Pistol, and the Covenant Carbine.

, You have to learn the trajectory, power, and efficiency of both of the grenades. Trying to kill someone with a ""frag"" grenade at close range will not help you one bit. Chuck grenades into rooms that your enemies are in to lower there health so you will have more of a chance on beating them.

, The Hardest part of being a pro during a match is being double teamed. Throwing at grenade in between the assailants will make them run in different directions because it is highly unlikely if a grenade is throw that they will run in the same direction. The point is to try to scatter the assailants or you might not have much of a chance. Or you could try to put as many shots on them as you can and call them out so your teammates can help you.

, The Plasma Pistol, and the Covenant Carbine are both very good weapons. The Plasma rifle an take out shields very quickly, the Plasma Pistol takes out shields (and overshields) with its charged shot, it also can stop a vehicle completely like a Ghost or a Warthog or even a Mongoose!(Although there are no vehicles in MLG) The Covenant Carbine is more ammo efficient but not quite as strong as the Battle Rifle.

, Look Sensitivity allows you to turn at different speeds, be able to shoot more accurately and comfortably on the setting right for you, and overall be a better player. Try ""3"", the default to start out with and go up one notch every 5 matches or so. 90% of the pros use 3-5 sensitivity, but some use higher or lower.

, One of the most important and useful functions in Halo would be the melee. You are not becoming a pro any faster by trying to hit someone 2 feet (0.6 m) away from you. An especially good combo to use with the melee is the Plasma Pistol (drains their shields) then punch them out. You can also shoot your opponent two times with the Battle Rifle, then beat them down for the kill.

, This is a very ""fun"" and deadly tactic to implement into your gaming. One example would be sneaking up on a guy in a confines space and throw a grenade in front of them. Their obvious reaction would be to back away from it and go straight towards you. Another example is to run away from an assailant, turn a corner just to have another guy there to kill him as soon as he walks in.

, This is a very effective strategy, by sticking someone, first, they're going to die no matter what and if your shields are down just stick the attacker.

, Jacking or Skyjacking vehicles is a perfect way to take out large vehicles that are obliterating everyone on the map. if you skyjack a Banshee you have now become a powerful player, you can kill everyone so easily. Using or jacking vehicles is the best way to win a match and rank up!(Although there are NO vehicles in MLG)

,: Of course all the weapons in Halo 3 are deadly, but the most potent thing in a team's arsenal is communication. If a teammate is in trouble, or one teammate notices the whole team bunched together and you are holding a rocket launcher, communication can be very helpful there.

, Using Crosshair Placement is the art of simply learning to aim by looking at where the crosshair is at by the enemy (i.e. You are in a BR Battle with someone and you don't think just shoot. With crosshair placement, you analyze where to put your crosshair and when it should go there.

, Learn strategies for different maps and game types, E.G Construct, King of the Kill. When a bottom hill comes up, you should have one person in Close Purple, Sword, In the Hill and either up Top Gold or Open purple. It is important to remember that there are lots of different strategies for different things, Camo strat, OS Strat etc.

, A common misconception on Halo 3 is how weapons are ""dirtied,"" meaning that their spawns are delayed. I'll first start this by saying that no, standing where they spawn will not delay them, and letting them hit the ground before you pick them up does not mean they will not be delayed.

, The weapons need to stay completely still for 2 seconds in order to prevent them from being delayed. What this means is:

,,,,,, The rockets will also be delayed the rest of the game, therefore the spawn times would be 8:30, 5:28, 2:26, and so on, unless someone dirties them more. Same thing would apply with the sniper.

, Get a power weapon, put him in your sights, and pull the trigger. Right after you kill him teabag him repeatedly. Repeat this step until you get booted.

, Use the first scope for medium range, the second scope for long range.

, When shooting at a target, aim for the head as much as possible, as this does more damage.

Swing carefully around the cheese planet until you reach its underside.,
Swing very sharply out when you reach the bottom of the shaft leading to the centre of the level.,
Place your worm on the ledge with the weapon crate once you have entered the centre of the cheese planet.,
Use your pneumatic drill, and drill down into the ledge you are standing on.,
Select and deploy Armageddon from your inventory.",How to Complete Level 30 in Single Player Campaign on Worms 2: Armageddon," It is the last, non-purchasable campaign level you have to beat in the single player campaign.;
, You must get through the map to the crate at the centre of the cheese planet. Unfortunately, you don't start with any weapons, but you can unlock some by collecting the three crates available on the level. There are two sentry guns on either side of the planet under two ledges, guarding the two utility crates. Of your three worms, two have 1 health each and one worm has 30.

, As this worm only has 1 health, it will die, but at the same time, it will collect the utility crate, containing a pneumatic drill, for your other worms to use.

, This worm will need to destroy the sentry gun on this side - to do this, simply jump off the ledge about halfway between the oil drum there and the edge so that you land near enough to the sentry gun. Your worm will take falling damage, blow himself up, and if you're close enough, this explosion will knock the right sentry gun off the level into the water below.

, Since there is no sentry gun there, this worm will not be killed. The utility crate will give you a ninja rope, which you will need for your next step.

, You will need to carefully swing around the outside of the cheese planet until you are directly below the central core. You can begin by either launching your ninja rope at the satellite to the right of the planet and swinging back to the underside of the planet, or by abseiling down the planet's side until you reach the bottom. Whatever the case, you will need to swing carefully and make sure you don't hit any terrain when you are swinging, as this will knock you off your rope.

, Do this by pressing A on your Xbox 360 controller twice in quick succession while swinging in a forward motion, all the while making sure you are as high up enough from the water below so as not to drown, but low enough so as not to hit the terrain and drop off. You will need to take extra care when you reach the very bottom of the level, as you will only be swinging a very short distance from the water below.

, You will need to swing out and then press A again very quickly - ideally when you do so, your ninja rope will latch onto the top of the shaft and you will be able to rappel upwards to the centre of the level. If you instead latch onto the sides of the shaft, try reversing your rope and 'bouncing' up to the centre, or by swinging out once again and hoping you latch onto the top of the shaft this time.

, This weapons crate contains the Armageddon weapon. Don't be tempted to set it off yet however, as you will be knocked into the water as well unless you follow the next step.

, This will place you at the bottom of the cheese planet and out of harm's way for when you set off the Armageddon weapon in the next turn.

, This will rain burning meteorites down on the level, throwing most of the enemy worms in the water and killing the ones which aren't. After they are all dead, you should receive 1,000 gold to purchase items with at the worms marketplace. Congratulations, you just completed Level 30 and the single player campaign!

Melee Kills.,
Check your scoreboard every fifteen seconds unless in a battle.,
Running the flag.,
Last but not least reserve Rockets, Sniper, and Plasma Pistol for Slayers and supports not for yourself.",How to Become a Better Objective Player on Your Halo 3 Team," Learn to utilize the Mauler CORRECTLY. If you can figure out the MAXIMUM distance you can shoot the Mauler and it still causes a good amount of damage to the opponent you can do your job correctly. The Mauler has the same lunge distance as ""punching"" with the Gravity Hammer. The infamous Mauler Beatdown combo is your greatest asset when rushing the flag, hill or ball. When playing against people that know how I play when they find the Mauler they waste all of its ammo. When you grab the Mauler you should scare your opponents into doing the same thing.;
, If you don't know how to check the scoreboard hit select. When you do this a literal scoreboard will appear showing who is left standing who is down and how many points each team and individual has. When playing objective based game two or more enemies down = go for the main objective. two or more allies down = drop back into a safe area and don't rush the objective unless two or more of the opponents are down as well.

, This does not mean pick it up and charge. This means pick up and drop the flag then immediately do it again. You get a speed boost for this and it confuses the opposing team if your team can successfully pass the flag between each other. You can run with the oddball to get into safe areas but you will NOT gain time.

, You will get into close battles so Rockets and Snipers are rendered useless. The Plasma Pistol only works for supports because they should be in hiding while still hitting the opponents. The only weapons an Objective player should carry is the Mauler, BR, and as a LAST RESORT the carbine.

Know the map or maps you are playing on, where the weapons spawn, where to walk and how to get from A to B.,
Know where you spawn, and as a result, where your opponents are likely to be.,
Pick up effective weapons for a 1 vs. 1, such as the sniper rifle or beam rifle, which are invaluable for their close range and long range capabilities.,
Stay close to valuable secondary weapons, such as the needler, battle rifle and carbine, which also have good close and long range capabilities.

,
Stock up on grenades, specifically plasma and spike grenades.,
'Camp', or basically stay in a well fortified location, making the enemy charge you where you can hopefully defend against them more easily.,
Learn advanced moves to kill your enemies.,
Be aware of your opponent's movements and weapons - if you can, learn how to sneak up and surprise them without being seen and take opposite weapons to counteract theirs, such as a battle rifle to attack if they have a shotgun.

,
Be persistent.",How to Be Good at 1 vs 1 on Halo 3," If possible, try to get your opponent to agree to play on a map you are very familiar with, thus giving you the upper hand.;
, You can predict their strategy if you have a good grasp of the maps. On most 1v1 maps, there are only two spawning areas.


For example, in Guardian, if you spawn at elbow, you will know that your opponent spawned bottom blue. He will either go towards you up the sniper lift or he will go up to yellow lift.
Elbow is the better spawn for the beginning of the game. It is better because you can get the sniper right away, your opponent will most likely go snipe lift which leads to an easy out BR for you right away 1-0, and you can get nice map control. Use sniper to get him to one shot then pull out that BR for an easy finish.

, Other power weapons such as shotgun or rockets are also effective and the sniper/shotgun combination is very powerful in this form of the game.

,, Sticking your opponent is extremely useful in one player duels, especially as a last-ditch effort to take your opponent down with you if he is about to kill you.

, If you have a shotgun or sniper rifle, this is a good tactic, but if your opponent has explosive weapons such as rockets or grenades, then limiting your time in each spot may be a better option.

, Although anyone can get a kill, you'll need to out-think and out-play your opponent to win. Throwing a grenade and shooting with your battle rifle is a good move for example. Pick up all the tricks you can so that you have a good chance of winning.

,, You may lose, but you'll earn the respect of your peers if you put up a good fight and play it through, rather than conceding an early defeat.

Start off by playing Lone Wolves.,
Get a good friend or a well known player to play with you in doubles.,
Avoid Playing With Randoms.,
Remember to follow the rules of thumb for Halo 3.",How to Become a General (Lvl 50) in Halo 3," The easiest play list to get a general ranking is in Team Doubles. Unless you have a great group of four players, you should play Double Team. You can play with a friend or not but playing with one is highly recommended.;
, Most circumstances in Halo 3 require you to kill your opponent(s). Since objective based game types are mostly not in Double Team, you should learn how to kill They do appear close to 1/3 of the time though.

, Not as a warm-up but as a lesson. It will teach you how to roam alone and how to deal with 1v1 battles (or more). You can use what you've learned in Lone Wolves and apply it to Double Team. Think about it, if you can defeat 5 other people by yourself, how hard will it be to defeat only 2 people with a teammate?

, Learn each others techniques, strategies, and just become one with your teammate. It sounds a little stupid but it is proven that people who work together, win together.

, Randoms are when you play alone with others you don't know, most the time they never talk and stink. You can communicate with your friends and setup with them. Don't have friends? Try going to mlgpro.com or bungie.net to find someone.

, Finish off each others kills, get map control, communicate, and try not to stress too much over a video game.

Get into the action!,
Be ninja-like.,
Use the sword well by examining the situation.,
Use grenades profusely.,
Learn your melee distance.,
Take advantage of situations.,
Use your team effectively if you have one.",How to Be Effective in a Swords Match on Halo 3," Although you may save your lives by hiding in some obscure spot on the map, you will never win a swords match or be a good swords teammate if it's a match of team swords. So find a prominent spot on the map where other players are and get into the fray, but be smart about it - don't just run in without checking who's behind you or stand in a spot where people can easily ambush you. Basically, don't just hide away but make sure that when you are in the open it's a secure location.;
, You'll be most effective in a swords match if you can surprise your opponents. This may include jumping down on others from higher ground or attacking from behind corners. This is particularly helpful if drawing everyone's attention and fending them off isn't working for you - although you may not get as many kills as simply using your skill with the energy sword in the open, attacking stealthily may suit you better.

, If an opponent is a certain length away, preferably with his back turned, using the Right Trigger is a better option, causing you to 'lunge' forward and kill him. However, if the opponent is closer or can see you, the sword's melee is a better option (press the B button on your Xbox 360 controller) as it is faster than the Right Trigger option, although it will not move you as far forward. Most players use the melee option in combat situations.

, Although other players may complain, grenades are invaluable in swords matches, especially if they are thrown from a distance. If you see several players in a sword dual, throw a few grenades and you will probably pick up a few kills. If enemies are close then grenades aren't the best option but if you think you're more likely to stick someone who is lunging at you than cancel him (done by using your sword at the same time he makes contact), then throw a grenade and hope to stick him. Spike and plasma grenades are more effective than frag grenades in swords matches.

, Being effective in a sword match depends on how good you are at judging your attack distance. Attack to soon and you'll have no effect and leave yourself open to a counter-attack. Attack too late and your opponent will have already killed you. You'll get used to it over time, but it'll take some practice.

, If you see several players fighting in amongst themselves, then consider attacking a few from behind. You will probably get a few kills, although they will probably dislike you for being sneaky.

, In team swords matches you need to utilize your team correctly to have any chance of winning. This may come in the form of having team mates grab an opponent's attention, then run away to get said opponent to follow them only to run into more enemy team mates. Or having someone help you if you're in a difficult sword duel. Generally, never leave your teammate's side. You are far likelier to win a game if you show good use of your team.

Realize that many Halo 3 players are immature.,
Know how to face off a teammate who wants your sniper.,
Know how to control the one on one battle.,
Take a gun off the body of someone who's just died - any gun, even if it's not much better than your original one.,
Once you've killed someone who was annoying you, don't teabag them - that only brings you down to their level.",How to Beat Those Annoying Halo 3 Players," These are the kind of people who scream ""PWNED!"" into their microphone, so don't let them get on your nerves.;
, The sniper rifle is arguably one of the best guns in most games, and so an irritating player may camp by the sniper spawn point. Occasionally, one of these players may team-kill you for your gun, so keep an eye and ear out for them.

, This is the formulaic showdown between two players (of equal shield) running directly towards one another, usually firing their assault rifles. The formula goes=run towards, fire rifle, melee, hope for the best. The rifle is really the key stage. Aim for the head constantly with the assault rifle and move in a zig-zag towards your target to make aiming harder for them.

, The sight of you taking away their former sniper rifle/shotgun can send your target round the bend, and it's twice as effective without the complimentary teabag.

, Instead, simulate a shaking head by moving the analog stick from side to side. Not only is this ten times more condescending than teabagging, it's also a lot more satisfying, and the victim will soon be frothing at the mouth trying to kill you and do the same thing to your corpse. But don't worry if they do manage to kill you and reenact the head shake - it's unlikely to satisfy them in the same way.

Know the rules and where the key points are located in the game.,
Get accustomed to the style of play.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Know when to use your weapons.,
Be tactical.,
Use your team.,
Use the ball wisely.,
Retreat if you have to.",How to Be Effective in a Grifball Match on Halo 3," The bomb, or ball, is located in the middle of the field and the goals are at either end. Every time the ball is planted onto one of those goals, the scoring team wins a point. The team to reach the point limit first wins. If you can master these few rules of the game, then playing will become a lot easier.;
, A Grifball match is a fast-paced and fun game played with gravity hammers and energy swords. When you are holding the ball, you are significantly faster than the other players and have extra over-shields. You can jump a lot higher as well, but you have a forced waypoint so that everyone can see you.

, It's easy to find enemies have surrounded you or that the opposing ball carrier is nearing your goal, so be vigilant and try to keep an eye on the action at all times. Use your radar, other team member's warning and your own wisdom to keep up with the play.

, If you are chasing the ball carrier, then selecting your energy sword is far more effective due to their enhanced over-shields. But if you are fighting normal players, then your gravity hammer should suffice. Make sure you get your timing right when attacking, or you could be left in a vulnerable position.

, At the beginning of the match, it is likely that both teams will try to simply run into each other and grab the ball. Consider, however, going around the sides or deploying some other tactic to secure the ball for yourself. Anyone can swing a gravity hammer or chase after a ball mindlessly, but to win, you'll need to employ every ounce of tactical thinking within you and utilize it.

, Nothing is more important in a match of Grifball than team work. Make sure you all have working microphones and can communicate clearly. Some players should go for the ball and ball carrier, one should stay behind to protect the goal and one should try to loop around behind the enemy team to disrupt play. This, although but one tactic for a team, is an effective one. If you have the ball, team work needs to be flawless.

, On the rare occasion you get the ball, you need to make sure you maximize it's potential. This means using your enhanced speed, shields and lowered gravity to out maneuver the enemy. At this point, your team will become invaluable in getting you to the goal, so keep close to them and use them to distract or kill the enemy.

, Don't throw your life away by charging aimlessly at the enemy line. Wait for others to spawn or regroup before launching your next attack. If you have the ball, consider retreating behind your allies also in order to form a new plan of attack. You'll know when you should retreat, so do it before it's too late. You never know when taking another look at a situation can open your eyes to a new opportunity.

The number one rule you need to know is to never stop moving.,
Find a weapon worthy of headshots.,
Find a location that can serve as a ""Sniper's Nest"".,
Be aware of your target's movement.,
Aim ahead of a moving target.,
Carry a few grenades with you just in case your enemy gets close.,
Be prepared to defend yourself against anyone who comes too close.",How to Be an Effective Halo 3 Sniper," A good sniper will only take one shot before moving to a new location. If you stay put after taking a shot-especially after hitting a target-you will be easier to track and kill.;
, The SRS99D Sniper Rifle and the Covenant Beam Rifle are the choice selects. These weapons have multiple zoom function and are relatively common.

, These nests are usually in higher places with plenty of foliage, rocks, and other natural objects used to conceal you. A good sniper position can see vast distances of the map. All this allows a sniper to kill without being killed. And as said before, keep moving. A well-seasoned sniper will scope out multiple sniping posts before taking his first shot.

, When he/she jumps, shoot near the feet or where the head will be after they land. When your target strafes, look for a pattern or a break in the movement. If a target is trying to make a speedy getaway in a vehicle, you need to adjust your aiming speed according to that of the vehicle. When you see an opportunity to fire, take it.

, This slight difference will account for where your target will be in a second. When they are in a vehicle, you have to aim further ahead than normal.

, A few sticks and your free of opposition. On the plus side, if your target has discovered your position, simply move to another location with a bead on your past spot. More than likely your enemy will return for revenge.

, As said above, grenades are good for that, but a close range weapon like a shotgun or assault rifle would be better suited in case you run out. Carrying a bubble shield or regenerator is also wise.

Know where the hill spawns.,
Get an offensive and defensive weapon.,
Plan your route.,
Get grenades.,
Use your team, if you are playing in a team King of the Hill match.,
Assault the hill from a good vantage point.,
Collect power-ups, such as the camouflage and over-shields.,
Take advantage of situations.,
Keep moving!",How to Be Effective in a King of the Hill Match on Halo 3," If you have no idea where the hill will spawn or move to you will have very little chance of being any better than your opponents. To get the edge on your enemy and win the game you'll need to know where the hill will be every time. Play King of the Hill custom games whenever you can and watch where the hill spawns and moves and record it down if you need to. Every map has a different rotation system so take note.;
, When attacking the hill, offensive weapons such as brute shots and rockets are excellent to clear the hill quickly, while once you control it, defensive weapons such as shotguns and Energy Swords are vital.

, If you know where the weapons on the map are and where the hill will spawn, you should be able to plan an effective route to reach the weapons and assault the hill before it moves. Consider letting the first hill go if you can reach the rockets, shotgun or sword and they're near where the next hill will spawn. Remember, it's a thinking match, not one of brute strength or just skill alone.

, Quite often lobbing a few frag grenades into the hill from afar can stop opponents getting too much of a lead and if you are about to lose the hill, plasma grenades can be invaluable to make sure your enemies can't get it either by sticking them. However, do not go out of your way to get them - instead pick them up on your way to either a power-weapon or the next hill spawn. They will not win a game for you alone.

, Don't just have everyone go straight for the hill, but have a few go for weapons to make sure you can secure future hills. Only one person needs to go to secure the first hill - getting the weapons you need is much more important early on in the game. You may also consider having one player go only for weapons and attacking the enemy rather than assaulting the hill.

, It is easier to attack it from higher ground and if you couple this with a power-weapon, then you will have a good chance of clearing the hill before you enter it. Before assaulting, make sure you are clear of where all the players in the hill are - there's nothing worse than thinking you've cleared a hill and having someone else who was hiding kill you from behind.

, They will help you tremendously when assaulting or defending the hill so if you can find them on your way, use them.

, If two players are killing each other in the hill, shoot a rocket or a grenade their way and you should be able to take the hill easily.

, Even if you are in the hill, don't sit in one place as you will be vulnerable to being stuck or getting hit by a rocket. Move in and out of cover in the hill if there is any and defend it until it has moved or you die. Always be aware of who's coming to try to take it from you and leap out to take them by surprise.

Decide to become a ninja.,
Obtain the full Hayabusa armour set along with katana 'Scout Head' Rouge head or Recon head can also be used.,
Equip the Hayabusa armor and katana 'scout' rouge or Recon helmets by changing your current armor from the Start menu.,
Practice on campaign before moving to multiplayer as the enemies are easier to kill and hide from in the campaign levels.,
Know ninja weapons - although their main weapon is their fist (so become familiar with the B button on your Xbox controller which allows you to melee), the energy sword is also a good choice.,
Crouch everywhere unless it's to kill an opponent.,

Attack silently.,
Assassinate!,
Move on.,
Avoid vehicles and never drive or ride in one except to board it or destroy it (primarily by sticking it).,

Practice practice practice!,
Change your character's gamer icon to the ninja picture to complete your ninja transformation.,
The use of frag grenades as smoke bombs and the use of flares.",How to Be a Ninja on Halo 3," You'll probably get very few kills in multiplayer until you learn to perfect your art, but you can gain great satisfaction in the long run from killing your opponents like a true ninja. It will take time to get results, so be prepared to wait.;
, The Hayabusa armour can be unlocked by finding all hidden skulls in the campaign (excluding the blind skull copy on Cortana), but the katana can only be unlocked by obtaining 1000 gamer score from Halo 3, i.e by completing all challenges and achievements listed in Halo 3's achievements list.The scout recon and/or rouge head/s look like ninja masks too, so try to mix and match with all 4.

, Never change it again, not even for team SWAT, where players usually swap their character to Elites to avoid headshots from behind. Wearing it is often seen as a sign of diligence and skill, as getting the katana and armor is not the easiest task and will take some time. For more information on the Hayabusa armor, see its page on Halo.wikia.com.

, When you feel you are ready you should move to multiplayer.

, At a stretch, magnum pistols may be used, but primarily for hitting the opponent or Gravity Hammers, although they make a lot of noise to alert your opponent. Grenades, especially spike and plasma grenades, are an ideal support-weapon for your activities.

, The ninja's role is to kill without being seen, and crouching hides you from your enemy's radar. Although you move slowly whilst crouching, you will be able to sneak up on enemies without being detected.

, Nothing aids your art more than dark areas and objects to hide behind. Consider practicing on your own in Custom Games and Forge sessions by finding ways around and through maps where you will be well hidden. Take the time to also find your own hiding spots where you can wait for prey.

, If you can do it safely without being seen, jumping is a good option. It will take a bit of skill to jump up to hard-to-reach places or onto small objects without falling, but learning skills such as the double jump or crouch jump will help. Grenade jumping should be avoided unless entirely necessary.

, Ninjas kill their opponents silently and without being detected. Wait until you are close to the player, or preferably above if you are on a ledge or high terrain feature such as a wall, before launching your attack. Finish them off quickly before they can react. If you time it correctly, they will not even have time to fight back.

, The true ninja attacks their opponents from behind, so when you can, sneak up behind your opponent to melee them on their back. One shot and they cannot fight back.

, After killing someone, never ever stay in the same place. Move on, or anticipate where your opponent will come next, such as if you killed them in one corner, move to the opposite one so you can kill them again when they come back looking for you.

, Ninjas move on foot.

, Try to stay near the power-up to help your chances of winning.

, It'll take a while to master the art of sneaking up on your opponent and the ways of the ninja, so practice a lot! The more confident you feel, the more you can be a ninja in multiplayer and in turn, the more multiplayer kills you will get.

, It can be changed in the same place as your armour from the Start menu.

, This is a great way to make your escape if there are too many people aiming at you

Jump!,
Find high ground or any elevated area which over looks the map.,
Use the terrain and map to your advantage.,
Aim at your opponent's feet.,
Throw grenades, especially if you are reloading and your enemy has no shields.,
Learn when to fire and what scope to use.,
Stand away from walls - normally a rocket fired straight at you will fly past, but the wall will explode the rocket on impact and thus kill you.,
Keep moving - don't be tempted to camp in any one spot, even if it is an elevated position or well fortified structure.,
Take advantage of the situation, such as when there is a large group of people jumping around.,
Find a secret hiding spot, if you must.",How to Be Effective in a Rockets Match on Halo 3," Jump a lot! Jump around corners, jump over obstacles - just jump whenever you can. You are a lot harder to kill while you are jumping and enemies will have to have the foresight to shoot where you will land, by which time you should have aimed him up as well. It makes you more obvious to other players, but in the end it the rewards will pay off.;
, It is easier to kill a player from above than it is from below. It is easy to rack up quite a few kills from a high spot before the enemy deems you a big enough threat to remove you.

, Any grav-lifts or man-cannons are simply gold in rocket matches - you are very hard to kill whilst moving on a man cannon or grav-lift but you can still kill other enemies if your aim is steady. Corners are also excellent to use to your advantage - you can jump out and surprise your opponent before ducking back into cover.

, It will be very unlikely you will hit them directly on the body, so learn to aim for the enemy's feet which should kill them or at least take their shields off for your second shot.

, A random, long range grenade can also work wonders once in a while, but don't expect to win with grenades alone.

, If you see an enemy hiding in a corner, anticipate when he will exit or if your enemy is jumping around a lot, learn to dodge his rockets and shoot while he is closer and reloading. Never scope in when the enemy is in close to medium range, but if you are far away, and there are several opponents around (or if they frequent that area often) scope in and fire a few well placed shots.

, Always stay at least three body lengths away from walls when you can.

, All it takes is one long-range rocket to ruin your streak. Find the best places and rotate between them, never staying in one place for too long.

, Shoot straight away before someone else does. Aiming up your shot for too long will probably result in someone else getting your kills and/or killing you while you aim.

, If you can get your hands on a Grav Lift, you can hide in a tube in the High Ground area. There is also one on the Snowbound area; hide in one of the corridors, and when somebody walks down the aisle, fire the rocket, throw a grenade, and run. Be careful not to kill a teammate, though!

Have a 'mic' for communication.,
Find a group of players you know and can have fun with.,
Make sure that all of your team is on your skill level, or that they understand you are not on their skill level but are trying hard to get there.

,
Start with playing in Team Slayer, something like an MLG playlist can be much more difficult and need even better teamwork.

,
Make a plan.,
Listen to the players around you and be aware of your surroundings.,
A key strategy is using ""callouts"" these are just simple names for areas around the map for quick reference.,
Listen to your teammates callouts, even if you do not believe them or they are wrong.,

After games, whether they are wins or losses, be sure to talk about it with your team.",How to Be an Effective Teammate in Halo 3," One of the most crucial steps in being a teammate is having a mic to talk over Xbox Live. If you don't have a mic it is almost impossible to be an effective teammate.;
, If you're having fun and can talk casually with your team you will perform much better.

,,, Talk with your teammates and decide on a plan of action. Plan things like what areas of the map you want to control and where each member of the team needs to be to achieve control.

, Otherwise you will frequently caught off guard, and killed as the dismay of your teammates.

, Ex: ""They have two guys in red base!""

, It really is better to be safe then sorry, especially in a tight game.

, Find who on your team is the best snipers, slayers, and supporters are and embrace your rolls. If you are not strong in close quarters combat, DON'T RUSH at the other team.

, Go over what you did well, what you did wrong, and ways you can improve as a team.

Find a tall, perfectly vertical wall and stand at the bottom of the wall looking up.

,
Throw a plasma grenade up along the wall and stand below it.,
Try to make the plasma grenade land on you - basically you are trying to stick yourself with your own grenade, so you will need to anticipate where it will land.,
Enter editor mode as soon as the grenade sticks to you.,
Find another player, preferably an enemy in order to maximize the damage you will cause.,
Move in close to the intended victim and press UP on your D-Pad to re-enter player mode.,
Repeat and show your friends how to be a kamikaze Oracle too.",How to Be a Kamikaze Oracle in Forge on Halo 3," The Forge can be accessed between the 'Custom Games' and 'Theater' options on the Halo 3 main screen. Any map will suffice, but preferably one with some kind of walled structure.;
, Sometimes the host of the Forge session can block others from using editor mode, so if this has happened, make sure he lets you use it.

, If there aren't any, create a few by entering the Forge object menus and placing them on the map.

,, Try to throw it so that the grenade 'skims' the wall as it goes up so it is basically right above you.

, This may take a few tries, so be patient. Crouching may increase your chances of success since you have a larger area for the grenade to stick on.

, You must be quick on pressing UP on your D-Pad to enter editor mode before the grenade explodes on you. Once in editor mode however, the grenade will not kill you until you exit editor mode again. You may function as normal in other respects however.

, Finding one which is unaware of your presence or of what you are doing is even better, as they will not know what hit them.

, You will explode instantly from the plasma grenade which you stuck to yourself and hopefully kill the person you were next to (or at least give them a fright if you weren't close enough). It will count as suicide, but you will get the kill point if you manage to kill the person you were next to as well.

, It may get boring if everyone continues to do it, but it will keep Forge sessions exciting for a while.

Learn the vehicle's interface.,
Don't delay!,
Work efficiently with your driver and passengers.,
Look behind the car at all times (if possible) when there are no enemies around - the driver will be able to see the front and you'll be able to cover the back, so between you, you'll have every area covered to spot enemies.,
Keep shooting at all costs.,
Aim right at enemies.,
Stay with your car at all times.,
Maintain contact with your driver.",How to Be a Good Vehicle Gunman in Halo 3," If you wish to be a gunner, you have to approach the area of the vehicle where you can do this (For example, the back of a warthog) and you will be prompted on the top right-hand corner of your screen to enter the vehicle using the Right Bumper. Sometimes the prompt doesn't appear, but you can still enter.;
, Nothing annoys a driver more than having to wait around for a gunner to get on, so if you want to be a successful gunner, learn to hop on instantly so you can both drive off and start killing. This is particularly helpful in hectic situations where you are under fire and need to move.

, In most cases, the driver's word is final - if they say to shoot left or right, then they probably have spotted a serious threat that needs eliminating so unless you're shooting at a guy with a laser or missile pod, turn where ever the driver says. Try not to tell him to back around if you've missed an opponent as they'll most likely be expecting that, so let the driver do what they have to. Over time, you'll create a code or understanding between you and your vehicle co-occupants.

, If you are driving in a wraith or scorpion, keep looking forward to finish off those kills the driver missed with the main gun.

, It helps keep the gun ready for action and can sometimes provide a lucky kill if you happen to pointing in the right place. However, if you are trying to launch a sneak attack or remain hidden, refrain from shooting as this will give away your position.

, There's nothing special you have to remember - if the enemy is in sight, and especially if the cross-hair is red although it doesn't always have to be, then just let the gun do its work and try to keep with the target for as long as possible. This can be hard if the driver is moving erratically, but it should get easier over time. Different guns have different powers and firing rates, so learn how to use each one.

, Nothing will kill a driver more than if you suddenly jump off - he'll be defenseless and very angry by the time they re-spawn. More than anyone, it is your job to go down with the vehicle, unless of course you can both do it safely and without hitch.

, Remember, if your driver sees an opponent and you're facing the other way, the only way you can know is if they tell you and the same goes the other way - if you need him to slow down so you can pick off a close enemy, tell him. Communication is vital.

, Every time you quit a game in progress 1 experience point is deducted from your total and you receive no points for the game you just quit.

, If you betray them, there is a high chance they will opt to boot you from the match and you will again be deducted 1 point and not receive one for the match you were booted from. Often, if it was an accident, apologizing will stop the person you betrayed from booting you.

, If this happens, even unintentionally, you will count as having quit the game and receive the according amount of experience loss.

, Getting angry and quitting or deciding to betray someone who has annoyed you can be avoided if you remain calm while playing. If you keep getting killed, hide instead of quitting and if someone is playing loud music, mute them instead of betraying them. This will save you getting experience penalties.

, These weapons increase the chance of you betraying someone and thus getting booted due to their large blast radius. In addition, trip mines are extremely volatile and if you don't communicate with your team, they might just walk into one.

, If you play within the game's rules, it is unlikely you will experience any penalties.

, Don't run or take extreme evasive action, but rather just slowly walk away. Giving them any attention will only bring more torment, probably in the form of tea-bagging or voice messages.

, Show no emotion and do not fight back (quite often they will boot you if you betray them back). These types of gamers are seeking attention and power and if you simply ignore them, they will go away.

, In Halo 3's multiplayer, team mates can, in most cases, only betray you once before the game gives you the option to boot them. If they kill you once then they will most likely not do it again in fear of getting booted. Only a determined trouble-starter will continue to betray you.

, If the person tries to betray you and there are enemies around, if he kills you it will almost certainly be attributed to the enemy and you will not receive a chance to boot the person betraying you.

, You can only boot someone in Custom Games or Forge sessions. If you are not party leader, ask someone who is to boot the player or ask to be made party leader so that you may then do it yourself.

, Again, they win if you give them a reaction. If you are no fun to betray, they will most likely move onto another member of your team which may not have a problem betraying them back and risk getting booted.

, This will lessen the chances of you meeting them ever again, but remember, it's not fool-proof.

Trip mines are just another piece of equipment which you can use in both the Halo 3 campaign and multiplayer, so they work the same way as bubble shields and the like. Walk over an unarmed trip mine to pick it up, and press X on your Xbox 360 controller to use it. If anyone walks near it or shoots it, it will detonate. In addition, it will self-detonate in 90 seconds if it has not been set off. They will also detonate or just plain ""disappear"" if too many are placed on the map (mostly happens in Forge as in multiplayer there is no way someone would leave a trip mine ""untripped"" long enough).;
, Although only the multiplayer maps Avalanche, Rat's Nest and Sandtrap, and the campaign level Tsavo Highway, have default-spawning trip mines, they can be bought and placed on any map when editing in Forge, so use them as much as possible. Try to see how close you have to be to kill an enemy and where the best places are on a map to put them.

, The key to placing effective trip mines is keeping them well hidden. When you place them, they beep loudly and flash with an orange glow, making them easy for enemies to find, avoid and even use against you if they shoot them. Try bouncing trip mines off walls, so that they land upside down, thus hiding the glowing light, or hide them around corners or on ledges so that enemies won't see them until it's too late.

, Trip mines detonate no matter what after 90 seconds, so be sure to place them in an area which is well frequented by the enemy team. Cover doorways and important areas with them to deter and kill enemies. If there is a special weapon or vehicle on the map, consider placing a trip mine beneath it, or even place an active trip mine where the trip mine spawns, to fool opponents.

, Trip mines have a larger blast radius than rockets and grenades, so they are perfect for taking out enemy vehicles. Place trip mines where you think vehicles will go, or drop one down quickly if one is about to splatter you.

, Throwing a trip mine down on someone followed by a grenade will kill almost anything, so don't forget to take advantage of enemies weakened by your trip mines. A quick burst of a battle rifle or carbine will finish off any stragglers who didn't die in the explosion.

, Nothing is more annoying than players sitting in a corner with rockets or a sword, or in a bubble shield. However, use this against them - sneak up and throw a trip mine where they stand; they will either have to move or shoot the trip mine and risk dying from the explosion, or stay trapped until someone kills them. Throw a grenade into the area and job done. Trip mines thrown into bubble shields will almost always end with a detonation, killing your opponent and the blast will be contained in the bubble shield's walls. Trip mines can also be placed to deter any campers from reaching a vital spot on the map.

, Trip mines are the only equipment which are actively deadly - they will just as easily detonate when an ally walks over it as when an enemy does, so if you're placing one down, tell your team. If a teammate does set it off, then it will count as a betrayal and may result in you being kicked from the match. Because of this, be sure to only use trip mines when you are playing with friends, or when everyone on your team has headsets to minimize your chances of getting booted.

, Trip mines can be used as an alternative to grenade jumping and can also be used to overload maps and create traps in Forge. Experiment a lot and use them whenever you can and you'll be a master of the trip mine in no time. If you place a trip mine in front of a wheel under a vehicle it is effective.

Play test your map profusely.",How to Make a Good Infection Map on Halo 3," Medium to large levels are excellent for building infection maps on - maps such as Foundry and Sandbox are intended for Forge usage, while others such as Avalanche, High Ground, Standoff and Valhalla are perfectly sized for infection matches. However, if you want a cramped, close-quarters infection game, then maps such as Blackout, Guardian and Orbital might be for you.;
, You can do this by pressing the START button while in Forge and toggling the game mode to infection. This will allow you to access infection-based objects to build.

, Do you intend to have invincible zombies who move slowly? Or vulnerable zombies who move quickly? Will they be invisible or have rockets? Depending which combination of infection game types you intend to use on your map, the way you build it should reflect this, so decide early on.

, For infection games, you will probably want to remove all objects from the level and begin building your own map. However, if you're strapped for time, or if you like a particular part of the existing map, you might consider simply adding to the default map. Maps with all the scenery removed can be downloaded from other users or online.

, Be clear about where people will go, spawn, get weapons, hide and the general layout of the map early on. Start building the main buildings or areas of the map first to get the general feeling for the level. Consider drawing it out on a piece of paper first so you don't forget where things are supposed to go.

, There should be areas where the zombies find it hard to get to so that the humans may defend it, and vice versa with areas only infected can jump to in order to attack the human team. Use walls and other scenery pieces to increase the height of areas only zombie should reach, and use tubing or walls to cage them in tunnels or rooms.

, Especially with infection games where both sides are moving at high speeds to reach hiding spots or defendable positions, you need to make sure that there are no places where people can get stuck and not get out. Avoid making people have to double jump or grenade jump to access areas, as this can make gameplay annoying for newer players. It really does pay to spend that little bit extra making sure that everything is lined up perfectly.

, Add some high levels to allow for defense, or some areas where it's tight to make for a scary gaming experience. Adding teleporters in your level can add some interesting scenarios, as well as adding other features such as man cannons and shield doors.

, Unless it's a vulnerable and hard-to-defend area, avoid placing too many weapons in one place as this will make it near impossible for the zombies to win. Try spreading weapons out evenly, placing less powerful or harder to use weapons in well defended positions, and place the most powerful weaponry in exposed places so players must take risks for greater rewards. Gun turrets are always a favourite for infection games.

, Nothing is more boring than having a map where players can defend themselves against the infected indefinitely. Make sure that players have to leave well-fortified areas to get better weapons for reload. Make sure there are at least two ways into every area, typically one which is harder to navigate, but more rewarding. In the end, your map should make your players take greater risks for greater rewards.

, Make sure that both zombies and humans have starting and respawn points (humans are considered the ""defenders"", while zombies are the ""attackers""). Change a spawn point's side by accessing its' properties and changing it to either an ""attackers"" or ""defenders"" spawn points, although you can make it neutral if you wish. You want to place zombies in areas where they can easily rush out to attack human defenses.

, Add some fusion coils and barrels, or any other piece of scenery which can spruce up the empty areas. Adding these can add that extra professional touch to your map.

, More than any other type of map, infection maps need to be play tested a lot to make sure that it is fair to both sides playing. Try it out with a lot of different variations of infection games and with lots of people, carefully noting down which areas need improving and which work well. If players are drawn to one area too much, but never to another, consider putting something worthwhile in that area to attract players. Listen to what your friends say to make your map better.

Be patient and time perfectly.

",How to Use Active Camouflage in Reach Effectively," This means that it isn't wise in general to use it in an open map, for instance ""Hemorrhage"" doesn't give too much cover to recharge.;
, It is the most predictable thing to do when enemies know you have AC. When you camp you might get a few kills before you get flushed out by, grenades, a crowd, or power weapons.

, Almost everybody thinks that AC is for campers. To be nearly invisible you need to move slow, so you need to move a lot if you want a safe recharge and be untraceable.

, The radar jammer AC generates a lot of blips on the radar, but they don't move gradually like you want to do with AC and by crouching you avoid getting on their radar. Even when you don't use AC at the moment keep crouching, because you never know who's around the corner or camping.

, Don't use it when nobody is in radar range because it will drain precious energy to use. Only use it when an enemy pops up on the radar so you have optimized use of AC in combat.

, It may confuse the enemy. When you activate AC, keep track of which blip is the real enemy to keep in mind. This may be difficult with two or more enemies, so you may want to practice.

, And I'm not talking about constant changing routes, but in combat. The radar jammer gives away that someone is near and most players think that users of AC hug walls and hide in corners. Stay in the open, that is what they won't see it coming.

, Be successful in eliminating enemies with AC. After a while in a match with AC in game, most players will eventually vow to kill you with AC. Don't let that happen, because you want to make sure that there is only one king in the arena.

, When you see a jammer entering the radar, activate yours instantly. This will confuse them a lot.

, When you use AC many times, you might already know the boundaries of the jammer. But if you don't, try to imagine a rough circle where the blips never go out, then locate the center of the circle because that's where your enemy is located.

, Use a perfect mixture of hugging walls, standing in the open and standing still to you liking.

Watch out for plasma grenades.",How to Use Armor Lock in Halo: Reach," Sometimes people use it randomly because they think it looks cool, or some other illogical reason. This will just quickly drain energy you'll need in a battle that might be around the corner.;
, This is because if someone has a Ghost, they most likely will try to splatter you. So if this happens, activate Armor Lock and destroy your opponent.

, For example, use AL when you see a Scorpion tank looking at you. Within milliseconds they are probably going to shoot at you. Or if you see a Wraith take shot at a plasma mortar use AL when it gets close to you. Plus, you will get a medal and CR's for it.

, When you know you're going to lose the fight, use armor lock to delay it just a few seconds longer. This may be enough time for your team to arrive and help, or it might help you think of an escape route.

, When you exit AL, an EMP blast erupts, size of it depending of how long you use the ability. The longer you hold it, the bigger it gets. The EMP disable vehicles and shields, giving you a quick melee kill. When you exit when an enemy vehicle passes, the EMP might hit the vehicle, leaving it vulnerable for attack and/or hijacks.


If you're fighting someone and he or she is very close to you, go into AL and come out of AL in one second; when you come out of AL, an EMP blast will take out an enemies shields if they are too close!

, When you stall too long enemies will just move out of range so their shields won't be disabled and you will be an easy target. When you enter AL, try to exit quickly as possible. The enemy will be vulnerable to the EMP blast and your battle-winning melee.

, When you see a vehicle trying to run you over, don't jump but enter AL. When you make contact with the fast-moving vehicle, you'll destroy it and get the splatter kill instead of the enemy. This also works when an enemy with an Energy Sword lashes at you: the force of the sword pulling the holder towards the rock hard armor, will collide and splatter the user.


If someone is shooting at you and you activate the AL, then most of the times the enemy team that is near you will stop and watch you until you come out of it, which gives your team a few seconds to do the objective.

, When you're stuck by a plasma grenade, or you're being shot at with a Covenant weapon, you'll deflect the projectile. This might hurt or even kill opponents near your area.

, When you exit AL all moveable objects will be blown back by force. You might you this to your advantage by positioning a vehicle on a safe spot.

, In AL, do not lose sight of your opponent and keep the middle of your screen at him. Then, when you exit, you'll turn extremely fast at the spot you were looking at. This makes enemies prey to plasma grenades or CQC-weapons.

, When they enter AL, just walk backwards and pick them of at a distance. Another option is to throw a Plasma Grenade underneath them and if timed correctly, the user will die. You could also call your teammates over to get a much easier kill.

, If you get stuck with a plasma grenade, use your AL. Not only will this protect you from death, but will also shred the plasma grenade from you. In rare cases, when you shred the plasma grenade it will fly back at the thrower. You get a medal and CR's.

Get a Plasma Pistol from a Grunt or Jackal, then go back to the river. If you look up, you will see a Falcon flying around above you.;
, Upon doing so, the Falcon should get shorted out. Now the Falcon must land upside down, because the pilot will disappear and leave it free for you. Otherwise, it will just take off again.

Be aggressive.,
For both Infected and Spartans, Watch your surrounding like a hawk.,
Keep this in mind for yourself too.,
Be a good sport.",How to Get Better at Infection Matches in Halo: Reach," Using the Magnum up while there are still people around to protect you will get you more points as long as you go for headshots (headshots are worth more points than regular kills.) Another advantage is that you save your powerful shotgun until the end of the round, which will be more useful at that point because of the higher population of zombies.

, One mistake many people make, is to follow the rest of the group to one popular camping area. This is not good. Usually the zombies will send a few people to the exits of your spot (example: the gravity lift on Sword Base) and attempt to flush you out. On the other hand, if you keep moving you will keep the zombies running around randomly. This effectively separates them into smaller groups, making them easier to take out.

, If you make it to last man standing, moving around will be absolutely zero help. If your the only one left, the zombies can now see a marker on their screen showing your position. This is now the appropriate time to camp. Experiment to find good hiding places using Forge or 2 player Xbox Live matches with a friend. Eventually you will find some little ledge or cliff that you can walk along or hide behind that makes you harder to reach or surround.

, Always save one of your two evades for emergency escapes or dodging underneath a bullet. Remember to keep a fair distance away from your ""prey"" as it takes you a small amount of time to readjust your weapon after evading.;
, Though you might get killed a fair amount of times before you get the hang of it, being aggressive is very useful. Use erratic movements to keep the Spartans guessing. Or even jump off a ledge that the Spartan thought was inaccessible. But mainly, surprise and aggressiveness will get you far.

, Many players love using flaming helmets, bright or dark armor, or other noticeable cosmetic changes. This can be to your advantage as, depending on the map, it may stick out like a sore thumb!

, Try to vary your armor colors, such as using darker colors that are blended with brighter ones. This will give you more variety and sometimes help you stay inconspicuous. Also, avoid obvious helmets and shoulder gear. Those flaming helmets may look cool on a FireFight match (where the AI knows your location anyway)but it can be a curse in multiplayer battles.

, Don't pass the time smacking your teammates in the back and then crouch and move away like it wasn't you. They may just decide to leave you under attack from zombies or talk to the others about booting you out of the match. Getting booted out of matches enough times could result in temporarily being banned from multiplayer matches of any kind.

, Bloom is a new feature in Halo Reach. This makes it doubly important to keep your reticle on the target, even after you've shot. You need to wait until the reticle goes back to normal to ensure your shot connects.

, This is vital for dispatching foes effectively. It takes five body shots and one headshot to polish off an opponent, so it's better to hold your DMR at head height.

, Stay at a distance. Your DMR has a range advantage; keep it that way. Also, try not to scope; it should be easy enough to headshot anyway with the DMR.

, If you're a serious gamer, and have a TV for gaming, go to level ground and aim your reticle at a team mate's head. Then, get some clear plastic, put a dot in the middle, and stick it where your reticle is now. This will allow you to go to headshot height easily.

Strafe. This is a really important key to not dying quickly; in most situations, keeping on the move will keep you alive for longer, especially in an encounter.
Fists. Melee attacking your opponents is amazingly powerful in any Reach game mode. However, it's obvious that you can only use this when close to an enemy. The downside to this is that it takes a second to attack and to wrap your finger around your gun's trigger again, so use this sparingly.
Frag Grenades. Many players believe that plasma grenades are better than their human counterparts because of their ability to stick to enemies and their vehicles. But fragmentation grenades are actually notoriously useful because of their bouncing nature. You can get them to bounce around corners if you use them well enough.;
, In many situations, running headfirst into the center of the battlefield leaves you as a very open targets for snipers and anyone with DMRs, Magnums, Rocket Launchers, or just about anything. However, if you feel it is necessary, and even then only if you're absolutely sure, then go ahead. Just remember, you probably will not survive the trip back. If you do, then you are a good Halo player with a lot of luck. Either that or all the snipers are asleep.

, Too many people don't know about the amazing side-effect of crouching; whilst crouching, you are invisible on any enemy's radar. Crouch when hiding or camping to surprise your opponents and have a better chance of survival.

, Camping is when you hide in a small, concealed space to ambush enemies who come your way. This isn't the world's greatest way of surviving with enemies able to snipe through doors or respawn knowing where you are. But if you think you've found the perfect camping spot, then go for it, but only if an enemy hasn't seen you. Just remember; doors are a camper's worst enemy and best friends. Also, once you've killed somebody by camping, then move to another spot. Otherwise, they will respawn and know where you are.

, The enemy's using a bubble shield? Go inside it, armour lock for a second, then release. The EMP will break the bubble shield. Also, if you are right next to an enemy when you release a well-charged armour lock, it will break their shields. Charged plasma pistols also do this job quite well. Also, bubble shields will restore your health when inside them.

, Ignore this one too often and you will soon be nothing more than a splodge of dead, rotting meat on the floor. Use this one too often and you will soon be nothing more than a black scorch mark on the ground. If the enemy has some pretty heavy firepower on their side, then find some cover and crouch behind it. However, the enemy can lob Frag Grenades if your position is too open, so be cautious.

, Never go on your own unless you’re some major superman shot gunner who can somehow reload very quickly within the last minute of a round… Oh dear, are you out of shotgun shells? Press Y to switch to Magn--OH DEAR, you now appear to be a zombie. Ah, well. Better luck next time, eh, old chap?

, You get booted, negative player reviews, complaints filed against you and more. Also, never take revenge on a team killer. Simply file a complaint and give them a negative player review. However, do not do this unless they deliberately kill you more than 2 times during one game whilst on your team.

, As if a very large step no. 10 wasn’t boring enough, then get this; there’s more. You’ll need to get acquainted with your weapons, whether you’re a first timer or a regular, practising around with weapons in single-player Firefight is never really a bad idea. Veterans who have been around since Halo 3 or earlier will probably have already played a million online games and absorbed much of the firearms information by now.

, Chucking a human grenade the moment before the die gives you a good 50-50 chance of getting a kill from beyond the grave, depending on how well you aim it. Of course, dying people don’t really tend to have time to aim a grenade throw, but if you have a spare just before death, then use it. You just might get lucky.

, Two blue Spartans with assault rifles. Don’t even try to kill one; many players will know that they will die, so they’ll charge for the closest one to try to score a kill before the other one kills them. Some people get lucky and do so. Some people have the Covenant gods on their side or something and in an amazing stroke of luck manage to kill both. Most people just get killed before they get to the target. Three blue Spartans against this red, and he’ll be dead shortly after coming out of cover.

, The true heroes of Reach are not the players who get the most kills, but the most assists. Whilst a one-man-army is impressive, a completely dedicated team player is a far more admirable when you think about it.

, Alright, this one will most likely get you killed, but if you can sacrifice yourself for or just assist a teammate who is fast losing a battle against somebody on the opposite team, they will really come to like you very quickly.

, And another thing; there’s no such think as ‘stealing kills’. Whoever accuses you of that is rightfully a noob themselves, and they’re still jealous because all you did was beat them to the punch.

, This is one of the rare exceptions to the ""no such thing as stealing kills"" rule.

, There’s nothing that online players hate more than a constant jabberer. Only speak when required or when holding conversation. In fact, if you’re holding a conversation, it would most likely be better to have it in an Xbox Live Party instead; it will disturb the other players less.

, Every armour ability is good in different situations. For example, for medium-range assault rifle combat between you, a bunch of your teammates and a bunch of the enemy, the bubble shield is quite useful. It heals, protects and provides temporary cover for you and your team. The active camo is good for infiltration and sniping. The armour lock is handy for assaults and defending key objective points, such as a flag stand or capture point. Armour lock is also handy when getting splattered. Go into it right before someone tries to run over you. The impact will either destroy their vehicle or send it flying into the air. Sprint is actually a surprisingly good armour ability, enabling you to get right back to your squad after respawning and letting you helping you get to and assist dying team mates much faster if you’re close by. Evade also does this job, but it will get you there a few seconds slower. However, it also allows you to quickly move out of the way of an enemy trying to splatter you with a vehicle. Finally, the hologram is amazing at confusing foes. If you and some squad mates are pinned down by heavy fire, then send out a hologram to draw enemy fire and start on assaulting them as they look the other way.

, You don’t aim down the sights of a fully automatic weapon here; that’s reserved for your Magnum, your Sniper Rifle and a few Covenant weapons. Also, there is no ‘second chance’ where people crawl on the floor. If you double-check a person’s dead body, chances are that you’re going to get shot by an enemy looking to avenge their teammate’s death.

, It’s good to look in your Halo: Reach manual and/or experiment with weapons in single-player Firefight to see which weapons work best at different ranges.

, Everyone has equal shields (and mostly firepower, too). Even skilled players cannot take a dozen foes at once alone, even with a Gravity Hammer.

, Use this to kill the other player before they slice/pummel you. Also, for taking down and enemy holding the bomb (a.k.a. Grif), use your Energy Sword. Just remember that other enemy players will soon be rushing to their’s Grif’s aid, so be quick and watch out for his fist. Also, Grif has shields, and the Gravity Hammer’s shockwave will only kill players will no shields, e.g. players who are not Grif. Be careful.

Try to run around and shoot duck, jump, use special ability's, and try to Forge a training map (trust me it will work).


If you have a hard drive, look for obstacle courses on the file browser to practice on and get target practice. It helps a lot.
When playing on matchmaking, there are so many hiding spots on every map. So look up hiding spots on the internet.;
, If you look on the bottom left of the screen, it says the place that you are at. I refer to them as call outs. Just make sure you know them so when a person from your team dies in an area, he can say where he is at and rescue will know where to find him.

, They help you when you are in danger. If you have a sniper rifle and the ability hologram. Use the hologram in a tower, kneel down inside of it and the other team will get tricked and shoot the wrong thing. If you are lucky, you could get a clear shot at them!

, If you lose, it's okay. Play again. It's not the end of the world. Remember your training and keep your calm. Don't get mad if you lose. it only makes you worse.

, If they are '1337' players don't ask them; they'll just go and steal your kills and show-off.

, By now you should know how to handle these situations. Pretend its almost real. Avoid getting killed(when you play online you'll see how this helps).

Remember that when you die, you are giving someone else a kill.,
Choose a play style that suites the playlist you are playing.,
Know that strafe and shot plays a major role in your game play.,
Play the game types you want to improve.,
Never give up.,
Always know when you are at an advantage and disadvantage.",How to Win More in Halo 4," You never want that. So try to find your combination of passive and aggressive play style. A good way to do this is maintaining map control. Staying in a certain area of the map isn't camping. Hiding in the corner with a shotgun is. For example on Haven, you want to stay top Mohawk so you can pick if foolish foes rushing top mid or charging with an assault rifle. You also have plenty of cover.;
, In a 4v4 team slayer game, you would want to stay with teammates mainly, trying to flank, and holding map control. In rumble pit, you will want to find out where the crowd is located and finish of people who are weak, and steal kills. No one will call you a bad player. If someone does, it does not matter, because you beat them. In a big team battle, you would want a medium to long-range weapon, as the DMR is perfect. Stay behind cover and run with purpose. If you are running in the open, make it quick. You are highly vulnerable in the open. Keep the high ground so the head is easier for you to see other enemies, and be able to see their heads for easy 5 shot kills. Remember to always stay alive.

, Aim with your feet, not your hands. In other words, move your player side to side and try to match your opponents strafe. Use your arms for tiny adjustments. This tactic allows you to have a higher sensitivity with good accuracy. Use the map to your advantage, stay behind cover so you know who is shooting you, and you will be able to counter their attacks. Peak shooting is when you shoot and quickly duck under cover, pop your head up and shoot, and than duck under cover again. This is useful in mid to long range; it is useful because it lets you maximize your time behind cover while dealing damage to your enemies. To do this, you must peak at your enemy and duck down, not moving your retinal, than get up from cover, fire, and immediately duck back. Practice this in the swat game type to perfect it.

, For example, if you want to get better at rumble pit, don't be playing flood. Play with people with the same goals as you to get better at Halo 4.

, This is important because when you rage, you don't think correctly. This leads to poor decision making. You will get nowhere in Halo if you do not think. So stay calm. A good tactic to staying calm is drinking water. This can lower blood pressure, so you don't panic. You are going to die almost every game. You watch the kill-cam and they miss every shot, and somehow kill you. Note that the kill-cams in Halo are vacuous. (Dumb). Try to catch ones play-style and Strafe. If an enemy is holding high ground, don't try the same tactic over and over again on him if it isn't working. Try something new, but in a situation like this, find some other enemies to kill and avoid that player who has the advantage.

, Some examples are when your opponent has a rocket launcher, and you have a standard load-out weapon. You have a disadvantage. You should not engage them in combat. However, if you have the high ground, or if you are in the air, go for it. The rocket launcher needs to hit a wall and kill you with splash damage. RARELY does the rocket actually kill you with itself. If you are forced to engage, run up to the rickets as close as you can and land a couple of shots on him, when he fires the rocket you will die, but you will take him down with you. It will be a trade.

Place an obstruction between you and the vehicle.,
Strafe.,
Dodge it.,
Immobilize it.",How to Avoid Being Splattered on Halo Reach," Make a mental note if there are drivable vehicles on it, and if the players in your lobby are reckless drivers.;
, If there are currently no vehicles, or you can confirm that they are otherwise destroyed or occupied, advance with confidence.

, If you see a vehicle coming, locate cover, quickly. Watch them if they are closing in on you.

, It's kind of hard to splatter a player who keeps dancing around a giant rock.

, If it is coming straight for you, do your best to lurch to the side.

, Depending on the vehicle, you can jump over it, walk past it, board it, or even outrun it.

, Use a Plasma Pistol to temporarily power it down. Proceed to either board or destroy it.

When you are playing SWAT use the DMR.,
Don't bother shooting someone in the chest.,
Keep your gun in headshot position.,
Turn up the volume.,
Don't let rank discourage you.",How to Be Awesome at Swat on Halo Reach," Overall it's a better weapon to use.;
, One shot to the head will end your enemy and save ammunition.

, It's easier to get a headshot if the gun is all ready at head level. When you are standing on level ground look at a teammate and put the crosshairs over their head. So when an enemy walks in a room, you only need to look right or left to kill them instead of split second adjusting. Some people put a dot on clear plastic and place it at the center of their TV.

, Doing this will help you hear footsteps, deep breathing and gunshots, which will tell you if an enemy is nearby.

, Many people have a lot of time to play Halo and rank up, but that doesn't mean they are all that good. They have only played longer than you have.

Beat the Campaign.,
Learn the maps.,
Choose your weapon.,
Drive!,
Stealth Stealth Stealth!,
Eliminate enemy special units.,
Be aware of what is around you.,
Remember it's just a game.",How to Be Good at Halo 4 Multiplayer," Doing this will show you the ropes, and get you used to completing objectives alone (minus a few marines). You should try to beat it on at least Heroic, or if you are new to Halo, Normal with a few skulls on. Also, the story is quite interesting, if you like cinematics.;
, This is essential to success. Go to Forge and fly around like a redneck on a dirt bike. Learn every tunnel, hill, and vantage point. (Note: there are 2 types of map, Big Team and Regular. Big Team has vehicles, Regular doesn't. Here is a list of the default maps. Big Team: Exile, Ragnarok, Longbow, Meltdown, Vortex. Regular: Adrift, Complex, Solace, Haven, Abandoned.

, Want to spray tons of ammo at enemies? Or would you rather make every shot count? Halo 4 has a variety of weapons to use, such as the Light Rifle or Battle Rifle. You probably have used these in Campaign, and also you can get additions like jet packs and auto-turrets. Make a class for every situation, like sniping or base capturing.

, The best part of Halo is going on a rampage in a Scorpion or a Banshee. Go into Forge and spawn some vehicles, and learn to drive all of them.

, Running through the centre of the map will get your head blown off. Stick to the edges, and only go into the middle if your team is charging, if you're near a powerful vehicles, or if you are closing in for a kill. Never stop moving; still= stiffed.

, Sometimes a guy in a Gauss Warthog will completely destroy everyone. Anti Tank: eliminate the gunner from a range, but be careful the driver doesn't see you. Use the Plasma Pistol to disable the Scorpion by holding down the trigger. Once it is EMP 'd, swamp the tank. Anti Sniper: Keep an eye on which way the sniper's victims fall. If they are hit from the back they will fall forward. Opposite for the front. Find the area he is in, and clear it with an automatic weapon. Anti Mantis: EMP it, and fire at it hard. Anti Banshee: EMP it, and focus fire on the cockpit. Anti Warthog: Stick it with a Plasma Grenade. Anti Wraith: Same tactic as Anti Tank. Anti Mongoose: Shoot the driver who thought driving that piece of junk was smart.

, The tables have turned, and you are pwning! Tank: Stay away from enemy spawning areas, or you are dead. Always have a gunner to deal with hijackers. Sniper: Shoot at cockpits, always. When taking out strong units, shoot once, count to 12, then shoot again. Stay in the shadows, and try to get the ""Awareness"" ability. Banshee: Never fly downward, unless you are sure it's safe. Always be boosting, or performing tricks. Warthog: Always be moving in a circle around the map. Wraith: Same as anti tank. Mantis: Use your machine guns on troops, rockets on dangerous units. Mongoose: Only use them over short distances, then get off.

, Although it is very fun, school/work, physical activity, and being social are more important.

Crouch.,
Choose good Loadouts.,
Generally stay back from the battles and be patient.,
Adapt.,
Observe.,
Have fun and don't rage.",How to Be Good at Halo 4," Crouching makes you invisible on radar so is an excellent option if you want to disappear with the Energy Sword or stay back with a DMR.;
, For example: fast reloads and unlimited sprint work well with the Assault Rifle and close quarters combat. If you have done the rogue specialization steady aim works well with the DMR or Light Rifle.

, You may get a lot of assists, but you will live. Even the pros don't do to well at the close quarters where everyone is shooting you. However, if you have a shotgun or other powerful weapon, sneak around the outside of the battle taking out any enemies blindly charging in.

, If it's a medium range map like Haven then the Carbine is a good rapid fire weapon. Long range maps suit the DMR or Light Rifle better. Also if your enemies are camping with a shotgun a DMR might not work. Neither will charging in with an Assault Rifle. The Boltshot is your best shot, or lure them out with a grenade then back up with an assault rifle. You can try the Plasma Pistol DMR combo. If someone is wasting you with a sniper rifle, go stealth and Assault Rifle at close range will most often win with a well timed grenade to throw off their balance.

, People are very predictable. Watch how they play and learn to counter it. A good trick is people often don't slow down, so if you see someone coming on the radar throw a grenade before they walk through the door, or corner, etc. then finish them.

, It's hard, but it doesn't help. Stay focused and win those battles.

For Flood, pick any armor ability.,

Jump around.,
Hide.,
Have fun.",How to Be Good at Halo 4's Flood Mode," You do not want to start with the Hardlight Shield. It is useless against Flood because it is very easy to sidestep.;
, Put a couple shots in the Flood to get a kill or an assist to get you more points.

, Here is a good list of camping spots for almost every map.


Abandon: Spawn spot by lift for LMS (Last Man Standing) or middle of map by lift for kills.
Adrift: By the pillars at the end of the hall.
Complex: On roof in the middle of map or in room below roof.
Solace: In bases by spawn spots.

, This step is tricky. The Flood has super high jumping and lunging, but also can use Thruster Pack or camo. Be sure to get your timings down!

, I know everyone says this, but the more you play, the better you'll get.

, Don't run in the middle of the map or take out your pistol in close range or you will die. Have self-control unless you are going for a Killian aire.

, If you are Last Man Standing, you get 15 points!

, Don't play Halo all day because you need to get a breath of fresh air. Good Luck

, Thruster pack is good for fast-paced players, vision lets you see where the humans are, and camo helps you sneak.

, When your reticle turns red, press shoot and you will lunge. If you happen to miss, sidestep their shot and try again. Also remember you can swing your sword while thrusting.

, Make them waste their ammo and then go in for the kill.

, Crouch pressing B, then you are invisible to the human radar. Camo is recommended if you use this tactic.

, Don't rage quit if you keep getting killed. Halo is supposed to be fun and not to be mastered right away.

Xbox One - Open the sidebar by flicking the analog stick left, select Settings, select All Settings, and select Subscriptions.

Xbox 360 - Press the Guide button, scroll right to Settings, select Account management, and scroll to the Memberships section.

, If you're using a traditional Xbox 360, you will need to either have an Ethernet cable running from the back of your console to the back of your Internet router, or you can purchase a plug-in wireless adapter from Amazon. To check the status of your console's Internet connection:


Xbox One - Open the sidebar by flicking the analog stick left, select Settings, select All Settings, select Network, and select Network Settings to see your Xbox One's current network or select an available one.

Xbox 360 - Press the Guide button, scroll right to Settings, select System Settings, select Network Settings, and look for a network. If you don't see one, select Wired or a network name and press A to connect.

, Game disks go in the slot on the front of the console; on an Xbox 360, you must first press the ""Eject"" button on the () side of the disk tray. Your game should start up as soon as your console recognizes the disk, but if not, press A while the game's icon is selected.

Notable examples of multiplayer-friendly games include the Call of Duty series, the Halo series, and Overwatch.

, The way in which you'll access multiplayer in different games will widely vary; however, you typically begin the process by selecting a ""Multiplayer"" or ""Online"" option on the main menu of the game.

You may first need to sign into the game server or select your profile.

, Again, this process will vary, so be sure to read the various menu items to see what you'd like to do.

For example, in a game of Call of Duty, you'll typically select a game category and type, at which point you'll have the option of customizing your character while the game loads.

, This process can often take awhile, especially if you're playing a game with drop-in multiplayer. Be patient, and you'll be playing on Xbox LIVE in no time!, One of the more annoying aspects of playing online is having to hear inactive microphones picking up background noise. Doing the same with your microphone is a good way to get your account muted in-game as well as reported for harassment if the behavior continues in subsequent matches., Even though a fair amount of players will insult or belittle you while you play online, ignoring them is a much better course of action than responding.

You can typically press the ""Back"" button in the middle-left side of your controller to bring up a list of in-game players, at which point you can select players' names and press A to mute them.

, Though some rules--such as refraining from harming team mates--are universal, most games have online-specific etiquette that you'll have to learn as you play. One way to get a jump-start on this information is by browsing the game's community forums or by observing other players' gameplay.

For example: while not explicitly stated in the game, healing yourself during a player-versus-player fight in Dark Souls is widely regarded as a dishonorable thing to do.

, Online gaming can be an inherently lonely process, but if you're a part of a team, you should take actions that benefit the team as a whole, not just yourself.

If you're not prepared to ""play the objective"", consider playing a game type that doesn't emphasize teamwork.
An example of this concept might be leaving powerful equipment, weapons, or vehicles for another team mate if you know you aren't well-equipped to handle them.
If you're playing a game without a team dynamic, ignore this step.

, If your character is simply standing around in an ongoing multiplayer game while you're doing something else, you become a liability for your team. If you aren't completely committed to the notion of playing a round in your game, consider waiting to jump into a match until you're ready., Quitting early both lets your team down and marks your account as a poor sportsmanship profile, meaning that if you do it often enough, you won't get invited to matches., Complaining that a game was unfair or that the results of a match aren't right doesn't change anything, and it can hurt the experience for other players. There will be times where the outcome actually isn't fair, of course, but try to remember that the same goes for instances in which you were on a team that unfairly won.

People on Xbox LIVE also tend to dislike complaints about poor Internet connections (e.g., ""lag"").

, More than anything else, your best course of action while playing online is to respect the people with whom you're playing."

Choose a Clan Name - Finding a Clan name is the hardest part of making a clan.,
What games will you be playing?,
Recruiting - This is the second hardest thing apart from choosing a clan name.,
Build a Rank Structure - A clan is not a clan without a ranking structure.,
Get Rid of the Unwanted.,
Built a Clan Website.",How to Make a Clan on Xbox Live," Figure out a name that not only you like, but everyone else who may want to join your clan will like. Make sure its something that you will represent for a long period of time and that others will as well. You don't want to be running around claiming to be the Bad Kids who Play COD, unless your a noob and that's your style. We're trying to build a good clan here, so take our advice.;
, - You play a specific game or games already. Your clan should be based on one single game while you get it started. You can always expand later on. Figure out which game you play the most and go for that game. Build a clan base of at least 50 members before trying to expand.

, Recruiting is a major aspect in your clan. For your clan to grow and expand, you need to recruit. You need to have methods of getting new players in and keeping them in your clan. Sites like www.xbox360clans.net can help you find recruits easily. However, recruiting on Xbox LIVE is by far your best option.


Send out a message to your close friends and ask them if they want to join a clan. Be sure to include the clan name and the requirements to join.
Ask your friends to join. They will be the first ones to join because they know you and you know them.
Never give someone you don't know leader of your clan. It only spells destruction for your clan and drama.
Set guidelines on who you want to join your clan.

, A rank structure keeps your clan simple, organized and well maintained. Follow a chain of command and there's less confusion when things happen within the clan. For example: Leader, Co-Leader, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Private, Corporal, and Recruit.

, A Clan Leader has the right to pick and choose who he/she wants in the clan. Make sure you choose wisely because you could spark outrage with other clan members and do more harm, than good. Think about situations before you take action. These members do not need your clan anymore than you need them, there are other clans out there so do not treat them horribly. Ban those who choose to disrespect and not follow clan rules. Honor Codes are good to have setup when a person joins, make sure they agree to abide by the rules and Honor Code so that when the time comes that he/she disobeys it, you can point to the rules and Honor Code and show them that what they did wrong.

, Keeping your clan active, organized and updated is key to a clans success. Many clans today choose to run a website using forum software such as MyBB, Enjin, vBulletin, IPB or another forum software. Some cost money, some are free. A website is a website and the bigger it gets, the more it cost to run. Make sure that you are willing to invest in your clan to make if you plan to expand to become the biggest and best available to gamers.

Know your team.,
Set up the basics.,
Work on your defense and attack.,
Start low and build up.,
Execute a plan.,
Destroy the main buildings.",How to Play 'Command and Conquer Kane's Wrath' Well on Xbox Live," You need to understand the team you play, for example: The Nod has weaker units than the other teams and should use stealthier approach towards the enemy. Basically, you need to know what the team is strong against and what its weakness is try having skirmishes against hard or brutal AI you may lose but practice makes perfect (also AI is faster than a normal player so if you can beat a brutal or a hard with ease you can fight players just as easy).;
, Once you have chosen your team you like the feel of, then you need the basics. You need to expand quickly and efficiently, don't spend all resources doing this. Try to evenly spend on units, defense and gathering resource. To expand, build an emissary, outpost or explorer depending the team and send it to the nearest Tiberium field that you cannot reach via using your own build radius. It also may be cheaper and easier to defend if you unpack your MCV and move it closer to the field. Also, take interests of nearby 'capture' buildings like EMPs and Tiberium Spikes. These are of value.

, Once you have a steady income, then concentrate on defense or attack. However, don't forget about money income. Still, expand further if you can. You need to build units because they act as the hammer-blow of an attack or the very metal wall of defense to guard you base plus they move!

, Depending on your tactics, you should start with the low level units and gradually build on, using more advanced and stronger units or hordes of the weaker units. Build small groups of them. For example: GDI, build 6 pitbulls and scout Tiberium fields and destroy the enemy harvesters to slow their Tiberium income. Also, use this time to scout their main base or bases. Also Try to build up the tech tree if the enemy is flying through the tech tree and your still using infantry and light tanks you will find that destroying his army will be very difficult so remember there's always room for tech and improvement.

, By this time, you will know what they're doing or have a close idea in what they are doing to build units to counter this. If they build defense turrets, build things to out range them. If they build tanks, counter them with rocket men and better tanks, so on and so forth, or you could use this time to upgrade your units from the tech center.

, The match with your opponent should be beginning to close as your units are destroying his stuff. However, you need to take out the key buildings. For example, the scrin are going to attack your air units via using the anti-air plasma disc launchers. Target his nerve center, so he can't build anti-air turrets or his power, so they go offline if you attack more accurately then setting them to aggressive hope they do stuff you'll enjoy the game a lot more and be a lot more of a challenge. If you have followed this guide correctly and made you own style and combo of units and the way you build, then you'll find to be quite the challenge. However keep in mind that you need mix it up a bit don't constantly do the same thing try experiment with your units and powers.

Determine if your PC has a wireless adapter


Virtually, every modern laptop within the past few years has a wireless adapter built-in.,
Find an Ethernet cable


It can be any Ethernet cable.,
Use your PC,go to Start, Control Panel


Then click network connections.,
For the Xbox, go to the Settings blade and go to Network Settings.,If done correctly, you should be connected to Xbox Live

,
Another method is to simply select both your wired and wireless connections, right-click, and select ""Bridge"" as stated below.,
Using this method and a router, you can connect multiple Xboxes to the router, and the laptop as well, and have them all connected to Xbox Live.

",How to Cheat Xbox Live," This doesn't exclude desktops from this but its much more unlikely its built-in and its probably an add-in. If you don't have one, you can still buy a wireless adapter at many stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.;
, The Xbox 360 automatically does a cross-over process so you don't need a special cable. Plug one end directly to your Xbox 360 and plug the other into the PC. Almost every PC has one of these. If you have both your PC and Xbox 360 on, you will see a green light on the PC connector and possibly an orange (data) flashing light. This means the connection is working.

, Look for the Local Area Connection. Right-click and go to Properties. Scroll down the list of things in the box down to ""Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)"" and click it and click properties. Click the Use the following IP address button and the boxes will become enabled. In the first box, type ""192.168.0.1"". The next box should default to ""255.255.255.0"". That is normal. The other boxes should be left empty. You're not quite done yet. Click OK on both option boxes to go back to the network connections window. Right click the wireless connection and go to its properties window. Click the Advanced tab and go to the ""Internet Connection Sharing"" section. Check the top box, uncheck the bottom box. Then click ok. We have finished setting up the PC.

, Go to edit settings and go to section for IP addresses set it to manual. Input ""192.168.0.2"" as the IP address. Type in as the subnet mask 255.255.255.0. Then ""192.168.0.1"" in the Gateway Address box. Don't test the settings yet. For each DNS, type ""192.168.0.1"". Now test the settings. Everything should pass if set up correctly. The PC should say that it found a local area connection. Your Internet on your PC should also work. If none of these work, something was probably not set up right. Go back and double check your settings and steps and keep retrying until it works.

,, This will automatically route the connections without the need to set your IP address on Windows XP.

Add friends to your friends list.,
Be a nice person.,
Play with your Xbox LIVE friends often, at least once every two weeks or more.,
Do not constantly appear offline even though your friends know that you are online.,
Keep in contact with your friends as much as you can without becoming a nuisance.,
Consider removing some friends off your own list.",How to Keep Friends on Xbox Live," When doing this, always select friends who share similar views and interests as you. People who are similar in personality to you or who enjoy playing the same games as you will usually enjoy your company more and will be more likely to remain on your friends list longer. Don't just add someone because they can play a game well; these friendships must be maintained more than others and will depend on whether you can play well also. Certainly, these friendships can be useful if you need to beat a level or win a match, but ultimately, they don't last long and can end in someone feeling used if you've nothing more in common.;
, Above all, people want to have someone on their friends list that is fun to play with, mature, helpful and knows generally what they're doing when they play a game. Leave a lasting impression on someone with your kindness or fun attitude and they will be more inclined to keep you as their friend for longer. If someone insults them, stick up for them and you'll gain their trust.


If you feel angry or frustrated while playing, take some time out to regain your composure. Far better to disappear briefly than to let out invective that you can't retract.

, Most players will remove players they haven't played with in a while, so make sure you join their games or sessions whenever you can. It doesn't have to be for long, but just enough to let them know you're there, engaged with them and useful.


Form a group of friends and play together regularly. This will make players less likely to remove you since they will be unwilling to break up the circle of friends and if they do, you will probably see them again when playing with your other friends later.

, It is annoying and will cause mass confusion and anger ultimately resulting in you getting removed.

, Nothing makes people want to remove you from their friends list faster than if you spam them with lots of messages regarding free Microsoft points or your latest YouTube posting. A friendly note now and again promising to play with them soon should be enough to keep their interest.


Refrain from being needy or dependent on your friends. Some gamers will not like it if you constantly message them, send chat or game invites and/or whine about not being able to play with them.






Be mature and respect the fact that your friend may not want to play with you all the time. They have other friends as well.






Having a reasonably large friends list will stop you from wanting more friends, although spreading equal time between them can be time consuming.







, Remove some of your friends with whom you don't play as often or whom do not click with as much, so that you can spend more time working on your genuine friendships with friends you like more. If you do remove a friend, leave them a note explaining why and that you enjoyed their friendship while it lasted. No need to be nasty or insensitive. Don't ever remove your friends without telling them or they might attempt to get you banned. Also never, ever add random people you do not know.

, Before you do anything, one thing you have to be sure of is that your console is connected to the Internet. You can do a wired connection by using an Ethernet cable to connect it to your Internet source or you can also connect wirelessly if you have a wifi router available.

, Use an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox One to your TV. Connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI OUT port at the rear portion of the Xbox One. The other end of the HDMI cable goes in the HDMI input of your TV. If you have cable or satellite TV, you can connect another HDMI cable into your console’s HDMI IN port and the other end goes to your set-top box for cable or satellite TV.

, Connect your Kinect into the Kinect port at the back of the Xbox One. It is the port in between the USB ports and IR port.


The Kinect sensor cable has a fixed length of 3 meters (9.8 ft) so make sure that your Kinect sensor is close enough to your Xbox One.

, Plug the power supply at the back of the Xbox One into a power source. It is at the leftmost part of the console from the back. Then connect the power cord to the power supply. Lastly, plug in the other end of the power cord straight to your power outlet.


The Xbox One’s LED on the power supply should light up as an indication that there’s power.

, You can turn on your unit by using your wired controller. Simply hold down the Home button on your Xbox One controller to power on both your unit and controller at the same time.


You can also touch the front panel of the Xbox One (where its logo is) to power on the unit.
If you are using a wireless controller, make sure you put in batteries first to power on your controller.
The Kinect sensor can also be used to turn on your console except during initial setup. You can normally turn on your Xbox One via the Kinect sensor by saying “Xbox On” within your Kinect sensor’s range.

, The first thing you’ll see on-screen is the Xbox One logo with a green background. Wait for it to process a bit and it will eventually give you initial setup instructions.


The first instruction is for you to press A to proceed. It gives you that instruction by showing an Xbox One controller on-screen. Then Xbox One greets you for the first time.

, There are a lot of languages available to choose from including English, Deutsch, Español, and more when you scroll down the options. Select your preferred language then press A.


You will notice that Xbox One on-screen texts automatically translate to the language currently selected as a preview.

, Depending on your selected language, Xbox One will now give you options to select what country you live in.

, You can either choose your wired connection or WiFi (wireless) connection. It is best to choose the wired connection for stability.


In choosing wireless, you may have to provide your router password for access.
If Xbox One for some reason fails to discover your router, you can press Y on your controller to refresh scanning.

, Since this is initial setup, you will need to update your Xbox One. This is almost guaranteed for initial setup, regardless of the unit. You need to be connected to the Internet to download the update which is around 500 MB in size.


Your unit will automatically reset after the update.

, After the Xbox One resets, it will ask you to press the controller’s Home button to continue with the rest of the setup. First up, select your time zone. Again, the default selection will depend on the country you selected previously.

, Setting up the Kinect sensor will allow you to sign in automatically via Kinect recognition, control Xbox One with voice and hand motions, chat with other Kinect users, and control your TV.


Make sure you have speakers connected to your Xbox One for the Kinect setup to properly gauge speaker volume.
Keep quiet when the instructions ask you to. This will affect the Kinect sensor’s setup.

, You can use the email and password associated with your current gamer tag. If you don’t have an existing gamer tag, you can use your Skype, Outlook.com, Windows 8, or Windows phone’s credentials instead.


If you don’t have accounts on any of the alternatives, you must create a new Microsoft account to proceed.

, View and accept the Xbox Live terms of use. After accepting, you will be given the Privacy statement.

, You will have the chance to pick your color preference for your Xbox One’s color theme. Upon selecting, you will be given a preview of what your dashboard will look like.

, Before ending the setup, Xbox One will ask if you wish to save your password. It is advisable to save it to prevent the unit from asking your password every time you log in, but if you are concerned about who uses the device, then do not save the password.


You will also be asked if you want the Kinect sensor to automatically log you in upon recognition.

, Now, press your controller’s Home button to end the setup and visit your Xbox One dashboard with your chosen color theme. Enjoy your new Xbox One!

Close the Options window to save the changes.;
, The ROM file is a copy of a game cartridge. You won't be able to access the Cheats menu until you've opened a ROM file in Project 64.


If you have set a ROM directory, you can have Project 64 list all of your ROMs in the main window. Do this by placing all of your N64 ROM files in a single directory, and then click ""File"" → ""Choose ROM Directory"" in Project64.
You can right-click a game in your ROM directory list and select ""Edit Cheats"" to add cheats without having to start the game. You can't enable cheats until the game is running.

, Once the ROM is running, click the System menu and select ""Cheats"". You can also press Ctrl+C if the game is running. If you have a ROM directory set, you can right-click on a game in the list and select ""Edit Cheats"".


The game must be on the list of supported ROMs in order for the Cheats menu to work. This only really applies to homebrew games or ROM hacks. Any ROM for a regular game should work without issues.

, Project 64 includes a large cheat database that provides cheats for most official Nintendo 64 games. Opening the Cheats menu after loading a game will display all of the premade cheats that you can choose from.


Some cheats are actually categories with multiple options. Expand the tree to see all of the available cheats.
Selecting a cheat will usually provide a brief description and what it's used for. This isn't guaranteed for all cheats.
If you can't find the cheat you want, or want to add new cheats, click here.

, If you've found a cheat that you want to use, click the checkbox next to its name to select it. You can select multiple cheats to use at once, but be aware that many cheats make games unstable, and too many will increase the chances of the game crashing.

, cheats to select the variable. This will open a new window that allows you to select the variable that you want to use. This is a common way to use a cheat that is slightly modified for similar items. For example, a (=> ?) cheat might modify your character's inventory, and each variable is a different piece of equipment. If you don't select the variable before trying to use the cheat code in the game, nothing will happen.


Each variable should have a brief description when you open the list. The first few characters are the part of the cheat code that refers to that variable, and can be ignored when browsing the list.

, Depending on the cheat, it may take effect immediately, or it may need to be triggered while you're playing. Refer to the cheat code's description in the Cheats window to see how to activate the cheat.

, Project 64 supports GameShark codes. You can find codes all over the internet at a variety of code sites and fan forums. Just search for the game you want to cheat in and include the words ""cheat codes"" to find code lists. You should be able to find codes for just about any game you can think of, including homebrew and ROM hack games.

, You'll need to either start the game or have it loaded in your ROMs directory so that you can open the Cheats menu. See the first section for details. Also go press ctrl alt delete to browse the whole cheat code libary

, You can right-click on anything and still see this option. If you can't get the menu to appear, try right-clicking elsewhere in the window.

, This can be anything you want, so choose something that will help you identify it in the list of cheats. Add a description as well if the cheat requires some special instructions or clarifications.

, Make sure to preserve any spaces in the code. Most codes will have eight digits (<address>) followed by a space and then four digits (<value>), e.g. 8111A7C0 0140.

, Sometimes you'll come across a cheat that has multiple versions. On most cheat sites, the last digits will be marked as xx or xxxx, followed by a list of what you can replace xx or xxxx with. The number of xs indicates the number of characters that make up the variable. To create a multi-variable cheat in Project 64, copy the base cheat into the ""Code"" field, and replace the xs with ?. For example, 8011A800 00xx would become 8011A800 00??.


You'll know that you've entered the base cheat properly when the ""Options"" field becomes available.

, In the ""Options"" field, you'll be able to enter all of the variables for each option. Enter the characters for the variable followed by a space and then a description, e.g. 2D Pocket Egg. Each new variable should be on its own line.

, Once you're finished adding all of the variables, click the ""Add Cheat"" button. It will be added to the list of your available cheats, but will not be enabled until you check its box and select any variables.Note: The ""Add Cheat"" button will only become clickable when the code is properly formatted. If the button is grayed out, check the code for extra spaces or incorrect characters. If you still can't get the code to appear, it may not be a valid code for the Nintendo 64 GameShark.

Get out of Midgar.,
Go to Kalm and experience the cutscene there where Cloud explains about his history with Sephiroth.,
Go to the Chocobo Ranch with at least 2,000 gil saved up.,
Wander around in the Chocobo footprints until a random encounter with a Chocobo is in it.,
Take the Chocobo across the Great Marsh without encountering the Basilisk.,
Go through the cave.,
Exit the cave and wander around in the forest opposite the Mountain.,
Decline her requests for ""another round"" and say ""Wait a minute!""",How to Acquire Yuffie in Final Fantasy 7," In order to do this, you need to do the motorcycle mission without letting Cloud or the other Party members die. After that, there will be yet another boss fight with yet another big robot. Try tackling this using Cloud with restore and an offensive magic (since he has not yet unlocked any better weapons), Barret with Lightning and Elemental Materia on his weapon, so his attacks are counted as super effective against robots (also helpful in the Elevator Battle), and Red XIII with whatever magic you have. After that you will be out of Midgar and in the World Map.;
, This is very lengthy; save before and during this part.

, Buy the Chocobo Lure Materia and some Gysahl Greens.

, The music will be different, so you will know when it comes.

, It will kill you.


Fight the Basilisk later on in the game to get an overpowered Enemy Skill.
Another enemy skill can be found right outside Midgar; wait for the robot things to do Matra Magic, then kill them.

, Treasure can be found in the cave, along with a Materia and enemy skill.

, You will encounter Yuffie and have to fight her. She has 500 HP. By then, Cloud should have his next weapon, obtained in Kalm.

, After that, ask if she wants to go with you, and do not ask her name. She will tell you. Do not open the menu. If she runs away, you can re-encounter her.

Notice things happening in the game that aren't supposed to be there.,
Find out or ask about glitches in general.,
Be careful not to abuse glitches in shared gaming.,
Ledge climb.,
Try to pass through walls.,
Check out the big things.,
If you find an invisible barrier, try to find a way around it.,
Look at a place that is otherwise unable to reach.,
Play the game ""incorrectly"".,
Try pausing.,
Try again.,
Use some of the suggested places from the section above.,
Stay alert when playing.",How to Find Glitches," For example, weapon switches when you thought you were holding one type of weapon, clothing changes when you didn't request a change or an entire change of scenery or location when you weren't expecting it. Perhaps gravity doesn't seem to exist anywhere, when it ought to, or maybe your tools, weapons or objects are doing something they wouldn't normally do. To know whether this is part of the game, or a glitch, there are ways to find out:


Read the game synopsis accompanying the game. If it's detailed enough, this might help you.
Ask a friend who has already played the game. He or she might know whether what you're encountering is normal or not.
Go online and check out the forum for the game. See if someone else has raised the possible glitch. Or, do a search for ""X glitch"" on a search engine if you suspect it is a known glitch.;
, Check out the specific site, forums, discussion pages or other information source related to your game. There may already be discussion threads or tutorials for finding current glitches in your game.


YouTube will often have video tutorials of glitches in popular games.
Always check the date of posting of the glitch information. While glitches may remain for some time, they usually won't last more than a few months in live games, as the programmers will patch them eventually.
Equally, always read what can go wrong when exploiting a glitch––some glitches can destroy your game or lose items for good.
There are some sites dedicated to outing as many glitches in games as possible. Some of these include funny glitches that are worth a good laugh but not much more.

, Glitching isn't appreciated in many multiplayer games as it is considered a form of cheating or modifying gameplay in an undesired way and may impact other players unfairly. Read your live game's terms and conditions before getting carried away with overusing a glitch. You may be better off reporting a glitch than using it.

, If you can get onto a climbable ledge, then keep going on it as far as you can. See if it takes you anywhere. Possibly there is a point at which the programming got sloppy and you fall or climb through into something else of interest.

, In some games, walls become transparent when certain things happen, such as when moving items, interacting with players or using special actions such as teleporting or decorating. Perhaps there are particular joins or fissures in walls that create weak spots where you can pass through what is normally solid.


If you notice that your weapon, tool or other object that you're holding can go through a wall, then try to go through as well. It could be a sign of a way to glitch into the wall or out of the zone, level, map or area that you're currently in.

, Rocks and other big scenery are often the best place to try to find glitches. Sometimes the game developers get lazy and don't set up barriers there.


If you go to a rock to try to glitch into it or out of a map, try to go to the most obscure edge of it. The most protruding edge that is obviously different from the others could be the key to getting inside it.
If you are new to glitching, try not to go for the hard glitches like going out of map or under map. Try to get on roofs for a while, and then move on to advanced glitches.

, Such barriers usually lead to roofs or other places the game developers didn't want you to go.

, Ask yourself, ""I wonder if there is a way to get up there."" Consider what your game character might be able to use to get there, such as barrels, vines, tree branches, bouncing kangaroos, whatever! Give it all a go––you never know until you've tried.


Most glitches happen in areas you're not meant to be playing.

, Games testing occurs with a focus on playing the game ""correctly"", following a set sequence with expected outcomes. You can turn this on its head by playing it the opposite of what may have been intended, such as approaching things from a different direction or angle, trying to invert the usual things or simply pushing the boundaries when most players wouldn't bother.


If you're not afraid to die in the game, you can probably find quite a few strange things out!

, If you're in the middle of an action, stunt or activity, sometimes pausing might confuse or change things for you. It's worth a try. This action is more likely to be useful for older games.

, Go back to the exact part of the game where you encountered it last time. You may need to try several times before seeing the glitch again; pinpointing exactly what causes it may take time to refine.


Keep trying. Just because you don't get where you want to the first time, it doesn't mean you can't get there.

, Go and visit some of the areas of the game that are more likely to contain glitches, such as rocks and big scenery.

, Don't actively look for glitches but be alert for the possibility as you enjoy your game, noticing anything that doesn't fit in with the normal gameplay.


Most glitches are random accidents that you stumble upon. They may be present while in regular single or multiplayer modes, depending on the game type.

Review current games in the platform you're interested in.,
Be original and inventive.,
Consider creating an adventure game.,
Brainstorm puzzle games.,
Think about action games.,
Consider simulation games, games that are concerned with playing out realistic situations in game settings.,
Think about creating a racing game.,
Find the perfect team to help you build your game.,
Extensively test your game before publishing.",How to Make a Successful Game," What are the popular games? What are the current trends in new games? What ideas and concepts have been used before? Exploring the market of existing games will help you become familiar with the style codes your game should conform to, and it can also help you identify holes in the market - holes that your game can fill.;
, Be open to new experiences and ideas. Be original and creative, and avoid making your game too much like any existing ones. You can use ideas from other games, but make sure to introduce new concepts and ideas into your own.

, To come up with an idea, think about what you want in an adventure, what kind of adventure you would like to have. It could be under the sea with marine animals, or up in the space with aliens - the possibilities are endless. Come up with a storyline for the game, have a few goals the player is trying to accomplish. Add details that will help develop your fantasy world, like currency, language, and other characters.

, Puzzle games depend mainly on logic and strategies. The player solves a puzzle to finish a level. These games should start pretty easy to let the player get the hang of the puzzle, but it should become harder and harder as they progress to win. Still, every level should be solvable. If the game is either too easy or too hard, people will get bored with it. Remember, different players use different strategies to solve a puzzle, so make a puzzle with some possibilities. For the player, the fun in a puzzle game is in finding the best strategy; for the designer, the challenge is in finding the sweet spot for that strategy, somewhere between trivial and merciless.

, An action game requires players to use speed, accuracy, and timing to overcome obstacles. Action games need to be full of life and energy, and they should require the player's full attention. The game should depend on speed, navigation, and avoiding obstacles, all of which become more difficult as the game gets faster and faster, bringing more excitement to the player. In that way you take gamers attention. Also add achievements and a ranking system to attract more people and encourage them to play your game for longer.

, These include taking care of virtual people or pets, developing cities of societies, and building amusement parks or zoos. Some of these games take hours to play, and maybe incredibly complex. Some simulation games aren’t even played to be won. In stimulation games you can use things from real life. Anything from daily life that you find interesting can become a simulation game, and you can use simulation games to explore areas of life - different jobs, parts of the world, people and animals - that you normally don't get to participate in. For this reason these games can be attractive and endlessly interesting.

, Racing games involve speed and challenge. You'll need to choose a vehicle - car, motorcycle, pterodactyl, anything that moves. Design different tracks or race courses where the races will take place. Also include different weapons, power-ups, or anything else you can think of to change the flow of the game and keep it from getting boring.

, Assemble a group of people with complementary skills and ideas. Having a team will help you come up with and develop more creative ideas, and it will make the process of building the game much less stressful and more fun. Find friends to help you or find teams online, or else find an existing team to join.

, After you finish the game with your teammates, review it, test every part of it in every situation you can think of to try to find bugs, and fix every bug you find. Then before publishing, find an awesome name and description for your game, one that will attract people and make them play.

Try the procedure outlined in How to Get Your Girlfriend to Play Video Games.,
Help find activities that she can do whilst you are gaming.,
See if there is something she can do around you while you play video games.,
Make sure you're spending enough time with her, in general.,
Include your girlfriend in ""game-time"" decisions.,
Make a plan together of when you can both do activities that you enjoy apart.,
Plan time to spend together.,
Honor your agreement.",How to Juggle a Girlfriend and Video Gaming," You might end up fighting over who gets to play their favorite video game, but that's a much better problem to have than arguing over not spending enough time together.;
, This could be a new hobby that she's always wanted to try, or regular meet-ups with her friends. That way, she has something fulfilling to do, while you play video games. Stay away from hobbies like dancing though - she might just sucker you into joining her!

, If she loves to read, maybe she can submerge herself in her favorite book while you indulge in your video games. There are also activities like knitting, crochet, and painting that will keep her busy, but you can still feel like you're spending some time together by being in the same room. Be encouraging with whatever she chooses - after you finish your game, ask her how her book/knitting/painting is going. Another idea is to have a second TV in the room that she can watch while you play.

, If all you want to do is play video games, even if it means spending little or no time with her, that's not enough for most girls, and your relationship might be on thin ice. If you give her enough attention and reassurance when you're not playing video games, however, she might not feel the need to fight to regain the time you devote to video games.

, Relationships benefit from honesty and inclusion. Talk with your girlfriend about why playing video games is important to you. If you play online games with your friends, explain that this is your way of connecting and sharing an interest with your friends. If you play games on your own, this is your way of relaxing and enjoying yourself, just as she has her relaxation time doing things she enjoys. It's okay to have different interests.

, Plan when you can spend time apart, that works well for both of you. For example, if she goes to Yoga on Monday and Thursday nights, this would be an ideal time for you to plan ahead and arrange game-time by yourself or with friends.

, Be sure to include time doing something together in your plan, so that you can both look forward to times when you can connect with each other. When you've agreed times to spend together, you can both be much more present together, knowing that any self-relaxation time is already catered for.

, Sticking to these boundaries will help you both achieve regular time apart doing what you enjoy. Compromise is also important in any relationship, so make sure that you're not asking for what you both agree may be too much game-time. Honoring the agreement shows respect for the relationship, and for your girlfriend.

Publish.",How to Make a Text Based Game," Inform 7 is a popular and powerful tool for creating text games, more often called interactive fiction. Its programming language is designed to look like simple English sentences, while still allowing full functionality. Inform 7 is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.;
, Adrift is another popular, easy to use interactive fiction language and compiler. Because it relies on a graphical interface instead of coding, it may be the easiest tool for a non-programmer to use. Adrift is free and available for Windows only, although games created with it can be played on any operating system or in a browser.

, If you'd rather approach text game creation as a coding project, TADS 3 may be the most comprehensive software of this type. It will be especially easy to pick up if you are familiar with C++ and/or Javascript.TADS 3 is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.


The Windows version (only) of TADS 3 comes with a ""Workbench"" addition that makes it much more accessible to non-programmers, and more convenient to use in general.Programmers may be interested in this in-depth comparison between Inform 7 and TADS 3.

, The tools above are by far the most popular, but there are several others that have strong followings in the interactive fiction community.If none of the tools above interest you or you want to explore more options, try these next:


Hugo
ALAN

, You can jump in and get started without any downloads using one of the following tools:



Quest (more similar to the IF tools above)

Twine (easy to use visual editor)
StoryNexus (the player clicks options instead of guessing what to type; StoryNexus hosts your game online)

, Most text-based games are played by typing in commands. People who have played interactive fiction games before will expect you to include certain commands in your game, such as ""examine (object)"" and ""take (object)"".


The documentation or tutorial for your software should introduce you to these commands, and how to include them in your game.
Often, a game has additional unique commands, which can be anything from ""twirl baton"" to ""mow lawn."" These options should always be made clear to the player, unless you are putting them in as jokes or Easter eggs that are not required to complete the game.

, The most common form of interactive fiction involves exploring different locations, usually called ""rooms"" even if they are outdoors. A good project to start with could include one or two rooms to explore at the start, another couple rooms the player can get to with some simple searching or problem-solving, and a larger puzzle the player needs to solve with some thinking or thorough searching.


Alternatively, you can make a project that's focused more on the decisions the player makes, instead of the puzzles he solves. This could be an emotional story focused on the player's relationship with other characters, or a plot-based story where the player has many decisions to make, then witnesses the consequences in later scenes. This may still use a geographic map, or it could use ""rooms"" that are more like scenes, with the player progressing through several vignettes that explore these themes.

, If your first room doesn't work the way you want it to, or you're just not sure how to achieve what you want with your software, look for a ""documentation"" or ""help"" menu, or a ""Read Me"" in the same folder as the main tool. If that's not enough, ask your question on a forum at the website where you got the software, or at a general-purpose interactive fiction forum.

, Once you have a basic plan for your game, write a short introduction to describe the game, explain any unusual commands, and warn about adult content if any.Next, write the first room description. Try to make the first setting interesting, as many players will walk away if they see an empty apartment. Here's an example of the first thing a player might see when they start up the game (labeled for convenience):



Introduction: You redeemed your entire collection of pudding coupons for this yacht, and now it's adrift at sea. Typical luck. Better see whether Lucy weathered the storm. You think she was in the engine room when it hit.

Logistics and content warning: Welcome to The Frugal Man's Yacht Trip. Type check coupons to see your current collection. Use the command redeem followed by the name of the coupon to use these mysteriously helpful items. Warning: game depicts mild violence and cannibalism.

Room description: You are standing in an oak-panelled bunk room. The metal bunk frame fell over during the storm, and the only mattress lies torn and soggy under the liquor cabinet. There is a closed door to the north.

, Come up with ways for the player to interact with each object you mentioned. At the very least, they should be able to ""examine"" or ""x"" each one. Here are a few examples of commands the player can use and the text they see as a result:



examine mattress – Stuffed with finest quality goose feathers, most of which are now floating around the room. Soggy and smells of booze.

x me – You are exhausted, and wearing only the ragged pink bathrobe you put on just before the storm hit. The bathrobe has a pocket and a cotton sash.

open door – The doorknob turns, but won't open. It feels like there's something heavy on the other side.

, A classic beginning requires the player to find a way out of the room. This doesn't have to be a complicated puzzle, just a taste for what your game will be like. It also teaches the player to read carefully and look for hints. For instance, the player might be supposed to do this, after typing the commands above:



pick up mattress – As soon as you lift it, a reek of tequila assaults your nose. That explains why this mattress is soggy... you toss it to the side and wipe your hands on your bathrobe.

x room – You are standing in an oak-panelled bunk room. The metal bunk frame fell over during the storm, and the only mattress lies torn and soggy in the corner. A liquor cabinet is in the corner. There is a closed door to the north. A broken bottle is on the floor.

pick up bottle – You pick up the broken bottle of tequila. Waste not, want not.

x pocket – Your wallet is still there. Phew.

x wallet – You may have given up the pudding coupons, but you still have your emergency coupon wallet. Right now you have a a crowbar coupon and a whistle coupon.

redeem crowbar – You hold up the crowbar coupon and clear your throat. The coupon drifts away, and a moment later a hefty crowbar falls into your hand.

open door with crowbar – You insert the crowbar into the gap of the doorframe and push hard. A growl on the other side startles you. One more attempt should open the door, but you'd better have a weapon ready.

open door with crowbar – This time there isn't even a weight on the door. It swings open easily, to reveal a large grey wolf staring at you! Better think fast – you can only choose one option.

hit wolf with bottle – You wallop the wolf right on the nose with the broken bottle. It whimpers and runs off. The way north is now clear.

, As the creator, you'll become so familiar with the terms that they seem second nature. Other people only have a few sentences of instruction to work with. Whenever you add a new command or object, especially one that's vital to move forward in the game, make sure you keep it obvious and simple to use.


Always use valid object names in the room description. For example, if a player walks into the room and sees a description of ""a painting,"" make sure ""painting"" is the term for that object in your game. If you carelessly use the term ""picture"" instead, players will have to guess at how to interact with it.Allow synonyms for verbs. Take some time to think about how a player might try to use objects.A button should respond to both ""push button"" and ""press button."" An enemy should give the option to ""attack,"" ""punch,"" and ""hit,"" plus ""use (any item that could be treated as a weapon) on (enemy).""

, Don't let your carefully devised puzzle break the reader's immersion in the setting. You might feel terribly clever for creating a puzzle that involves a Viking helmet, a stick of dynamite, and a bee hive, but it's unreasonable to discover these items in a spaceship or a high school classroom. Your setting will feel less cohesive, and the items may as well have a neon sign flashing ""use me for a puzzle.""Giving puzzles more than one solution makes them feel much more realistic, as does allowing a single item to be used in multiple puzzles or in multiple ways.
Make the puzzles feel relevant. There should be a reason your character needs to solve the puzzle.Avoid artificial puzzles such as towers of Hanoi, mazes, and logic puzzles., Old-school adventure games are famous for cruel results such as ""You pick up the rock, starting an avalanche that buries you. Game over."" Nowadays, players want their skill to be rewarded. Besides avoiding arbitrary player deaths, here are a few other design goals to keep in mind:Don't make important events hinge on a die roll. For the most part, if a player has figured out what to do, he should succeed 100% of the time.
Provide hints for difficult puzzles, and don't put in more than two or three red herrings.
Don't make a puzzle that can't be solved on the first playthrough, such as one that requires knowledge of the next area or a trial-and-error puzzle that kills you if you don't guess correctly.
It's fine to permanently close off an area partway through the game, but the player should be given fair warning before this happens. If a choice makes the game unwinnable, this should be obvious in advance, and it should end the game instead of letting the player keep trying with no hope of winning.

, Spend some time to make every ending interesting. If the player loses, he should still get to read a sizable chunk of text that describes specifically what happened, and encourages him to try again. If a player wins, give her a long, triumphant ending, and consider allowing her to spend a couple additional actions savoring the victory in a special end-game room., There are dozens if not hundreds of articles available at Brass Lantern, Interactive Fiction Database, and IFWiki, where you can home in on specialized topics like how to write convincing characters, or how to program objects with complex interactions. Perhaps even more important is the large collection of text-based games at IF Archive, where you can discover what you enjoy firsthand, by playing the games yourself. Here are a few excellent resources to start with:

, Once your game seems complete, play through it yourself several times. Try to cover all the possible paths through the game, including doing things in a ""weird"" sequence that you didn't intend. Once you've corrected any errors that come up, rope in a few friends, family members, or online interactive fiction players to beta test your game the same way. Encourage them to give feedback on what parts were frustrating or not fun, and consider their suggestions for changes or additional options.


Save often or use the ""undo"" command, if available, so you can try different paths without starting from the beginning each time.

, Some text-based game creation software also comes with an online platform where you can upload the game. More commonly, the creator will upload the game to IF Archive, and post a description at IFDB.


Share links to your game on social media and on interactive fiction forums for more exposure.
The vast majority of text-based games are offered for free. You can charge money for it, but if this is your first project and you don't have an existing fan base, don't expect many buyers.

, Surely you have a rough idea about what this game is about? If not, think about your favourite games, what games sell or simply think about fantasy. Fantasy is always a good starting point for (ok) game makers/designers. Mainly due to the fact about 96.23% of games are indeed fantasy .

, Use Photoshop, Gimp or even Window's basic Paint tool.

, Have an introductory page where you name and edit your game character. The first map is usually plain and simple, don't go overboard on your first map.

, If you are more adept with game design then why not try your hand at scripting? This is however, harder to do and is really not advised to new designers. Also, you really should have a, well, a point... This makes a game a game. Maybe the point of a mini game is to kill the boss via doing a quest and then going to the boss.

",How to Make a Map With Valve Hammer Editor," Brushes are essentially the backbone to the map; it's impossible to have a map without brushes. Brushes are used to create many essential parts of a map including, but not limited to: world geometry, the skybox, area triggers, and displacements.

Brushes are created with the 'Block Tool' located on the panel at the far left of the screen (or alternatively press Shift + B). The block tool can create arches, blocks, cylinders, spheres, spikes, toruses, and wedges, but right now we'll just focus on making a simple block. With the 'Block Tool' enabled (and making sure that at the lower right corner of the screen, the 'Categories' tab is set to 'Primitives' and the 'Objects' tab is set to 'Block') move the mouse cursor to any point on any 2D view grid and drag the left-mouse button to the size of the brush you want. Make sure that it looks right in all three grids (Top, Side, and Front). Press 'Enter' on the keyboard or right-click the mouse in the 2D grid and select ""Create Object"" to create the brush.;
, Entities are essentially any objects in Hammer Editor that are not world brushes. Most entities perform some sort of action, like lighting a room, teleporting a player to another part of the map, or laying down a route path for an NPC (Non-Player Character).Entities can be split into two categories: brush entities and point entities.

Brush entities are, rather obviously, entities made from brushes. Examples of brush entities include, but are not limited to: trigger brushes, areaportals, hint brushes, and physics brushes.

To make a brush entity, you first need to create a brush (refer to the ""Brushes"" section above). Once the brush is created, select it with the 'Selection Tool' located at the top of the left panel (or press Shift + S, or simply press the Escape key (Esc) to automatically enable the 'Selection Tool'). With the brush selected, ""tie"" the brush to an entity by moving the mouse cursor to the 'Tools' menu at the top of the screen and selecting 'Tie to Entity' from the drop-down menu (or, more popularly, by simply hitting Ctrl + T). After you have tied the brush to an entity, the 'Object Properties' menu will pop up on screen. By default, it will become a func_detail entity (beginners probably won't need to know what this is yet). If you want it to become something other than a func_detail brush, simply select one of the many brush entity types from the drop down menu. Hit apply and you now have a brush entity in your map.


Point entities are a little different from brush entities in a few ways. First off, they exist on a single point on the grid by using the ""Entity Tool"" on the left side of the screen (Shift + E for the keyboard shortcut). Second, they are always accompanied with some sort of visual prop model, even though some entities (such as lights and logic relays) will be invisible in the game. Point entities are used for many things from lighting and ambient sounds, to inserting spawn points, props, and navigation nodes.
To insert a point entity, click the 'Entity Tool' at the panel on the left of the screen (or press Shift + E), then look at the lower right corner of the screen. Under the 'Categories' tab it will say 'Entities' and under the 'Objects' tab will be the name of the currently selected entity. By default, it'll be a spawn point for whatever game you are mapping (ex. ""info_player_deathmatch"" for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, ""info_player_terrorist"" for Counter-Strike: Source, etc.). You can filter through the different point entities by simply typing it in the 'Objects' tab. So if you wanted to insert a light, simply type in ""light"" in the 'Objects' tab and it'll filter all entities with ""light"" in it. Once you have the desired entity selected, pick a point on a grid where you'd like to place the entity and click the left mouse button (you may also left click in the 3d camera - keep in mind that if you click on the 3D camera, the entity will be created automatically, while if you click on the 2D grid, you'll have to press enter before it is created). Once it is created and you're satisfied with the placement, press the Escape (Esc) key on the keyboard and you have a point entity in your map.



, Textures define what your brushes look like, as well as assigning material properties to brushes. While most textures are applied on brushes for aesthetic appeal in game, they can be used for optimization and organizational purposes. For example, a trigger_multiple brush entity could receive any texture, but it'd be wise for organizational reasons to texture it with either the tools/toolstrigger or tools/toolsinvisible texture. Another example is tools/toolsnodraw. This is definitely one of the most important textures to use, because any brush face textured with tools/toolsnodraw will not be rendered in the game; therefore, it is wise to create brushes with no draw first, then apply the desired texture to only the brush faces the player can see from the player's point-of-view in the game. Trigger, invisible, and nodraw textures will appear in the 'Auto' visgroup for easy hiding or viewing.

To apply a texture to a brush face, you need to click on the 'Texture Application' tool on the panel to the left of the screen (or simply press Shift + A). Once that is activated, the 'Face Edit Sheet' window will appear, and will be on the 'Material' Tab by default. Around the middle of the window, you'll see what texture is currently selected. You can browse for different textures by clicking the 'Browse' button, but there are literally thousands of textures to choose from. Thankfully, there is a filter for you to use, so if you have an idea of what texture you want, like a wall texture for instance, just type ""wall"" in the texture filter and all textures with ""wall"" will be visible in the texture browser. To see all textures again, simply clear the filter box. Once you have found a suitable texture, double-click it and the texture browser will close, taking you back to the Face Edit Sheet. If you already have a brush made, move the mouse cursor over to the 3D window, navigate over to the brush if necessary by pressing ""Z"" and then using WSAD to move to the brush, and right-click on the brush face(s) that you want to texture. Once you're satisfied, close the Face Edit Sheet.
To apply a texture to the entire brush at once, as opposed to just one face at a time, first select the texture you wish to use. Next, select the brush you wish to edit. Finally, with the brush still selected, move your mouse cursor over to the ""Apply Current Texture"" tool (no keyboard shortcuts, unfortunately). Select the tool and the entire brush will now be covered in the selected texture.

, Please note that the following map will be made under the Counter-Strike: Source configurations, so there may be discrepancies if you're mapping for another game. If there are any major game-specific steps that are required, this article will address those issues., This will give you the space necessary to create the map.

, It will save you a lot of headaches in the long run.

, Then drag the left mouse button along the 2D top-view grid to create a box (a ""brush"") to create the floor. You can make it any dimension you choose, but for this example, it'll be 512(Length), 512(Width), and 32(Height). Press the ""Enter"" key on the keyboard (or right-click the mouse and select ""Create Object"") to create the brush.

, For this example, the walls are going to be 512(Length), 32(Width), and 256(Height).

, While holding down the ""Shift"" key (holding ""Shift"" and dragging clones brushes), drag the newly cloned wall brush to the opposite end of the room.

, Left-click on the cloned brushes once to enter ""Rotate"" mode (represented by a circle on the corners of the selected brushes) and rotate them 90 degrees and line them flush with the floor and other walls.

, There shouldn't be any gaps in the room.

, Filter with key words such as ""wall"", ""floor"", ""ceiling"", etc. Remember to texture only the faces that the player will be able to see.


Textures that have nothing to do with your theme will look ugly in the final product.

, Regardless of what game you're mapping for, there should always be a player spawn point, so that will be the first entity in this map. Place an info_player_terrorist entity (or whatever respective spawn entity the game utilizes) anywhere in the map with the entity tool. In the case of Counter-Strike: Source, make sure the spawn entities are not touching the floor or they will be stuck and won't be able to enter the map (i.e. ""Team is Full"" bug).

, For example, if a weapon needs to be reached, make the player look at that weapon. Or, if the player needs to go somewhere, make sure it is facing where it needs to go., This will add light to the map. The entity emits a light that will radiate in all directions, and its brightness and color can be changed.


For example, if you had a BTS map, you could use dim lighting for an eerie vibe. Or, if you had a clean test chamber map, you could put lights in Observation Rooms and/or light strips.

, Having a map with nothing to mess with is just plain boring. Add tons of interactions, for example:

A cube that can go wherever the player puts it
An easter egg control room that has a few buttons that do stuff. That is important.

, Select the tools/toolsinvisible texture, then create a brush big enough to encompass the spawn points of the entire team. Tie the brush (Control+T), then select func_buyzone from the ""Class"" list under ""Class Info"". Hit ""Apply"", then under ""Team Number"", select which team will be able to use the buyzone (i.e. ""Terrorist"" buyzone for the Terrorist spawn location).

Good Luck!",How to Make a Game Engine," There are a variety of languages from which programs are made. The language you choose doesn't matter too much, but the most important thing is that you start somewhere.

There are many programming languages to choose from, but most go with C or Java and they are also the most useful in Game Development.
Once you learn one language, it's much easier to learn another.;
, The most effective way (in my opinion) to learn programming/computer science is to take a class! Whether this is a class at your school, or outside of school shouldn't matter.

No matter who you are, you can find a programming class that suits you.
MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/) has a variety of free classes.
If you look around on Google, you'll find a number of other sites that also have free lectures and classes available.
You could also have a friend teach you a language, sharing is caring.

, You don't want your first game to be you big, important game. You want a chance to screw up and not care too much about your project.

Try to make a simple game.
If you learned Java, check out the Swing package.
Don't worry too much about this project(s), they should only take up a few weeks of your time.
Learn from your mistakes.

, Try to challenge yourself. That way if you don't achieve all you set out to, you'll still (probably) have a pretty good game left over.

Think for a while, don't feel pressured to do this in one sitting.
Sit on your idea for a while so you know it is good.

, Technical communications is important in any kind of engineering, including software engineering. You don't want to tell someone that you're making an apple and they go and make you audio for a pear.

Write up a ""Game Design Document"". These are used in professional game development, but more importantly, they easily communicate your idea(s) to others. There are many free templates available online.

, You don't have to go at this alone. It's also more fun and exciting in a group.

You can't make a custom game engine and manage the project without help.
Ask your Friends first before going to strangers or advertising for help, you'd be surprised who would love to get into the game industry.

, Look into what you're going to do before you do it. Even when you make an engine from scratch, there are still a number of tools that you could make your engine out of.

Look into ""OpenGL"" if you learned C and ""JOGL"" if you learned Java.
Maybe buy a textbook on OpenGL, ""Redbook"" is the most famous one, but it is online for free.

, Render a primitive or 2D object to get started.

Make a 2D triangle, or a cube.
Look into ""Display Lists"" so you can draw many primitive objects.

, There aren't many games where you can't change where you're looking.

Make the perspective of your game (First person perspective, top-down, etc.)

, One step at a time! Except not actually because stepping is actually kind of complicated.

Either move everything around the camera or move the camera view port, but they are the same to the processor.
Be able to move in all angles, not just along the axis.

, That default color will get old after a while, and not many games are used with only solid colors.

Splice them into your display list(s).

, This makes your game much more interesting and realistic.

Perhaps footsteps for when you walk.

, This also adds to the realism.

Learn the different kinds of lighting.
Use a sphere instead of a cube to make sure the lighting is working.
You could put a primitive object where the light should be coming from to debug. Just make sure the light can get out of the box/sphere you put it into.

, The biggest thing people notice when you show them an incomplete game engine is the lack of proper collision detection.

Make it impossible to walk through the cube.
Make it possible to move (in other directions) when you are colliding with the cube.

, Most games have falling things somewhere.

Make a floor, and jump around on it.

, Don't forget to market it. You may want to enlist a marketer (friend) to help you. Assume your game is going to be a hit so that way you can work towards that.

Have Fun!

, Don't be coy, tell other developers that you made a game engine. You don't have to be the only one to develop with your engine. When you let other people use it, you have the right to some of their royalties, but also you get constructive feedback and perhaps improvements to your engine.

Game Engines are valuable and impressive.
Did you notice how much those other engines are charging indie developers? (You could be that engine!)
Use your engine to get wannabe game developers into the industry!

, Start your journey into the booming game industry!

Now you can laugh at your friends who said ""Unity was easier"".

What you do in 3DS max is you create the models/characters used in the game and so now create a simple character, save it, create an environment, save that, make a turret (enemy that shoots frequently at you, could be an archer/cannon/guy with guns) and save that (all those files should be saved separately).

, Create a new scene where you separately load the 3 files and put them together, with a few scripting learned by the tutorials the turret shoots at the character you can steer and attack back.

, This is also the time to pick up your list and scratch things and add them to your game.

, Music could be very important. Do not forget to make trigger sounds like gun sound, walking or shouting.

, Do this by making it attractive so you can pay your server payments back with ""google ads"".

, Add attractive extras which the gamers may buy so you can have your profit. Promote your game!

Flash is best suited for simple games, so focus on creating a game that has only a few mechanics for the player to worry about. Try to have a basic genre and some mechanics in mind before you start prototyping. See this guide for more details on the planning phases of video game development. Common Flash games include:


Endless runners: These games automatically move the character, and the player is responsible for jumping over obstacles or otherwise interacting with the game. The player typically only has one or two options when it comes to controls.
Brawlers: These are typically sidescrolling and task the player with defeating enemies to progress. The player character often has several moves that they can perform to defeat enemies.
Puzzles: These games ask the player to solve puzzles to beat each level. These can range from Match-3 style such as Bejeweled to more complex puzzle solving typically found in Adventure games.
RPGs: These games focus on character development and progression, and have the player moving through multiple environments with a variety of enemy types. Combat mechanics vary wildly from RPG to RPG, but many are turn-based. RPGs can be significantly more difficult to code than a simple action game.;
, Flash is best-suited for 2D games. It is possible to create 3D games in Flash, but it is very advanced and requires significant knowledge of the language. Almost every successful Flash game has been 2D.


Flash games are also best suited for quick sessions. This is because most Flash game players play when they have a little free time, such as on breaks, meaning gaming sessions are typically 15 minutes or less.

, Flash games are programmed in AS3, and you will need to have some basic understanding of how it works in order to successfully create a game. You can create a simple game with a rudimentary understanding of how to code in AS3.


There are several books about ActionScript available on Amazon and other stores, along with a large number of tutorials and examples online.

, This program costs money, but is the best way to create Flash programs quickly. There are other options available, including open-source options, but they often lack compatibility or take longer to accomplish the same tasks.


Flash Professional is the only program you will need to start creating games.

, When you are creating a basic game, there are several different code structures that you will be using. There are three main parts of any AS3 code:


Variables - This is how your data is stored. Data can be numbers, words (strings), objects, and more. Variables are defined by the code var and must be one word.




var playerHealth:Number = 100;
 
// ""var"" designates that you are defining a variable.
// ""playerHealth"" is the variable name.
// ""Number"" is the type of data.
// ""100"" is the value assigned to the variable.
// All actionscript lines end with "";""





Event Handlers - Event handlers look for specific things to occur, and then tells the rest of the program. This is essential for player input and repeating code. Event handlers typically call upon functions.




addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, swingSword);
 
// ""addEventListener()"" defines the event handler.
// ""MouseEvent"" is the category of input that is being listened for.
// "".CLICK"" is the specific event in the MouseEvent category.
// ""swingSword"" is the function that is called when the event occurs.





Function - Sections of code assigned to a keyword that can be called upon later. Functions handle the bulk of your game's programming, and complex games can have hundreds of functions while simpler games may only have a few. They can be in any order since they only work when they are called upon.




function swingSword (e:MouseEvent):void;
{
        //Your code goes here
}
 
// ""function"" is the keyword that appears at the start of every function.
// ""swingSword"" is the name of the function.
// ""e:MouseEvent"" is an added parameter, showing that the function 
// is called from the event listener.
// "":void"" is the value that is returned by the function. If no value
// is returned, use :void.






, ActionScript is used to affect objects in Flash. In order to make a game, you will need to create objects that the player will interact with. Depending on the guides you are reading, objects may be referred to as sprites, actors, or movie clips. For this simple game, you will be creating a rectangle.


Open Flash Professional if you haven't already. Create a new ActionScript 3 project.
Click the Rectangle drawing tool from the Tools panel. This panel may be in different locations depending on the configuration of Flash Professional. Draw a rectangle in your Scene window.
Select the rectangle using the Selection tool.

, With your newly-created rectangle selected, open the Modify menu and select ""Convert to Symbol"". You can also press F8 as a shortcut. In the ""Convert to Symbol"" window, give the object an easily recognizable name, such as ""enemy"".


Find the Properties window. At the top of the window, there will be a blank text field labeled ""Instance name"" when you hover over it. Name it the same as you did when you converted it to a symbol (""enemy""). This creates a unique name that can be interacted with through AS3 code.
Each ""instance"" is a separate object that can be affected by code. You can copy the already created instance multiple times by clicking the Library tab and dragging the instance onto the scene. Each time you add one, the name will be changed to designate that it's a separate object (""enemy"", ""enemy1"", ""enemy2"", etc.).
When you refer to the objects in the code, you simply need to use the instance name, in this case ""enemy"".

, Once you have an instance made, you can adjust the properties through AS3. This can let you move the object around the screen, resize it, and so on. You can adjust properties by typing the instance, followed by a period ""."", followed by the property, followed by the value:



enemy.x = 150; This affects the position of the enemy object on the X-axis.

enemy.y = 150; This affects the position of the enemy object on the Y-axis. The Y-axis is calculated from the top of the scene.

enemy.rotation = 45; Rotates the enemy object 45° clockwise.

enemy.scaleX = 3; Stretches the width of the enemy object by a factor of 3. A (-) number will flip the object.

enemy.scaleY = 0.5; Squishes the object to half its height.

, This command will return the current values for specific objects, and is useful for determining if everything is running as it should. You may not want to include the Trace command in your final code, but it is useful for debugging.

, Now that you have a basic understanding of the core functions, you can create a game where the enemy changes size every time you click on it, until it runs out of health.var enemyHP:Number = 100; 
// sets the enemy's HP (health) to 100 at the start.
var playerAttack:Number = 10; 
// sets the players attack power when they click.
 
enemy.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, attackEnemy); 
// By adding this function directly to the enemy object, 
// the function only happens when the object itself is 
// clicked, as opposed to clicking anywhere on the screen.
 
setEnemyLocation(); 
// This calls the following function to place the enemy
// on the screen. This occurs when the game starts.
 
function setEnemyLocation ():void
{
 enemy.x = 200; 
 // moves the enemy to 200 pixels from the left of the screen
 enemy.y = 150; 
 // moves the enemy down 150 pixels from the top of the screen
 enemy.rotation = 45; 
 // rotates the enemy 45 degrees clockwise
 trace(""enemy's x-value is"", enemy.x, ""and enemy's y-value is"", enemy.y); 
 // Displays the current position of the enemy for debugging
}
 
function attackEnemy (e:MouseEvent):void 
// This creates the attack function for when the enemy is clicked
{
 enemyHP = enemyHP - playerAttack; 
 // Subtracts the attack value from the HP value, 
 // resulting in the new HP value.
 enemy.scaleX = enemyHP / 100; 
 // Changes the width based on the new HP value.
 // It is divided by 100 to turn it into a decimal.
 enemy.scaleY = enemyHP / 100; 
 // Changes the height based on the new HP value
 
 trace(""The enemy has"", enemyHP, ""HP left""); 
 //Output how much HP the enemy has left
}




, Once you've created the code, you can test your new game. Click the Control menu and select Test Movie. Your game will begin, and you can click the enemy object to change its size. Your Trace outputs will be displayed in the Output window.

, ActionScript is based off Java, and uses a very similar package system. Packages allow you to store variables, constants, functions, and other information in separate files, and then import these files into your program. These are especially useful if you want to use a package that someone else has developed that will make your game easier to create.


See this guide for more details on how packages work in Java.

, If you're creating a game with multiple images and sound clips, you'll want to create a folder structure for your game. This will allow you to easily store your different elements, as well as store different packages to call on.


Create a base folder for your project. In the base folder, you should have an ""img"" folder for all of your art assets, a ""snd"" folder for all of your sound assets, and a ""src"" folder for all of your game packages and code.
Create a ""Game"" folder in the ""src"" folder to store your Constants file.
This particular structure isn't necessary, but is an easy way to organize your work and materials, especially for larger projects. For the simple game explained above, you will not need to create any directories.

, A game without sound or music will quickly become boring to the player. You can add sound to objects to Flash using the Layers tool. See this guide for more details.

, If your game has a lot of values that will remain the same throughout the game, you can create a Constants file to store all of them in one place so that you can easily call on them. Constants can include values such as gravity, player speed, and any other value that you may need to call on repeatedly.If you create a Constants file, it will need to be placed in a folder in your project and then imported as a package. For example, let's say you create a Constants.as file and place it in your Game directory. To import it, you would use the following code:




package
{
        import Game.*;
}






, While many developers won't reveal the code for their games, there are a variety of project tutorials and other open projects that will allow you to see the code and how it interacts with game objects. This is a great way to learn some advanced techniques that can help your game stand out.

"
This is probably the most blatantly obvious but important step: Make sure the final boss has a major role in the story!,
Make sure it's hard.,
Try to make it epic!,
Have music that is very catchy and all but impossible not to like.,
Make sure their health is high compared to the other bosses (except for optional bosses and bosses that you are supposed to deliberately lose against, although optional bosses can be weaker than the final boss).

,
While the boss should be very hard, make sure that they are beatable.,
Get the right instruments.,
Try to see how hard the final boss is without various items that are in the arena.,
Make it your own.",How to Make a Final Boss," Quite frankly the whole main villain=final boss is cliched but not overused. It's the best strategy to go with. The final boss is typically the cause of the protagonist having to go through so much trouble, so show that.;
, Something that many sites categorize as a disappointing final boss is a boss who can be killed in one or two tries. Try to make your boss be so powerful and such that he/she can't be killed in the first three tries. Make the final boss merciless, if possible.

, If you think about it through and through the final boss fight is the exact same thing as a climax except for video games instead of film. Try to have the regular stuff: dark skies, lightning, rain, etc. Or alternatively, if your game is a more kid-friendly game, don't do that and go for something that will get the E rating (if you're being rated) and make it easy on the feelings, however still make it epic enough to get the E rating.

, Many video games nowadays have the tendency to make the final boss music a remix of the game's main theme but a much darker tone. This is a good strategy but be creative, or not do this at all and make an entirely different track.

,, The prime example of a game that does not obey this rule is Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! where the eponymous final boss is commonly cited as one of the, if not the, hardest final boss(es) in video game history.

, For music the most commonly-used instruments for a final boss is an organ and/or opera. This isn't a must however. In the video game Banjo-Kazooie the final boss' music was very catchy and a remix of the game's main theme but rather Rare (the company that made the game) used just about every instrument but organ and opera. However, feel free to do what you want so long as it ain't copyright infringement.

, If it's pretty hard no matter what then try to put a few must-need collectibles hidden in the arena and perhaps even a few health items. If it's pretty easy with these collectibles then by all means omit them to make the final boss all the more challenging. A save point and a few treasure chests is a must, especially in the RPG genre.

, Don't try to base your final boss fight off of another one (since this would classify as plagiarism which is illegal) but make it as original as possible. If you can't do that then take bits and pieces from many other memorable final boss fights and meld them together until it's virtually recognizable of the other elements. If you can't do that, then remix it off of a regular boss but make it much tougher.

"
Formulate and create a plan of work for your project.,
Decide the genreof your game.,
Decide the Settingof your game.,
Decide the graphical/visual style of the game.",How to Make a Computer Game for Free1," This step is usually neglected by most people who are seeking to create a new game, programmers and non-programmers alike. However, it is also one of the major reasons for most of the failed first trials. This mainly includes deciding how much time and resources will be dedicated to each task within the project and the relationship between these tasks. The processes themselves need to be identified first of course. Read further on this article to identify the different tasks that you will eventually need to perform.;
, Game genres are categorizations of games based on game-play style and interaction. This can be:



Action Games: where the game-play relies heavily on quick user reflexes, good timing, accuracy, or any combination of these factors to progress further in the game.

Adventure Games: where the game-play relies on non-confrontational approaches that requires little or no quick reflexes. The game progresses through solving puzzles, performing tasks or interacting with the environment of the game and characters in it.

Action-Adventure Games: where the game-play style is a mixture of the two previous genres. For example, there are long term goals/tasks the requires quick reflexes to be completed and the game progresses through performing sequential tasks, each or some of which is a kind of a mini-game that is action based.

Role Playing Games (RPGs): where the players take on specific ""roles"" in the game's setting and progress their character in-game through acquiring skill-points or experience. Some of these games are turn based but some use a more real-time approach. Massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) is a sub-genre of this genre, where multiple players share the same game environment and some tasks requires the cooperation of multiple players to perform.

Simulation Games: where the game-play depends on simulating aspects of real-life or some imaginary fantasy setting.

Strategy Games: where the playing style requires mostly careful planning and skillful thinking.

Board and Card Games: the game play is based on a set of cards that needs to be handled according to a certain set of rules or on manipulating ""pieces"" on a board.

, The setting of the game includes one or more of the following components:



Location/Geography. The location at which the story of the game takes place. This might be the detailed map of a fictional land or the layout of a military compound. This can be a fictional/fantasy world, a parallel universe, another dimension, a new continent, a certain country in a certain era, a specific-use compound ... etc.

History. The back-story of the game outlining what happened so far in the location decided for the game that is of interest to the game-play.

Mode. This decides the general theme of the game in some way. It can be a ""dark"" themed game, a utopian one or a childish one even. This is vastly influenced by the target group of your game, which you should decide during the planning phase.

Game Society. You have to give the background necessary for the characters involved in the game-play including back-stories and features.

, Will your game be a two dimensional or three dimensional game? Will graphics be fancy or crude? Will characters be rendered in cartoon-like manner, comical one, or real-life style?

"
"
Calculate your available budget.,
Research available gaming engines based on the choices you made during the planning phase.,
Decide whether you need to learn programming or not.,
Research you options for reaching the required level of skill at the programming language necessary.,
Make the necessary purchases.,
Learn to use your game engine.

,
Read at least an introduction to software engineering models.",How to Make a Computer Game for Free2," Neither over, nor underestimate your resources.

, For example, if you choose to create a cards/board game, you probably won't need a fancy graphics engine and you'll find many open source game engines dedicated to card games. However, if you're planning on creating a first person shooter action game, chances are you'll need a more powerful game and graphics engine(s).


Take into consideration your current level of programming skill and the programming languages you're skilled at. For example, if you have no prior knowledge of programming, you'll need an engine that requires no programming skills.
Take into consideration the level of documentation the game engine provides.
If you can't find an engine that fits your criteria of budget and prior-programming knowledge, research game engines that require programming knowledge at the simplest level possible and see if you find one that fits your other criteria. If not go up a little in the programming skill requirement until you find an engine that fits you other criteria.

, This includes deciding:


Whether you need to learn a programming language at all according to your game engine of choice.
What programming language you need to learn and for what platform.
What skill level you're required to reach to be able to use your game engine of choice

, Will you have to take courses or will an online tutorial be enough? How will that affect your budget?

, Make sure to include the game engine documentation in your purchases if the documentation is sold separately.

,, Though not an absolute necessity, it will greatly help.

"
"
Start small.,
Divide and conquer.,
Take notes and use feedback.,
Use a design model, and stick to it.,
Be patient.",How to Make a Computer Game for Free3," Trying to start with a sophisticated game implementing the whole thing at once will most likely end up being frustrating.

, Don't try to solve all problems at once. Instead, try dividing problems into smaller ones and so on until you get to manageable problems that you can tackle.

, Show what's finished to closed circuits of friends or family. Modify your design according to the feedback you take from reviewers.

, Do not make the mistake of changing models halfway unless it is absolutely necessary.

, Creating a game is not a one day/week job. Some games are not a one year job!

"
"
Design you marketing campaign.,
Test, test, and test again.,
Implement your marketing campaign and publish your game.

,
Take feedback from gamers who play your game.

",How to Make a Computer Game for Free4," This does not necessarily be a commercial-based one. However, you need to increase the visibility of your game so that you can get more feedback which will eventually help in improving your game and your game-creation abilities alike.

, Though nothing is perfect, you should try to be as close as you can to it.

Complete the Registration Form on the Indie Games Challenge website.,
Mail the following:


Mail Your Video Game on a Disc (10 copies).,
Mail Your Video Elevator Pitch on a Disc (2 copies).,
Mail a copy of your Registration Confirmation Page and your PayPal Confirmation Receipt.,
Mail everything to: Indie Game Challenge Tennyson Parkway Building 2 Plano, TX 75024.",How to Get Your Video Game Published for the Indie Game Challenge," Are you competing individually or on a team? It may be difficult for some people to work with others and for some working on a team is a dream. Though it will be a lot more work on your own, it may be best for you. On the other hand, if you like collaboration and exchanging ideas then be apart of a group.;
, Choose someone on your team that knows the game inside and out. Have this person be the point of contact and keep your team up to date with your game’s progress during the selection process. If your team does get chosen, your Team Captain must speak on behalf of your team and the game itself so choose wisely amongst your peers.

, Don’t walk into uncharted territory if you absolutely cannot contend with those more experienced than you. What separates an amateur from a professional in the game industry is only a matter of two years, but it makes a difference to wait a little while before you can contend with the big boys. If you don’t have much experience but can still create a great game, then choose the non-professional challenge. If you’ve been in the industry for a while and think you’re hot stuff, then compete in the professional challenge.

, Quite possibly to most arduous task you will ever come across. It will either be really easy or super hard if you put too much thought into it. You will need to fill out as much information as you possibly can about you, your team and your game. Keep everything brief, yet concise and to the point. Your submission (along with THOUSANDS of others) will go through a set of judges. Make yours stand out amongst the rest of them. What makes your game great? Highlight that.

, #There’s going to be a lot of people who are going to test your game which is why so many copies must be made. Once again, you need to submit 10 copies of your game on CDs, DVDs and 10 sets of any special equipment or hardware that goes with your game. Things like: graphics cards, 3D glasses, controllers, etc etc. Furthermore, you guys will need to categorize your game into 3 categories—casual, core or cause. And lastly, you should have an installer that comes with your game and a document with instructions. I realize that it’s a long process for anyone and everyone who decides to enter the Indie Game Challenge, but you need to be meticulous and follow these guidelines for success.

, This is where things can get fun. Be creative! Your elevator pitch must be at 60 seconds or less. This is your chance to wow all the judges with your savvy and wit. Create a trailer, commercial, public announcement, anything that will catch the judge’s attention. Have fun with this one!

, Simple as this is, there are going to be entrants out there that miss this step. So don’t! Double check, or triple check all your steps up and to this point. You wouldn’t want your submission to be thrown away because you didn’t have the right materials in do you? Of course not! All entries must be submitted via PayPal for $100 via the contest website (www.indiegamechallenge.com), but if you’re super cool and have a GameStop Edge Membership then you only need to pay $75. If you’re one of the lucky people in Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland, North Dakota, and Vermont…you don’t have to pay an application fee! (By law). Keep in mind that all the entry fees that will be received go towards game development scholarships. Not towards any leisurely activities for the promoters. It’s for those who put in the hard work day in and day out to make a great game. And besides, $100 isn’t that much as you probably put more than that into your game anyway. It’s for you and your future as a game developer. Don’t take cost into consideration when a big opportunity like this comes along.

Know what an orbit really is.,
Design a ship capable of reaching orbit.,
Try breaking the design down into 3 main stages or sections.,
Keep 'Delta-V' in mind.,
Get in the mindset.,
Launch your rocket.,
Perform your 'Gravity Turn'.,
Burn till your apoapsis>70 kilometers (43 mi).,
'Coast' till you reach your apoapsis.,
Perform your circularization burn.,
Enjoy the view!,
Remember to come back home, point the ship with WASD at the retrograde marker, the yellow circle with the cross through it(against your direction of travel) and burn until your periapsis is below about 20 kilometers (12 mi).

",How to Achieve Orbit in Kerbal Space Program," Getting to space and getting to orbit are two very different things. Getting to space means you simply leave Kerbin's atmosphere by going above 70 kilometers (43 mi). Getting to orbit involves gaining appropriate lateral velocity (speeding up side-ways) while also propelling yourself vertically.;
, Everyone has their own style of ship-building; where one persons rocket may have 20 elaborate stages, another players ship may only have two stages and still be able to get just as high an orbit. Try playing around with a few stock ships and ships from the forums. If you find a design you like, adapt it to suit your style and/or needs.

, The first being the boost stage. This stage is your least efficient stage with the most power and biggest rockets. The 'Mainsail' engine or the �LV-T45 for a small rocket would be perfect. Solid rocket boosters also provide high thrust but remember that you can't turn them off! Your transfer stage should kick in as you approach the 900m/s mark when you are almost tilted over towards the horizon. This will push your apoapsis up to around 70–100 kilometers (43–62 mi). Your third stage or orbital module should be used only to circularise your orbit and de-orbit and an LV-909 or Poodle engine attached to a small fuel tank (like the FL-T400 or X200-16) will be fine.

, 'Delta-V' means 'Change in velocity' and is measured in m/s. Your delta-V is linked with the fuel capacity, weight and efficiency of your rocket. You will need around 4500m/s (4700m/s with safety margin) Delta-V to get to orbit around Kerbin. To find how much Delta-V your rocket has, use this formula: (http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet#Delta-v_.28.CE.94v.29) you can also use this: (http://www.kerbalspacecalculator.net16.net/stageDVCalc.html)

, Ok, to do this you are going to need to think big. KSP is not for the faint of heart, It's a giant universe out there, get ready for it!

, At this stage you simply want it to go straight up until you reach an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) Consider turning SAS on and keeping your thrust at 2/3rds for lighter rockets. (depending on the weight of the rocket). Obviously, some rocket designs will require full thrust at launch, it is simply good practice to not exceed terminal velocity so that you don't waste fuel. Speed should be 120m/s at 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) and let it slowly increase

, The gravity turn is the manoeuvre that will start giving you lateral velocity. You will want to tilt over to about 45 degrees east(right), this angle will allow your craft to continue to rise into the skies while gaining that needed lateral velocity. It is always good practice to launch your rockets into an anti-clockwise orbit (an eastward gravity turn) as this will let the planets rotational velocity add to your orbital velocity.

, Your apoapsis is the highest point in your orbit and is marked in the map view by 'Ap'. you can hover over the marker to see its altitude or you can click on it to see it without having to hover over it. 70 kilometers (43 mi) is the altitude at which Kerbin's atmosphere ends, if your apoapsis is under this altitude, you will not be able to achieve a stable orbit as friction from the atmosphere will cause your craft to slow down and fall back to the rocky ground.

, 'Coasting' just means 'hit the time warp!'. You will want to warp to your apoapsis for your next burn.

, At this point you will be changing your sub-orbital trajectory into an orbital trajectory. You will do this by pointing 'Pro-Grade' and burning till your periapsis>70 kilometers (43 mi).

, If you have followed these steps correctly, you should be looking at a rather round planet! Well done!

A few days before the LAN, download the latest patches, mods, and maps for the games you plan to play.,
Set up the room the night before the LAN.",How to Host a LAN Party," You can probably host a smaller LAN party (6-16 people) with equipment you already have. For larger LANs (16 or more people) you may need to buy/rent more equipment. The other limiting factor is the venue. A good way to gauge how much room you will need is to plan for 2 people per 6-foot table.;
, The garage is perfect for smaller LAN parties. You can usually fit about 20 gamers in the average size 2-car garage. If you need more room, start looking for large meeting halls. Try asking around at local colleges, churches, Elks lodges, and other public spaces. Finding free space is best, but if no owners are willing, then a hotel meeting room may be your best option. It can cost a lot of money, but they will be able to provide you with reliable power, air conditioning, and even tables and chairs.

, You will need at minimum a router (ex: Linksys BEFSR41 or D-Link EBR-2310). Most routers only have 4 network ports, so if you plan to have more than 3 people over, then may also need a switch (ex: Linksys EZXS16W or D-Link DES-1024D). You should have 1 network port per person. 10/100BaseT equipment is more than adequate for gaming, although gigabit speeds are nice for fast file transfers. However, if you want to save money (and who doesn't?), you can find cheap 48-port 10/100 switches on eBay. The switch plugs into the router, and all the gamers plug into the switch. Some network guidelines depending on the size of your LAN party follow:


Up to 10 PCs - You will need a network card for every PC, a small 100BASE-TX Ethernet switch, and at least 2 100BASE-TX network cables; you may be able to purchase a network starter kit.
11 - 40 PCs - Get 100BASE-TX switches with enough ports for all your guests (or multiple switches with linkup ports) and enough cables to connect the computers to the switches. To save time and headaches, ask guests to have their network cards installed and configured and TCP/IP protocol installed before they show up. They should also bring their own switches and cables, but you should have some extra just in case.
41 - 200 PCs - In addition to the previously listed equipment, you will need switches (preferably 10/100, at least one port for each 40 people) and dedicated servers in order to avoid a lag. Consider running all your servers on 100 Base-TX, or a gigabit network.

, If you overload your circuits, the circuit breaker will trip and the pressure will be on for you to fix it on the spot. The best solution is to be prepared.


If hosting in your garage or house, you will need extension cords to run from electrical sockets around the house. This is because you can only plug so many computers into one circuit. To determine which sockets are on which circuits, you will need to go out to the circuit breaker box. If you are lucky, then the circuits are labeled. If not, you will need a 2nd person in the house who can tell you which room's lights go out when you flip off each circuit.
If you are at a hotel venue or using a generator (see Tips), you will be provided with distribution boxes, which have multiple 20 amp circuits. A good guideline is 4 gamers on a 15 amp circuit and 6 gamers on a 20 amp circuit. Run extension cords to each table to evenly distribute power, and make sure the gamers know which plug they should plug into.
It's a good idea to check every circuit and map it out on a piece of paper, hand out a copy to everyone, and label each outlet. Be careful with refrigerators and air conditioning being on the same circuit as PCs. When their compressors turn on, they draw a lot of power.

, For a small LAN, your dining table and desk may be all you need. For a garage LAN, you may have to rent some folding tables and chairs. Your local party rental store will be able to help you out for less than $100. 6 foot (1.8 m) tables are the perfect size for 2 gamers. 8 foot (2.4 m) tables can fit 3 gamers with a bit of a squeeze. As already mentioned, hotel meeting rooms will have tables and chairs already available for you.

, Choose a variety of game styles (FPS, RTS, Racing). Keep in mind that choosing only the newest games will alienate gamers with older PCs. If you are planning a tournament, decide the game, format, rules, and maps. You may want to run software like LanHUB or Autonomous LAN Party, which helps you track the tournament ladders.

, Most games today will benefit from having a dedicated server, even running on a modest PC. Search the internet for configuration files, and get everything installed and tested. Learn server commands. You don't want to be setting this up the day of the LAN.

, No one can sit at a computer for 24 hours straight (...at least they shouldn't). Try classic LAN party games, like dodgeball, hard drive shuffleboard, and power supply chucking'.

, It can be as simple as ordering pizzas or a group exodus to a local restaurant. You could also plan a BBQ or hire .

, The date may be determined by when the venue is available. For small LANs, try to make it at least 3 weeks in advance (2 months for larger LANs) so people can keep their schedule open.

, It's surprisingly easy to do. Companies like Intel, AMD, nVidia, Antec, OCZ, and Alienware] will send you small things like stickers, posters, and t-shirts. If your LAN is of a good size, you might be able to get some hardware to give away. Make it worth their while. Prizes can make your LAN party more appealing, but they should never be the focus. You're there for the gaming!

, This is the most important step! Post in forums, list it on LANparty.com, Blue's News, and post fliers in the area. Have your friends tell their friends. Make it clear what time it takes place, what games will be played, and what the person should bring with them.

, Organize them onto a shared folder on your computer or a dedicated file server. This way, gamers can update their games without throttling your internet connection. You may even want to burn these files to CDs, to hand out to the LAN attendees.

,


Set up chairs, tables and trash cans.
Prepare a sign-in sheet, and have assigned IP addresses next to each name. (assigned IPs are unnecessary if you are running a DHCP server)
Print out hand-outs welcoming the guests and describing some rules and guidelines.
Set up and connect your networks and servers, and test away.

The ghosts go in different directions, so try to remember their movement patterns.,
The place where you have started, go the opposite direction and DON'T go down(instead go up).

,
Keep going up until you have reached the top aisle on the drawing.

,
The red ghost will be the last one to chase you, and the blue one will be the first because you are at the very top.,
Go down and eat the fruit in the middle because you have time before they regrow.

,
Whenever you see the Pink or Blue ghost coming for you, go into the tunnels or just eat all the small dots on the bottom of the screen.,
To escape Orange Ghosts, you have to always eat the fruit in the middle to make him stunned and he won't chase after you.,
To escape Red ghost, just eat the Power Pellet, because even if they have regrown, they run away for 8 seconds, and start chasing you again.

",How to Eat Ghosts in Pacman Without Being Caught," The Red ghost always goes around the whole screen from right to left to make its way to you. The Pink Ghost always goes after you by going from any direction except the bottom. The Light Blue Ghost comes from sides of you and will always go through the tunnels that take you to the opposite direction (if the Pac-Man you are playing has tunnels) The Orange ghost also goes any direction, but except the right side of you, and most likely to catch you from the left.;
,,, Eat the Power Pellet for the points, so go after all the ghosts, because by then all the ghosts are close to you.

,, This way, the Pink and Blue ghosts will take at least 15-20 seconds to chase you again. When you have eaten all the bottom dots, and go through the tunnel, they both go around the screen and they don't chase you for a period of time.

, Note that the Orange ghost will start chasing you quick because they go buy the points, and divide the number of the 1st number on your score=that's how much time they don't chase you(eg. you have 500 points=2.5 seconds they don't chase you.)so it is only on luck because low points can be good or bad and high points can be good or bad.

Perfect your throw.,
While learning, aim for the 3000 hole, the one in the very center of the board.",How to Do Well at Arcade Iceball," Bend over low enough so you can reach the pocket of balls on the right, and you can just reach touch the surface of the ""run way"" with the tip of your middle finger, and make sure your throwing arm is lined up in the middle of the lane. Swing your arm back and forth if you wish to get a feel for it.


Without moving your back, grab a ball. Practice swing again if you want to.
Then roll it down the lane at a decent speed. Too fast and it will crash into the cage covering the holes. Too slow and it'll bounce out of the bottom circle resulting in 0 points.
It will take one or two tries to get used to rolling the ball. The slickness of the lane, the weight of the ball, and the flimsiness of the holes can affect how the ball will act, so adjust your throw accordingly.;
, You will hit it fairly often, and occasionally it will bounce up to the 4000 or even the 5000 hole, but it might bounce out but will be caught in the 2000 hole!

, Using a mouse to click can help you click faster than the click that is done using the laptop cursor. This is because of the hand position and the science involved in clicking.

, Remember the keys and be alert to press it when needed. (for example if you press left mouse clicker when you were pressing right mouse clicker)

Some computers have a setting that allows you to adjust your sensitivity so you can click faster., Get your mouse ready, and place your pointer finger on the left (or right) mouse clicker. Make sure it is either at a large slant or straight up and down.


Keep your finger near the mouse, and between clicks, don't take your finger very far away from your mouse, or even keep your finger on the mouse.
Click lightly. You don't want to put to much pressure on the mouse, or it can slide out of position. Even worse, it can slow the speed of your clicks.
Be sure to have a good grip or the mouse can slide out of your hand.
Make sure your hand is not doing something else, like scrolling.
If you are not doing anything else, and have your other hand free, you can use both hands. Put both of your fingers on your mouse, and alternate clicking between your hands. Get a rhythm in your head, and put it into your fingers.
If you still are not clicking fast enough try an auto-clicker, if it's allowed in what you are doing. Some gaming servers don't allow auto-clickers. If it is allowed, then download one and follow the instructions on how to use it.

, A good choice is a Razer mouse. Other preferable gaming mice companies are Logitech, Cyborg, Mad Catz,Steel Series etc.


Keep practicing, keep playing games, go online to check your clicks per minute.

,


Try the game Osu on PC. This game trains up your reaction times so you can actually see something at a faster speed than normal; this is usually for gamers.
Try out some FPS games. They greatly involve reaction times and some games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive can get your reactions times to a new level.
Play around with other games; search up reaction time games and play around with them!You can try copter game online.

,


Download a mouse clicking software. There are many free and paid software such as GS auto-clicker that can click the mouse. If you own a Razer mouse, you can download Razer Synapse, and set up your own auto-clicking program, and bind it to an extra button.
Set up a clicking macro to click automatically for you. Some mice don't support macros but many gaming mice do.

Understand the way the claw is programmed to close.,
Be aware of the peculiarities of the older machines.,
Choose your machine.,
Pick the target toy.,
Position the claw over the selected toy.,
Drop the claw when you think you've got it.

,
Watch the claw with 100 percent focus.,
Adapt to the results of your ""fishing."",
If you haven't won, repeat the process to try again.",How to Beat the Crane," Most machines have a setting which can be set by the operator to tighten the claw once in X amount of tries with a bit of randomization. Effectively, this means that the claw will be ""loose"" most of the time, but will tighten once in every X amount of turns (on an average––not necessarily every nth turn), so people only win every so often.


There are also alternative, tricky programming for some machines. On such machines, there is a dual strength setting that causes them to grip with full strength initially and loosen after some time, giving the impression that the toy was caught but managed to slip. This effectively makes the machine more like a slot gambling machine rather than one depending on skill!;
, Some older machines have claws with fixed strength from turn to turn. This is because these machines have claws with strengths that are fixed with a screw by opening the machine. In the case of such an older machine, skill can make quite a difference.

, Don't play a machine that only has a right and forward button, when you've pressed and released each button once the claw will drop without you getting the chance to adjust. Look for one with a joystick and a ""drop"" button.

, When selecting the toy you think you can get, put aside the toy you really want but is trapped. There are ways to enhance the chances you'll get something from the machine:


Close in on a toy that is on top of the pile. If it has an arm or tail trapped under another toy, it won't come up, so avoid that one. The claw is strong enough to lift a toy, but not to un-wedge one.
Consider the shape of the toy. Avoid choosing round toys as the claw will probably slip on the toy. Choose toys with features that allow the claw to have a better grip, like a doll with large pigtails.
Pay attention to how far the claw-track reaches––toys against the glass are a no-go.

, Stand in front of the machine to do left-right, but stand beside the machine to do forward-back. The mirror that's in most machines screws up depth perception.

,, Some claws drift left or right, some rotate and change the position of the prongs.

, You probably didn't get it.


If the prongs didn't close or let go of the animal without lifting it, stop immediately because the machine is broken or rigged.
If the claw grabbed the toy, then dropped it, try again.
If it missed entirely, adjust and don't forget to compensate for drift and rotation.

, That said, also know when to quit. If it's the toy you're after, you can probably get a very similar, better-made toy for 5-10 dollars at a box store or the mall. If you have spent two dollars, seriously evaluate whether it's worth it and whether the machine works. If you're after the thrill of the win, consider downloading an app for a game of skill and playing to win online without mounting cash losses.

Watch and listen to the game.,
Learn the rules.,
Master the basics of flipping.,
Get good at aiming.,
Nudge and tilt.,
Perfect your stance.,
Join a pinball league.,
Enjoy it.",How to Play Pinball Like a Pro," In order for the profits to trickle back upward, operators need as many players as they can get. This means that the last thing anyone in the industry wants is players walking away from machines confused and frustrated because they couldn't understand what they were doing. To combat this, machines today give the player lots of instruction. But some beginner players don't realize this and this miss easy hints from the game. So while you are playing, look at and listen to the machine.


""Look at"" mostly means watching the display. Most games from roughly 1990 onward will tell the player what they need to do next. Keep an eye also on the play field lights: often if you don't know what you are doing, just hitting a target with a flashing light in front of it will do something.
""Listen to"" means just that. Pinball machines have had speech since the late 70s, and will verbally tell the player about things going on in the game. And even the sound effects are designed the cue the player in certain ways. Start listening to the sounds games make in conjunction with the things they do and you'll start to get the connection. And this isn't trivial: often the sound is meant to tell you something like, ""Hey, I'm about to kick the ball at you really hard: be ready!"";
, It isn't just ball control, nudging and aim that makes the world's best players. Most modern machines have complicated rule sets, and learning what those rules are is a major part of getting high scores. For instance, many pinball machines from the past decade contain features and other scoring opportunities that can be ""stacked"" - meaning that two or more features can be activated at once. Rule sheets for most modern titles can be found at the Pinball Archive.

, While there will always be an element of chaos in pinball, in truth, very few balls that come down the playing field are completely out of the player's control. This is the key area which determines a player's skill level: bringing the ball under control. There are many advanced tricks, but for now let's address the basics:


Don't flip both flippers. Flip only the flipper that you need to. Flipping both will actually sometimes cause the player to ""drain"" (lose the ball) when they didn't need to.
After you've flipped, drop the flipper back down immediately. Leaving it up leaves a nice big gap for the ball to fall between.
In general, don't flip any more than you need to. And as you'll discover, that's way less than you might at first think. Once you've got that down, you'll notice that if you hold the flipper up at the right time, you can bring the ball to a dead stop. Great! You've learned how to ""catch"" the ball. This is a critical element of good play. Catching the ball lets you both stop and think of what shot you want to try to take next and aim carefully for it. There are other things that it also affords the advanced player that we will get into later. And for all players, it lets you stop and take a quick drink, smoke, or answer your cell phone if you're careful.
Some machines have more than two flippers. Before you start, be sure to look over the entire machine to find all of the flippers, so that you're ready when the ball is near any of them. (For that matter, some machines have more than two buttons. Some have an additional button on one or both sides that have special functions that come into play at various times in the game. Some have buttons on the lock bar, which is the metal bar above the glass that is closest to the player. Some have more than one plunger. Some have a gun or other type of auto-launch mechanism that at times will come into play for reasons other than just getting the ball onto the field. Be sure to note where all of the these things are, and pay attention to when it is time to use them.)

, You've now gotten to the point where you can bring the ball to a stop consistently and you're learning about what shots you want to try for. Excellent. Now you need to learn how to hit them consistently. The most important rule for aiming is simply that the closer to the tip the ball is, the more to the opposite side it will go. So, for example, let's say you're holding the ball on the left flipper. You drop the flipper and let the ball roll down. If you flip again quickly, you'll send the ball more to the left. If you let the boll roll down a little more towards the tip of the flipper, the more you'll send the ball to the right.


This is where instruction starts to slowly be taken over by instinct. While the above and other rules are accurate, in truth this is where you will need to start ""learning"" the machine--what direction and with what force a ball goes in conjunction with when and how you flip all comes down to the individual machine. Even two of the same machine can play very differently dependent upon a wide variety of physical factors: how strong the flippers are and what angles they are at, how clean the machine is, how steep the machine is, etc.
Aiming is thus a combination of knowing the general physical rules for a pinball machine and knowing the specifics of the machine that is in front of you. If you shoot for a ramp on a machine that is the same as the one that you normally play, but the shot goes early, adjust yourself, and shoot later next time. You're not playing against other players; you're playing against, and with, the machine.

, Don't be shy: a certain amount of nudging is considered perfectly fair play, and done right, can often save a ball that might have otherwise been lost.


Even more than aiming, when and how to nudge is an art form. Even among the experts, no two players approach this with the same philosophy. Some are aggressive, some passive, some judicious, and some wild. What is important is simply to remember that machines do have tilt sensors, and if you tilt, not only does your ball end, but in most games you will lose any end-of-ball bonus points that you might have accumulated; in some cases, this bonus can be enormous.
Most modern games will also warn you that you are playing too hard. Take the warnings seriously. The way that tilt bobs work, sometimes the moment you get the first warning you are already doomed, since the tilt bob will keep bouncing back and forth and hitting its surrounding ring even if you stopped touching the machine entirely. More often, though, you'll get your warnings, which build up over the course of the ball. Two to three tilt warnings is usually the default.

Do not hit the front coin door in frustration. Really, don't abuse the machines, period: these are expensive games, most operators don't fix them all that often, and it's just plain anti-social. But added to this is that many 80s and 90s games have ""slam tilt"" sensors on the front door. If this goes off, your game automatically ends.

, We've talked about how you play, but how do you stand? What is the best way to position yourself as you flip away? Again, there is no single standard here. Many players simply stand mostly straight, with a slight lean towards the game, no frills. Some hunch down. Some put one leg far ahead of the other. A few cross their legs. And a few even do a Karate Kid and stand mostly on one leg, seriously. Also some players play with gloves to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. Some play sitting down. Some junior players stand on a milk crate. Some play with and iPod on or with cigarette in their mouth. One player once played routinely with a miner's hat on. Whatever works for you, here is what is important to consider:


First, whatever stance you choose should be one that you can remain comfortable at for a long time. A good game can last 15-20 minutes. An epic game can last hours. Make sure that whatever you choose it's so comfortable that you don't think about it.
Second, make sure that your body is physically centered enough that you can nudge the machine forward without losing your equilibrium. A pinball machine weighs about 300 pounds; giving it just the right amount of force takes more physical precision than you would think.
Finally, don't give a hoot what other people think of your style. Pinball is like bowling or golf in this respect. When the ball is moving you might subconsciously strike all sorts of absurd poses, but as far as the game is concerned, a jackpot is a jackpot. Do what works.

, ""Huh? A pinball league? Those exist?"" Why yes, quite a lot of them do. Pinball leagues and tournaments have been around for decades, despite getting scant media coverage. Various web sites listing them come and go. Much of what you'll learn will come from just watching others play and getting ideas. There are also all kinds of online communities; just about every major social networking site (such as MySpace) that includes groups or forums has at least a few pinheads mulling about. However, what is arguably still the best gathering spot is in the ancient land of Usenet, at the newsgroup rec.games.pinball.

, Like any game, the object of pinball is ultimately to have fun. Sometimes, you may need to be reminded of this. Pinball is awfully fun when you're playing well. When you're not, or when the game just isn't being nice to you, it can get highly frustrating. Learn early on when to chalk it up to a spat of bad luck and keep on trucking, and learn when to just walk away and come back for another round another day.

Master the weapon that you are handling.,
Avoid using cheats.,
Be familiar with the MAP.,
Always have a secondary weapon on your side.,
Finish missions every day if you can.,
Cooperate with your teammates especially in DM matches and avoid trash- talking them.,
Use sound to your advantage.",How to Be a Good Crossfire Player," By doing so you can increase kills and might enjoy the game better. It is recommend that you not use different weapons until you have mastered the previous one! You may do it if you don't have a nice weapon but if you do have one try to master it. Know its RANGE, RECOIL, POWER and how to use it efficiently. It's all up to you on how well you know your weapon.;
, Cheating is a bad idea, play fair and square. You may say that you can enjoy more when you use cheats but you might regret when you get BANNED. Enhance your skills by playing fair and not under the table. Sometimes the X-Trap GameGuard cannot always detect cheat programs, but other players could save the game and can easily REPORT you in forums and if you were proven guilty, may result to a ban.

, Being familiar with the map is a great advantage especially in Deathmatch modes as you'll know where the enemy usually resides and where they hide. By doing this you can acquire a lot of kills.

, Always trust your secondary weapon you don't know when you ammo runs out. Desert eagle is a highly recommended secondary when your primary weapon ammo runs out. Time to get your secondary to assure your survival.

, It's a big deal for those who want to rank up fast and earn GP for those who plan to buy fancy weapons - by performing missions every day, you can easily rank up and get wealthy quickly. Sometimes for GP'S patience is needed as you plan to engage in missions.

, Cooperation gives a higher possibility of winning a match; going it alone always has a high chance of causing a team loss. Learning how to use radio messages is a very big help for your team, like when you spotted the C4, just press ""Z+4"". It notifies the them to guard the dropped C4 that should be planted by BlackList Team before time runs out. Don't always blame your teammates because you always die without getting help from them. Remember, not all players can act just like what you expect them to act. When you die, try to reflect on it and think on some ways to prevent dying again. Don't always rely on your team, sometimes you are still responsible on your own. Every player is important in every match just like in the game of chess.

, An enemy can't really sneak up on you if you hear them coming. Try using surround-sound headphones.

Select a character.",How to Choose a Character in Super Mario 3D World," Turn on the Wii U, and select the Super Mario 3D World icon. You will be brought to a title screen. Press the + button to proceed.;
, The next screen will be a file-selection screen. Select whichever file you have been playing, or start a new one. In total, the game has 3 file slots, and you can begin a new file by pressing the A button to select a blank file slot.

, If you start a new file, a brief cutscene will begin, laying out the plot for the game. If you did not start a new file, you will immediately be brought to the controller registration screen.

, Now you must register your controller. To do so, just press A on any controllers you want to use (up to 4 players can play at once). Once all controllers are registered, you will automatically be brought to the character selection screen.

, Before you decide who you want to play as, you can scroll through the four available characters by toggling to the left and right. The default character displayed is Mario; scrolling to the right once will bring up Luigi, twice Peach, and three times Toad. Scrolling through again after Toad brings you back to Mario.


Note that players cannot select the same character.

, Mario is the most balanced of the four characters, with decent sprint speed, jump height, average fall speed, 1-second sprint-activation time, and no special abilities.


Luigi has the highest jump height out of the characters, medium fall speed, decent sprint speed, 2-second sprint-activation time, and has worse traction than Mario.
Peach has a decent jump height, the slowest sprint speed, the slowest fall time, .75-second sprint-activation time, and has the ability to float through the air.
Toad has the lowest jump height, the fastest fall speed, the fastest sprint speed, and a 3-second sprint-activation time.

, Each character is a fine choice for any world; however, there are some that are more suited to certain types of terrain than others. Overall, Mario remains a good choice for any level, as he has no glaring weaknesses and has an average build.


With his high jump, Luigi is best suited to levels involving platforming, but does poorly on levels with many twists and turns as he is prone to falling off stages.
Peach is also great on platforming levels, as her float ability gives her the power to glide over obstacles and easily navigate jumps other characters would struggle with. She is not good for levels involving sprinting though.
Toad is best with speed-based levels and is not at all suited to platforming because of his quick fall speed and low jump height.

, Once you have decided which character you wish to play as, press the A button. After everyone has selected their characters, press the A button once more, and you will all be brought to the game’s world map.

Determine if your PC has a wireless adapter.,

If done correctly, you should be connected to Xbox Live.",How to Use Your Laptop As an Xbox Wireless Adapter," Virtually, every modern laptop within the past few years has a wireless adapter built-in. This doesn't exclude desktops from this but its much more unlikely its built-in and its probably an add-in. If you don't have one, you can still buy a wireless adapter at many stores such as Walmart and Best Buy.;
, It can be any Ethernet cable. The Xbox 360 automatically does a cross-over process so you don't need a special cable. Plug one end directly to your Xbox 360 and plug the other into the PC/Laptop. Almost every PC/Laptop has one of these. If you have both your PC/Laptop and Xbox 360 on, you will see a green light on the PC/Laptop connector and possibly an orange (data) flashing light. This means the connection is working.

, Right click the wireless connection and go to its properties window. Click the Advanced tab and go to the ""Internet Connection Sharing"" section. Check the ""Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"" box and uncheck the ""Allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection"" box below it.(On Windows 7 and vista, to get to the properties box, right click the small icon in the bottom right of the task bar that shows wireless connection, and select 'open network and sharing center'. In this window, click on the ""Change adapter settings"" link, right click on your wireless adapter, then click properties. Click the ""Sharing"" tab, then check the top box, uncheck the bottom box). Then click ok. We have finished setting up the PC/Laptop.

, Go to the Settings blade and go to Network Settings. Go to edit settings and go to section for IP addresses set it to automatic. Now test the settings. Everything should pass if set up correctly. The PC/Laptop should say that it found a local area connection. Your internet on your PC/Laptop should also work. If none of these work, something was probably not set up right. Go back and double check your settings and steps and keep retrying until it works.

,


Another method is to simply select both your wired and wireless connections, right-click, and select ""Bridge"" as stated below. This will automatically route the connections without the need to set your IP address on Windows XP.

Know your guns and how it works.,
Know the map.,
Choose a sniping spot.,
Use your team to your advantage.,
Your Profile.",How to Snipe in Xbox Games," in games shooting games like GRAW 2, Call of Duty 4, Rainbow 6 Vegas 2, etc., all of the guns have certain pros and cons. Some guns are more accurate and others more powerful. Some shoot quicker or have less recoil. So choose based on what you want to do. and remember, it's not likely that every kill is going to be one shot so don't just choose the most powerful gun.;
, Take time to walk around the map on your own and find out where the hiding spots are and how to move around the map without being seen.

, When looking for a sniping spot, there are 3 major things to consider. They are: line of sight, protection, and escape. Try to balance them out to find the best spot. Line of sight is how much of the map can you see and be able to fire upon. Protection is whether or not people easily see you. Escape routes are places that you can safely run to if you think you have been spotted.

, If your playing a team game then you need to use them. You can tell your team to attract the other players so all of you can shoot at them. Your teammates can also charge a group while you snipe at a different angle.

, by this I don't mean if you have a cool name or picture I'm talking about the size of a target you make. In most games there are 3 profiles, standing, crouching, and prone. Each has it's advantage in mobility, accuracy, and profile size. Ideally you want to be prone when firing but sometimes you will have to crouch or stand to get a better view. Just remember that you won't be able to move quite as well since you'll either have to stand up or crawl to get out of there.

The best car for going round corners will be the American team Honda car, buy it from the auction and it should come with adjustable parts.",How to Race Well in Forza 2," There are three regions, Asia, Europe, and North America. For example, if you like muscle cars, go for NA. If you want tunes (supras, skylines) go for Asia and etc. Each has a long list of cars available for purchase and each has different attributes which make them an enjoyable place to represent.;
, There are four major difficulty settings, but once selected you can go back and change any specific setting later. You earn extra money for having more difficult settings (up to 50% extra) but it also makes controlling the car harder.


The suggested brake line is helpful as it lets you know the optimal time to brake and gives you a good line around the corner.
ABS gives you anti-lock brakes, but you lose 10% of the money with it enabled, It really depends on how you brake, all it really does is keep your wheels from locking up and not letting you turn while braking.
TCS allows you to stomp on the gas with less fear of spinning out. It regulates your throttle so your tires don't spin.
STM also reduces the risk of spinning out; it controls the 'attitude' of the car by applying brakes to individual tires as you get sideways in a corner.
Tire wear and gas should be set to simulation as these do not become a problem until you get to endurance races, but by then you should be familiar enough to have your car setup well.
Damage difficulty allows your vehicle to get beat up (or not). Simulation means if you run into enough things you can make it so your car will hardly run. Limited allows your components to only be damaged to 50%. You can also disable damage all together.
AI difficulty should be raised or lowered depending on how well you do in races. Higher difficulty means you get more money, but you better have very good vehicle control or a lot better car.

, There are five important parts to a corner:


Braking point: this is the part of the straight before corner where you have a set location to start braking. This will vary depending on the vehicle you are using and speed you are traveling, but after a couple laps on a track, you should have this location nailed down. Without ABS, you should practice stopping your car in the shortest distance which is surprisingly close to real life.
Braking: just as in real life you need to separate your braking from your cornering. Even with ABS, braking in the corner will reduce how tightly the car can make the corner. Also, be sure to roll on the brake, as it will allow the weight transfer to reduce the stopping distance. Be sure you brake enough to slow down before you get to your turn in point.
Turn in point: this is the location that you start your turn. You want to start the turn in on the outside of the corner. At this point you want to roll off the brake (just letting go will disrupt your vehicle's balance), and roll the steering wheel into the corner (all the way).
Corner: You want to find the correct speed and turn in point to be able to apex the corner (the apex in a simple corner is the half-way mark on the inner side of the corner). The exterior-apex-exterior corner allows for the greatest speed to be carried through the corner, thus less braking, less accelerating, and ultimately faster lap times. In the corner, you want to give the vehicle enough gas to maintain the same speed, any speeding up, or slowing down will reduce the maximum available traction.
Accelerate out of the corner. Depending on how powerful your car is and whether or not you have TCS and/or STM enabled you will want to wait until you are aimed in a straight line before you stomp on the gas. If giving it gas on the exit of the corner, you want to roll on the gas smoothly to not rob any turning traction from your car.

, While you try to get a perfect corner in, it is very difficult to do.


As you enter the corner, if you see you are going too fast, you should tap the brakes early in the corner. This will temporarily reduce some under steer in the corner and reduce your speed which will allow you to take a tighter corner.
Use the throttle to steer. This takes a lot of practice and is hard to explain, but it is extremely important especially in long corners and sweepers. Turn in to the corner with the stick (steering wheel) all the way in. Use the amount of gas to adjust where you are in the corner. Less gas (less speed) will allow your vehicle to take the corner tighter, while more gas will do quite the opposite. Feathering the throttle in or out will keep you on the track, but remember that the reaction is somewhat delayed, so keep on top of your speed in the corners!

, Based on the amount of money you are getting in races, you should upgrade your car to help beat a circuit.


Don't buy any cars unless you have plenty of money. Especially early in the game, you will be able to race in a few circuits, and the cars you win in those circuits you can use in other circuits. The longer, more advanced races will give you more money, but will also require much more specific cars. This is when you should buy cars specifically for a race.
Upgrades can be taken off or sold if need be. A lot of the later races require a specific class of car, or specific horsepower. You many need to remove upgrades to fit into a lower class. For the horsepower-limited races, be sure to have as many maneuverability upgrades as possible to make the race easier.

, Be amazed but follow the top bit of this article and see how to take corners easily, this should make a difference to your corners.

Download the appropriate software you will need.,
Install all of the software.,
Rip our DVD to our hard drive now that all of the software is setup.,
Use MeGUI's D2V Creator tool to create a D2V file which is needed for MeGUI/AviSynth to handle MPEG-2 files (which is what DVD's use).,
Select which audio track(s) to demix - you can select more than one track if you want the encoded file to have multiple audio tracks.,

Make sure the ""On Save Close And Load To Be Encoded"" option and press the ""Save"" button to save the AviSynth script (by default, in the same directory as the D2V file, the file name is not important).,
Select ""x264"" as the ""Codec"" and ""MP4"" as the ""File Format"" in the ""Video Encoding"" section of MeGUI under the ""Input"" tab.,
Set the bitrate.,
Set up the audio encoding options.,
Select an audio codec to use.,
Press the ""AutoEncode"" button to launch the Automatic Encoder setup window.,
Click on the ""Queue"" tab and all the jobs should be listed there.,
Kick back and relax.",How to Properly Encode H.264 Video Using Megui for an Xbox Running Xbmc," Use RipIt4Me+DVD Decrypter for ripping DVD's, MeGUI as a GUI for x264 encoding, and AviSynth v2.5.7 for video frameserving.
, MeGUI should prompt you with updates on first launch. If not, go to Options -> Update and update all the software packages.,

NOTE: If your source is not DVD (scene Blu-Ray/HDDVD rips), then skip on down to step #7.

, This step is required only for MPEG-2 files, so skip to step #7 if your source isn't a DVD. So from the ""Tools"" menu, select ""D2V Creator"". In the ""Video Input"" section, load the first VOB file of the movie title set (the rest of the files in the set will be loaded automatically). You might get an error message about not being able to find ""DVD Decrypter Generated Info Files"" -- this is fine. Press ""OK"" to skip this error., Alternatively, you can just select the demux all the tracks and then choose the correct audio track(s) later on.

The default save directory is the same directory as your loaded DVD VOB files - change this if you want to. Select both the ""On Completion Load Files"", ""And Close"" checkboxes and press the ""Queue"" button. You are now returned to MeGUI - click on the ""Queue"" tab and press the ""Start"" button to start the D2V creation. When processing has finished, the status of the queued job will read ""Done"" and the created D2V file will be loaded into the AviSynth Script Creator ready for the next step. This can take a while, so please be patient - the status window's progress bar may not move, but don't worry, DGIndex is working.

, If you followed the last step, the AviSynth Script Creator tool should already be started with the D2V file created loaded. Otherwise, you'll need to load the media file you want to convert into the ""Video Input"" section. The ""Input DAR"" is the aspect ratio of the input video. In most circumstances, it should be automatically set for you. Anamorphic DVDs will be set to ""ITU 16:9"", for example. Press the ""Auto Crop"" button to remove the black bars from the input video if it has any (most widescreen DVDs will).,

If your source is DVD, you can get away with using the maximum standard definition resolution (720x***) if no horizontal bars have been cropped.
If horizontal bars have been cropped, then you need to go to the next number that is divisible by 16, which is (704x***).
Alternatively, you probably can still maintain really good quality with horizontal values of 720/704/688/672/656/640. If your source is an HD rip, then you can use larger horizontal values such as 832/816/800/784/768/752/736/720. Refer to the chart in step #13 for appropriate corresponding vertical values.

,

For films on DVDs, you usually do not need to run a deinterlacing analysis.
If the content you have is TV based, then you might need to click on the ""Analysis"" button to see if the video requires de-interlacing.

, For the Resize Filter, try the default ""Lanczos (Sharp)"". If the source has lots of noise, you can choose to enable the Noise Filter and choose how much noise is present in your source. The other options can be left alone (""Colour Correction"" should be automatically checked for D2V input sources)., After saving, the AviSynth file should be loaded automatically into MeGUI and MeGUI's preview window should pop up. Please make sure the video looks alright, especially for DVD sources with cropping/resize. If the video looks squashed or the aspect is screwed up, then you can click the ""Show DAR"" checkbox and play with aspect ratio in the drop down beside it., MP4 is not the container -- just the file format -- we will set our container later on to be ""MKV"" using the ""AutoEncode"" function.

For the Video Profile, we will configure our own. This is the trick to getting H.264 to play nicely with XBMC. There are two profiles available... one has high quality (but bigger file size) and the other has good quality (at a slightly smaller file size). Technically, the only difference between the two are that one has CABAC on and Deblocking off and the other has CABAC off and Deblocking on. So configure your own video profile to match one of the following:
High Quality, Larger File:

program --pass 2 --bitrate XXXX --stats "".stats"" --keyint 240 --min-keyint 24 --ref 8 --mixed-refs --no-fast-pskip --bframes 6 --b-adapt 2 --b-pyramid --weightb --no-cabac --subme 7 --partitions p8x8,b8x8,i4x4,i8x8 --8x8dct --ratetol 4.0 --qcomp 0.5 --me umh --merange 32 --threads auto --thread-input --progress --no-psnr --no-ssim --output ""output"" ""input""


Good Quality, Smaller File:

program --pass 2 --bitrate XXXX --stats "".stats"" --keyint 240 --min-keyint 24 --ref 8 --mixed-refs --no-fast-pskip --bframes 6 --b-adapt 2 --b-pyramid --weightb --nf --subme 7 --trellis 2 --partitions p8x8,b8x8,i4x4,i8x8 --8x8dct --ratetol 4.0 --qcomp 0.5 --me umh --merange 32 --threads auto --thread-input --progress --no-psnr --no-ssim --output ""output"" ""input""

Match those settings EXACTLY! The box in the video configuration dialog must match this exactly, so get it right! Also, a couple variables can be changed if you want...




For Film (23.97 FPS) : --keyint 240 --min-keyint 24
For PAL (25 FPS) : --keyint 250 --min-keyint 25
For NTSC (29.97 FPS) : --keyint 300 --min-keyint 30

, The bitrate you set in your Video Profile is dependent on your video resolution. This is the best way to get Xbox-compatible video at the highest resolution and bitrate possible. Suggested Bit Rate settings based on Output Resolutions are:

These are MAXIMUM Bitrate values, which means you can set them lower, but that isn't recommended at higher resolutions! I recommend the values highlighted in green and yellow, as they look great and have little problems playing back.
The codec may crap out on HIGHLY COMPLEX scenes (e.g. Scenes with rain, water, snow, smoke, etc... or complex action scenes with hundreds of cuts within a couple minutes) at lower bitrates, and the only way to combat this is to set a custom ""Zone"" from the start frame of to the end frame of the complex scene and set that Zone's Quantizer to a value of 20. This can be done in MeGUI's video configuration dialog. Play around with different settings and see which works the best for you...

, If you've followed this guide for DVD conversion, then the demixed audio track we selected in the D2V Creator should already be loaded in the ""Audio"" section of MeGUI (if not, load in the .AC3 file that was created). If you are not converting from a DVD source, then you can either load in a separate audio file or a video file containing your audio track. Also, MeGUI allows you to import multiple audio tracks, but we do not want this, so make sure you only have one audio track loaded in. You will know you have more than one track if you have tabs that say ""Track 1"", ""Track 2"", and so on., Use either AC3, OGG, or MP3. I prefer AC3 audio, because it is virtually lossless, you can keep the original 6 channels, and it takes little CPU power to decode. And OGG and MP3 should be fine to use as long as you stick with 2 channels (and not 6). Note that OGG has better compression and uses roughly the same amount of CPU as MP3 to decode, so it is technically superior. For AC3, in the ""Encoder Settings"" box under the Audio section, select one of the ""Aften AC-3"" profiles. If you click the ""Config"" button next to it you can set a custom bitrate. 640 KBPS is the best quality, 448 is decent, and 192 is very low quality., This is pretty straight forward - just specify the Size And Bitrate to be ""No Target Size (Use Profile Settings)"" and make sure the Container is set correctly, to ""MKV"". The output location can be changed as well - this file will be the final output file that you want, so make sure you remember where you put it and don't accidentally delete it when cleaning up (I like to put this file in a different folder to all the other files, just in case). Press the ""Queue"" button and all the necessary jobs will be added to the encoding queue., When you are ready to start encoding, press the ""Start"" to start the encoding. You can view the status of your workers by selecting the ""Workers Summary"" option from the ""Workers"" menu., It will encode audio, then two pass encode video, and then mix them together for a nice and pretty XBMC-compatible H.264 MKV video file. You can delete all the other files, unless you plan on making more encodings from them."

Have an idea of what role the character has.,
Now you know whether this character is a main character or not, you can decide the gender.,
Once you know what gender your character is and what role he/she plays, piece together a personality type (this does not include intellect).,
Now you have a personality to work on, you should now see what strengths and weaknesses the character has.,
Find relationships for the character; What relationships does the character have to other characters in the game?,
If the character is a main character or someone who will help you, what style does the character play like?,
once you know all of these, create more characters.",How to Design Your Own Game Character," This is the basis of all character building and I will explain why later. For now, think whether the character is the main character and what significance it will have in the game.;
, The gender is crucial to the character as it will unlock a whole half side to the personalities that are considered normal and personalities that are not for that gender E.G Fighting is considered a men's sport, Fingernail painting is considered a female activity. Because this is a game you will want to see what significance gender has on the game world, for example, in a medieval setting females are not as highly respected as men. So this character will have difficulties in that setting.

, Ask yourself the following questions: As a main character/Sidekick/Friend does he/she personality help fulfill their role? Is he/she aggressive or kind or both? Is he/she hardworking? Is he/she very social or not social? Is he/she very perceiving in personality? Choose whether each trait is environmental or not

, Is he/she strong? Is he/she intelligent? Is he/she social? The more weaknesses the more interesting it will be too, because it will add more suspense as the character will be in more trouble more often due to clumsiness or low intelligence.


What is the characters background? How involved is the character to the game world? Decide whether the background suits the personality or is a result of the personality. This may not want to be revealed all at once to the player to create more dynamic suspense.
Give each character something unique. Something that people know them for. Whether the character is a boy or a girl, they should have their own unique thing. Could it be the clothes they wear? The condition they have? Something in their appearance? It could be anything really...

, What don't the others like about him/her? What do they like?

, E.G If its in a shooting game, does he run in and shoot everyone like a madman? or keep calm.

, Keep in mind your other characters may be a result of this characters traits.

Know what type of game you would like to create.,
Learn about the basic resources you'll be using.,
Learn the components of the Graphical User Interface (GUI).,
Learn the basics about objects and events.,
Learn about rooms and their construction.,
Learn about implementing sounds and music in your game.",How to Get Started With Game Maker1," If you're interested in making an isometric shooter, for example, the tutorials and examples you'll read will be vastly different than your average puzzle-based tutorial.


Any community forum, whether in the Steam community or the YoYo Games community, will help you come up with ideas for games and ways to further improve your game-making career.;
, Every component of your game is a resource; resources include everything from sounds and character images to collision effects and a compilation of all of your code. You can view a lump sum of your resources at any time from the Resource Tree in the left side of your screen. The GameMaker resources are as follows:Sprites, which are images used to animate objects.
Sounds, which make up the sound effects and musical score of the game.
Backgrounds, which are images used to define rooms.
Paths, which are scripted movement patterns for objects in the game.
Scripts, which are pieces of code that you name and call into action during certain instances (for example, an object-to-object collision).
Shaders, which are used to create graphical effects (e.g., shadows).
Fonts, which dictate the appearance of text.
Time lines, which dictate the point at which specific instances occur in the game (e.g., a door opening or an enemy appearing).
Objects, which are essentially anything appearing on-screen (excluding the background).
Rooms, which hold objects.
Included files, which are files from your computer that the game will use in the final cut.
Extensions, which are additions to the game outside of the traditional GameMaker resource pool.
Constants, which include all of the constant variables defined by you for your game.
When naming resources, be sure to preface them differently by category; for example, you might preface your sounds with ""sfx"", your sprites with ""spr"", and so on. Using the same prefix for different categories can improperly associate a resource with a category, which will lead to an error.

, The GUI is the set of tools and options that help you create and fine-tune your game. To view the GUI, click the ""New"" tab at the top of the GameMaker startup menu.


The main menus are in the top right corner of the GameMaker GUI. These include File, Edit, Resources, Scripts, Run, Window, and Help. Each of these options has its own drop-down menu complete with options specific to their function, so be sure to click on each of these to learn more about their contents.
The main toolbar is beneath the main menus; it contains buttons to add objects, sprites, and any other GameMaker resources you'll need. You can also export your project, save your project, and open an old project from here.
Your workspace is the top window on the right side of your screen. This is where you create and edit resources.
The code compiling area is beneath your workspace; this is where the code related to your game assembles and compiles.
The resource tree is in the left side of your GUI; it displays every resource you have assigned to your game in a list form, complete with search bar below.

, Objects comprise most of the on-screen data in any given room. For an object to be functional in your game, it must be defined with an event; for example, an event triggered by pressing a button on the keyboard might cause an object to move a certain direction. When you choose to create an object from the resources menu, it will take you to the ""Object Properties"" menu.


You can define your objects by adding an event in Object Properties, then adding a result in the ""Actions"" window.
Sprites are images--often several sequential ones, in practice--used to animate objects. Every object you create will have at least one sprite assigned to it. GameMaker comes equipped with many sprite templates, and YoYo Games has even more available for download; you can also create your own.
""Collision events"" are typical events which are used to dictate what happens when an object touches another object. This could be a character bumping into a wall, an enemy touching the character, or something similar.

, Just as each house is separated by individual rooms, your game will have different screens representing different points in the game--also known as ""rooms"". Rooms hold a set of objects, scripts, pathways, shaders, timelines, and a background to define them as separate instances.


Every room will have its own background to set it aside as a specific room. You create a background by clicking the ""Resources"" tab and selecting ""Create Background"", then uploading an image or selecting one from GameMaker's library.
Rooms can comprise levels, loading screens, informative screens, or options-related screens--even the home screen menu of a game is technically a room.
GameMaker: Studio will not run your game without room components.
To create boundaries in your room, define an object as a wall and place it throughout the room. You can keep the same object for subsequent rooms if you choose., GameMaker: Studio contains a small native audio-customizing suite from which you can choose compression options, file types, and so on. GameMaker only supports .WAV and .MP3 filetypes, so make sure that your selected sounds are in the pertinent file formats before attempting to upload them to GameMaker.


To bring up the Sound menu, hold down ⇧ Shift and Control, then tap U. You can also click ""Create Sound"" in the drop-down resources bar.GameMaker can only implement one .MP3 track at a time, whereas it can use several .WAV files simultaneously. This makes .WAV files better for sound effects and .MP3s better for a soundtrack.
You can change the default volume of the track, the quality of the track, and the name of the sound from within the Sound menu.
Sounds are often used as actions in response to events.

Sora is the wielder of the Keyblade,goes on a journey, going to other worlds finding and doing what he needs to do.

Adding another car to make it two player you hover over the sprite and click duplicate, this will then copy the racing car and make another one exactly like it.,
When wanting to change the layout of the background, you click on the 'Stage' button, this will then allow you to create your own racing game background.

,
When you have created the background for your car racing game you can move the cars around and place them wherever you like.

,
To get your cars to move, you have to set them so they can move individually and go in different directions, you do this by making a script for them.,
When creating the script for both racing cars, you should have added the 'Forever if' Variable, you should have also added the 'Colour _ is touching _ ?',
The script for the duplicated car will be slightly different compared to the first racing car.,
To test your racing game, click on the 'Switch to presentation mode'.",How to Create Your Own Car Racing Game in Scratch,";
, The cat has been used as an example of a sprite.

, You can create the sprite by drawing it free hand, or uploading one. To create one you click on the 'Paint new sprite' button.

, When finished creating this sprite you need to add a small dot in front of the car, this will later be explained.

, When this has been done the new sprite that you have created will be on the Scratch page. This will be the sprite used for your racing car racing game sprite.

, You may change the colour of the second sprite, you can do this by editing it. The edit button is under the heading 'Costumes' this will only appear when you have clicked on the sprite(s) you would like to edit. You should also add a small coloured dot in front of the duplicated racing car. The colour dot should not be a colour that is already used in the game.

,,, This is done by clicking on one of the sprites. This is the script for the pink racing car.

, This is so when the cars are driving around, they can not go off the track, so for example if you have put a small pink dot in front of the racing car and the barriers are grey, you should put 'Colour pink is touching grey?' you change this by clicking on the boxes provided in the variable and touch where ever the colours are.

, The controls will be slightly different due to it being a 2 player game. The keys that you press to move the car are letters on the keypad. These letters are your choice and which ever ones you would find relevant and easy to use. For example the key A and the key D. The letter D can be used to go clockwise (right) and the letter A can be used to go anti-clockwise (left).

, This button is located at the top right of the Scratch screen. To start the game you click on the green flag, this is also at the top right of the screen.

Look before you jump.,
Keep it possible.,
Use strategic energy placement.,
Don't be arbitrary.",How to Design a Successful Platforming Game," In real life, you wouldn't want to jump off a cliff without checking for a safe place to land. Similarly, your game shouldn't require the player to jump to a platform that can't be seen onscreen. That doesn't mean you can't surprise the player; just avoid ""leaps of faith."";
, At no point should it be impossible to complete a level. If you want the player to fall into a ""trap,"" make it possible to continue the level (without perishing!). That means no inescapable obstacles or enemies that can't be defeated.

, Put enemies in places that fit the level design and add to the challenge in a specific way. It might seem tempting to put a bunch of enemies in one place, but don't - it's been done way too many times already. Instead, use enemies in clever ways, or to create a puzzle for the player to solve.

, Don't put coins or bonus items in places that can't be reached or that lead the player to an inevitable death. The player should be able to theoretically collect every power-up in the level, even if it is difficult to do so. So don't put doors, coins or power-ups in arbitrary places - it will only make the player frustrated.

Know what you intend to do.You may have ever wanted to make a game, or at least know how.,
Have a design.,
Come up with a way to record your character.",How to Create a Text Based World With Batch Script1," Text based worlds, large games with all words and ASCII art for pictures were the first games ever, then came the harder to make mmorpgs. These games are single player, programmed in batch script.,

Think, what type of text based world is this going to be? A fantasy one, a sci-fi one, a horror one, a simulation one, another type? This tutorial is focused on a fantasy type, but its easy just to change it around a little.
Think really hard about things like how many monsters, skills, races, classes, professions, items, areas, shops, npcs and other things like that. A single monster can take up to a day to make with a 10 skill game, an incredibly fast typist and a good programmer, then that doesn't count the debugging and everything.
Also, make sure that you have the ASCII art or an ASCII artist, the right music for it, a flute and the knowledge to play it, or a medieval band in your backyard, and also, make sure that people will like your games.
Another major thing that you have to remember is that this is a text based world, so you should make it so that they can move north, south, east and west, and can pick things up, fight with them, sell them, buy things, gain new abilities, advance and things like that. This is just like the Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) games of the 1990’s.

, A lot of people would be confused with how to record their character. You need a character sheet for it. Make sure that it has EVERYTHING. A whole journal is good (or write your character sheet in pencil so that it can be erased)."
"
Have a gallery for the things.,
Also, make sure the artist has access to the programming.,Make sure that there is not a screen without art.",How to Create a Text Based World With Batch Script2,"

You don't even need art, but if you want an audience you do.
Let's say the thing the person is looking at is the description of a sword, make a sword, or a troll ,put a troll. but if it a poisoned troll, put a troll with maybe X's on its eyes or something, or if its burnt, put a few spots of black;
, You can't make them and then upload them. You have to put them directly after the echo commands.,"
